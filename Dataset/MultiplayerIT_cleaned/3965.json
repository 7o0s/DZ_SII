{"name": "The Quiet Man", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-quiet-man-recensione.html", "text": "Reviewing The Quiet Man is not complicated, but we confess that trying it we asked ourselves many questions. For example, it is legitimate to ask what motivated a publisher like Square Enix, which will certainly evaluate hundreds of pitches every year, to produce and publish it. Describing it is extremely easy: it is a long three-hour film, which mixes sequences filmed from real life with others made with the game engine, interspersed with dull fighting game sections a la Final Fight. Consider that there are no choices to make to move the story forward, so you look, you look, you hit every now and then, and then you look again. Its peculiarity is to have a protagonist deaf and combed by Pokmon, such Dane, of which we take control and hearing, so to speak. Basically for the entire game you hear the sounds as he hears them, so you hear practically nothing. By no means we also mean that Dane is not able to hear the voices of the other characters and when he talks he is limited to reading their lips. If the player is to understand what he is being told, he must learn to do the same. It is a radical choice, even interesting, which however lacks an approximate implementation which creates various problems for the narration, as well as merely logical ones. For example, we accept that we can't hear what other characters are saying, but why don't we even understand what Dane thinks and says? Why are we cut off from the conversation when lip-reading and talking to others? Couldn't subtitles have been put into these situations, making us understand what he proves to understand perfectly? Furthermore, if the goal was to basically make us assume his point of view, why doesn't the direction follow this choice in any way and is instead based on the use of a dull and stereotyped language, made up above all of objective shots? Again, why don't we hear the sounds of scenes where Dane isn't in? Why do characters who know about Dane's condition talk to him normally, often even turning their backs on him? These are no small issues, because the entire gameplay is based on this gimmick, which in fact is wasted badly and remains purely epidermal, i.e. a simple mute to the whole game without making us understand what it can really mean not to hear. Moreover, the fact that it is a poorly developed 'mechanics' can also be understood from the fact that the theme of deafness never really enters the narrative, remaining in the background. So the idea itself would be intriguing, but it's implemented so poorly that it's annoying. After all, what is annoying is also the whole story told, which is not only highly predictable, but also full of absurdities. Dane works as a hit man for a local boss, his childhood friend, and is in love with his woman. Have you figured out the ending yet? Well done, but you are missing a meaningless twist and a particular sequence that reminded us of the ending of Quantic Dream's Fahrenheit out of absurdity. Put in a vaguely racist subtext, mix it all up and disaster is served. Audio note In the original version of The Quiet Man the audio was practically turned off, then a patch added some sounds because some very shrewd buyers believed it was a bug and started complaining on the game's forums. Note that the complete lack of sounds was in the product description, so it would have been enough to read what you were buying to avoid embarrassment. Game mechanics Unfortunately, as we said, The Quiet Man is not only a film, but also has sequences in which they fight. The initial ~unfortunately~ is due to the fact that they are really badly made and, in some situations, they seem incomplete. Dane can punch, kick, grab enemies and use a power that allows him to focus attacks, mixing everything to create more or less effective combos. He can also dodge opponents' blows, a useful move especially if you choose the higher difficulty level (of two). At first glance, the system does not seem to work badly and the fights are almost pleasant in their extreme physicality and brutality. The further you go in the game, however, the more you realize that everything is extremely repetitive and poorly finished, between a very small number of enemies, polygonal interpenetrations everywhere and missing animations, the short fighting scenes soon become a nuisance, moreover often narratively incoherent and stuck to the game to lengthen the broth. In particular, the bosses lack animations, especially the final ones, making it difficult to understand why some shots do not hit while others do. Probably the developers have exhaustedI cut the budget and cut some things, but so the result is terribly sloppy and ends up penalizing precisely those moments that should theoretically be more intense and those fights in which it is necessary to study the opponent at least to know when to attack. Only the scenarios are saved which, being few and small in size, are rich in detail and very well cared for. In any case, it is not some graphic detail that can lead to recommend The Quiet Man, which turns out to be an overall disaster with no possibility of appeal.", "date": "2018-11-06", "grade": "3.0"}
