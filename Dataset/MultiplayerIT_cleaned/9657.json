{"name": "Botte da mostri", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82326-beast-boxing-3d-botte-da-mostri.html", "text": "The invasion of evil creatures that infest all modern video game entertainment devices, far from wanting to end, really risks overwhelming every type of video game currently available. On the other hand, it should be remembered, this ~obscure~ contamination has not spared even other types of media, suffice it to mention the sensational literary case of ~Pride, Prejudice and Zombies~, a revised and corrected version of Jane Austen's masterpiece which climbed, not without surprises, the Amazon charts. However, when you find yourself in front of a boxing simulator, such as Beast Boxing 3D promises to be, the putrescent world of monsters that contextualizes the title literally gets into a fight (it is appropriate to say it) with the very idea of the ~noble art~, since it is usually considered neither noble nor artistic to beat up a hideous creature. However, the only effect that can be considered physiological in facing a monster and knocking it down is, of course, the fun that comes from inflicting pain on it. First Person Boxer The complexity of the rules that regulate the world of boxing, as well as the high number of movements, blows, dodges and guards is, in practice, difficult to reproduce on a purely simulative level in a video game. The inevitable exception to this axiom can perhaps be considered the Fight Night Round series by EA Sports, a unique or almost unique example in the playful video panorama which, however, precisely because of the numerous technicalities, needs a certain level of constant application to be mastered . For these reasons, the most successful boxing simulations are generally also those that least take into account physics and rules, focusing more on healthy arcade fun: Punch Out on Nintendo Wii for example, despite an approach certainly not suitable for everyone, perfectly embodies this type of game, given that to win it will be necessary to have a lot of memory and synchrony more than knowing the basic rules of boxing. Unlike Punch Out, however, in which the protagonist is always framed from behind his back, in Beast Boxing 3D the boxer is represented in first person, so the only visible parts of the fighter are the arms and gloves. The reasons that push the young protagonist to participate in the World Boxing Championship for monsters, which is held every year in the world of Beasthalla, are unfortunately not known (if we exclude the healthy spirit of competition, of course); what is known, however, is that human beings are not allowed in any case in this kind of competition. The only way to access the tournament is therefore to dress up, appearing at first sight as one of the ~normal~ terrifying participants. Thus disguised, the young boxer can finally begin his competition, against a (unfortunately) not very large sample of enemies. Of increasing difficulty, the opponents encountered will range from the classic types of zoomorphic creatures (pigs, reptiles, fish) to those instead typical of horror iconography, such as skeletons or swamp monsters; it is particularly amusing to face a large strong chicken, more similar to the legendary archenemy of Peter Griffin in Family Guy (however the yellow plumage is missing, being the one in the object blue) than to the typical Campese 10+, produced by a well-known Italian brand and very good from eat. The semi-serious context, inevitably the cause of many smiles during matches, shouldn't however distract from the reason that pushed the young fighter to fight, that is to win the tournament. To properly face a match, the commands have been reduced to the bone: swiping your finger from the bottom to the top on the screen gives you an uppercut punch (right or left, depending on which thumb you give input with) while swiping the two hooks are thrown horizontally from the right or left; once hit, these shots will cause greater damage as well as a few seconds of uncovering for the opponent, during which you can hit by ticking the display with the classic quick frontal punches or jabs. Movements along the ring are delegated to the inclination of the terminal by means of an accelerometer, while the watch rises by keeping both thumbs pressed on the screen; with the high guard, however, the lateral movements inevitably become slower. At the top left, the status indicators indicate the level of health, tiredness and any bonuses or ~help~ (someone could call it doping...) that will come to the rescue of the boxer in particularly desperate conditions. These upgrades, together with the boosts for attack, defense, speed and guard, can be purchased in the gym with the money deriving from victories and allow when activated (oneat a time) the instant recovery of exhaustion and health, the slowing down of time, or a short period of invulnerability. After a particular series of successful hits, the gloves will really catch fire and you will enter a sort of ~fury~ mode in which the tiredness, driven by the competitive ardor, will not decrease until you take a hit. As previously mentioned, the enemies, although well characterized, are only 9 that can be faced in 3 difficulty levels; however, it is possible to fight again against defeated opponents, also to improve the score and accumulate money to invest in upgrading one's character. Technically, in Beast Boxing 3D the general cleaning and the work done on the models of the fighters leave a good impression, as well as the animations of the hits; however, the backgrounds are barely sketched but this limitation appears to be the right price to pay to avoid drops in framerate, absent on the test iPhone 4 (after the 1.1 update, however, things should have improved also for the previous Apple terminals). Finally, the audio is limited to a few effects while the presence of 20 Game Center objectives is noted. Price: 2.39 The tested version is 1.1 App Store links", "date": "2010-11-15", "grade": "7.9"}
