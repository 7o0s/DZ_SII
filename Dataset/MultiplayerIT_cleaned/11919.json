And so also for this Turbo Jet Ski 3d the referent is extremely marked Wave Race by Nintendo, especially the first beautiful episode for Nintendo 64. The theme is in fact racing with water scooters or jet skis, call them as you prefer; the substance remains the same, that is challenges to the last wave in an attempt to cross the finish line first. There are 6 characters to choose from, two of which are available from the start and the others to be unlocked as you progress. The game structure is very similar to that seen in other racing titles from Gameloft; therefore, the main mode, the career, will take you around the world in 7 settings such as Rio de Janeiro, Miami, Venice, Alaska, Shanghai, Lake Powell and Halong Bay. In each of these, a couple of classic races will be faced against 3 other challengers, a points competition based on evolutions, one focused on rescuing bathers in difficulty and finally a special event. In Rio the latter is a competition against a dolphin... does it remind you of something? ~Inspirations~ aside therefore, Turbo Jet Ski 3d can count on a fair variety, and by continuing in the game it is possible to unlock new costumes and earn money to buy more performing water scooters. Unfortunately, however, it is the fundamental component, that is entertainment, which seems to be missing in the transalpine production. The three-dimensional graphics, while pleasant and equipped with a good frame rate, remain simplistic and afflicted by evident pop-up phenomena of the seabed. But the still insufficient potential of current mobile phones is resolved above all in the reproduction of wave motion and the behavior of the vehicles on the water, which is all too simplistic. The few waves you encounter during the races thus become more of a setback than anything else, throwing your character into the air and thus wasting precious time. Collisions with other competitors are resolved only in a rebound and the evolutions with which to accumulate turbo are really a handful and not very satisfying. Not even the track design raises the fate of the game, instead proving to be uninspired and flat. Playing Turbo Jet Ski 3d therefore does not convey particular emotions, and the absolute lack of innovative or original ideas also eliminates the taste for discovery. On the other hand, the musical accompaniment is appreciable, with cheerful and themed songs, while the effects are practically completely absent. PRO Graphically sufficient Good variety of races AGAINST Boring Not original at all Wave motion too simplified", "date": "2007-10-18", "grade": "S.V."}
