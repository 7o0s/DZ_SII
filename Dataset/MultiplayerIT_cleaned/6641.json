We've played quite a few on Wii U, moreover: the first that come to mind are the beautiful SteamWorld Dig and Armillo, two unmissable products which this Teslagrad from the Norwegian Rain Games joins today. The characteristics of Teslagrad are typical of a low budget game that lasts a few hours: a rather low price, an exquisite technical sector that does not leave you speechless, a generally intense experience that is worth every penny. It's an idea, perhaps not too original, that this young developer has implemented in a big way. Norwegian Teslagrad is not a revolutionary game, but it does its job very well Positive negative Only the incipit of Teslagrad is memorable in its simplicity: rather than displaying the usual tutorial, the guys from Rain Games limited themselves to throwing the player into the action without providing a shred of explanation since, moreover, it is assumed that there it moves with the d-pad and that is jumped by pressing a key. If anything, the introduction already suggests the philosophy behind the narrative in the Norwegian game, in which the total absence of explanations, dialogues or texts leaves room for a story in pictures. A man returns home with a baby in swaddling clothes and a progressive variation of the color palette makes us understand that some time has passed since that fateful night. One fine day, however, a handful of brutes enter the house and our protagonist, a child, manages to escape from the back, immediately putting us in his shoes: in fact we will have to run at breakneck speed, jumping from one roof to another, while a game of parallaxes and stratified backdrops shows us the city of Teslagrad, a vaguely steampunk setting on which an immense tower rises. Our escape will take us into a castle, in which we will remain trapped and from which we will have to escape to return home. In short, the story is told in images and depends a lot on the player's imagination, making some passages of the game a little obscure but helping to fuel a discreet feeling of mystery, especially once you begin to encounter the most imposing and threatening creatures of the game. The castle, on the other hand, is a kind of citation of the classic ~metroidvania~ and post-Symphony of the Night Castlevania, since Teslagrad actually follows the same structure. It is basically a platformer in which most of the challenges are puzzles based on the use of the brain and reflexes, which can be solved using some gadgets and powers that our young alter ego will acquire during the adventure. The first, and most important, is a glove that allows you to alter the polarity of some platforms, turning them into real magnets. It is nothing particularly new, mind you, but the developer has devised quite original puzzles that require reasoned use of the gadget in order to move the platforms directly or indirectly to eliminate enemies or form real passages. Negative positive Among the other powers and gadgets of our protagonist there is also a kind of force field that can wrap him, making him repel from any devices or platforms of opposite polarity. Then teleportation takes over, a power of limited effectiveness and, at the same time, terribly useful. It allows us to instantly move forward a few meters, but it cannot be performed several times consecutively and it cannot be understood as a kind of ~boost~ to speed: it mainly serves to dodge enemies and to cross some obstacles, allowing us to reach previously inaccessible areas. Being a good ~metroidvania~, in fact, Telsagrad requires a good amount of backtracking, allowing us to revisit some areas where puzzles that seemed unsolvable or paths that seemed unreachable suddenly become within our reach. The combination of the various powers and gadgets, therefore, has allowed Rain Games to implement increasingly ingenious and complex puzzles, especially in the case of the end-of-area bosses that require the use of newly learned and long-acquired powers. In some cases we will have to use them all, absolutely all, which makes the understanding of some clashes particularly difficult: this is one of the main problems of Teslagrad, a game in which the infamous rule of ~one hit, one dead~ applies. One mistake is enough to send the protagonist to the other world, and if it is true that during the exploration the checkpoint system does not particularly weigh this mmechanism, on the other hand the boss battles, based mainly on ~trial and error~, can be quite frustrating. Having come to terms with this feature of the Norwegian title, however, one cannot fail to be fascinated by everything else, from the minimalist soundtrack to the splendid animations that bring the characters and settings to life.", "date": "2015-01-07", "grade": "8.0"}
