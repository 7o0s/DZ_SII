Flint Lockwood is the classic misunderstood genius: endowed with an intelligence above normal, however he fails to establish himself and in the daily life of Swallow Falls - the island where the story takes place - he always remains in the background, until he is presents the paradigmatic occasion. The native island is encountering various problems due to the crisis in the sardine trade, which has always represented the pillar of the local economy, and to improve its image and solve the economic problems Flint develops an incredible tool, called with the hallucinating acronym F.L.D.S.M.D.F.R., or Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator. It is a device that essentially transforms water into food, but the philanthropic discovery soon turns into a cataclysm, when the machinery is accidentally sent into the stratosphere, starting to absorb airborne humidity in gigantic portions of steaks, hamburgers, meatballs, ice cream and whatnot that obviously cascades in abundance to the surface of Swallow Falls. It might seem like an almost positive thing at first glance, but in reality it implies a series of huge problems for the town, which obviously will have to be solved by the main person responsible for the situation, or Flint. Helped by the trusty monkey Steve (capable of communicating through another of the scientist's gadgets), our hero will have to try to clean up the mess generated by the invasion of food as well as discover who is behind what appears to be a mysterious sabotage of his project. If the film is presented as a children's production suitable for the whole family, the game seems to be more focused on young audiences, although the simple and clean structure can still attract even the older ones, possibly for play sessions together with the aforementioned very young ones. A cleaning mission The story is told in a rather confusing way: in fact, if you haven't already seen the film (or at least you haven't read up on this) it's not easy to understand exactly the succession of events and the role of the various characters, also due to the marginality with which the dialogues are inserted into the game. It is a question of completing a series of missions rather detached from each other (freely selectable within certain chronological sequences), in which we find ourselves broadly completing the same objectives, essentially indicated by the need to reach a point on the map and clean up the area with intrusive food. To do this, Flint's fervent mind has devised various types of weapon to be used in a manner appropriate to the context, such as the huge fork to destroy giant ravioli or climb spaghetti waterfalls, a sort of hair dryer that allows you to melt ice cream , a big iron fist to destroy sausages or move hamburgers and a sort of vacuum cleaner capable of sucking in and spitting out liquids of various kinds, suitable for dissolving sugar ~lumbs~ with hot coffee or sprinkling honey on vertical surfaces to make them easily ~climbable~. In addition to the frenzied action, therefore, there is room for a certain reasoning regarding the approach to the enemies and obstacles present, as it is necessary to analyze their ~composition~ before choosing the most suitable tool to use. The various levels are never too difficult to complete, which makes the game particularly enjoyable even by the younger audience. Similarly, the possibility of playing in two at the same time with the second player able to enter and exit the game at any time (playing the little monkey Steve) at the simple press of a button on the second controller, represents an ideal solution for parents who they want to take part in the game on a non-continuous basis, perhaps helping the main player for a short, particularly difficult piece, and then leaving him free to continue on his own. Gastronomic environment The script behind the game obviously lends itself to staging rather original levels, as it is a question of hunting down huge portions of food of various kinds and invoices. In fact, each level is characterized by a dominant setting: there is that of the port invaded by typically Italian products, the mountain one grappling with rather aggressive and invasive jellies or the urban one in which ice cream has a prI have the upper hand. Viewed from above with the protagonist clearly visible in the center of the screen, the game has a look that recalls the classic tradition of action games but also, all in all, a good look. Obviously there's no crying out for a miracle but the quality of the scenarios, the colors and the general fluidity make this Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs a worthy video game application of the excellent work done in the cinema by the animation studio. Also noteworthy is a certain care in the creation of the surrounding elements, such as the short cutscenes that introduce the various sections of the game. In this case, quick skits are displayed with a graphic that recalls the typical aspect of 80's video games, a style reiterated also with regard to the options screens with a decidedly pleasant choice, although this fails to compensate for the carelessness with which the plot is dealt with in the course of the game, which creates a certain bewilderment in the player who tries to keep up with the succession of events. The sound accompaniment for its part is not reported for particular solutions: the tested version is entirely in English with a good amount of spoken dialogues which in the edition for our market should be localized in Italian. Comment Simple and fun Ability to play multiplayer ~on the fly~ Not bad graphics Repetitive after a short time Confused storytelling Suitable almost exclusively for the very young", "date": "2010-01-07", "grade": null}
