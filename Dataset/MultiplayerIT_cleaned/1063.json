{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-zelda-four-swords-adventures.html", "text": "Zelda's Four The beginning dates back to about two years ago, when Nintendo, not paying for having made billions on GBA simply by recycling the old Mario adventures, decided to assign the same fate to the other historic brand, Zelda, with the conversion of the legendary A Link to the Past; however, while for the Mario Advances the ~bonus~ was a graphically updated version of the very old Mario Bros., for ALttP (whose conversion was entrusted to Capcom as usual) things were done on a grand scale and to encourage purchases even those who had already finished and consumed the SNES version was included in the same cartridge a completely unpublished Zelda. Furthermore, this new adventure by Link had a very special feature: it could only be played in multiplayer! For the first time in the history of the saga, in Four Swords (this is the title of the game) two to four players could venture into dungeons characterized by the typical ~Zeldian~ design, collaborating with each other to overcome puzzles and obstacles but at the same time competing fiercely for the conquest of the final medallion of each level. And there were some good ones to be seen... Four Swords Adventures takes up and expands on the concepts of the Nintendo/Capcom duo, starting from the narrative premises: a new character was born in FS, the very bad Vaati, to whom a single Link was no longer enough to defeat ; Vaati returns in the GameCube edition, he is still the cause of everything, but this time he resorts to a not exactly original trick, kidnapping the seven Virgins (and among them Zelda) capable of hunting and sealing in another dimension a particularly dangerous enemy for peace in Hyrule. The same thing we had seen in A Link to the Past, but in fact from now on the plot will simply be overlooked by anyone who takes control of one of the four Links. The Four Force Let's try to unravel the skein: Four Swords Adventures is, basically, a canonical ~Zelda-like~ adventure with 2D bird's eye graphics; unless you decide to play it alone losing much of the fun, it absolutely needs as many GBA (and relative connection cables to the Cube) as there are players, and the reason is soon explained. While images of the overworld will scroll on the television, and we are talking about both the grasslands of Hyrule and the open spaces and the main areas of each dungeon, it will switch to the small screen of the laptop when a player enters a cave, dungeon or home. Dialogue with NPCs will also appear on the screen if they are not part of a cut scene, as well as information about each character. FSA [...] absolutely needs as many GBAs (and relative connection cables to the Cube) as there are players The most glaring advantage of this configuration is that the action can flow uninterrupted for any player who decides to stay in the overworld to do his thing (which are then the classic actions of Link, mallet enemies, mow the lawns, lift and throw things, digging...) even when another adventurer stops to talk to someone or goes to explore a cave or a dungeon: after a few minutes, the transition from big to small screen becomes absolutely natural for the player, and so the action can flow uninterrupted and smooth. The other feature of this configuration, less clear at first glance but vital for the proper functioning of the whole ambaradn, is that in the secret of one's screen one can do a lot of things without letting one's companions/rivals know them... Yeah, why suppose that maybe while the other three Links are busy in the overworld facing a cascade of enemies you discover, by chance or skill (in which case you'd be even more bastards inside), a hidden entrance that houses a Gem of the big ones, let's make 100... At that point you'd sneak in and no one would notice, or someone would eat the leaf but it would be too late, and you'd come out looking good with an extra hundred in your wallet. Have you begun to guess the greatness of Four Swords? Don't worry, there's still more... The Four Force The only limitation imposed on this scheme is that to overcome certain areas it is necessary to be four, both because certain puzzles must be solved together, and because, since the overworld is divided into areas exactly as in ALttP, you will not be able to access a area if someone falls behind: how do we visualize it, then? So far we are talking about overworld, but there is an important clarification to make: the game, just like its predecessor, is divided into worlds, which in turn are divided into levels. Therefore, there are no large spaces like Hyrule Fields to connect the various areas and Hyrule is no longer a single huge map in which to move freely.ordeal, by overworld we therefore simply mean the open spaces within each level. The levels must also necessarily be tackled in succession to get to the clash with Vaati, but once unlocked they can be replayed as desired. Your obsession, however, what you will begin to dream of day and night, are the Force Gems The Four Force We complete the analysis of the fundamental components of the title by talking about various objects and power ups: there are some great Zelda classics, such as hearts (obviously), the bow, the boomerang, the slingshot, the bombs, the lantern, the boots of Pegasus, the Feather of Roc... Almost all of them can be upgraded exactly as we are used to, and that is by finding certain Fairies, but with a couple of fundamental differences: each player cannot equip more than one secondary weapon, he will have to leave the one he had in previously if you want the new one, and also all the equipment, sword and shield aside, will be reset at the end of each level; all of this, like pretty much all of the game's design, is functional to multiplayer. Your obsession, however, what you will begin to dream of day and night, are the Force Gems, a variant of the classic rupees whose collection is one of the main objectives, if not the first, of the adventure: there are different denominations, from single ones to very rare ones of 1000, whose collection by a player will unleash the exaltation of the lucky one and the black hatred of the others. At the end of each level, the count of the Gems will be very important to establish the winner, and if you consider that not only the collection of these is possible, but also the theft from another Link (in the most subtly uncivilized ways possible), you will have a another piece of delirium that can trigger a foursome of FSA. And it certainly didn't end there... Here you don't look at anyone! The world is full of games ~all against all~, where any impropriety is admitted in order to win. First of all, we underline the perfect realization of FSA, the perfect balance between luck, skill and knowledge of the mechanisms of the game by the adventurer when it comes to grabbing the biggest preys: for some Gems it is really luck, pure and simple, for example example when you activate a switch and the big gem falls right in your area, attracting the envy of your competitors. For others it takes skill and dexterity, you could start on par or even with a small disadvantage but recover everything thanks to the skilful use of Link's moves and weapons, while for still others knowing the typical Zelda mechanics helps a lot: a boomerang can also retrieve objects beyond Link's normal reach, an empty space surrounded by grass almost certainly hides a secret... In all cases, grabbing high-value Gems will trigger delirium in the group. The nice thing is that the competitive part of the game system is certainly not the only one, and in hindsight not even the main one: cooperation is necessary in FSA. First of all, cooperation between the players, which can be summed up in the classic saying according to which ~Two heads (or rather three or four) are better than one~, and then ~physical~ cooperation between the characters on the screen. Let's just take a few of the most trivial examples, so as not to spoil the taste of the surprise: you will be faced with the classic ~weight~ switches or levers to pull, or even objects to move, which will require the presence of all four Links ; you will have blocks to move in sequence, each of a particular color, and you can already guess what to do; you'll still have platforms that are weight-sensitive and teetering on a load-bearing plank, which will knock you off if you don't do a certain thing, and two blocks that exactly bound the space that four Links would take up if they were next to each other ... What to do? Well, we don't tell you! Ultimate examples of how perfect the collaborative mechanics are and how brilliant the ideas born from Nintendo designers are the boss fights Here you don't look at anyone! Ok, just one last example of one of the more ingenious mechanics, so you can get a pretty complete picture of the brilliance of the whole: some switches can only be activated with the bow, and only one player, due to the fact that he can only carry one secondary weapon at a time, has the bow. Big problem: the switch is on a screen from which it is not possible to shoot the arrow, what to do? A player goes to the screen where the switch is and displays it on his GBA or on the television, the one with the bow remains where he can shoot it, displaying it in turn on the GBA or on the televisionisor, launches the arrow and the other, noting how much he missed the target, will be able to tell him where to move to hit it. Simply delicious. And let's not forget that the Dark World also exists in FSA, a ~dark~ and slightly different version of the normal world, which can be reached by recovering pearls and bringing them to certain points in the game. A player who goes to the Dark World sees it on the GBA, and it can still somehow affect the others left in the Light World... Maximum examples of how perfect the collaborative mechanics are and how brilliant the ideas born of Nintendo designers are the boss fights: as in all Zeldas, for each boss you have to discover the precise strategy, but this time each strategy implies a role for each warrior. Or only for some, with the others ready to unduly grab the fruit of the work of others; but this too is all intentional, all functional to make FSA's multiplayer one of the most beautiful, perhaps the most beautiful, ever seen. The crux of the matter, what makes Four Swords Adventures the Masterpiece of design and playability that it is, is precisely this dualism between collaboration and competition. But we will have time to reflect on this too. One eye on the past, one on the present, the other on the future In addition to the main Adventure Mode, there are Tingle's Tower minigames (yup, the leprechaun also haunts FSA!) to unlock during the course of the main adventure and which emphasize competition for Force Gems, and a mode independent of the others if not when it comes to unlocking the arenas in which to play: it is the Shadow Battle, a real deathmatch in which the only goal, reachable by all possible means, is to remain the only Link standing on the field. Not as deep as Story Mode, but hilarious nonetheless; ten arenas, moreover, are not few. Tetra's Trackers, a treasure hunt in which our fellow Japanese players were instead able to take part, is missing in the western versions. Not bad, what there is is already enough. The beauty is that the framerate almost never seems to accuse the presence of so much goodness One eye on the past, one on the present, the other on the future Let's move on to the technical-stylistic analysis: the GBA, let's close the discussion immediately, does what it can, and there seems to be no difference, even in used libraries, between FSA on the laptop and A Link to the Past. As for the Cube, some might think that a 2D game on such a powerful console is a waste. Mistake. We won't imply that 2D is entirely functional to such a game scheme, but we will simply state how beautiful FSA's 2D is. At first glance it looks like a higher resolution A Link to the Past, because the style used is that of the immortal SNES adventure, as well as many on-screen objects, from houses to some characters; but soon we realize the strengths, which are to be found in some splendid effects taken on weight in style and spectacularity by Wind Waker (in any case, many playful and artistic design elements are also taken from Aonuma's game) and above all in the presence on the screen, more often than not, HUNDREDS of sprites, whether they are friendly or enemy characters, elements of the landscape, Force Gems and various effects, all in motion. In these situations the game manages to be spectacular because frankly to have so many elements on the screen in a 2D game you probably have to resort to the most advanced scrolling shoot 'em ups on the market, and lately there aren't really many. The beauty is that the framerate almost never seems to accuse the presence of so much goodness, and only in one juncture throughout the course of the game was the slowdown such as to jeopardize the correct use. But wow if there were so many enemies to slice... On the other hand, it should be noted that the resolution, although higher than the other 2D Hyrulian adventures, is not stratospheric anyway, and this is noticeable in case of zoom. Finally, we are aware of the fact that 2D nowadays could make someone turn up their noses, but we advise these players to make an effort, they will not regret it. The sound is in the name of the purest old style, not only for the technique used, the classic MIDI, but also for the compositions that recall the historical ones of Zelda, if they are not exactly a differently arranged version; same thing for the sound effects, and for the presentation in general which without frills is based on only written dialogues and classic cut scenes undifferentiated from the rest of the game. More could have been done, if only because in this way the plot, already overshadowed by such a peculiar game structure, does not provide players with", "date": "2005-01-07", "grade": null}
