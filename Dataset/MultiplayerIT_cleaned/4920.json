The package, available exclusively on PlayStation 4 (it will arrive on PC and Xbox One on May 18), includes a new single-player mission, ~Women's Gambit~, six unpublished time trials, two non-lethal weapons useful for stealth approach (the air gun and the sniper rifle) and a series of extra outfits. At the same time Ubisoft has also released a free update for all owners of the game which introduces a series of very interesting features, in this case a set of fun online races (at the command of eKarts, motorcycles and drones) and the new Showdown competitive mode. The latter allows you to engage in frenetic two-on-two matches within fifteen different maps, with three possible types of match: ~Steal the Drive~, a sandbox variant of the traditional ~capture the flag~; ~Doomload~, full of enthralling firefights; and ~Hack / Secure Servers~, a territorial mode in which you must conquer certain servers or prevent the opposing team from hacking them. These are novelties of great value, perhaps capable of relaunching an online sector that had died down a bit after the debut in November. Watch Dogs 2: No Compromise is too short and limited DLC, which is definitely not worth the purchase My name is Sborovski, Alejandro Sborovski Beyond the challenges and accessories, it is obviously the single player component that forms the fulcrum of No Compromise, with a storyline divided into five missions in which issues are addressed that only initially seem to have a semblance of depth. It all begins when Sitara asks us to identify and punish a porn film producer, Alejandro Sborovski (obviously it is a funny stage name, for the record, the English version is ~Jackofski~), who some time ago abused a friend of hers ending up making her a drug addict. It would have been interesting to find out how Sitara was actually the girl exploited by Sborovski, or end up in a story of abuse and slavery, but obviously the authors of Watch Dogs 2 had other plans and the whole thing soon turns into a caricature, without however introduce innovative situations with respect to the basic campaign, as instead happened in the aforementioned Human Conditions. In fact, in the first part of the DLC we will have to enter the building where the producer shoots his films, hack his devices and mobile cameras and then confine him in a room and literally spank him, while our friends film everything as a warning to those who goes against DedSec. At the end of the mission, a small twist occurs and you have to get by for a few minutes without weapons and gadgets, since the Russian mafia has decided to hit the Bay Area hacker group and wants to make an example of Marcus Holloway. What comes next unfortunately follows a plot well known to those who know the Ubisoft title: first of all we will have to blow up some cars and loads of drugs to respond to the Russian offensive, introducing us into an area very well manned by guards; secondly get us in the car and distract the mobsters while Wrench places a mix of explosives and fireworks inside the enemy bases, finally enjoying the spectacle of their detonation after reaching a point in the open sea, at the end of a frenetic Chase. Compromises? Here I am. No Compromise costs 9.99 euros instead of the 14.99 of the previous Human Conditions, but if the latter guaranteed something like five hours of gameplay for the single player component only, in the case of the new DLC the count is decidedly reduced and about forty minutes to complete all missions of the ~Donna Gambit~ storyline. Definitely not much: a complete disappointment for those who expected a solid and lasting package, which was also able to offer something new in terms of situations. As mentioned, on this front the authors took a potentially valid narrative incipit but developed it very badly, closing the Sborovski case within ten minutes and diving back into the usual mafia feud which frankly is now cloying and abused for this production. In the end, the most interesting news comes from the free April update, with its fun competitive mode and the three different types of matches, but these are elements that have little to do with the DLC and that we cannot evaluate in detail. this context. What we can do is instead sum up the general quality of a Season Passwhich unfortunately disappointed expectations, effectively delivering us a single package of value, Human Conditions, and culpably neglecting the other contents.", "date": "2017-04-23", "grade": null}
