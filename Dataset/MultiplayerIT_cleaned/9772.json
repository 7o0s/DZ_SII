The ~immediacy-cartoon style~ formula has in fact always had a positive impact on the audience in the videogame market. How to forget games like Speedball by Bitmap Bros on the unforgettable Amiga or Mario Tennis on the various Nintendo platforms? Or the Everybody's Golf series born on PlayStation and evolved over the years on practically all Sony consoles? Precisely this last saga, among other things, has not only been successfully revived on PSP with two ad hoc titles created by Clap Hanz in the period between 2004 and 2007, but has given life to a new series centered on the the most beloved racket sport on the planet, tennis. Developed for Playstation 2 in 2006, Everybody's Tennis brought the same crazy and fun universe already seen in the other production into this new sporting context, achieving moderate success despite the fact that insiders and the public accused it of the lack of certain attributes that would have extended its longevity and improved overall quality. And in the light of all this, the possibility that the same development team would also propose it on the PlayStation Portable in the near future was perhaps already intuitive. As then happened, even after and after four years. For the avoidance of doubt, however, let's say immediately that what we are about to analyze is not a port of the home version of the same name nor a sort of sequel, but a much more complete and varied game in itself as we will see shortly. The Happiness Club Perhaps precisely because of the (few) criticisms received, Clap Hanz has decided to recreate a large part of his video game by adding new elements to fill the gaps in the home edition, first of all what can be defined as the most consistent and interesting novelty of the product : the new Story mode, an option that allows the user to experience the gaming experience in a much more complete way. What is it about. In the role of one of the previously chosen characters (initially two), i.e. a young promise from the Happy Tennis Club of Nakagawa, the player follows a plot that basically revolves around different tennis academies and their rivalries, as well as the recruitment of new members , unraveling through typically comic anime situations with the primary or almost primary objective becoming that of beating the opponents but only to make them happy, cure them of a certain unhappiness and as mentioned above, make them become athletes of the club. All alternating training phases, interaction with other characters (with many textual dialogues fortunately translated into Italian - Ed) and role-playing style phases complete with exploration of various locations with a typically old-style RPG view, i.e. in a three-dimensional isometric perspective, with actual games. Although not a very original idea since something similar already existed in the days of Mario Golf and Mario Tennis on Game Boy Color, this option turns out to be perfectly timed, especially considering the fact that the product does not offer a tournament mode or many others possibility. Semi-real games Playing on a variety of more or less insane fields, leading equally improbable characters (twelve basic ones plus secret ones, which are at least three others) each of which characterized by specific personal skills, the player can make use of special moves and super hits to prove you're a true champion, even in challenges with friends. But don't be fooled by the comic graphics and friendly characters: playing Everybody's Tennis is less simple than it might seem. In spite of the graphic style, the game is very well packaged and cared for as regards the technical aspect. Mind you, we are not dealing with a real simulation, but this does not mean on the other hand that we have a sort of Sega Superstar tennis to be clear, and facing some opponents will require a certain commitment, including tactical ones. Its game system is in fact the ~classic~ one of this kind of productions, or at least of some of them, that is a mixture of Arcade and Simulation capable of offering immediate gameplay but at the same time endowed with the right depth. The commands used mainly to perform the various actions during a match can be performed using the analog stick and only three keys, each of which is used for a particular shot (lob, direct, lifted). To hit the ball well, excellent timing is required, which is why you need to pay attention to factors such as running, positioning of the corpo and rebounds. Without forgetting fatigue, a key element of a meeting which is signaled by a special bar to be monitored vigilantly. Inevitable are the special moves to be used in the key moments of the set and the presence of temporary obstacles on the playing field such as kittens, puddles and , ready to involuntarily deflect a shot, even if this happens very rarely. On the other hand, it is easier to interact in this sense with some of the elements placed on the sidelines such as the truck which, perhaps caught in full force by a volley, starts up and crashes or the limousine which, caught in full force by the ball, sends the butler into a rage . Ad hoc graphics At the end of each match, based on the result, the type of performance, the accuracy of the shots, the special shots used, etc., the player is rewarded with money, points aimed at increasing the physical characteristics of his tennis player and bonus items with which to personalize and empower their athletes. Several of these rewards are closely tied to completing the heart-shaped Loyalty bar. Thanks to them and to the material available in the well-stocked shop, it is in fact possible to change a character's clothing, hairstyle, racket and much more to your liking and all this does not have a purely aesthetic function: these gadgets also influence the athlete's skills. The graphics are beautiful, colorful and cartoony, with very pleasant and nice characters accompanying the user match after match and enhanced, as we wrote in the previous paragraph, by the presence of various extra animated elements on and off the field, apart from the public could have been done with more care. The playing fields are also very characteristic, which despite being somewhat improbable due to their location, shine for their variety and in some cases are even evocative. Finally, the audio sector is nice, with music suitable for the context that even provides ad hoc sampling for the most important moments of the match, in order to better underline the most spectacular actions almost as if it were an anime. But not all that glitters is gold. In our opinion, such a complete product lacks an online multiplayer mode. Absence only partially mitigated by the implementation of the game shared by up to four players locally with their PSPs without having to own multiple copies of the game. Furthermore, there is no possibility of being able to play a real tournament since the game modes are limited to the aforementioned History within Tennis per Uno, where it is also possible to play the classic single match.", "date": "2010-09-29", "grade": "8.3"}
