Holders of the season pass, a package which, at the cost of 2400 Microsoft Points, then allows you to download everything without spending extra money, have no choice problems, Multiplayer.it therefore comes to the rescue of those who instead have decided to evaluate the 'purchase. It is important to watch the weather after the news The new DLC in question adds five new multiplayer maps, each characterized by different climatic conditions: Repercussions (Flooded City), Artillery (Tornado), Cover (Fog), Jacinto (Rain and Imulsion) and Raven shot down (Snowstorm). It also includes new unlockable achievements for a total of 250 Gamerpoints, four new multiplayer characters: the Savage Hunter, Dom Commando, mechanical Baird and the Savage Elite Grenadier and, finally, a new ~mode~ to discover together. As the most attentive fans of Gears of War will surely have noticed, two of the five maps made available are reinterpretations of others already contained in the previous chapter, specifically the downed Raven and Jacinto. Thus continues the work of Epic in bringing back the locations most loved by the players, but at the same time offering unpublished maps. In Forces of Nature, as the title itself suggests, there are no particular style exercises, but rather a clear design choice, or rather that of adopting a different climate in each of the five maps which therefore also influences the gameplay itself of the games. as has already happened in other maps in Gears of War 3, but this time representing a common denominator to the entire downloadable package. The five proposed arenas are characterized by fairly small dimensions and therefore suitable for close combat and the famous covers that have made school in recent years in the action genre. ~Repercussions~ is set in a park full of cover points, but also stairs that lead to vertical levels. The huge ship stranded on top of some buildings immediately stands out. The map is small and square, with two balconies at either respawn end overlooking a small central plaza. The ~force of nature~ in this map is represented by the powerful earthquakes that make it very difficult to snipe accurately, and by the continuous floods that do not help the famous ~campers~ because staying still on one's position for too long becomes too dangerous. Xbox 360 goals Forces of Nature not only adds maps, weapons and characters, but also 250 new points to unlock through 7 objectives. One related to Beast mode, one by completing 50 waves in Horde for each map (cool!), others by performing specific actions required by the game, such as making a series of repairs using the character mechanical Baird. The goals are not difficult but some take a long time to achieve. Meat on the fire The second unpublished map, called Ariglieria, is perhaps the least spectacular or inspired of the package, and is represented by a disused industrial location, symmetrical and with an artillery cannon in a central position. In the centre, there is also a flamethrower and a single shot to revive the environment. But above all it is the storm that gives that touch of unpredictability to the game: after a while you begin to glimpse flashes in the sky, lightning and thunder, until a real tornado is unleashed, so powerful as to be able to transport game new cover items and items. The third unreleased map is the ~Bay~, an old fishing village with the sea on one side and the pier on the other. Also specular in shape, symmetrical and horizontal, it does not stand out for particular game design merits but rather for a very strong and convincing characterization that makes it decidedly pleasant both to play and to ~experience~. In the center of the village, a Torque bow and a shield brighten up the situation, while the ~Force of Nature~, in this case, will bring a very thick fog to the map that will make close combat more unpredictable and difficult. The map is very open and the ship offers an excellent position from which to snipe undisturbed. Until the fog arrives, of course. Jacinto is the first ~remix~ map from Gears of War 2: full of internal tunnels, very narrow and devoted to melee, but also terraces and vertical spaces from which to attack, it offers more styles of play and a new environmental situation, i.e. flooding from emulsion. The second map reprthe opposite is that of the downed Raven, this time in a ~hard winter~ version with the snow as the protagonist with a beautiful white cover and flakes that descend abundantly from the sky thanks to a splendid particle effect of the Unreal Engine 3. Downed Raven is one of the most popular maps of the first Gears of War because it offers a very limited space of action that forces players into forced hand-to-hand combat. In the center of the map the downed Raven helicopter, from which four very short paths branch off from where to respawn and try (unnecessarily) to hide among cars and the remains of an ancient railway. In this case, as already mentioned, nature affects the gameplay with a robust snowstorm that partially limits the view. However, the maps are not the only reason to buy this DLC, as there are also five new weapon skins, while two more will be added as a reward for performing certain actions during matches, for a total of seven new skins. In addition to this, each map, if played in Horde or Beast mode, hides within it, as an easter egg, an Elemental Cleavers, or a weapon with new powers such as the electric cleaver (thanks to the storms) or the cleaver fiery (due to the emulsion). Forces of Nature also brings a new mode called ~Guardian~ to Gears of War 3, more than new let's say a reinterpretation of the gameplay logic that the ~Assassin~ mode had, in which the objective was to destroy the leader of the opposing faction. In this case the goal is to defend it, so as not to waste respawns and try to win the game with as few kills as possible. Inverted but specular logic. Ultimately, this latest DLC is a great reason to continue playing Gears of War 3: all fans of the Epic saga will be extremely satisfied with the support given to their favorite game and we remind you that this is the last expansion planned by the developer. which, however, keeps the doors open to future DLCs if this will have the desired success. Forces of Nature is available for 800 Microsoft Points in the Marketplace and can be downloaded here. It is important that anyone who has already purchased the Season Pass does not download it from this link but simply insert the disc, start the game and follow the on-screen instructions.", "date": "2012-04-02", "grade": null}
