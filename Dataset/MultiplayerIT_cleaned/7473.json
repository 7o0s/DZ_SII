The birth of the ~tower offense~ was greeted with enthusiasm on both PC and mobile, and this first step resulted in the creation of an excellent spin-off, Anomaly Korea, as well as a sequel proper, Anomaly 2, which we already have got to try in the PC version and which now debuts on iOS and Android devices. The war between the ground troops and the mysterious ~anomaly~ continues, which after the clashes in Baghdad, Tokyo and on Korean territory seemed definitively defeated, but which instead re-emerges even stronger than before, creating a sort of impenetrable energy field from radars to inside which hides a myriad of huge metallic creatures that emerge from the ground. During the introductory mission, the machines manage to overwhelm the Yukon convoy by luring them into a trap, but this only creates more resentment among the ground troops, who decide to deploy new and more powerful vehicles. This is the main novelty of Anomaly 2: the units at our disposal can take on two different configurations, completely changing characteristics in an instant and adapting to ever-changing situations. With a double tap, the Assault Hound, an armored vehicle armed with a progressive machine gun, becomes a devastating bipedal mech equipped with a flamethrower; the Hammer, a tank with devastating firepower but valid only in straight trajectories, becomes a quadrupedal unit equipped with a missile launcher; the Guard, a crawler capable of slowing down the movements of enemy towers, transforms into a helicopter that protects adjacent units thanks to an energy shield. Anomaly 2 plays the transformation card and delivers us a tower offense experience not to be missed How do you change in order not to die By introducing the element of ~on the fly~ transformation, the developers of 11 bit studios have shuffled the cards on the table and created a whole series of unprecedented situations, in which it is necessary not only to quickly position the power-ups on the screen (only two, unfortunately, novelty in this sense: an object that ~turns off~ the enemy towers allowing us to hit them first and one that allows us to concentrate fire on a particular target to eliminate it quickly), but also precisely transform the units so that they respond blow by blow to enemies; all within fifteen spectacular missions that can be tackled according to four difficulty levels, complete with a double ending. A great job has been done in terms of level design, which never gets as ~huge~ as in the first episode of the series, and the touch interface is the same as always, quite clear and precise but with some problems on the iPhone due to of the small size of the screen (and, let's add, the ~back~ button mysteriously works badly - a fix is urgently needed). Nothing that prevents you from fully enjoying the experience, which also shows off a substantially enhanced technical sector, with much more detailed and evocative settings than in the past, but which on the 5s move with incredible fluidity and speed. To the substantial offer of the single player campaign is also added a competitive online multiplayer for two players, certainly ~slow~ in its dynamics (we are still talking about a strategic one) and at the moment not densely populated, but full of potential and freshness, seen which also allows us to control towers and not just land units.", "date": "2013-11-19", "grade": "8.8"}
