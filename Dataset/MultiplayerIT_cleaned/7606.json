Curiously, Soul Hackers is itself a spin-off... of a spin-off, as the second title of the Devil Summoner branch in the Shin Megami Tensei family. Confused? Great, us too. The important thing, however, is to know that Soul Hackers is a perfectly stand-alone title and you don't need to have played any Shin Megami Tensei before it to be able to fully appreciate its story. As for the gameplay, however, it's a whole other ballgame: unfortunately, Soul Hackers came out in 1997, when RPGs didn't take players by the hand, dishing up dozens of tutorials. Which, in fact, given the complexity of the game, wouldn't have been a bad idea; and since this port is far too faithful to the original release, it's time to expect some headaches... Your soul... is mine! Soul Hackers was released in 1997 for SEGA Saturn and in 1999 for PlayStation One, in a period in which technology is making great strides and there is more and more talk of cyberspace and virtual reality without yet interpreting these fascinating concepts in a much more bland and concrete today. The Shin Megami Tensei series has always been characterized by themes and atmospheres based on the occult and the supernatural, and if you add a pinch of cyberpunk and an ounce of science fiction to them, the picture that is painted is quite intriguing. In Soul Hackers, then, the unnamed protagonist (a MegaTen classic) lives in the super-sophisticated town of Amami: we are in a future that for us is now the past, in which persistent online worlds are a striking novelty, so is that our alter ego and his band of hackers - the Spookies - long to participate in the armored Paradigm X Beta, a sort of alternative virtual Love Me. We succeed and together with Hitomi, the girl we're in love with, we log in for the first time... to find ourselves facing Kinap, a spirit in the form of a coyote who asks us for help. There is something rotten in the city of Amami, and Paradigm X could be something far more dangerous than an online community. Our hero will find out the hard way by reliving the memories of a special agent and coming into possession of a device that will allow him to communicate with demons and summon them. When one of these takes possession of Hitomi's body, we will be forced to collaborate with him to discover the truth about Paradigm X. Told through lots of dialogues and sporadic cartoon sequences, the plot of Soul Hackers looks just like a science fiction tale of other times, flecked with fantasy and even a bit of cyberpunk: there's a bit of everything, from Japanese to Indian mythology, and at times the dark and disturbing atmospheres can even be a little indigestible. The English localization is excellent as usual and the dubbing also seemed to us to be well made, for such a niche production: there is a lot to read, however, and those who do not know the language will certainly find themselves in difficulty. Soul Hackers is a very special RPG for the most nostalgic and lovers of retro challenges The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect has been used sparingly, yet it has the great advantage of making first-person exploration of the dungeons more engaging, giving corridors and rooms a convincing depth. In combat, however, it only ~detaches~ the menus from the sprites, and is almost imperceptible. Walking demons The porting of Soul Hackers is all too faithful to the original: this ~new~ version for Nintendo 3DS has not been practically retouched, as far as the technical sector is concerned, which is therefore quite questionable when compared to titles such as the recent Etrian Odyssey IV, both during explorations and during battles against sprites without animations. With the other Atlus game that we reviewed a few weeks ago, Soul Hackers shares quite a few characteristics: also in this case, for example, the exploration of areas and dungeons takes place completely in first person. If the streets of Paradigm X and some settings in the real world seem to come out of a very normal metropolis, the same cannot be said of some much more ~dreamlike~ and disturbing dungeons in which we will be forced to wander, fortunately assisted by the map displayed entirely on the console bottom screen. In these cases, between one washed-out texture and another, we will often have to confront each otherwith ingenious puzzles and hordes of angry demons. The battles, also in first person just like in Etrian Odyssey, are the typical MegaTen affair: one misstep can cost the life of the entire team, made up of two human characters and four demons. The latter are the heart of Soul Hackers gameplay, as they must be recruited, raised and managed according to tradition: we must pay attention to their character, because if it conflicts with ours they may not obey us, and we must always keep keep an eye on the amount of Magnetite available, a resource that allows us to keep demons active and which is consumed over time. Demons can be fused to acquire even more powerful creatures that inherit the abilities of their precursors, and can be recruited through the conversation system which, with a little skill and a pinch of intuition, could allow us to completely dodge the most of the all too frequent random fights. In short, it's all very deep and interesting, but if from the beginning we managed to extricate ourselves from the complicated menus and the unclear interface, knowing how to chat with the demons and when it was the right time to do it or not, it's simply because we know Shin Megami Tensei well and its decades-long main gameplay features. Soul Hackers explains practically nothing about its mechanics, throwing the player into the fray without any mercy: it is never clear where one needs to go to continue in the story and many services, such as shops, for example, are scattered throughout Paradigm X and decidedly uncomfortable to consult and use, although essential to the success of our mission. Not even the possibility introduced with this version for Nintendo 3DS to use game tokens or StreetPass to buy special bonuses or unlock more powerful demons than normal makes life easier, although it is a feature implemented precisely to facilitate the adventure for new users in difficulty. In this sense, in short, one feels completely the advanced age of a game that in 1997 could even have appeared futuristic, but which today can be appreciated above all by nostalgics and those looking for a bizarre and incredibly intricate RPG.", "date": "2013-09-23", "grade": "7.0"}
