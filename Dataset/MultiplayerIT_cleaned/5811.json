For those who haven't tried this title at least once, it's about controlling a character named Steve and exploring randomly generated worlds, entirely made up of blocks, all with vintage-flavored graphics reminiscent of 8-bit games: you can explore caves, dig, build buildings, fight against monsters, cultivate fields and raise animals... the real limit is only your imagination! There are two main modes, Survival and Creative. In Survival mode you have to deal with hunger, with the surrounding environment and with the monsters that come out by the dozen at night to kill you; it is essential to seek shelter, perhaps dug into the first mountain you find, and do it quickly, as the night does not forgive arriving before you realize it: it is man against nature! In Creative mode there is no difficulty, Steve is able to fly and you have access to an unlimited amount of material as well as any existing object; in this mode, you can easily create any type of construction just by doing it. To instill in the reader that emotion that one feels in front of a new version of the game, let's go back for a moment to 2009, the year in which the alpha playable on PC was released and in which we first heard the magic transmitted from this title: we talk about finding yourself reliving the first day of Survival mode, about that feeling of anguish you have when you realize that, unfortunately, we have not found a piece of coal and, for this, we will be forced to pass the night in the dark inside a hole or between four walls built in the best way possible. The Wii U conversion only has the flaw of arriving with a monstrous delay and is, as we will see, technically inferior to the versions for PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One but certainly not disappointing. Minecraft for Wii U Edition is a great conversion, comfortable to play on the GamePad Minecraft on the Gamepad: a conveniencewasted Let's start with what's good: Minecraft is complete with everything, 60 frames per second even in horizontal or vertical split screen for two players locally and up to 8 players online with the possibility of sharing our worlds with them and vice versa . To communicate you can use both voice and game chat which is implemented perfectly with the GamePad, quite comfortable for writing. Familiarizing yourself with the controls is not easy at first (those who are used to Splatoon will press X to jump and get the inventory opened as a result) but it doesn't take much to get used to. One piece of advice we give is to use, if you have it, the Wii U Pro Controller, which is necessary if you want to play in two since, unfortunately, the Wii remote does not work with Minecraft. Here comes the first regret. Given the peculiarity of the Wii U GamePad, one would have expected greater interaction with it, for example by accessing the inventory in a more comfortable way instead of having to press a key to open it and move a cursor to move the objects inside ( and moving a cursor without a mouse is really annoying) or by viewing the game map or the crafting table. Even if these features have not been implemented, the possibility remains, as in many Wii U games, to play on the GamePad without using the TV: undoubtedly the greatest quality of this version, which will allow you to enjoy yourself comfortably even on television turned off while staying near the console (split screen is disabled). We are facing a hybrid version halfway between the old and new generation consoles: it moves away from PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in terms of colors, which are much more vivid here, viewing distance and frame rate but it is not at height of the new generation consoles probably due to a hardware limit of Wii U which, among other things, restricts the play area to a single map against the 25 present on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One even if this is for a neophyte (provided they still exist) is not a real problem. Textures, Skins, Mash-Up packs and creativity As for the features themselves, the Mojang title is a perfect port of the game that apparently lacks nothing: there are all the biomes, villages, monsters, the Nether Realm and the Ender Dragon, even the Adventure mode ( little-played variant of Survival where you cannot destroy blocks but can trade with villagers). Inin reality, the Hardcore mode is missing which, in essence, is a Survival in which you can only die once. Precisely this mode offers, perhaps, the most intense gaming experience in Minecraft and on Wii U it is no less: as previously mentioned, after passing the first day and having built a shelter, you have an infinite number of materials available with which to build increasingly complex tools through which you will dig at night, being careful of underground creatures (just avoid going towards unsafe sounds) while the outside world is populated by monsters, and you will build during the day, in total safety. It will be possible to forge weapons and armor to face the various zombies, skeletons and spiders without too many problems, even if the risk of a creeper approaching behind you, ready to explode, is always lurking, especially in the dark of a little cave. before placing a torch to illuminate it. As you progress in the game, you will need to move away from your first shelter to make more and, when the distance between shelters is too much, you will realize that you need transport and, therefore, you will desperately look for a horse or , for the more patient, to build tracks to transform the shelters into real stations. Of course, as with the other console versions, all those mods that have now modified Minecraft to the point of having new materials, tools or unimaginable machines inside are absent. Don't despair, because the game includes the Battle And Beasts 1 and 2 skin packs and the Christmas one for free which, if you don't know, change Steve's appearance; free is also the texture pack dedicated to Christmas that changes all the graphics of the game. Other packs of skins, textures and special Mash-Up packs are available (with the latter, in addition to changing graphics and skins, typical elements such as buildings and music of the theme they are inspired by are added) which, however, unfortunately, are paid for an amount ranging from  0.99 to  3.99: among these we point out those dedicated to Doctor Who, the Simpsons or Star Wars and, in the Mash-up packages, those of Skyrim and Mass Effect.", "date": "2015-12-22", "grade": "8.0"}
