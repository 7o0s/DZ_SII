As long as you don't shamelessly copy, there's nothing wrong with that, of course, and even when it happens you can turn a blind eye, as long as you did your homework well (this is the case, for example, of Toukiden). Be that as it may, Freedom Wars is yet another experiment in a line of thought that has already given birth to titles such as God Eater, Soul Sacrifice and the aforementioned Toukiden: a third-person action adventure in which you complete mission after mission, while procuring the materials needed to improve their equipment and overcome increasingly difficult challenges. As addictive as the mechanism that has brought the Capcom franchise to success is, it alone is not enough to sell a new intellectual property: there is a need for new ideas in this market of imitations, and Freedom Wars has plenty of them. But will they be enough to distinguish him from the crowd? Freedom Wars is an action game, along the lines of Monster Hunter, original but not without its problems My freedom begins where yours ends If there's one thing Freedom Wars excels at, it's definitely the originality of the setting. Probably inspired by stories like the one told in The Hunger Games trilogy, the trio of developers - a joint venture made up of Sony, Dimps and Shift - set the game in a remote and post-apocalyptic future: it's 102014 and the Earth is by now been drained of any resource, forcing the population to take refuge in underground complexes called Panopticon. The problem is that the Panopticons have gone to war with each other to grab the very few resources left on the planet, which are barely enough to sustain each of them. For this reason, each Panopticon has established a string of extremely severe laws which allow for the punishment of its residents, limiting their possibilities to excess and, consequently, the consumption of resources. As if that weren't enough, since every human being represents a potential waste of resources, the problem of overpopulation has been solved in the most brutal way possible: every newborn is simply guilty of existing, and sentenced to a capital punishment of a million years of imprisonment. There is a way to escape a life of isolation, and that is to contribute militarily to the defense of one's Panopticon: the resources conquered, the enemies defeated, the citizens saved and so on contribute to reducing the sentence, which is why the ~ sinners~ fight to help their Panopticon and aspire to the higher echelons of society. We, of course, are one of them: an accident occurs at the beginning of the game that will cause us severe amnesia, resetting our capital punishment, practically a ploy to start the game in medias res by putting us in the shoes of a young prisoner. The story of Freedom Wars obviously revolves around the conflict between the Panopticons, but also around the characters who inhabit them, whether they are our allies or nemeses: the cast is decidedly full of bizarre characters full of personality, but the story never insists on none of them, reducing them to mere specks with the exception of Aries, a mysterious girl who regularly visits us in our sleep. In short, the attempt to impose a storyline that links the various missions was only partially successful, and some twists inevitably lose effectiveness due to a rather inconsistent screenplay - texts in Italian, spoken in Japanese. No one plays Monster Hunter for the plot, just to remind us what we're talking about, but Toukiden, for example, was much better used to it. PSVita trophies To unlock the 32 bronze trophies, the 7 silver, the 3 gold and the final platinum, it will be necessary to clean off Freedom Wars for good, for example by completely reducing the sentence of our sinner. Of course, you must complete all special and non-special operations, pass the C.O.D. and obtain all conceivable rights. Bramble birds The series of initial missions with which Freedom Wars opens serves as a tutorial, but it is of little use since to learn how to play seriously it will take several hours of practice. The fault lies mainly with the control system, cumbersome and a little wooden, and with the superficiality with which the title explains each of its functions. But let's go in order. Played in the third person, Freedom Wars really resembles Monster Hunter: with one key you sprint, with a couple you attack, with another you use items in your inventory or interact with the environment. The combinations of attacks and loaded shots are inevitable, the addition of an alternative to the various weapons is welcomemelee, represented by a series of machine guns, pistols and missile launchers which pass simply by acting on the d-pad. The exchange of weapons and their use are quite intuitive and represent the first layer of a combat system which, however, offers many more options, starting with the possibility of taking cover behind walls and low walls. Furthermore, every sinner has a tool which, once learned to use, drastically changes the way of approaching each conflict: it is the bramble, an accessory wrapped around the arm which can be thrown in any direction it is aimed at. The brambles can be of three types - healing, defensive and capturing - and perform the functions suggested by the categories to which they belong. A captivating bramble, for example, allows you to place special traps, while healing brambles obviously heal the targets, and so on. In addition to ensuring what are real extra abilities, defining the player's role in the group, the brambles expand the possibilities of action and movement because they act as real grappling hooks, allowing us to hang from walls, ceilings or enemies themselves. Thanks to the brambles it is possible to implement particular tactics which allow, in this case, to fight the gigantic ~kidnappers~ on equal terms. The latter are practically the monsters that we would fight ad nauseam in any Monster Hunter and represent the funniest and most captivating challenges of Freedom Wars: each model of kidnapper has particular weapons, skills and protections that force players to employ specific strategies. It is literally possible to hang from the body of a kidnapper and slaughter him in mid-air in order to dismember him, thus collecting extra materials and rewards, and in most cases it is essential to weaken them, perhaps by throwing them to the ground with our bramble, to free the citizens who they kidnapped and imprisoned in their capsules. It's a pity that the alternative to the fights with the kidnappers are insipid missions in which you have to face the sinners of the other Panopticons, especially when they start to get a little too long: as the game progresses, in fact, the missions tend to be divided into multiple stages chained together and strain the player's nerves with modifiers to enemy power or defense that require very careful planning. None of this would have bothered us, except that most of the modifiers in question or the mechanisms that regulate them are not explained anywhere, except in the suggestions that appear randomly during loading. Freedom Wars, in certain instances, becomes a real exercise in frustration: it is possible to complete each mission alone, but more often than not you feel the need to face them in multiplayer mode to hurry up faster and have more fun. Options, options everywhere Freedom Wars is not limited to displaying a dry list of missions, of course, and as usual we will find ourselves having to get by with a truly disproportionate amount of options and features in this case. Initially, behind every rumor there is a trap: our sinner, in fact, has no right, and even lying down or interacting with someone is considered a crime to atone for. It's almost comical to complete a mission and reduce your pain, risking your life, only to see it increase by choosing the rest option offered by the game itself. This is a somewhat frustrating expedient, which however manages to immerse us even more in the peculiar and despotic philosophy of the Panopticons, which we will also be able to choose to represent in a kind of leaderboard on a global scale. Our sinner, abundantly customizable at the beginning of the game, is always accompanied by an automaton, an android with equally customizable human features: given that in Freedom Wars there are no real armor to build, it is possible to unlock, modify and wear numerous costumes, but it must be said that at that point the manufacture of objects with the materials obtained by defeating enemies and kidnappers becomes much less satisfying. One of the winning features of Monster Hunter, for example, was precisely the possibility of physically showing off one's conquests by wearing the ~parts~ of defeated monsters. In Freedom Wars, at most, somewhat anonymous weapons are manufactured which, from an aesthetic point of view, do not offer who knows what variety, and the process for building, modifying and upgrading them is extremely complicated, as well as little or nothing explained: proceed by trial and error, without knowing which materials it is best to keep and which ones to donate to the Panopticon, it is anything but funny and the lack of clarity ofthe menus, in this sense, certainly does not help. The menus, in fact, are somewhat the heart of the interaction between our sinner and the surrounding world: through them one can change one's appearance, access the structures in which objects are manufactured, change equipment, obtain rights and so on, so it's a shame they aren't much more intuitive and faster. From a technical point of view, after all, Freedom Wars is satisfactory with reservations: the character models deserve applause for the character design, the richness of the details and the cleanliness of the textures, thanks also to the choice of a particularly brilliant color palette, while the scenarios in which they move are too generic and repetitive.", "date": "2014-11-05", "grade": "8.0"}
