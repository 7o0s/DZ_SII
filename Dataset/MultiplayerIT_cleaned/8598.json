Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. In recent weeks we have taken care of reviewing the Mega Jump phenomenon, which over the course of several months has built its success thanks not only to the free format, but also and above all to a gameplay refined from update to update, following the indications of the users and always adding new features. Now let's see a product that has just been released on the App Store and Google Play, and which aims, if possible, to obtain a similar response: Cordy Sky. The protagonist of the game, Cordy, is the same seen in the platform of the same name (here is our review), a title of excellent quality, which in its mechanics is clearly inspired by LittleBigPlanet and boasts an excellent structure. This time the funny character with a cathode ray tube TV instead of a head is adrift in space and has to repair his spaceship to get home, collecting a certain number of components. To find them, he will have to complete a series of levels in pure jumping game style, i.e. with an almost infinite vertical progression and the obligation to use every handhold to reach unprecedented heights, without ever making a mistake, under penalty of game over. Or rather, things would go like this in the aforementioned Mega Jump, in the classic Doodle Jump and in other productions of the genre, but the developers of SilverTree Media have decided to equip Cordy Sky with a couple of extra aids: first of all, the ability of the character to double jump and then correct any miscalculated moves; secondly, an indicator placed on the right side of the screen, which is recharged by collecting some bonus items and which allows us to enjoy an emergency boost in case it is falling. Is the game good when it doesn't last long? The two solutions we have just talked about unfortunately affect the proverbial degree of challenge of jumping games, a trend that over the years has gained elements of progression, different settings and unlockable extras instead of the initial ~survival~ setting, with the classic ~single game~ and a few variations, but without ever losing this feature. In other words, Cordy Sky is a bit easy and the aids do not help, if you pass the pun, to make the experience more lasting and engaging. However, it would be a crime to brand the SivlerTree Media production for these naiveties and instead ignore the very pleasant platform influences that enrich the levels, with real platforms on which the character finds himself stopping, albeit briefly, and which therefore change the cards on the table with respect to the obligation to jump continuously. Many of these situations boast further spectacular implications, with the activation of switches that transform the scenario and project us from one part of it to another. All seasoned by a really excellent technical realization, with well-differentiated levels, a good variety of objects, beautiful colors and fairly well-finished animations. Finally, as far as the control system is concerned, it is possible to choose between the traditional tilt, the virtual buttons and the ~slide~: the latter undoubtedly proves to be the method with the greatest precision, but unfortunately the finger ends up covering an important part of the touch screen and this can create problems.", "date": "2012-04-14", "grade": "7.8"}
