{"name": "Rally Fusion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rally-fusion.html", "text": "So let's see the game modes: we said, the heart of the title in question is represented by the Race Of Champions, which in turn is divided into the actual Race of Champions, a points championship that takes place in various places on earth and the Nations Cup, each of which offers three levels of difficulty. The ROC challenge, which we can participate in after creating our own profile, instead requires that you first pass three road tests to have a sort of license to then be able to compete and win trophies, thanks to which you will unlock new game modes, initially not available: Rally Challenge, in which you will race in a circuit, alone against the clock; Circuit Challenge in which you will challenge four opponents; Rally Cross Challenge Hill Climb in which you will race along a track in the middle of the mountains; '~Elimination Challenge~, in which the car in last position is eliminated every lap; ~Follow the leader challenge~ in which the cars have a bar, which decreases if they are not in first position, until the one who has least ~used up~ the bar wins; ~Head to Head Challenge~, a challenge between only two drivers that takes place in multiple circuits. You can access this series of unlockable modes by winning championships via the ~quick race~ menu item. Finally, the ~custom challenge~, also not available from the beginning of the game, gives you the possibility to create your own customized rally. Gameplay Now you're wondering: is it nice to play? In this regard, it must be said that rally fusion is a much more arcade-style game than a simulation; if this can make rally purists turn up their noses, it will probably make the happiness of those who look for immediate fun in a game of this kind, fun that does not require hours and hours of training to be able to learn how to drive the car to perfection With this, however, do not think that from the first game you will be able to finish first in all the races ... on the contrary, you will still have to acquire a minimum of mastery of the car, therefore I feel like saying that from this point of view rally fusion has a good difficulty calibration. During the races you will often see your car take real tumbles, and in this regard the programmers have included in the game the possibility of saving your ~longest jumps~ and ~biggest crashes~, which gives the game that pinch of ~diversity~. ~. A note of merit also goes to the co-drivers who support the driver by inciting him and giving him advice on the strategies to be followed, equipped with excellent artificial intelligence; in the event that they become annoying with their reproaches, you can eliminate their voice by pressing a special button ... original, don't you think? If you've been paying attention, you'll have noticed that I said that RF is much more arcade-style, but I didn't say that there's no trace of simulative ambitions: in fact, each car has its own damage indicator which could actually lead to difficulties in driving, making dents, doors opening while speeding at 100mph etc...really fun and spectacular to watch! Even the graphics department does its duty, showing a good variety of environments quite rich in contour elements, among which the public stands out, which finally is made up of polygonal elements and not simple two-dimensional bitmaps. The textures are of good quality as also the polygonal models of the cars, even if for the record I would say that in this regard we are below the excellent levels guaranteed by titles such as sega GT... All the polygons on the screen are in any case well managed, guaranteeing good fluidity to the game, factor never so important as in driving simulations. What about the audio... while not bringing anything revolutionary in musical terms, the co-driver's voice is what is most striking, as he will be able to totally immerse you in the race thanks to his cheers. Finally, longevity is guaranteed by the myriad of modes that can be unlocked as you progress in the championships and by the presence of 30 initial pilots plus others that you can create using a special editor; more than this...! Comment Ultimately I feel I can recommend Rally Fusion to all those who love this genre but don't look for a too simulative aspect in it; to all the others, however, I recommend trying it because objectively it is a well made game. After two long years of gestation in the British studios of climax, rally fusion is finally available on shop shelves ... will this rally simulation succeed in imposing itself on the competition? let's find out intogether... As soon as you insert the DVD into your console, the main menu of the game will appear from which you can access the various modes available, which are to be precise: ROC (Race Of Champions), quick race, roc challenge and custom championship; from this menu you can also access the options screen, that of your records gained in the various game sessions and the most spectacular replays. Before analyzing the various modes, it is appropriate to spend a few words to immerse yourself a little more closely in what the spirit of the game is: in rally fusion you will have to compete against various opponents on board about twenty of racing cars, darting on 20 tracks located in 9 different environments ranging from desert to forests and tropical or snowy landscapes. Although the number of cars available is not high, especially when compared to other titles of the genre, it is nice to see that all the cars available are those that officially compete in rallies: toyota, audy, ford etc...", "date": "2002-11-20", "grade": null}
