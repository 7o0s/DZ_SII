The younger players are excused given their age but the smoother senpai certainly can't have forgotten the hours spent in front of the PC thanks to the imagination of this group of developers. Worms is certainly the most famous brand thanks to its simplicity and immediacy, and the Apple iPhone people certainly cannot miss the portable version of the warrior worms. Worms for iPhone does not differ from the original version and perfectly reproduces every single aspect: the invertebrate protagonists are divided into teams and are called to wage a furious battle trying to bring home the goal of completely eliminating the opposing teams. The guerrillas therefore find themselves embroiled in battles to the death in steep environments, full of natural obstacles alternating with parachuting objects from the sky that can be used as power-ups. The mobile version of Worms focuses purely on single player play; the modes present in fact offer only three choices: Quick Game, Training Game and Challenges, the common factor is the possibility of selecting the difficulty of the AI before jumping into the battlefield. Partita Veloce needs no introduction: four randomly selected teams compete in a ~friendly~ match. Match Training is the classic training room in which the main objective is to refine one's strategy and skills, while in Challenges the team led by the player is called upon to face teams of antagonists of increasing number and skill for a total of 50 phases. The only existing option for a multiplayer game is only usable locally but without wifi support, consequently it is necessary to pass the iPhone in the hands of each person. Armed to the teeth The technical sector is really well done thanks above all to the fidelity of the perfectly recreated porting without any flaws both in terms of graphics and sonorous. In fact, the scenarios and colors used are very faithful, as indeed the interactivity with the environment has remained unchanged, obviously limited to the devastation of the seabed but still worthy of note. The gameplay is the most important aspect to analyze thanks above all to the use of the iPhone touch; controlling each worm directly with your fingers is very immediate, since it is enough to drag the viewfinder on the screen, press the fire button and admire what happens below. Nonetheless, the reactivity and precision are not always at an optimal level, leaving the doors open to a little frustration. The zoom is perhaps the least well-finished aspect given that the magnification range is certainly not very wide, but still such as not to affect the viewing angle. Another flagship of Worms lies in the fervent imagination of the developers inherent in the construction of the available arsenal: if the classic uzis and missile launchers are certainly effective but not very original, attacks as devastating as they are bizarre such as the sheep-bomb, the exploding donkey statue, energy waves and exploding bananas. Other useful items complete the soldiers' equipment such as parachutes, jetpacks and iron beams that can be placed on the stage as a bridge, not to mention the possibility of teleportation. Everything therefore contributes to outline the picture of a version of Worms faithful to its historical characteristics, even on the iPhone. The tested version is 1.0.0", "date": "2009-07-28", "grade": "8.0"}
