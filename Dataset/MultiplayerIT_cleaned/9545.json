{"name": "Beyond a Steel Sky", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beyond-a-steel-sky-recensione-console.html", "text": "When Apple unveiled its video game-based subscription service for iOS and Mac, Apple Arcade, it put together a sort of sizzle reel video composed of a great mix of in-development projects which also featured several interesting ideas, but one of the games that aroused greater amazement was the sequel to Beneath a Steel Sky, a historic graphic adventure from the 90s, the golden age of the genre, by Revolution Software. A couple of abundant years later, here we are in front of the review of Beyond a Steel Sky on Xbox and PlayStation, a direct conversion of that title initially released as an Apple Arcade exclusive and probably remained one of the most striking projects of that first wave of titles presented for the subscription service, though it hasn't proven to be without flaws. Times have changed a lot since 1994 and point and click has practically disappeared from major productions to find its own dimension especially in indie titles, where it has truly found a second youth, and this title is further confirmation of this. We're a far cry from the clamor that sparked Beneath a Steel Sky at the time, when Charles Cecil and famed cartoonist Dave Gibbons brought a cyberpunk epic like never before, but 26 years later the video game designer and the designer still demonstrate a remarkable harmony, taking up the particular style they had chosen for the original and transporting it into a game that demonstrates, at the same time, that it has assimilated the evolutions that have taken place in the graphic adventure genre in the following decades. On the other hand, the work done on the Broken Sword series and its progressive evolution in terms of structure and graphics over time is also noticeable: Beyond a Steel Sky is presented as a third-person game, which on consoles offers direct control of the character, but its structure remains anchored to the classic one of graphic adventures, focused on dialogues, interaction with the scenarios and use of the objects in the inventory to solve the puzzles. History: where were we Beyond a Steel Sky: Robert arrives in Union City from the clearing in the desert 10 years have passed since the events narrated in Beneath a Steel Sky and at the beginning of the story we find the old protagonist Robert Foster again in the clearing, away from the chaos of Union City and intent on enjoying a peaceful retreat in a small rural community. Certain that he has left the city in good hands, with his friend Joey to control its management, the hero of the first chapter cannot suspect that he will soon find himself immersed again in a dangerous adventure that will take him back inside the megalopolis, discovering the most disturbing secrets. The initial sequence, built as a sort of animated comic, takes up exactly the style of the original, with Gibbons' drawings narrating the dramatic incipit, making us immediately get back into the right spirit. However, there is a further element of mystery that soon emerges behind the events that open the story and it is the darkness that can be glimpsed behind the bright utopia of Union City, which turns out to be only a splendid facade. The city has been completely transformed from the events of the first chapter and from Joey, Robert's ex-robot companion, who is now revered as the founder and tutelary deity of the new social utopia. However, Foster's investigations soon reveal some dark sides of the seemingly ideal civilization built on the old city-state and the sudden disappearance of the old friend only deepens the mystery. Beyond a Steel Sky, Robert in the streets of Union City The darkest and most classic cyberpunk therefore leaves room for more marked elements of social criticism, on the alleged earthly paradise at the service of citizens, supported by a remarkable irony that pervades all the dialogues and characters that can be encountered during the game, making the interactions with the NPCs particularly enjoyable, which assume even greater importance here than in more classic puzzle solving. The story is quite independent from the original, allowing even those who do not know it to enjoy the development of events, however it contains numerous references to the first chapter that can only be fully appreciated by those who have played it, and in particular in the final part there is a sort of real connection to the plot of Beneath a Steel Sky, definitively closing the circle in a way that is clearer and more complete if we keep in mind what happened in the 1994 original. Gameplay: puzzle solving and hacking Beyond a Steel Sky, some glimpses take up the most classic cyberpunk Despite the new setting, the gameplay remains firmly anchored to the origins of the series, we proposeI give a modernization of the classic point and click graphic adventure system. As we also reported in the review of the iOS version of Beyond a Steel Sky, the game features an evolution of the interface elaborated for Broken Sword 5: The Curse of the Serpent, exploiting the third person view and direct control of the character to allow exploration of three-dimensional space, but the interaction always takes place through contextual menus near objects, elements of the scenario or characters. The dynamic interface appears near the interactive elements and presents only a few choices (usually a basic action and the possible possibility of accessing the inventory, which when it appears already indicates a possible solution to the puzzle), with a system somewhat uncertain because it requires placing the object precisely in the center of the frame, forcing corrective movements of this which can be a bit tedious. It is a simplified system that is based more on the variety of situations involving other characters or robots, rather than on the combination of objects, but the most characterizing element of the whole puzzle design is certainly the presence of hacking, which opens up many new possibilities of interaction. In the initial stages of the adventure, Robert finds a scanner which, suitably modified in an illegal manner, allows him to enter the electronic and computer systems present in the surrounding area, allowing for new possibilities for interaction. Beyond a Steel Sky: Robert is preparing to hack some devices By extracting the tool, this indicates how many and which devices can be hacked and by activating it we enter the different systems: some flow charts appear on the screen which determine actions, reactions and consequences based on the inputs and situations foreseen by the various computers and robots present. Through a simple dragging system we can radically change the behavior of these machines, with different consequences, by modifying the sequence of operations and the cause-effect relationships set up even in a rather creative way. It is to all intents and purposes a sort of game inside to the game and certainly the most original element present in Beyond a Steel Sky, which stimulates lateral thinking and the creative approach to solving puzzles much more than the standard graphic adventure dynamics, which are less brilliant to say the least. In this way a certain imbalance is determined between some decidedly simple puzzles and others so layered as to be a bit cumbersome, but it is a bit of a critical element that recurs in this genre. A particular cyberpunk Beyond a Steel Sky demonstrates peculiar artistic tendencies, in some cases Having inevitably abandoned the wonderful 2D bitmap of the original, Revolution has focused on 3D graphics with Unreal Engine 4 and the application of a cel shading-style filter for the representation of the characters, a rather apt solution to try to recover the comic strip of Gibbons, even if what comes out is a bit anonymous. The good art direction emerges above all in the landscape design, in particular regarding the construction of the majestic Union City and its glimpses that seem to blend cyberpunk with art Deco elements, in a rather original vision of the futuristic utopia represented by the city. This emerges both from the architecture and from the design of some technologies, such as the interface of the Minos computer system with which we must interface continuously within the adventure. Precisely on the latter there is a note to be made: the construction of this kind of widespread social network is well thought out at the conceptual level, but it never finds a real development during the game, representing a bit of an opportunity wasted. The system of ~social credits~, the ~Qdos~, is barely sketched while it could have offered an interesting opportunity to build a ramification of choices on a moral basis and this too gives a bit of the feeling of a limitation imposed by contingencies of development versus the grand ideas they had for building Union City. It should also be noted that some technical imperfections are still present: the initial release of Beyond a Steel Sky was rather marred by various bugs and glitches that somewhat affected its evaluation and, strangely, a year after this, the game is still not without its drawbacks. On Xbox Series X it appears much cleaner, but there are still some problems with interface management, Robert's pathfinding and contacts with other characters or elements of the scenario which are at this point not very understandable, also considering the graphic systemico undemanding and the frame-rate limited. For the rest, the musical accompaniment is pleasant and the English dubbing is also of an excellent level, with all the texts translated into Italian.", "date": "2021-12-04", "grade": "8.0"}
