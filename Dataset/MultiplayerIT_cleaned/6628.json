Only the eShop was missing, and we couldn't be happier for Wii U owners to see how Frima Studio has packaged an impeccable port, albeit with a clear amanuense soul. In fact, there are no additions or implementations that improve the offer or take advantage of the Wii U hardware, but if you are already puffing because the GamePad is once again a simple mirror of the video stream on the screen, curb the disappointment: Chariot is perfectly fine Like this. The Canadian work enjoys its clear playful self-sufficiency, which does not require further forced upheavals or abstruse ideas; its conservative stance towards Nintendo's second screen therefore represents a value and not a lack. We need this passage to talk about the title in the round, without limiting it to performance or any differences between the available versions, all absolutely equivalent. It must also be said, for the sake of news and respect, that Chariot is an indie title, but it doesn't really come from below. With hundreds of employees, Frima Studio is an extremely solid reality on the North American scene; in addition, specific funds allocated by the Canadian government for digital culture intervened to help the team in the development. A great fortune, in short, that in other parts of the globe there is not only one parachute with which to soften the fall, but even two. Inspiring, fun, and fun to play together, Chariot is the ideal return to quality 2D Gamepads The GamePad screen fully supports off-screen play, thus guaranteeing the same view as the main video stream, including the HUD. On the other hand, there is no absolute support, within the adventure, of the stylus and therefore of the resistive touch. Was there more than once The playful, very light style used by Frima only serves as a glue to the gameplay. Sparkling enough to elicit more than a smile, the pop-fantasy novella tells of a now deceased King who in ethereal form dreams of reaching a tomb worthy of his greatness; to indulge his spectral desires his daughter and boyfriend. Simple assumptions that base their originality on a few successful lines of text, accompanying the protagonists along all 25 levels that make up the journey. Well yes, contrary to its DNA Chariot can boast of having a rather long and full-bodied adventure, absolutely above the average of almost all independent two-dimensional platformers. However, these are the cases in which it is necessary to evaluate the quality of the time spent, the ideas put in place, the goodness of the mechanics and the technical pleasantness of the campaign; it would be incorrect to recommend based purely on quantity, but luckily Chariot delivers on every promise. Considering the ability and technical versatility of Frima Studio in providing their titles with a physics engine modified for the occasion, it is not surprising to be faced with a gravity that is clearly unreal, but extremely functional to the gameplay. The playful heart of the title can be summed up quickly: each character can throw his own rope to grab one end of the chariot with the King's coffin inside, carrying it up and down, left and right, leaving it dangling by exploiting its weight, using it to reach high points and much more. There would be no satisfaction in doing each of these actions if there weren't a physics capable of returning correct feedback, thus allowing one to think about the evolutions to make the chariot perform to solve the puzzles, and luckily Chariot satisfies: the response to the commands is immediate, smooth, just and absolutely frustration-free. Walking with the dead The real pride of the Canadian work is an excellent level design: with an emphasis almost from other times and a passion reminiscent of Nintendo, the team supplies level after level very competent but above all amusing design solutions. There are many ideas condensed inside: the enthusiasm of completing the journey is accompanied by many small environmental puzzles scattered here and there, some accessories some not, in which to get lost and have fun, all characterized by a quick and therefore perfectly digestible approach from a diverse range of users. Thanks to the double movement track - on one side the protagonists on foot, on the other the chariot with wheels - Frima Studio skilfully blends elements of the level to often split the roads, push the interaction between the two protagonists in moving the chariot and obstruct the path with always new and spot-on ideas. Many sections have exitsand dungeons as well as collectibles and coins - to be defended from the attack of hostile fauna - which can be used to unlock new upgrades and equipment in the extra-scheme shop. It is also thanks to this gimmick that Chariot ensures intelligent back-tracking, by virtue of well-placed respawn points that do not force you to redo the whole level but put the choice in the players' hands whether to appear in advanced points. If you've noticed, until now we've always spoken in the plural, emphasizing how the soul of the title resides in the offline couch multiplayer: that's right, we reiterate it strongly since Chariot is a product that fully embraces the couch-play philosophy taking it to the extreme, for better or for worse. We are not saying that the game is poor in single, but it is undeniable that the construction of every centimeter has been proposed with the clear idea of two players who make physical proximity their means of communication of excellence. A noble, successful end, which therefore necessarily puts any single player approach into the background, even the most technical. The product is still enjoyable, but the presence of another player is the fulcrum around which the creative structure created by the Canadians revolves. On the technical side, Chariot defends himself very well. Well moved and inspired in the settings, sprites and drawings create a fabulous overall picture that denotes a clear step forward in indie animation in the field of two dimensions, although - we repeat - the production behind it is certainly not from the garage. The simplicity of the offer bears fruit in the external parts as well as in the interiors, perhaps illuminated by a torch, renewing a design cornerstone: in this videogame genre, art will always reign over technique. Something more could have been offered on the musical front: what Frima proposes is a set of ambient motifs in the background that raise their decibel level only in certain situations, leaving for most of the adventure with the sole company of the effects audio. A strange and short-sighted decision: the reflective nature of the title would have combined well with light but ever-present arrangements. To increase replayability, the game also incorporates many objectives, some even difficult, which will increase the hour counter for the most perfectionist.", "date": "2015-01-14", "grade": "8.3"}
