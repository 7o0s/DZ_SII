When the series debuted on the first PlayStation it drove millions crazy thanks to the ability to tear down walls and, in doing so, level entire levels to the ground; unlike the previous game, the sequel relied almost entirely on the narrative, but reducing the destruction failed miserably to attract the attention of the audience. Red Faction was no longer that game built around an original and technically surprising idea, it had instead transformed into an ordinary shooter. The flop soon made the series disappear under the sands of time until, about ten years ago, it was dusted off and reinvented for a return in style. Thus was born Red Faction Guerrilla, a reboot that focuses again on the most important feature of all, around which it builds practically 80% of its gameplay and which, guess what, immediately makes it jump to the top of each ranking. However, history repeats itself and Red Faction: Armageddon, a sequel to Guerrilla, makes the exact same mistakes of the second disastrous game. The result? Red Faction disappears again. What can we learn from this lesson? Simple: if your game is famous for a feature, it's really stupid to reduce it or even eliminate it altogether. another Brick in the Wall With Red Faction it is even more serious that this happens because the destruction that can be left along the way has no equal, to the point that replaying this remastered version leads you to strange and conflicting sensations: on the one hand there is a game that clearly has ten years on the back, on the other a physics that takes center stage and that still today manages to surprise and amuse almost as much as that first day a long time ago. The Switch version examined here, with the usual technical reductions, stands up with dignity, especially if you enjoy it in portable mode where Red Faction Guerrilla immediately appears sharp and very fast, totally free of frame rate uncertainties. The first few minutes with the Switch in your hands are really pleasant, surprisingly pleasant, but problems are not long in coming. Although it is extremely easy to change weapons, jump between Martian rocks and drive the different vehicles available, the lack of some features that we take for granted today in the success of an action console weigh so much during the numerous shootings that they also demolish the fun, not just hangars and towers that Red Faction: Guerrilla is full of. It goes a little better with the Pro Controller, while things improve markedly with the function that allows you to aim with the gyroscope, but one does not always want to or it is a viable solution, you know it better than us. There is another problem in gunfights and in handheld mode: the color palette is so flat that enemies cannot be seen. Not even ironsight, the viewfinder, helps us, and so we die often and unjustly. This, we repeat once again, is a problem that mainly affects portable mode. We often die, we said, and death takes us with it towards two other problems of this remastered: the uploads are a little too long, and a mission design that imposes the usual introduction and the usual possible journey to the destination on each attempt. Martian desert By managing to overcome these obstacles, you have hours and hours of controlled destruction ahead of you, and we assure you that there is no moment in which taking down a building with a few targeted explosive charges does not transmit that thrill full of orgasmic satisfaction. The game is then full of challenges in which this feature is put at the center of attention, to be used exactly as in a wonderful puzzle game. The physics that regulates the destruction of the scenario also enriches the driving phases with an unexpected but absolutely welcome realism, we are really almost at the levels of the best. Surprisingly, we didn't find the repetitiveness of the open world mechanics a problem - you can see, feel and play that the formula here was still fresh and used with an ingenuity that makes it much more acceptable than in other more recent games; after all we are here, pad in hand, to pull down Martian constructions also fighting for the revolution, and we don't want to do anything other than this. The remastered here, like the original game, includes an online mode that we remember little more than mediocre ten years ago, and which in this case we have not yet had the opportunity to try due to a chronic lack of players. Don't worry, if there is something more to say about it, we will not fail to keep you updated! Finally, but not in order of importaction, many bonus missions and a new mode designed for local multiplayer and called Demolition Teams in which, in turn, up to four players will be able to challenge each other in a long series of timed tasks, in the vast majority of cases naturally focused on destroying everything in the least amount of time. possible time.", "date": "2019-07-03", "grade": "7.0"}
