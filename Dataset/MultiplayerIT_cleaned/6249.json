For the new edition of the game, therefore, we can speak of a flying start, of the consolidation of a project that has undoubtedly borne fruit (see the over 4.5 million downloads) and which, moreover, arrives on the App Store, Google Play and Windows Store at a reduced price, in this case 2.99 euros for unlocking the full version via in-app purchase. The structure has remained the same, with the possibility of playing a quick race, an entire championship, tackling the new Time Attack mode or the Challenge (in which we will be able to compete against other users' ghosts), selecting timings and navigating the menus to activate assisted braking or not, one of the elements which, especially during the early stages, can make the difference in making the experience accessible to all, experts and novices. Naturally, the protagonists of the competition change, with an updated list of drivers, teams and tracks to ride during the day or in the evening, depending on the situation, with the unfailing goal of crossing the finish line first. Will we succeed this time too? SBK15 Official Mobile Game follows last year's excellent edition to offer us a solid experience Always consistent There aren't many driving games on two wheels, in the mobile sector, and therefore the commitment made by Digital Tales to obtain the best possible performance of the races in SBK15 Official Mobile Game is surprising. As mentioned, the new edition of the game starts from the solid foundations of what we saw last year, and shines in particular with regard to the control system, which by default uses the accelerometer and the touch screen to respectively determine the inclination of the motorcycle, the accelerator (right) and the brake (left). The fluidity of a technical sector of excellent workmanship, well detailed even if lacking in certain situations (see the animations of the collisions, a bit hasty), ensures great precision in the response to stimuli, with the device that does not require excessive inclinations and that therefore it is able to offer a relatively comfortable experience, also open to further fine-tuning. The other eight presets field only the touch screen or additional variants, so as to really satisfy everyone. During the races this aspect of the game makes itself felt quite a lot, allowing you to ring in precision overtaking, brush the curves and avoid unwanted contacts, which unfortunately give life to not exactly exciting cross-sections, in which the technical limits of the product come to the surface, such as already mentioned. Undoubtedly the fault of a physics that seems to have remained rather ~light~, unable to convincingly communicate the weight of our vehicle and of the others in the race, but we are actually talking about nuances. If we really want to criticize SBK15 Official Mobile Game, we can say that the innovations compared to the previous edition are a little too small and that it would have been appropriate to be more daring from this point of view, rather than giving fans a simple update, leaving the very valid contours unchanged. The possibility that in some time an update will arrive to shuffle the cards a bit, however, bodes well in terms of variety on offer, because the risk of becoming fossilized is real.", "date": "2015-06-24", "grade": "7.8"}
