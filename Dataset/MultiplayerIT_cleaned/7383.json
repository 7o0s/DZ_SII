A writer takes his family (wife and son) on vacation to an isolated house. Dan Kaplan, this is his name, is experiencing a moment of profound personal crisis, due to the most classic of evils that can afflict those who do his job: a creative block. In short, he can no longer write anything that satisfies him and the novel he has in mind does not seem to want to take shape. From this stalemate also derive the problems of the wife, a painter dissatisfied with herself and with the relationship with her husband, and of the son, a child who particularly suffers from loneliness and who would like to have more attention from his father. As an entity who lives in the Kaplans' vacation home, a place of escape that should help them overcome the crises they are going through, we players have the task of observing family life, discovering everyone's personal needs and deciding from time to time which one to please or, to put it as in the game, which compromise to accept. As? The procedure is really very simple, more than you might think. Each decision you have to make represents a chapter of the game. Wandering through the house, one must look for documents (letters, notes, drawings) and one must interact with the Kaplans by reading their thoughts and penetrating their memories. In this way you will access their emotional states and become aware of their needs. While these cheerful activities are taking place, it is important not to be seen: under penalty of being unable to read the thoughts of those who have identified us. To do this, you have to go around the house jumping from one light to another (lamps, ceiling lights, abat-jours and so on), trying to stay out of sight of the Kaplans, meanwhile intent on living their lives. Nothing complicated, even if in the advanced chapters many lights will be turned off, making travel more difficult. Once the needs of the whole family (or at least one of the members) have been discovered, it will be necessary to look for one of the three objects that represent the way to satisfy them and, in the middle of the night, whisper in Dan's ear what he must do to proceed. This will close the chapter and you will be able to see the consequences of your actions. It is clear that the joy of one will produce the frustration of the other two, who have not seen the desired compromise achieved. Continuing the adventure, the chain of choices suggested to Dan will produce different effects on the life of the family, up to the ending which will be different depending on the decisions taken. The Novelist is about creative blocks and family dramas that develop in the folds of life Storytelling-focused video games have certain duties to the player. Most important of all is to enthrall them with the story being told. And here we know we are opening Pandora's box of discussions, given that each of us, by culture and life, reacts differently to contact with a work. In the case of The Novelist we are faced with an intimate and minimalist story, but often too predictable in its implications. The system of choices leads to asking some big questions about life: is it more important to feed and satisfy the natural selfishness of each individual, risking ruining relationships with the people around him, or can he be made happy just by giving space for those close to him? Is it right to sacrifice affection for a career? But beyond that, there are some shortcomings. In the first place, the very nature of the choices ends up showing all the limits of the system, very similar to that of a game book. As we said, the game is divided into chapters in which you have to decide which of the three protagonists to satisfy. The problem is that, apart from a few details, the subsequent chapters will not really be affected by what happened before. The player is asked to choose from time to time based on the sympathy he feels for the three. There isn't a right choice to make but convexly, there isn't a wrong choice either. This awareness leads us to approach the game in a paradoxical way. Examining the wishes of the three, it is easy to discover that they all have legitimate and partly shareable dreams and ambitions. But precisely for this reason it becomes impossible to make a choice that is not dictated by mere sympathy, that is by the selfishness of the player who will end up trying to project his expectations into play, hoping that they will find adequate satisfaction. Unfortunately this is exactly what happens, that is, one is never disappointed by one's choices and one gets more or less what one expects by taking them. The more cynical could also decide not to decide and replay The Novelist three times, favoring the characters in turn in modo to see the various aspects of the story. It seems to us a somewhat poor result for a title that would like to make the player's emotional participation the core of him. The omniscient entity led by the player ends up becoming more of a mischievous and moody presence than the characters themselves; in fact indifferent to their fate because he is aware of being able to satisfy whoever he wants, without having to please everyone. Was this the desired effect?", "date": "2013-12-26", "grade": "6.0"}
