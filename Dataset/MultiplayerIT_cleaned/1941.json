{"name": "Iron Storm", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/iron-storm_b.html", "text": "From Beta to Final: What's Changed. It must be said that Iron Storm has been advertised on many sites in the sector and all have highlighted the ~what if~ setting based on the extension of a First World War that reached until 1964, the date in which we take over with our gallant hero of the situation. Compared to the latest beta version we have received, we can say that the game has improved a lot in terms of fluidity, given and considering that the drop in framerate, felt above all in the ~hottest~ situations and resulting from the presence of multiple opponents shooting at the same time, has disappeared Almost all. I want to underline the ~almost~ because the graphics engine of the game, although it excels in the architecture of the maps (created with a number of polygons equal to the bare essentials) and the side effects (lens flare, sleet, etc...) is flawed partially precisely in the context of the opposing bots, which also show a certain ~woodiness~ of movement and an AI (artificial intelligence) equal to the most marked deficiency. From this point of view, little has changed since the beta version, and this demonstrates once again that AI is precisely the fulcrum around which the success or failure of a title built mainly on singleplaying is based, such as it's IronStorm. In fact, every position and movement of the opponents is based on a scripting that follows a well-defined process and not at all ~variable~, apart from the firefight, where the bot instantly ~decides~ the best tactic to try to counter human ~ingenuity~. It's a pity that most of the time the adversary behaves like a real ~sadomasochistic-suicide~, walking around all happy and bold in front of the roaring and sentence-spitting mouth of our beautiful machine gun, which shows no mercy for fools! The only times that the enemy implements an all in all discreet tactic, it is only in well defined and pre-established points of some areas, which are usually bordering the corners of the trenches or behind some ruined wall. All this seems very little to what was advertised in the preparation phase by the PR (public relators) of 4XStudio, who had praised this aspect of the game, and which now appears to us in all its true nature of a missed shot. I know that the software house in question has sinned a little bit of presumption and superficiality on this aspect, but so much so that not all donuts come out with a hole. In the six levels that make up the game, almost half prove to be real ~building blocks~ in their persistent tediousness, ascertained that there are very few differences found in the first two levels: a long and winding trench, which in the open or stormy sky, at dusk or at night, underground or among the ruins of casemates and churches, the usual and shuffled... corridor! I understand that the setting follows the background hand in hand, but a certain variance, especially in the first levels, was a must, at least for the supporters and lovers of ~let's see what happens next~. It is precisely in the initial stages that the stimulus to play is lacking and one is repeatedly tempted to abandon the game and uninstall it, but if one manages to resist long enough, the long and winding trench gives way to cities ruined by the bombings , full of snipers with tanks in support stationed at the crossroads, entire bunker-like enemy bases built underground, military trains to be sabotaged, chemical-nuclear energy production centers saturated with sentinels guarding the plants, etc... What you don't expect. The original touches also exist in IronStorm: apart from the excellent workmanship of the weapons, they have the right badness and a great mix of style between 1st W.M./2nd W.W. and Vietnam, what you don't expect comes out: a novelty in the selection of bombs (whether they are grenades, smoke bombs, mines, etc...). In fact, to launch the bomb, a short animation ~rests~ the main weapon on the shoulder with the right hand, while the much mistreated left hand holds the bomb, with the addition of the mouth (!) to snatch the safety catch, if any! All this gives a real swashbuckling look (it is visible in the third person or by an opponent in multiplayer). The mechanism causes a bit of confusion at the beginning (you start cycling the weapons at random in moments of greater excitement), but then you get used to it. Another positive aspect of the game is the multiplayer mode, although the maps and modes can be counted on the fingers of two hands (four maps for deathmatch and four for capture the flag) and the content is taken verbatim from what is present in singleplaying . The modalities are the classic ones: deathmatch, teamdeathmatch, capture the flag and an ~isolation case~, which consists in finding a validgia (with attached sound beep for research) and transport it to the opposing base. Except that the suitcase appears randomly on the map - and sometimes even on unreachable places! -, it would be the shameless copy of Team Arena's ~one flag capture~ mode. The excellent construction of the weapons adds up to the solidity of the netcode (the ~Mad Max~ look of the machine-gun and rifle-gun is wonderful, and the smoky trail released by the bazooka projectile, which uses the particle engine of the game, is truly superlative , also exploited for the spectacular effect of the poisonous spirals released from the cans). It's all these details that add several points to the graphics, but they certainly don't fill the weakness of the AI present in singleplaying. Obviously the few multi-maps have been set up for ~large~ groups (no less than six players, given their size) and a classic ~one-on-one~ is not recommended if you don't want to turn a deathmatch into a ~treasure hunt~. In conclusion. Iron Storm is a title with an exceptional background, reflected by a skilful use of textures, which manage to fully recreate the style of an era consumed by an ~almost~ eternal war. If you have the patience (and the right incentives) to overcome the first two levels, in the following ones there is the best of the game, whose graphic peak is reached with a ruined Wolfenburg recreated with a very particular post-holocaust style. The only real discordant note is the poor AI that affects a large part of the playability, without mentioning the poor animations that distinguish the computer-controlled characters (they look like many pinocchios, although they are woody in their movements). The various cutscenes were created by mixing the output of the game's graphics engine with an external 3D program, they have a good direction, but the facial poses of the characters seem to have been created taking inspiration from the mannequins of the Standa! Overall, the interludes manage to create the right environment, which surrounds the progress of the game. The multiplayer, on the other hand, is successful, but only thanks to the ganasso-style weapons. However, it was preferable to have a greater number of maps with smaller dimensions, rather than a few but dispersive ones like the current ones. Finally, since the code is not ~open~ to the mappators (no tools or editors have been released so far to create maps and/or mods on their own), the only alternative remains the possible release of bonuspacks from the parent company. But nothing has been leaked on the subject yet. Iron Storm isn't evil, but it doesn't even remotely reach the quality level of its other more famous competitors (Mohaa, Sof2, etc...). If I had to come up with a rating and stay ~wide~ I'd give it a six and a half. But even with this rating it seems destined to fall into oblivion of games to be left on the shelf to collect dust immediately after it has been completed (if you don't get bored before.). Premise For the background, the storyscript and the contents of the game in question, you can very well refer to the preview of the beta, published a few weeks ago. In this review, we will basically deal with the changed and/or improved aspects, compared to the previous release released for print.", "date": "2002-11-12", "grade": null}
