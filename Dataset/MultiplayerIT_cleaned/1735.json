The various stages are tackled in sequence, and you can move to those that have already been completed via a convenient map (at Super Mario World, so to speak). Aside from the question of replaying levels to get high scores, going back to your home (Pac Land) opens up many interesting possibilities for you, including that of playing the very first episodes of Pac Man in a coin-op version. To do this, of course, you'll need tokens... As expected, at the end of each setting you'll have to face a different boss, using the useful tips you'll get from time to time. Your character can jump and kick, or bounce on the ground (both attack maneuvers), or even charge a run that transforms him into a kind of marble, useful both against some enemies and to pass certain points in the levels. The settings present numerous ideas for you to take advantage of practically every feature of Pac Man: in some cases you will have to cling to handholds, or bounce on springs to reach disproportionate heights, or even throw yourself from one platform to another with a certain precision. The enemies you will meet along the way are generally animals, while the famous ghosts will only show up when you can swallow one of those particular energy pills, which allow you to devour them. On several occasions, the developers have seen fit to pay homage to the first Pac Man, making you go around mazes full of balls, chased by ghosts. Furthermore, every now and then you will also be able to access subgames that repeat the formula even more faithfully, proposing a real renewed version of the original 1980 coin-op. Technical analysis The graphics of Pac Man World 2, together with its game structure, is the strong point of this product. However, it is not free from flaws: decidedly well-finished settings moved by a well-made engine are contrasted by an at least ~uncomfortable~ camera management, which sometimes hinders you in delicate situations, and some ~minor~ but they turn up their noses. As for the latter, I am referring in particular to two situations: the animation of Pac Man (jerky) when loading a level and the graphic representation of when the character ~eats~ the ghosts: instead of both, it simply appears a score. If it's a precise choice, I'd say it's not very successful, because it undermines (albeit slightly) an otherwise impeccable creation. The sound sector is average: some ~classic~ effects have been taken as expected (do you remember Super Mario Sunshine?), the new ones are good and the music simply does not bother. One could classify this aspect of the game as ~functional~ and nothing more. As for longevity, PMW2 offers a rather high number of levels and a perhaps simplistic but far from ~simple~ approach ... seeing is believing. Concluding... Pac Man World 2 is an excellent platformer and can count on the popularity of a character who has always been an icon of video games. The background of the characters and settings seems to me to be successful, and the programmers have done an excellent job as far as gameplay is concerned: the collisions are precise and the jumping system is ~elastic~ enough not to be frustrating. If the large number of levels guarantees a good longevity for this title, there is also its defects to consider: we are not dealing with a product of who knows what thickness, even if its qualities make up for some defects that from time to time they make themselves felt even too much (the management of the virtual camera). Ultimately, I would say that the new Namco platform is proposed as a valid and fun product, to be considered especially if you need a light-hearted and light-hearted game. Pros: Excellent graphics Rather playable Texts in Italian Cons: Improved visual management Sometimes even too demanding Some questionable graphic choices Some like it round When the first Pac Man came out, I was far too young to elect him as a personal icon. It's a different matter for Pac Land, which represented something very important to me... I don't remember how many times I got hand cramps to make those ~long jumps~, for which it was necessary to move the joystick like madmen forward and backwards. Pac Man World 2, to my delight, offers the same atmosphere as Pac Land, and it is no coincidence that it is proposed as an ideal sequel to the old onethe coin-op series. Here Pac Man is a character in the literal sense of the term, with a whole background of friends (even even a dog... round) and enemies to accompany him. The plot of the game, introduced by a well-made and very nice animated sequence, shows the classic ~ghosts~ who wander around Pac Land and find an imposing tree with golden fruits. They begin to collect them and play with them, not knowing that in doing so they have freed an evil and powerful being from their imprisonment: Spooky. Pac Man's task is to find all the golden fruits and put the seal back in place, through six environments divided into numerous levels.", "date": "2003-03-03", "grade": null}
