{"name": "Fury - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fury-recensione.html", "text": "The online gaming sector has undergone a marked surge for some years thanks to the advent of champions of the caliber of World of WarCraft and Guild Wars, which have attracted millions of players and brought many users closer to the world of online mass titles. Fury unlike the titles mentioned, stands out for the choice of aiming exclusively at hard and pure combat. In fact, there is neither a plot, nor missions, and the development of the character takes place by fighting against other users. Once you start the game, your only avatar choices are gender, physical appearance, and server. Having taken control of the character, an exhaustive tutorial (in English like the whole game and the manual) introduces the control system and skills. The next step involves choosing one of the four schools, which in turn include two classes for a total of eight. Each of these has 7 skills available immediately, which allow you to perform melee and ranged attacks, heal, strengthen yourself or weaken enemies. Some particularly powerful abilities require others to be used a certain number of times to be activated. An interesting aspect is the absence of mana, which added to the fact that almost all skills have a recharge time of 1 second, makes battles fun as well as spectacular. Furthermore, if for some reason the basic skill set does not go well, in no time at all it will be possible to change class without any penalty. Endless battles Being an exclusively online fighting game, knowing the skills perfectly, discovering the ones that best suit your style is a fundamental step. Accumulating victories upon victories, gold and fame are acquired, which can be used to improve equipment and learn new skills (400 in all) from the many masters scattered around the map. Fury is a game where experience gained in battle is worth its weight in gold and when you find yourself in front of an avatar fully dressed in his heavy armor, you can rest assured that he has sweated the proverbial shit. There are three different game modes, which include not only the typical team deathmatch, but also a variant of ~capture the flag~, where you will have to bring crystals to your base (with the possibility of stealing them from the opposing one) and battles for the conquest of the opponent's fortress, involving up to 64 players per team. The fights in Fury are extremely fast and maximize team play, forcing you to move in groups and coordinate to best combine skills. Moving and jumping, skills have less effectiveness, which leads to not neglecting melee. Compared to the beta some time ago, there has been the inclusion of power-ups in the maps, essential for obtaining bonuses in attack or for restoring one's health. It is a choice that undoubtedly makes the battles more lively and by opting for the subjective view, one almost gets the impression of being in a fantasy version of Quake 3 Arena. Thorny issues Comment Fury has a love-it-hate-it play pattern. The frenzy of the fights and the particular gameplay make it an attractive product which, however, for the moment is not yet mature at the right point both from a technical point of view (the graphic system must be optimized) and in terms of its basic structure. Still, the experiment is interesting and worth a look. Pros Fast-paced battles Original game structure Spectacular graphics... Cons ...but quite heavy Only fights Uninspired models and environments PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium IV 2 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB (2 GB with Windows Vista) Video Card: GeForce 4 with 128 MB of Ram Disk Space: 11 GB Recommended Requirements Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD equivalent RAM: 1 GB (3 GB with Windows Vista) Video Card: GeForce 7600 with 256 MB memory Disk Space: 11 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo Processor 1.66 GHz RAM: 2 GB DDR2 Video Card: GeForce 7300 with 256MB of memory Fury is available for PC.", "date": "2007-11-30", "grade": null}
