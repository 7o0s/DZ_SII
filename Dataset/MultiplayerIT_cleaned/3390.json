Difficult to find, in the gaming world , a most beautiful representation of the alliance between Sonic and Mario as a paradigm of the Olympic spirit, which should unite the different countries for a meeting and a competition based on the principles of sportsmanship, friendship and fairness. We therefore find ourselves faced with this strange combination on the occasion of the new video game officially licensed by the Olympics, which arrives on the market to tell the truth with an almost bizarre time advantage, considering that the sporting event will only be held in seven months, but evidently Nintendo and Sega have estimated that it was better to take advantage of the favorable autumn period rather than the towing effect of the sporting event, for which there is always time anyway. In its strangeness, the creation of the Mario & Sonic series was a rather brilliant idea: considering that in the current gaming market there is no room for a sports simulation on the old Track & Field style, but also that an important license like that of the Olympics would be wasted without an official video game, Sega and Nintendo had the excellent intuition to exploit it to re-propose the classic multi-event sport but with a much more marked characterization. In fact, many of the individual disciplines proposed by the game do not deviate too much from the principles of the old Epyx and Konami games, but the application of the characters from the Mario and Sonic series allows for an imaginative approach, with clear digressions from the realism of the simulations and particular and amusing interpretations. The large number of disciplines present allows for a considerable variety of gameplay, partially compensating for the fact that every single event is essentially based on the obsessive repetition of the same inputs, but to all this in Mario & Sonic at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games we must also add very interesting news, consisting of the story mode and the introduction of the retro style. Between past and present Put it all together, Mario & Sonic at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games looks like a real cornucopia of content to play, obviously all of which can also be tackled in multiplayer, which makes the offer truly rich and potentially lasting. If you consider the possibility of multiplayer ~on the fly~ typical of Nintendo Switch, this potential increases further, increasing the value of the collection. The peculiarity of this chapter of the series is the fact that it offers a story mode which in fact represents a real alternative game, or rather a game within the game, which considerably expands the disciplines in which to engage and the situations proposed on the screen . The story is obviously very simple and not exactly of great interest, but in addition to gradually revealing the various sports disciplines, it also offers a series of retro-style mini-games and well-made pixel graphics. It all starts with Eggman and Bowser teaming up to play a bad joke on Mario and Sonic, managing to imprison them in a sort of parallel dimension thanks to a mysterious console but ending up with them by mistake, inside the screen. The four, together with other extras, thus find themselves projected back in time, precisely during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, an event in which they obviously decide to participate. In this way, the single player offers a roundup of sporting events and diversified digressions that alternately follows the protagonists in the present, whose events are represented with standard 3D graphics and those that ended in the past, with the episodes of the latter shown with a fascinating 8 and 16-bit style 2D representation. All the various events, sports or derivatives, accumulate in the Game Room, thus allowing them to be replayed at any time. The product also does not give up some didactic ambitions: scattered around the levels, which are in turn arranged on maps similar to those typical of the Mariesca tradition, there are documents and historical references that provide information and details on the Olympics and in particular the two Tokyo editions of 1964 and 2020. The digital olympics The strong point of Mario & Sonic at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games is probably the abundance of its contents and the variety of game solutions, given the presence of about 30 disciplines in which to try in total, to which are added the mini- multi-event game taken from the story mode. Among these possibilities, someare completely new to the series such as Karate, Climbing, Surfing and Skateboarding, all reproduced in a rather convincing way. Obviously, as befits the world of Mario and Sonic, we shouldn't expect particularly realistic simulations but rather purely arcade approaches to the various sports disciplines, which are in any case reproduced in their basic elements and in broad terms according to the rules set by the Olympics (except in the cases of ~dream events~ which represent more marked digressions on the basic theme). Beyond the possibility of playing single or multiplayer games (the latter is certainly the choice that guarantees the greatest involvement and challenge rate, of course) a fundamental element of differentiation of the gaming experience is given by the selection of the game system control: most sports can in fact be tackled using the Joy-Con motion sensors or with sticks and buttons in the traditional way. In the first case we are faced with sportsmen who recall Wii Sports (but more structured), with the possibility of moving and waving in gestures that more or less faithfully replicate the gymnastic exercises. The second case brings everything a bit closer to the historic tradition of Track & Field-style arcade sports simulations, with the competition usually deriving from pressing the keys with the right timing. A special case is then represented by team games such as football and rugby, which offer experiences more similar to traditional simulations even if extremely simplified and always based on the arcade spirit. To act as a glue to the various sporting experiences, the Story mode introduces various levels that replicate situations and movements typical of the disciplines but placing them within different and bizarre contexts, following the crazy story of the protagonists grappling with the sudden changes in time between the 1964 and 2020 Olympics. A buffet of games Every single discipline is a short burst of gameplay that wears out quickly, except for some sports that require a little more time such as team sports, but the sense of Mario & Sonic at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games is precisely to provide short samples of the game , taking full advantage of the abundance of available solutions. In the approximately 30 mini-games present, between sports disciplines and imaginative digressions, there really is something for all tastes: the fast and spectacular performances of skateboarding, surfing and dream running (all three particularly convincing) for example, the competitions of skill in archery and target shooting, the close competition of karate, boxing and fencing or the challenges of precision and timing in the various types of track or throwing sports. It cannot be said that the game is fossilized on the same gameplay dynamics, even if obviously it is easy for a single discipline to quickly get bored if it is tried several consecutive times, given the minimalism of the individual micro-mechanics. The best way to enjoy Mario & Sonic therefore remains to switch quickly from one experience to another, as in front of a sort of buffet with videogame appetizers, light and delicious but which invite you to consume them one after the other until we are well satiated. As if the abundance of game situations weren't enough, to these we must also add the methods of use, which include various types of multiplayer and control systems. As a fundamental addition, online multiplayer is finally available, which in a title of this type can simply represent vital oxygen, even if the netcode in more agitated situations is still to be evaluated. The fact of being able to choose between the traditional control system and the one based on motion detection, thanks to the Joy-Con, introduces, as we have said, a further level of variation in the gaming experience, even if it must be said that motion sensing is not always precise and sometimes makes the action confusing. The graphic style remains the cheerful and colorful one that we have already seen in the previous chapters of the series, however succeeding well in the difficult attempt to unify the different styles of the world of Mario and that of Sonic into a whole that is surprisingly cohesive. The continuous alternation between the modern dimension with its 3D graphics and structure and the Tokyo 1964 setting with the use of old-fashioned 8 and 16-bit bitmaps is a touch of class that manages to liven up the experience a bit also in visual terms as well as gameplay, representing a really good idea.", "date": "2019-11-05", "grade": "7.8"}
