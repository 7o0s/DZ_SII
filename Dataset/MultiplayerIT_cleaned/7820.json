But hadn't we defeated them definitively by driving them back from the hole in the universe they had come from? How did they get back? What do they still want? Our technology? Our women to create a hybrid race? The Nutella? Ah, you say they only ever want our cores? But what will they have so beautiful that they will travel hundreds of light years to come and destroy them? Will doing so guarantee our conquest? And were we stupid enough to center our entire military apparatus around balls of light, even if they were poorly protected? You see what it means to save money on the design phase and hire the engineer who conceived the Death Star... Never be, however! Why don't they bomb us like all intelligent creatures in the galaxy would and instead just march along? They may be aliens, they may have been able to reach us from the farthest reaches of the universe, they may even look terrifying, but they are a bit idiotic. What then, so many efforts to take over this planet and have not studied our customs at all, otherwise they would know that it would be enough for them to make random promises and launch new television programs to keep more than three quarters of the population quiet. Let's try not to tell them, come on, otherwise their mission would become all too easy. Sanctum was in many ways a surprise, one of the few tower defense capable of renewing the now stale formula of the genre, made so by an innumerable amount of soulless clones made everywhere, especially in the mobile sector. The idea was to mix defense through defensive structures and scenario manipulation, with a first-person shooter. The purpose was to protect energy cores from alien attacks that proceeded in waves of increasing intensity. Although it was Coffee Stain Studios' first game, it proved to be really solid and well done, even in the use of the Unreal Engine 3.0, an engine that few other independent titles have managed to exploit in the same way. The release was a success, fueled by the steady release of additional content and various special offers that followed over time. Then Sanctum 2 was announced: same engine, same genre, same mix of elements. Will he be able to repeat the original? Extreme defense The first differences are noticeable at the beginning: Sanctum 2 has a richer structure than its predecessor. In addition to offering more game modes, it also shows greater care for secondary aspects such as menus and graphic concepts, a sign of greater security from the development team (of course on PC they could also avoid talking about Gamertag... but not let's quibble). Once you have started the campaign and chosen one of the four available characters, all customizable, you are not immediately on the battlefield building structures. A short introductory sequence has been added to the beginning of each section to emphasize the presence of a storyline. In reality, as you should have understood by reading the introduction, it is the classic alien attack against the poor and helpless earthlings and soon we find ourselves faced with the usual nucleus to defend and the usual chessboard on which to build our defensive structures. The effort is still appreciable because it helps to immerse yourself more in the game, even if it is certainly not an essential or memorable addition. The gameplay itself has remained very similar to its predecessor, at least in appearance. After the construction phase, in which the collected resources must be used to generate defenses, we move on to the combat phase, in which we fight in first person against the aliens using the weapons selected before starting the map. Enemies come from different places and in ever-increasing numbers. The aim is obviously the one already described, that is to prevent it from reaching the nucleus. To do this, you must not only know how to shoot, but also understand how to slow them down by lengthening the distance they have to travel or by creating bottlenecks where it is easier for the turrets to riddle them with shots. Usually, in maps with multiple access points it is convenient, if possible, to merge the different channels into a single point, so as to be able to better control the movements of the enemies. Each turret is upgradeable. The way the developers have conceived to manage upgrades is really interesting: every resource spent on upgrading a turret increases its characteristics, even if it does not level up. So resources are never wasted. Real challenge Sanctum 2 is a difficult title. Damn difficult. Enemies attack relentlessly and in many situations turrets seem more like a way to soften them up than take them out.Then, as the levels go by, the access points will increase and playing alone it will become really difficult to cover them all effectively, to the point that the last area could be really frustrating without someone to accompany us. Compared to the first chapter, the focus has been shifted to the FPS part: now the player's ability to choose where to fight and which enemies to give priority to has become central. This has greatly favored cooperative gameplay, where players are forced to share building resources, even in the presence of a greater number of enemies. The games are open to allow other gamers to enter without knocking. In short, there is no mercy for anyone who doesn't want to collaborate, to improve themselves and to improve their character. In fact, many situations that initially appear desperate are greatly simplified by level growth, which allows you to unlock better defenses and personal weapons. The system is different from that of the first chapter, where growth was all concentrated in the game and required spending resources on weapons. Here there is a role-like system and everything that is brought to the battlefield must be selected before the start of the battle. In truth, the actual action is a little confusing and things get worse as more elements on the map increase. It is not uncommon to feel a certain disorientation and find yourself checking the minimap to understand where there is a need to intervene. In some cases it seems clear that you end up in the dust because perhaps the mission is designed for characters with better weapons, still to be unlocked, and therefore you find yourself playing just to level up, similar to what it happens in many MMOs. If desired, among the defects we could add a certain lack of direct information given to the player, but in reality it is enough to play a few maps to understand how everything works and be able to go by nose. For example, the range of action of the turrets is visible only by selecting them, but experience and a little brain are enough to understand which area will be covered or not, so we don't feel like weighing too much what would simply be a convenience in plus, in the long run useless (real gamers hate comfort, write it down somewhere). A tower defense mixed with a FPS, will it work or will it be just smoke?", "date": "2013-05-24", "grade": "7.8"}
