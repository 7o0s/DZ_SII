At the basis of this practice there may be very personal implications, a plethora of meanings filtered according to the sensitivity of the subject and his emotionality. Commonly associated with a feeling of joy, singing is understood as an excellent way to give a note of color and light-heartedness to one's daily life. Greg Lobanov must also think so, a young independent developer to whom we owe the creation of Wandersong, a singular 2D adventure that keeps a safe distance from patterns and trends dictated by the contemporary video game market. Specializing in content creation with GameMaker, the author originally from Philadelphia has created a work in which singing is interpreted precisely as the preferred means with which to represent the most genuine and spontaneous side of human nature. An essential tool and even a reason for salvation for all of creation. Lobanov said that the idea of making Wandersong arose following a long bicycle excursion: a journey over 5,000 miles long, covered on two wheels in the heart of the United States. This adventure enriched and changed him, stimulating him to create an interactive experience in which the positive facets of the human soul were highlighted. Starting from these premises - and from Kickstarter, where the game was funded in February 2016 - Wandersong became a reality in September 2018, when it debuted on PC and Nintendo Switch. Here we are going to talk about the PS4 version, freshly published on the pages of the PlayStation Store. Story of a young bard and his talent: singing Wandersong can be defined to all intents and purposes as a musical adventure, although the need to sing notes is only a means of telling a story and trying to convey a message to the user. In the guise of a young bard you are put in a position to generate pleasant and intoned sonorities; qualities not for everyone, which soon prove to be crucial for completing missions, puzzles and environmental puzzles scattered along the way, as well as for interacting with humans, animals and even other entities encountered during their incessant wanderings. In the initial stages of the story, the protagonist is informed of the fact that creation is about to be erased forever by the deity Eya, to be replaced by a completely renewed alternative reality. Determined to reverse the fate of a destiny that seems inevitable, our improvised hero decides to hit the road, armed only with a great willpower and his own innate singing skills. The mission? Get busy to put back together the pieces of a mysterious melody called Earthsong: the only one that, once sung, should avert the sad events that the world is going through. The singing skills available to the bard can be activated by the practical movement of the right analog stick of the pad, while the speaker integrated in the DualShock 4 is responsible for reproducing the sounds emitted by the protagonist. In these phases, a circular indicator is accessed, in which eight segments of different colors are accessible: each of them is associated with a different singing tone and it is sufficient to direct the lever in the desired direction to produce the desired sound. Despite the rhythmic nature of the gameplay, based on the concatenation of correct sounds for any type of interaction with the surrounding environment, Wandersong does not intend to offer the player a playful experience based on precision, as would happen if we were in the presence of a rhythm game. In other words, those who expect this kind of approach from the game may be disappointed. On the contrary Wandersong turns out to be a platform with very basic mechanics, where the dialogues with the characters encountered along the way and the resolution of any activity through singing essentially represent the only key elements of the gaming experience created by Lobanov. We are often asked to follow certain instructions to play melodies, but a great level of precision is not required to carry out each sequence correctly. Therefore, neither scores nor indicators are available which, when reset, require you to start a certain sequence over again. Conversely, if you end up at the bottom of a cliff during one of the more dynamic areas, you will end up restarting from the mostnearby, as the game is constantly updating the autosave. The most interesting mechanics are found in those situations in which singing allows you to influence the functioning of some elements located in the scenario. For example, it happens that you have to direct the stem of some flowers in various directions to reach portions of the path that cannot otherwise be explored; or again to use the air currents to push towards the other, to the right or to the left, changing the direction in step with the variation of the vocal tonality. And then there is the dance, which on the contrary has no other function than to give a touch of color and sympathy to the protagonist, who, continuing his journey, will have access to new variations that can be used at will, just for the sake of combining the I sing some healthy pelvic movement. Ultimately the singing experience concocted in Wandersong is just a useful pretext to present a 2D platform adventure by giving it a sui generis reading key within a stylized and colorful world. And it is precisely this last aspect that has not fully satisfied us. While winking at other more famous productions, the aesthetic component of Wandersong seemed to us too minimal and not very characterized from a purely artistic point of view, especially as regards the appearance of the characters. Also in this case the relative obstacle of the English language remains, since the game presents the original texts and without the presence of subtitles. Nothing prohibitive for anyone with a minimum of familiarity with the language, mind you, but we still preferred to warn you.", "date": "2019-01-23", "grade": "8.0"}
