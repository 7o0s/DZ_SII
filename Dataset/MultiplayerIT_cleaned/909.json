{"name": "Singles 2: Triple Trouble", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/singles-2-triple-trouble.html", "text": "Widen the round The situations presented in the various game modes take up the logical thread, and largely the characters, known in the first title. The ~story mode~ projects us into a situation that has already started with a series of relationships between the pre-existing characters, which force the player to follow a series of objectives to reach the final half. The level of relational complexity presented is very striking. For example, we may find ourselves in the situation of monitoring a boy who has just moved into an apartment inhabited by two girls. One of these is a pleasant, sexy and uninhibited ~friend~, while the second, in spite of ourselves, is the ex, furious at how the relationship between the two ended. Obviously to win the heart of the former it will be necessary to reconcile with the latter, exercising all the power and charm at our disposal. Supporting characters, such as friends and confidants, have a fundamental role in the development of the game, as it is necessary to maintain relations outside the couple to increase one's charisma and talents. As was already the case in The Sims, even in Singles 2 weight is given to the physiological management of the characters, who are much more influenced by basic needs such as sleep, fatigue, hunger. The management of couple relationships is extremely variable and complex. It is no longer a question of dealing with a single partner to know, but the possibility of embarking on more complex relationships, deep or short, to make true love blossom or form a perverse love triangle (or square?) based on betrayals. A sprinkling of RPG As already mentioned, the gameplay has undergone slight but substantial changes, especially in terms of managing the characters and their skills. Adding a pinch of RPG, the player is called to manage and develop the characteristics of the controlled characters, through the achievement of particular objectives. At the end of the day, the points earned by completing certain actions are distributed. These points can then be spent on various skills to impress partners and outwit the competition. By investing in certain areas of his training, the character will be more skilled in the game of seduction and will soon become irresistible towards the opposite sex. Or rather Towards the other partner, because in Singles there are no limits to sexual fantasy and everything is possible. Homosexuality is accepted like heterosexuality and there are no barriers that prevent the formation of couples of any kind. For this reason, flirting is successful based on the characteristics and level of ~social~ relationship between the two partners, gender is not considered and potentially every character is to be considered bi-sex. Class is not water Let's talk a little more about depth of play. As already mentioned Singles 2 is inspired by The Sims 2. You can see it in every detail, such as the management of the house, hygiene and leisure activities of the characters. The management of the house, the phases of construction and furnishing, affect the mood of the characters and the seduction of the partners. A well-furnished loft, with style and attention to detail, with refined furniture and expensive floors, can affect the ease of achieving the final goal. Work is another of the key features of the game. The character cannot abstain from carrying out his daily work, on pain of the practical impossibility of continuing with a normal life due to lack of money. If Singles focused only on the private aspect of domestic life as a couple, Singles 2 brings the introduction of social life, dating outside the home, occasional flirting. In fact, it is possible to visit nightclubs, or call friends on the phone to keep relationships alive. The technique The technical department has undergone a considerable development, producing a solid and lean title in the creation of 3D environments and details. Singles 2 can be considered the real first title of the saga, preceded by a good test made perhaps too hastily. Now the result of DeepSilver's efforts has translated into a mature product capable of competing with the major titles of the genre. The power linked to the ~spicy~ theme of the game is total, as there are currently no simulation titles capable of offering a totally uninhibited vision of the sexual sphere, amiably set aside in favor of fairness even in The Sims. The attraction to all that is taboo will then do the rest. We are faced with a title sure of the success of the previous one. The changes made and the introduction of a series of devices aimed at improving playability and versatilityities will guarantee a non-negligible success to this game. Definitely aimed at a mature audience, in a mix of sex and love triangles Singles 2 Triple Trouble will surely make you spend several hours of healthy and spicy fun. Pros: Revolutionized graphics engine, leaner and more flexible Playability finally appreciable Spicy and fun Cons: A few too many peeks at the neighbor's homework The Sims Some plots are particularly complicated to manage After the phantasmagorical and unexpected success of the first Singles, a new spicy DeepSilver title reappears on the simulation market. Singles, a game strongly inspired by the gameplay of the best seller The Sims, sets its fortune on the theme of the couple relationship. The power of this title is the absolute lack of inhibitions in the face of the burning issue of sex, the real cornerstone and fulcrum of the action. Going through the typical phases of courtship, the player is called to reach the final half and to catapult himself into a murky whirlwind of passions. If the first title lacked depth and seemed to be projected only to reach the final stage, without too many complications, Singles 2 reaches maturity by giving the game a more challenging and at the same time more fun aspect.", "date": "2005-06-21", "grade": null}
