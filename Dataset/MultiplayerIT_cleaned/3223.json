{"name": "Ib Remake", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ib-remake-recensione.html", "text": "There was a precise era, in the past five years ago, in which RPG Maker really gave the tools to all aspiring role-playing video game creators to vent their imagination and creative flair. It is no coincidence that RPG Maker has once again chosen to bind Nintendo Switch with a certainly unexpected remake of a very peculiar product from the beginning of the last decade. It goes without saying that independent games are benefiting enormously from the Nintendo hybrid: Switch has literally saved the passion of millions of older players and guaranteed income for an endless list of garage development studios. RPG Maker, which nominally was born to give fans the opportunity to create role-playing games, was actually a source of many independent pearls, not least the much talked about OMORI himself. Ib is another of those titles born in the underground of the network in 2012 and over time it has become a niche product, but with its own passionate following: today we welcome the arrival on Nintendo Switch of its revised and updated version, already present on Steam. Find out with us if it's worth savoring those atmospheres again in Ib's review. An unexpected exhibition Although whispered, Ib's game atmosphere conveys precise connotations Let's start with a big confession: we won't say much about Ib because, trivially, it's a very short game, as linear and essential in gameplay as it is original and creative in its solutions. The incipit is curious at the right point: in the role of the protagonist, we will find ourselves exploring an exhibition with our parents. The situation will very soon become more frightening and isolated than expected, leaving us to explore a labyrinth made of mysteries, obstacles and looking for a way out in every way. Compared to the aforementioned OMORI or a similar title such as Undertale, Ib remains a decidedly simpler game both in its visual style and in its gameplay and game design solutions: the choices adopted by the developer do not want to convince due to the depth of the play sector, rather to tell a short but relatively concentrated story, with some tricks that improve the final result. We are talking about a game with a rather narrow longevity, and which certainly lives on numerous playthroughs to discover the various endings and the many secrets of the game. The version that arrives on Switch can count on slightly modernized graphics compared to the original, additional content and in general a series of ~quality of life~ improvements in the management of puzzles that make the game absolutely more usable and dense, to the detriment of loss of that sense of raw pixels that clearly comes from such a strongly independent production. Ib's discomfort The cast of Ib doesn't go too far from the canons, but the character design still has its dignity Ib is a more refined, delicate and if we want less immediate game than other titles of similar caliber: it has a structure that pushes you to make more runs, however short; proposes a musical accompaniment that is not immediately striking, but grows over time, becoming an absolutely targeted background and fused with the story told; offers a gameplay voluntarily left out of the overall fabric can make Ib a rather particular proposal and not necessarily appreciated by everyone. Not much is known about Kouri, the mysterious creator of Ib, other than some rare information from his online blog in Japanese. So on the fly, if you asked us for any of his influences, we would say Kouri played - and was very impressed by it - a specific type of Japanese production between the late 90s and early 2000s: Clock Tower, Koun and the first Project Zero are perfectly fitting, models of clear inspiration. Although Ib is a title that frees itself from a gore key and based on scares, the sensation is of being faced with a precise desire: to create and bring to life an atmosphere capable of making one feel constantly uncomfortable, a concentration of elements place, a supernatural made up of abnormal situations in normal places. The version on Switch, in fact identical to the PC one even in terms of performance, is absolutely recommended, being improved compared to the original free version and still available. Its chosen game mode is certainly the one in portability, a bit the best way to enjoy many independent titles that want to do nothing but self-affirm themselves with honesty and humbly entertain the player. Kouri's proposal therefore remains quite current, despite the limited production levels and the fact that it carries more than 10 years of history with it. Oh yeah, it's been so many years already.", "date": "2023-03-12", "grade": "8.0"}
