{"name": "Psycho Killer Qu'est Que C'est", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/118854-borderlands-2-psycho-pack-psycho-killer-quest-que-cest.html", "text": "After the substantial batch of downloadable content that accompanied the months immediately following the release of Borderlands 2, Gearbox has taken some time to work on further material with which to enrich the already substantial playful experience of its cooperative shooter: in Waiting to be able to play on new scenarios with the fourth expansion scheduled for June, those who still hang out on the arid surfaces of Pandora can already experience the peculiar abilities of Krieg the Psycho, the new class available for download. So let's see how this bizarre character behaves... On the other side Gearbox's choice for this second extra class (the first was the Mechromante Gaige) is undoubtedly courageous, first of all for the pure and simple look of Krieg, very similar to the Psychos that every self-respecting Borderlands player has learned to eliminate at safe distance to avoid their powerful melee slash as well as attempted kamikaze attacks. It therefore makes a certain impression to have among the ranks of one's group a tall, muscular, bare-chested thug with his face covered by a mask and with a marked propensity for self-harm. And yes, because in addition to being comparable to his ~colleagues~ in the aesthetic aspect, Krieg is also in the behavior on the battlefield, proving to be a character indicated mainly to all those users who like to jump into the fray without thinking too much about the consequences. A first indication in this sense comes from the special ability that can be activated by pressing the right backbone, thanks to which it is possible to draw the devastating ax in the possession of the protagonist and use it alternatively to slash or throw it at more distant enemies: as for all the other classes of Borderlands 2, it is a feature that can be expanded in a substantially different way depending on the preferred skill branch, for example by reducing its very long reload times, allowing the restoration of energy during its execution or enhancing its damage with the 'adding explosives attached to the blade. Speaking of the three distinct paths in which to channel the points earned by leveling up, those reserved for Krieg by the Gearbox developers fully confirm the initial impressions of a character that is nothing short of extreme. The central branch, appropriately called Mania, is mainly oriented towards enhancing melee attacks, with skills that allow you to increase the damage of the blows by 250% or even to transform Krieg into a Psycho Tough, physically imposing but also and above all in terms of brute force. Among the many upgrades, the one that allows the character not to enter Fight for Life mode when health reaches zero stands out, instead allowing him to throw sticks of dynamite at opponents and rewarding him with an immediate rebirth if he manages to kill someone before the countdown ends. Bloodthirst is instead the name of the skill branch that can be viewed on the left of the screen, behind which you can find characteristics congenial to a more classic use of the arsenal at your disposal. Everything revolves around bonuses that can be accumulated by eliminating enemies in rapid succession with firearms, grenades or melee attacks: a path not recommended for particularly careless players, given that to maximize the benefits of the various skills it is necessary to constantly keep an eye on the icons that indicate which type of tool should be used to keep the damage multiplier running. What is certain is that dedication in this field is rewarded with particularly powerful advanced skills, such as the one that causes nova explosions to follow when killing enemies and which can cause frightening domino effects in the most crowded situations. The last - and craziest - branch of skill is called Infernal, thanks to which Krieg draws a whole series of advantages in setting himself on fire, from damage reduction to increasing the power of his attacks: also in this area there is no shortage of special abilities, such as those that allow you to spit flames or generate fireballs that invest enemies every time you get hit. Although Krieg is undoubtedly a breaking character compared to all the other Borderlands 2 classes, it is difficult not to see some forcings that make him a DLC that is undoubtedly less successful and attractive than the one dedicated to Gaige the Mechromante. The main paradox lies in the questionable effectiveness of a figure heavily biased towards melee attacks in a shooter in which weapons from ffire are an almost sacred element: playing as Krieg, you have to submit to rules that are completely different from the standards that have always been advocated by Gearbox, therefore attacking with your head down, aiming at the dilapidation of health rather than its preservation and above all taking into account the possibility to find themselves on the ground much more often than with a conventional class. It must be admitted that the idea of having a Psycho within one's group can be tantalizing, even if only for its propensity to attract the attention of enemies to itself by absorbing large amounts of damage: however, it did not seem like us to take on its role a particularly enjoyable experience precisely for the reasons listed above. Krieg's therefore appears as a not too successful experiment by the developers to completely overturn the typical conventions of Borderlands 2 gameplay, a task too onerous to be successfully completed by a single downloadable character, which moreover arrives when the game has now been out for seven months at an objectively exaggerated price.", "date": "2013-05-22", "grade": null}
