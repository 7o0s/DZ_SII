{"name": "Combattimenti aerei tascabili", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hawx.html", "text": "Just released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, HAWX represents together with the recent EndWar an attempt perpetrated by Ubisoft to push the boundaries of the Tom Clancy's series, until now the exclusive prerogative of action games with a first or third person view. In the game, as anticipated, we will take on the role of Captain David Crenshaw and we will experience the most intense years of his career, which will lead him to work for Artemis until the agency reveals its plans. It is an extremely similar product to the famous Ace Combat, even in the configuration of the controls, which however gets lost a bit in the implementation of the innovative elements that should have differentiated it from the Namco Bandai title. The result is a discreet shooter, which with greater attention to detail and certain aspects of the technical sector could become a point of reference for the genre, especially on the Sony console. The mobile reduction for Java-compatible devices has been entrusted to the expert hands of Gameloft, which for the occasion has decided to try its hand at one of the oldest and most fascinating videogame genres ever: vertical scrolling shoot'em-ups. Once the game has started, you must first choose the plane you want to fly among the four immediately available: the MIG-31 Foxhound is very fast but has ineffective weapons, which once upgraded make the range wider but only in a straight line; the Rafale C, on the other hand, is slow but powerful, with the bursts that, thanks to the power-ups, open horizontally and allow you to hit multiple enemies at the same time; the Eurofighter Typhoon is the most balanced aircraft between speed and power, with the shot that thickens thanks to the upgrades; finally, the Saab 35 Draken is also very balanced and boasts rather menacing cannons, which with a certain number of power-ups can really open breaches between the enemy ranks. Completing the nine stages that make up the game unlocks a further level of difficulty and also allows us to use new and more powerful fighters. In any case, ending the game is not exactly a walk in the park and sometimes it will be inevitable to resort to a ~continue~ to resume the action from the last stage reached. The gameplay of HAWX is classic shoot'em-up of this type, with formations of hostile vehicles moving across the screen in predetermined patterns, while firing at us at regular intervals. There is no shortage of bigger and harder enemies to take down, truly a tragedy to face if our weapons are not upgraded. In the lower part of the screen there are two bars, which load over time and allow us to resort to a ~smart bomb~ (0 key) or a barrage of homing missiles (* key). Fortunately, it is possible to set the autofire from the options, in order to control the d-pad with two fingers for greater control of the plane during the inevitable ~dodges~. In some situations, an alternative and spectacular action is offered to us, through a sort of ~bullet time~ or when you have to dodge buildings to reach the end of the stage. Usually mobile shoot'em-ups have stages that are all very similar to each other or even without differences, as well as uninspired enemies. From this point of view, HAWX is really excellent, with scenarios that are almost always different and often excellent in terms of design and attention to detail. The scrolling is fairly smooth, while the hostile vehicles move up and down, with some mediocre examples (the helicopters, some turrets) and some really well done (the bigger enemies and the bosses). Wanting to criticize the Gameloft product, it can be said that enemy fire is not always clearly distinguishable from the background, which can lead to unexpected deaths. Finally, the sound sector offers discreet music and some good sampled effects.", "date": "2009-03-24", "grade": "S.V."}
