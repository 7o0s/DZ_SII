Close this page and don't look back, because in the next few lines you will find spoilers galore, since we will talk openly about the ending: how could we not, if Re:Mind is essentially the revised and corrected ending of Kingdom Hearts III? And to say that the epilogue was one of the things we liked the most when we reviewed it last year: it closed the circle, answered many questions and raised others. It turns out that for Tetsuya Nomura, the creator of the series, that ending wasn't enough. He still had a few ideas in mind, while fans loudly complained about the absence of additional challenges and bosses worthy of Kingdom Hearts II's Organization XIII. Re:Mind therefore exists to satisfy these ambitions, but the result is an ambivalent and controversial experience. Re:Mind Once the software is installed, the first part of the DLC can be accessed from the Downloadable Content menu provided you have completed the game at least once. In fact, your final branded save will act as a springboard and you can use it to alternate loading your progress in the DLC or in the actual game: Sora is always the same and keeps the levels gained, the skills learned and the objects collected regardless from the game you want to load. If you decide to launch the DLC, however, you will start from your arrival at the Keyblade Graveyard for the final showdown with Xehanort and during the game of Re:Mind you will no longer be able to travel between worlds or retrace your steps. Should you realize that the challenge is too demanding, save the game and reload the normal game from the same save to power up Sora, perhaps obtaining the Keyblades added with update 1.07, Lucky charms and Distant memories. Having made this premise, let's try to understand what Re:Mind really consists of by reiterating that, from this moment on, we will talk openly about the Kingdom Hearts III ending. A year ago, in fact, the game ended with a final cinematic which, although moving and satisfying, did not answer some important questions. For example: how had Kairi come back, apparently killed by Xehanort just before the final showdown? And what happened to Sora, who disappeared before our eyes just before the end credits? Re:Mind does just that, in a sense: it fills in those holes and clarifies some aspects of the complicated plot imagined by Nomura. In doing so, however, the eccentric scenario writer ended up complicating even more a plot that had already become difficult to follow among a thousand spin-offs on different platforms. Nomura, in fact, resorts to the most trite and rehearsed trick of fantasy fiction: time travel. Determined to save Kairi from her sad fate, Sora discovers he can use the bonds he formed with his fellow adventurers to relive their last battles against Organization XIII and Xehanort. It is a cryptic narrative solution that hooks into the peculiar ~science fiction of the heart~ of Kingdom Hearts and which above all serves to add small details to the last few hours already played. In this sense, Re:Mind recycles a large part of the original game, making us face most of the bosses again, albeit sometimes in the role of the other Keyblade bearers such as Roxas, Riku and Kairi herself. The bosses can therefore prove to be slightly more challenging than in the original adventure, while for most of the time we find ourselves scrutinizing the new cutscenes in the hope that they will clarify some points in the story better. After passing the Keyblade Cemetery, you then return to Scala ad Caelum for the battle with the final boss, but even here the experience changes significantly. The splendid, gigantic city is now freely explorable, albeit completely deserted, except for the Heartless who will attack us from time to time: considering the short duration of the DLC, we would have preferred a greater possibility of interaction. At this point the plot takes off completely on a tangent and the game becomes a succession of fights and spectacular interludes that lead directly to a new final battle and a closing movie practically identical to the previous one, except for some unpublished frames of a certain importance. A little bit, for an additional downloadable content of 30 euros: it's good to start thinking about this aspect of the DLC right away, because it's decidedly important. Big Kingdom Hearts fans will be used to accepting the story by nowa for what it is, looking for Nomura's intricate logic in the connections between the various episodes and in the scenes before and after the credits. Re: Mind, however, in an attempt to clarify some obscure points, gets wrapped up in convoluted mechanisms that would rather justify Nomura's second thoughts about the direction that the franchise will take in the future. And those who have already peeked into the secret ending that is unlocked by completing the DLC 100% will probably be as confused as we are about the intentions of the historic producer of Kingdom Hearts. Limitcut episode However, Kingdom Hearts III Re: Mind does not limit itself to proposing a revised and corrected version of the ending, but also responds to all those fans who in Kingdom Hearts III have missed the memorable bosses faced in the prequels, especially in the second episode. The clashes between Sora and the various members of Organization XIII had certainly represented some of the highest moments in the series, and so Nomura also wanted to satisfy that slice of the public with additional content that is unlocked by completing the first part of the DLC and which appears in the Downloadable Content menu under the Limitcut Episode heading. A series of cinematics updates us on the situation a year after the end of Kingdom Hearts III: Sora is missing, but no one can find him. Terra, Ventus and Aqua are looking for him in the Realm of Darkness; Kairi has been put to sleep so that Ansem and his scientists can analyze her dreams for clues; Mickey and the others are scouring the worlds Sora visited before vanishing. It is at this point that the Final Fantasy characters re-enter the scene, albeit in an absolutely marginal way. In fact, Riku addresses the residents of the Radiant Garden whom we have not seen for many years: Leon, Aerith, Yuffie and Cid. It is the latter who finds, in the database of his computer, a series of digital copies of Sora and the members of the ~real~ Organization XII that the protagonist had faced in the past. Riku then deduces that by fighting them again, he could learn more about his friend's whereabouts. Let's also say that it is a really laughable pretext to allow us to face these bosses in the order we prefer, unlocking two more after defeating a certain number. They're opponents we've fought and defeated before - Vanitas, Xigbar, Larxene, and so on - but much, much more powerful, with all-new attack patterns, abilities, and pitfalls. In this sense, Square Enix has really outdone itself. Each boss is distinctly different from the others and often integrates peculiar mechanics, QTE mini-games or deadly desperate attacks that must be learned one Game Over at a time. The challenge is extremely challenging from the start and even on Standard difficulty you need strong nerves, great equipment and a good level of experience. Perhaps it is a challenge that is too demanding, especially designed for those who have explored the combat system and have not been afraid to face the game on Critical difficulty. This part of the DLC is completely ancillary, and story-wise it adds practically nothing, but it's definitely the best content of Re:Mind if you belong to that group of players who craved a bunch of difficult and spectacular bosses that could take hours and hours just trying to learn the right strategies. If it is a challenge that interests you marginally, or you are simply refractory to content with prohibitive difficulty, the Limitcut Episode probably will not justify the economic value of the DLC, also because, by defeating all the bosses, a Secret Episode is unlocked with the real final boss , an extremely difficult battle that rewards the player with a double secret cinematic that could give us a concrete clue about the future of Kingdom Hearts. Alternatively, you could always watch it on YouTube while entertaining yourself with another little extra unlocked together with the Limitcut Episode, and that is the Photo Greeting, even if it is only a simple extra mode that allows you to play with the characters, the graphic effects and the scenarios to take fun and imaginative photos.", "date": "2020-01-26", "grade": "6.8"}
