{"name": "The Sinking City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sinking-city-recensione.html", "text": "After years spent telling us about the exploits of Sherlock Holmes, Frogwares returns to the fray with The Sinking City, a new investigative experience that draws heavily on the fascinating and controversial horror imagery resulting from the works of the American writer H.P. Lovecraft. The game is preparing to debut on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, with the latter version becoming part of the exclusives planned on the Epic Games Store. The conversion for Switch was also recently confirmed, which however will not arrive before next autumn. In these last few days we have had the opportunity to enter the new interactive experience born by the Ukrainian team on foot, and after having thoroughly explored it we are finally ready to tell you about it in our inevitable review. Plot and references to the works of H.P. Lovecraft The Sinking City tells the story of Charles Reed; private investigator of proven reputation, the man has been plagued by disturbing visions for some time. The images stand out in his mind, leading him to lose consciousness of himself and of the world around him. Nightmares also haunt him on his boat trip to the city of Oakmont, Massachusetts, where he wishes with all his heart that he could get answers about his quirks. Once his feet are back on the ground, the protagonist is informed about the terrible flood that has scourged the city, causing the emergence of an increasingly conspicuous number of cases of hysteria and visions among the survivors. Following these events, the streets have been invaded by mysterious deformed creatures of apparently unknown origin, which in fact constitute a further danger to the community. Answers are needed, and the only one who seems able to provide them seems to be Robert Throgmorton, a wealthy leading member of one of the oldest and most renowned families in the city. Without getting lost in too many formalities, the couple enter into an agreement: Charles will show off his investigative talent in order to track down Robert's son, who mysteriously disappeared during an expedition at sea. In exchange, the latter will receive answers on the onset of visions and the strange events that are subjugating the city following the flood. For the realization of The Sinking City the developers have drawn heavily from some of the main cornerstones of Lovecraft's works, including the fear of the unknown and the onset of madness, when the human mind comes into contact with entities and situations which he simply cannot understand. Just as the local population is gradually losing hope of returning to a normal life, the mystery that hovers in the streets and canals thickens due to the incessant presence of foreigners arriving from everywhere. The reasons for the exodus appear somehow related to the dark presences that populate the area, and it will be up to the player to try to unravel the skein one step at a time - or rather one investigation at a time - trying to find out what is hidden below the surface. During his stay in Oakmont, Charles will be forced to extricate himself from feuds involving ancient families, mysterious organizations with dubious purposes and decidedly disreputable individuals with whom to interact during investigative activities. Open world investigation Unlike previous Frogwares titles, we find ourselves in the presence of a horror-tinged investigative adventure set in a freely explorable game environment. Taking into account the limited incidence of secondary activities, the term open world could be a bit misleading, but in fact it is still an evolution compared to what are the traditional characteristics of the products made by the Ukrainian team. Charles is therefore able to visit the neighborhoods that make up the city without interruption, having to use a small boat to cross those areas of the map that have been invaded by the waves. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the work carried out on the characterization and atmosphere that the alleys, buildings and individuals of Oakmont exude seemed accurate and particularly similar to Lovecraftian atmospheres, net of a rather lacking technical realization on which we will return in a little while. The ghostly appearance and feeling of desolation that dwells in every corner are reinforced by the presence of haunted areas teeming with deformed creatures. The passages on foot or the crossings along the watercourses are marked by the alternation of night and day, although one never catches a faint glimmer of light or a semblance of salvation for those who, in spite of themselves,he is drawn into the vortex of madness that hovers over the city. To make the transfer from one place to another on the map more dynamic, the presence of various fast transfer points that can be unlocked through exploration contributes. Predictably the rarefied and at times anguished atmosphere of The Sinking City is not supported by an equally effective technical quality. Beyond a rather backward visual impact, one cannot help but notice the many imperfections that the game reveals in terms of graphic design, image cleanliness, variety of animations and credibility of the characters you come across along the way . Among the most obvious flaws is the case of pointing out the lack of variety of the faces of the NPCs, which are recycled on several occasions, nullifying part of the immersion. There are also obvious management problems of the elements present in the map, revealed by the temporary disappearance and reappearance of objects or people who populate the streets of the city. In short, the effort made by Frogwares in an attempt to make the playful experience more varied has resulted in some evident structural flaws on which one must inevitably try to overlook in order to appreciate the experience in its entirety. Dialogues, deductions and combat system Before being swallowed up in the dark Lovecraftian suggestions, the prototype of The Sinking City should have been used for a new Sherlock Holmes adventure. The initial design expanded just when the developers decided to use an imaginary diametrically different from the usual one. Given the open structure and the presence of secondary tasks, which you can decide whether to follow or not, the overall longevity of the work is significantly higher than the previous iterations of the Ukrainian studio, in the order of 30 hours of play overall. The composition of the map allows you to give a little more breadth to the investigative phases, although the city of Oakmont has proved to be rather static and devoid of real stimuli outside the main plot. With the exception of the side tasks, which can be selected by talking to some NPCs positioned near the main missions, the environmental interaction was almost non-existent. Fortunately, the investigative context has remained at excellent levels, proving to be well designed and full of stimulating ideas. Among the qualities that most catch the eye is undoubtedly the freedom of action: yes, because the developers have preferred not to take the player by the hand, thus avoiding suggesting too directly where to go or what decisions to take. Clearly there is no shortage of clues and geographical elements functional to carrying out the research, but it will be necessary to apply oneself to be able to understand where to go and how to activate subsequent events. The dialogues are just one of the many means that Charles has at his disposal to extrapolate new information useful for the investigation. The collection of clues can be obtained by combining the information obtained from several interlocutors with the objects and other evidence found in the places where the searches take place. Moreover, the brilliant deductions are also conveyed by some particular talents that the protagonist is able to exploit to his own advantage. By activating the Mind's Eye, for example, it is possible to notice otherwise precluded clues and access the so-called Premonitions. The latter make it possible to identify tracks which, once followed, lead to the identification of objects or other crucial information for the continuation of the research. Then we have the Retrocognitions, which activate a sort of altered dimension of reality, in which it is possible to relive single sequences of events. It will be up to the player to place them in the exact chronological order, so as to unlock further information. All the elements collected during the investigative activity then flow into the Mental Palace, or the section in which all the details that the player has been able to extrapolate through his own activity are stored in textual form. At this stage it is necessary to make logical connections between individual concepts, arriving at a more organic picture of the situation. The deductions made lead in turn to a series of choices of a moral nature which trigger alternative consequences capable of influencing the epilogue of the game in various ways. Unlike what happened in Sherlock Holmes, where the action sequences were completely absent or barely sketched (think of The Devil's Daughter), this time Frogwares has tried to enrich the offer by introducing a real combat system. CoConsidering the dangerousness of the creatures that infest Oakmont, Charles will not limit himself to acting on tip of foil, to the sound of clues and brilliant deductions, but sometimes he will have to go to the streets to try to defend himself from the threats that surround him. The scarcity of resources available for the map makes it essential to sip bullets and other equipment such as medikits and traps. Unfortunately the gunplay proved to be excessively crude, undermined by the inaccuracies of the aiming system and by poor management of the shots. Instead, we appreciated the implementation of a character progression system, entrusted to a skill tree that has the function of improving combat effectiveness, vigor or mental resistance.", "date": "2019-06-25", "grade": "7.0"}
