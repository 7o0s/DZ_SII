We got to strip off the new game pack after a thorough test in the past few days and in this article we provided you with our certainties and doubts. Given the short amount of time that has passed we can tell you that the contents and mechanics tested five days ago have not changed so we want to take advantage of the space in this review to dig deeper into the criticisms and complaints of the fans, to try to provide a more broad on the issue and illustrate, as far as possible, plausible future scenarios for Maxis' creature. Why is the community against Journey to Batuu? We said that the criticisms expressed by the Simmers on the announcement of Journey to Batuu were very precise: ~we don't give a damn about Star Wars~. A statement seasoned with a vengeance that cannot be ignored, because there are numerous features added over time in The Sims 4 that to date have not received adequate fixes, resulting in some cases lacking if not ~broken~. Babies that are not mere objects to interact with, the inadequate rendering of darker complexions or more functional folders and styles in the CAS. The unsatisfactory result of some elements added to the lack of others never included during the six years of life of The Sims 4 (the lack of dominant and recessive genetic traits, zodiac signs, thieves and burglar alarms...) and a more fragmented subdivision both the contents and the format of the expansions make this Journey to Batuu truly unsustainable. Why create an expansion that no one wants, that no one has asked for, in the face of the countless fixes and shortcomings that had an almost emergency priority for the community? After all, the Simmers had spoken clearly by participating in a survey by Digital Spy, which asked what were the expectations for the expansions of The Sims 4 in the year 2020. Hotels stand out in first place, followed by the experience of school life, farms and car; Star Wars is in twenty-first position. Illustrated in this way, the situation would all relate to the community but if it is true that in some respects the fans are absolutely legitimate to formulate such accusations, on the other hand a reality of the facts emerges that in our opinion is a little more complex where the recriminations of the Simmers sometimes they lack the right understanding of the context. Mind you, whoever is writing this review is far from wanting to defend Electronic Arts but at the same time, feels he wants to provide a perhaps broader view of the matter because in all this Journey to Batuu is the spark that ignited the discussion, but certainly not dynamite. The fixes are missing Let's start by saying what fans are right about: the fixes. A self-respecting developer cannot insert content into a game carelessly, the fact that something ~is there~ does not mean that it is ~enough~, it must be there and also be done well... at least, the theory dictates this. With the arrival of Journey to Batuu, some flaws of the game have in fact been fixed, which you can find a summary on this developer page, but some problems remain, despite Maxis' hard work. Inserting newborns makes no sense if they are then reduced to an object to interact with, as if they were a telephone or a saucepan. The same goes for skin tones: a game like The Sims, so based on being able to express our deepest and most discreet selves pioneered in this, cannot fall for dark complexions with gray and green undertones. You can't, and if this isn't discussed. But this has nothing to do with Journey to Batuu because Maxis could have given priority to any other expansion, even the most requested and popular and still be in the wrong. Contents from previous chapters are missing In addition to the features to be fixed, there would also be some shortcomings within the game that, according to the community, should have taken priority over such an accessory expansion as Journey to Batuu. If the fans are right to sell on the issue of fixes, a much more complex page opens up on the missing features because if it is true that some features could be added with a little effort by Maxis and even be released for free, on the contrary there are things that the community wants and which, it is the opinion of the writer, can never be inserted. ~They gave us Star Wars but we still don't have an open world like The Sims 3.~ This is one of the most frequent complaints that can be found in the ultim networkbut it is also a perfect example to support the following theory: the situation is likely not to change, regardless of the reception of Journey to Batuu. Although six years have already passed, The Sims 4 still heavily accuses the lack of effective communication of the product by the developer and producer: the fourth iteration of the simulation is completely different in form and spirit from the previous core. If The Sims 3 was a dense and redundant experience, The Sims 4 is lean, streamlined and flexible; on the one hand an organic and structured world that guided the players into pre-constructed narrative adventures, on the other a gigantic toy box where the limit is the imagination. It is a totally different approach that not all the public has yet conceptually embraced and understood and which, consequently, sets unsatisfiable expectations regardless of the expansions released. Why Star Wars? Last big gripe, perhaps the one that makes you nervous the most, is: why Star Wars? It's not strange for The Sims to host another label in the Sims world and integrate it into the game experience; already at the time of The Sims 2 fans had to deal with H&M and Ikea, for the fourth a staff pack dedicated to the Moschino clothing line has already been released. The most savvy have already arrived at it some time ago but it is good not to take anything for granted also because it is not strange to find players who are super passionate about The Sims but who at the same time have no experience with other video games or who are simply not updated on the chronicle of the gaming world . Electronic Arts and Walt Disney signed, in spring 2013, a multi-year agreement that allows the video game manufacturer to develop licensed titles using the Star Wars brand: from that moment until today all the teams owned by EA (except BioWare) have developed several themed games. However, a story full of bad incidents and stories that many of us would prefer to forget, such as the definitive closure of Visceral Games or all the drama of the lootboxes of Star Wars: Battlefront 2. It is clear that not even Maxis could escape from this burden and indeed, as We've already said in our trial, we're genuinely amazed that Star Wars integration hasn't come sooner. Probably bad past experiences have made EA understand that yes, it is right to return the investment made on licenses, but there is a way and a way to do it. At the risk of repeating ourselves Journey to Batuu doesn't even take the form of a wild money-grabbing operation because net of the topic addressed, the amount of content present in a twenty-euro package is considerable. What may therefore seem like an unpleasant teasing takes the form of a treatment that is anything but bad... of course, we understand that the ~could have been worse~ is a somewhat bitter consolation but since we have touched the worse, maybe the Simmers can sleep peacefully. A fragile balance What Journey to Batuu has shown is that the situation of The Sims 4 is based on a delicate balance, a symptom of a failure to consolidate the relationship of trust between the developer/producer and the public. A request for support from players higher than the real capacity of the dev team, a radical conceptual change of the game experience and a sales formula for expansion packs made up of three different economic cuts have made the situation fragile. A fragility that is also reflected in the developer's position, despite the expansion of the same with a new studio in Texas, because we are not talking about a development team that has had the opportunity to try its hand at different genres: Maxis, in all its extensions and offshoots , it makes sense to exist in the EA group solely and exclusively because it develops The Sims, a product that must generate such earnings as to convince EA that closing the team, all in all, is not convenient for the moment. It is clear that since there is no direct competitor to this simulation, the producer can also rest on the knowledge that the customer is ready to pay a few more coins just to play The Sims and it pains us a bit to have to express this cynical awareness but all this has nothing to do with Journey to Batuu, an expansion that instead has its dignity and that risks paying for ~sins~ (pass us the somewhat biblical term) that are not attributable to its release but, rather, from a system that has not yet settled into a stable formula. So: are we genuinely surprised by the quality/quantity of Journey to Batuu content? A lot of. Were we blown away by how the Star Wars franchise has been brought back to the world of The Sims? Absolutemind. Did we feel the spasmodic need for this Game Pack? Of course not but, as already mentioned, this is a reasoning that applies to every single expansion of The Sims 4 and is closely linked to the taste of the individual player. While aware of the motivations that drive the community to rebel, we are strongly convinced that this is not the end of The Sims 4 and we reserve the right to judge the overall impact that this expansion will have on the entire fourth cycle because we do not know for how long The Will Sims 4 go on, what more content is on the way and how many years will it still be supported. In the meantime, we limit ourselves to recommending the expansion because, as the whole experience of The Sims 4 is set up, there is no expansion that is really not recommended: it all depends on what experiences you are looking for, what worlds you want to explore and what stories you want tell.", "date": "2020-09-08", "grade": null}
