As it is legitimate to suppose, the aspects most significantly affected by the change are the graphics and the one linked to the control system, and in both cases we can be considered moderately satisfied: although Hexxagon Labs does not set new records in this sense, everything is done with enough skill, and for a puzzle game that's enough. Let's rather see what the HeroCraft work offers in playful terms: the style of play closely resembles that of the Othello board game, with the difference that here the grid is made up of hexagons instead of squares. The aim is therefore to move one's pawns trying to color green as many boxes as possible, in competition with opponents who will obviously try to put a spanner in the works. Apparently extremely trivial, the gameplay of Hexxagon Labs instead hides an out of the ordinary depth, as the simple assumptions above can lead to the elaboration of truly complex strategies: for example, game after game, the user will discover the usefulness to go and occupy the corners of the grid before the others, the only points unassailable by the opponents. In short, the HeroCraft product does not invent anything new, but it's always nice to be faced with a puzzle game capable of combining surface immediacy and great structural complexity. Moreover, the AI of the opponents controlled by the CPU is always very good (even if the ~shot~ on the professors mentioned at the beginning is objectively exaggerated), guaranteeing a constant level of challenge: Hexxagon Labs is therefore a title suitable for all those who try rewards in carefully analyzing a situation, devising a strategy and building your victory move by move. The right contour to the excellent play structure of the title is represented by a satisfactory number of levels (27 plus 3 tutorials, ten more than the mobile version), by three game modes and as many difficulty levels and by a multiplayer section that allows for up to three users to interact easily on the same iPhone due to the turn-based nature of the game. And then it's sold for just 0.79 Euros on the App Store, which is a definite plus point...", "date": "2009-04-09", "grade": "S.V."}
