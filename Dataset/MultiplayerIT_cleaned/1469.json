{"name": "Project Gotham Racing 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-gotham-racing-6.html", "text": "The road leading to Project Gotham 2 The structure of Project Gotham Racing 2 is rather atypical for a car racing game, for those few who have never heard of it. Its nature partially borrows from that of a role-playing game, in which you have to manage to pass tests distributed across 14 classes of cars, starting from the Compact Sports Cars such as the Mini Cooper up to the Ultra, in which you can drive dream like the Ferrari Enzo. The tests range from competing against a variable number of opponents, from four to eight, crossing the finish line in a certain position, to being able to beat a certain record time on a course, from reaching a given maximum speed in one point of a track , until you get a certain score by darting through pairs of cones placed on the asphalt, without hitting them. Each test can be tackled in five different levels of difficulty and if the basic cars that are made available for each class are enough to overcome them at the lower levels, to be able to get the better of the higher difficulties it is necessary to buy the most prestigious cars of each category, which can also be purchased by going to what is a polygonal version of a dream showroom with all sorts of automotive jewels. To make purchases you have to spend tokens that are awarded every time you level up Kudos. These are the prize that the game assigns for every evolution made on the track, for every passage on the curbs and for every jump made at great speed, without crashing into the edges of the tracks. Every so many Kudos earned in the events, you level up and here come the tokens to spend in our pockets to buy ever better and more competitive cars. In order to complete the game and unlock all hidden cars, it is necessary to pass all tests on the highest difficulty level, in all game modes (in addition to the Kudos World Championship mode, there are also Arcade Race and Record Attack), which constitutes an absolutely arduous undertaking and which will keep even the best ones busy for weeks. Xbox Live connection The backbone of the game hasn't changed all that much over the years from previous installments, either for better or for worse. For good, PGR2 remains a fun and long-lived racing game and, among other things, very challenging for those who want to try their hand at conquering the platinum medals which constitute the prize for the races passed at the highest level of difficulty; the number of cars has almost tripled (from just over 30 to over 100 today) and the driving style, still arcadey, has become a little more technical, forcing much more attention when driving the vehicles. which have much less homogeneous reactions depending on their technical characteristics and the terrain on which they run. For worse, the Artificial Intelligence of the machines managed by the CPU sometimes leaves something to be desired and witnessing the queues of the opponents, who do almost nothing to move from the pre-established trajectories, at the cost of throwing themselves into piles of bodies in the most improbable curves, clashes with a bit with all the rest of the system of an absolute level title. The real novelty of this title is the introduction of the Live modes in the skein of a skein, which however will never be definitively untangled, if we do not admit that in reality it is a fusion between online and offline modes. There are no network modes distinct from single player modes, at least not conceptually. You plug in the Ethernet cable, start the single player game, and still project to the Xbox Live servers. Every time obtained in the Attack on Record mode, every single Kudos earned, both in Arcade races and in the championship, are recorded and placed in the world rankings relating to each individual event. The first ten classified will get the replica of their performances to be saved on the servers and to be there available to anyone who wants to try their hand and learn, in an infernal group that, even once all the platinum medals have been obtained, will always put us in comparison with the best to beat by providing new lifeblood to the gameplay. In every second, in the midst of each of the tests of the single player mode, we will be able to receive the invitation of a friend to participate in an Xbox Live race with seven other people, with the single press of a button and without interruption. And not just for the sake of racing, but to acquire Kudos Live, which can be spent on the purchase of those same cars that we need to progress in the Kudos championship. All tracksof the game can be unlocked not only by passing the championship tests, but also by defeating an opponent online who has already unlocked them previously and who acts as a host. In PGR 2, therefore, having Xbox Live at your disposal, there is only one great mode, given that you can enjoy every single circuit and car in the game whether you go online or offline or both ways , at our absolute discretion. To all this must be added the complete absence of lag, except for very sporadic rare cases, even those times in which the host is connected with basic ADSL and you are connected to the network at the same time as PCs that are browsing the internet. Overviews from the world The technical aspect of PGR2 will be discussed for months since some choices made by the programmers certainly offer the side to criticisms of no small importance, but which in hindsight can be silenced in the face of a game that is simply spectacular. Cities continue to be deserted save for fallen leaves and sheets of paper fluttering in the wind, and the frame rate has been capped at just 30fps. What the programmers have obtained in exchange is a very clean game, never stuttering even with eight vehicles on the screen and always fluid even online, always to favor that non-distinction between single and multiplayer games that makes PGR 2 a unique product at the moment. Except in cases of extreme lag, in fact, it is not possible to recognize an offline game from an online one and the amount of work managed by the polygonal engine, perhaps not trivially spectacular like others, is great. The asphalt surfaces, especially when the sun reflects blindingly on them, are among the most convincing ever made, embellished as they are by effects and excellent textures; the models of the cars are complex and deform under the blows of opponents and guard rails. The elements of the backdrop, which are reflected on the bodies, deform as a result of the damage suffered by the cars and depending on the weather conditions. The lights of the game are warm and enveloping and this time they manage to amalgamate vehicles and environments in a convincing way, eliminating the unpleasant effect whereby it seemed that the cars of the previous episodes were superimposed on cities that were less realistic than the vehicles that roamed around freely. The cities, the real protagonists of the game, are vast, full of details and, albeit with some textures that are not always up to par, monumental; some glimpses of Washington or Chicago are truly remarkable and rightfully become the new term of comparison for the polygonal detail of the next racing games on any platform. Even the soundtrack plays its part with the return of city radios, which alternate selected songs from three different musical styles and giving space to really existing musical groups, selected from the musical scenes of the different metropolises. Note the new way of interacting with the radio, which can be managed without needing to pause even in the middle of a Live race, given that with the right analog lever of the pad it is possible to turn on the radio, the CD, adjust the volume and change the station or piece of music. Overviews from the world Comment Project Gotham Racing 2, already in the single player mode, is an excellent, fun and long-lived arcade driving game. In fact, before having faced and passed all the challenges proposed in the different classes and having collected all the available medals and kudos, weeks will have passed and the feeling of having played the best out there for this kind of game will remain. titles. The fact is that the new work of Bizarre Creations, thanks to Xbox Live, is something more than an arcade racer; is the first step towards the realization of an idea that sees the dissolution of the boundaries between offline and online, between single player and multiplayer gaming in its fullness, thanks to the network. For Xbox owners, this is the best driving game available in the console line up. For anyone who is an Xbox Live user, PGR 2 is a potentially inexhaustible source of entertainment and the first opportunity to understand where Microsoft's online project can really go in the space of a few months. Pros: An almost perfect production Remarkable graphics Live like never before Cons: The artificial intelligence of the cpu It's been quite some time since Bizarre Creations announced Metropolis Street Racer on the Dreamcast, the first attempt at a driving game set in some of the most fascinating cities in the world, rbuilt maniacally, paying attention to thousands of details. Since then this project has come a long way and, now in its second chapter on Xbox, as well as being an excellent arcade racer, marks a step in the path of Xbox Live and the Microsoft console towards an idea of fusion between multiplayer and game modes. single player, which were from the beginning in the plans of the machine, but which only now show themselves blatantly.", "date": "2003-11-28", "grade": null}
