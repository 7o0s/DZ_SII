{"name": "Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grand-theft-auto-iv-the-lost-and-damned-recensione.html", "text": "Johnny Klevitz is almost a family man, who runs the shack and makes sure that his boys never lack for food and a roof over their heads. The problem is that the family is a gang of drug-dealing motorcyclists, in constant struggle with the other gangs on the territory of Liberty City, and that the shack is a kind of hovel in which our heroes live crowded together in at least questionable hygienic conditions. Johnny restored peace, making sure that each gang dedicated itself to its own territory without conflicting with the others, at least until Billy, the real leader of the Lost MCs, gets out of jail, putting his addiction back on the loose. from drugs and all the violence that seemed to have subsided. A new adventure It is hard to think of L&D as a simple expansion of GTA IV, with respect to which it adds new protagonists, many lines of dialogue, movies on TV, multiplayer modes, some subgames and even musical pieces by the tenor of Bon Jovi and Aerosmith. In common, there are Liberty City and the basic mechanics, which however are at the service of a different story, continuously intertwined with the story of Niko Bellic and his cousin, to tell the many fans the background of some of the most memorable phases of the title released last year. Therefore, some of the characters return, but seen from a different point of view, on which the absence of moments in which Roman and Brucie's jokes lightened the tone and dampened the crudest situations, leaving a story in the field, at times , desperate in which you see flying hammers in the mouth, torture with blowtorch and hopeless love stories. With a camera that never lowers its gaze, even when it comes to framing the first full male nude scene in the history of video games, which leaves you stunned (especially if you think of the controversies that could arise from it), but which manages not to seem out of place in the big picture. The main quest takes about 10 hours and by the time we finished it we were 60% complete with all the gang battles still to be fought - urban warfare raging at certain points on the map - races to be won , motorcycles to steal, some commissioned jobs and 50 seagulls to hunt throughout the city. In short, to those who were wondering if this Lost & Damned would have been worth waiting for, Rockstar responds with a game that could easily have been on store shelves, and which for around 20 euros is an unmissable purchase for all those who liked GTA IV. Completely missing Niko's improbable love encounters, the clothing stores - there are, but they are not accessible -, the missions obtainable from the computers of the police cars and the sections by motorboat or helicopter. From a gameplay point of view, L&D is like a concentrate of the action of GTA IV, which features many more shootings, from which it is no longer necessary to run away all the time, since it is expressly asked several times to kill to the last cop on screen. Obviously, we are often invited - when not forced - to use the motorbikes also for road battles but, even if they have slightly improved their riding, the management of the two wheels is still problematic, above all in the most entangled situations. The good thing is that the intermediate checkpoints have been inserted and that therefore even the longest quests can be overcome without excessive trauma. Companions are accessible from the start and provide motorcycles, weapons at advantageous prices and, from a certain point on, support in missions, with an innovative system for the series, thanks to which each of them improves their stats every time they survives a shipment unscathed. The idea of the gang is favored by the way Johnny and the others travel on the roads in constant formation, with a precise disposition on the asphalt which, if respected, helps to recharge the vital energy and that of the bulletproof vest. L&D is a concentrate of some elements of GTA IV, without the pauses that Niko allowed himself, so in the end we witness another story, set in the same place, and which, even if it does not reach the heights and complexity of the original, could be appreciated more by those who would have preferred a less dispersive game. Lost and Damned Multiplayer With the announcement of this first expansion for Grand Theft Auto IV, the questions that the millions of interested Xbox 360 users have incessantly asked themselves for months were related to the protagonist and the setting, much less to the additions dedicated to multiplayer which, after the first weeks after release, it has been eclipsed in favor of the usual Halo and Call of Duty. Rockstar NoHowever, on hasn't lost heart and has decided to try again, on this occasion producing a whole series of contents aimed at increasing variety and recovering a share of users, recycling - how nice it is to recycle - the work done for the component in single of Lost and Damned so as to keep the complex compact and coherent. It was possible to try this new competitive guise in the developer's London studios, testing the additions by hand. In total, five new modes have been created, four of which will be tried out and one that won't be shown in action until release. The impression is that great importance has been given to team play, so much so that the best new game has turned out to be Witness Protection, where a team must be divided between the driver of a pickup truck in charge of taking some criminals to prison and the cars of the police who will make up the escort, and the other plays the role of the Lost, committed to freeing the comrades trapped and destined for a life behind bars; a non-stop challenge that is very fun, frenetic but capable of requiring great coordination. Decidedly more classic, Own the City is a reinterpretation of the canonical Conquest but capable of involving five large areas of each island, complete with AI-controlled bots to guard the owned areas and a van loaded with weapons with which to improve their equipment. Lone Wolf Biker then offers another rather traditional encounter: a player has the ability to see the positioning of the next checkpoint and must try to reach it to score a point while the others must touch it to in turn become holders of that special ability. If up to now there has been talk of a match for sixteen users, Rockstar also wanted to think of couples by giving them the most ignorant and crazy experience of the whole package: Chopper VS Chopper, motorcycle against helicopter, if the latter destroys the driver the first takes its place and can hunt for the checkpoint; nothing more simple and at the same time destructive. Finally, the not yet proven Club Business, all against all or in teams, where you individually complete as many assigned tasks as possible so as to become the leader of the club. In short, a good complex of new possible situations to have fun for several hours, not to mention that the renewed physics of the bikes and the unpublished weapons will be maintained, in addition to the new physicality returned using the members of the Lost. All the previously created modes close the overview - with thirteen new races only for motorcycles - and an option to enter games already in progress without going through the lobby. It is difficult to think that the multiplayer of Lost and Damned can change someone's online habits, but it will certainly lead many people to experiment and spend a few hours in the company of what is put in an interesting package also for these additions. Comment Rockstar scores another one of its own, packaging an expansion that doesn't seem like one, but rather a version, all action and pitch black, of one of the most beautiful games that this generation of consoles has been able to give birth . If you liked GTA IV, Lost & Damned is worth every single penny to pay, once you accept the fact of being faced with a grim story, full of characters without light, but who shine with an expressive maturity out of the ordinary for a video game . The structure of the missions is the same as the original and completely lacks the more ~social~ part which had the merit of lightening the tone and atmosphere, relieving the player of a real sense of unease, which is felt here throughout time. It is increasingly clear at this point that the true protagonist of GTA IV is Liberty City, bewitching and ready to host any adventure Rockstar comes up with to stage, and at the end of Lost & Damned one cannot help less than wondering what the hell they'll come up with next time to impress. Pros Plot and charactersLess distracting than GTA IVAdditions to multiplayer Against Basically identical in the structure of the missions Most of the social elements are missing The riding of the motorcycles is still to be perfected Xbox 360 - Goals Lost and Damned is giving away 250 points in addition to the 1000 already available with GTA IV. Unlike the latter, in which you had to sweat hard to get them all, here the full loot is easily within the reach of those who want to commit to playing.", "date": "2009-02-17", "grade": null}
