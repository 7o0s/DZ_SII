{"name": "La battaglia dei pianeti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mytran-wars-recensione.html", "text": "In a distant future, devastated by numerous wars, the Earth ends up under the control of powerful and unscrupulous corporations, which in a few years reduce the planet's natural resources to a minimum. Rather than revise its policies, the Kondor Corporation organizes interstellar expeditions to find new worlds to exploit; and the nearby planet Mytran immediately presents itself as the perfect destination, given that an apparently inexhaustible source of energy lies in its subsoil. The problems arise after the arrival of the ground troops, as what was believed to be an uninhabited place is instead home to extremely dangerous beings, who will not allow anyone to exploit their planet. This is the incipit of Mytran Wars, a turn-based strategy developed by Stormregion in which we control the robotic army of the Kondor Corporation with the aim of eliminating any threat present on Mytran and taking possession of its energy sources. In the game we will have to deal with different characters, all well characterized, whose stories are narrated through comic-style cutscenes (complete with a balloon for dialogue). In the course of history, however, there will be surprises and twists ... Turn based warfare Right from the start, Mytran Wars presents itself as a classic turn-based strategy, without particular innovations but with a certain attention to detail. As mentioned, the player controls the troops of the Kondor Corporation, in this case a variable number of mechs of different types, some of which are piloted by key characters that we cannot afford to lose, as their elimination automatically translates into game over . There are three types of mechs, which differ in size, mobility and firepower. After completing the first missions, we will have the possibility to ~sell~ the models we don't like and buy new ones, or to modify the equipment to improve the various characteristics of the robot, or even invest the money earned in the ~research~ sector. and Development~ to unlock new weapons and new upgrades. The difficulty of the game seems to adapt to these new possibilities, in fact after the first stages we will find ourselves facing much more powerful and dangerous enemies, who will force us to study the best possible strategy to lose the least number of units and successfully achieve the objectives of shift. The action takes place through the classic phases of movement and attack: during our turn we will be able to move all the units and possibly attack the enemies, who will only return fire the first time (the rule also applies to our troops, however). Depending on the selected equipment, each mech can attack up close or from a distance, using light or heavy weapons, perhaps with repercussions on the squares adjacent to the target (as when using missiles). Creatures that inhabit Mytran, like elementals, can blend with the ground and recover from damage taken if they are near their energy source. In any case, they do not differ from the Kondor Corporation's mechs in terms of weapon arrangement and resistance to attacks, with the various body parts that can be rendered useless by a particularly powerful blow. Game structure Each mission is preceded by an intermission sequence that advances the plot, after which we move on to an essential but clear briefing, in which the objectives to be achieved to complete the stage are illustrated and we are given the possibility of managing the mechs. Inside the workshop we will therefore be able to assemble particular weapons and kits on our robots, assigning them to the various parts of the armor as happens in the most classic video games with mechs. From this point of view, Mytran Wars presents itself as a rather complete product, given the abundance of weapons, accessories and anything else you can buy or unlock to upgrade your army. The presence of a few vehicle classes is a bit disappointing, as well as the evident imbalance between the cheapest and most expensive models, which almost immediately forces us to sell the smaller robots to minimize the risk of failure. The missions are rarely limited to the classic ~eliminate all enemies~, indeed the clash can often be avoided in favor of reaching a particular area of the map. In some cases, we will have to use the ~conquest~ function of our mechs, reaching some alien structures and taking possession of them: from that moment we will be able to use them for our purposes, which is quite funny when we are talking about turrets and outposts with great firepower. The top three-quarter view can be rotatedninety degrees at a time by acting on the analog stick, while simultaneously pressing the two back buttons of the PSP allows us to enjoy a further shot during a fight. From the menu (which can be called up by pressing the X button while no units are selected) it is possible to adjust various parameters including the volume of music and effects and the speed of movement and combat animations. Unfortunately there's no way to completely skip the very slow enemy action phases, so at best completing a mission will take quite a bit of time. Finally, Mytran Wars features a local multiplayer mode to organize matches against a friend, choosing from the eight available maps. Too bad there's no online... Technical realization The new title created by Stormregion uses polygonal graphics to represent characters, vehicles and locations. However, the results are only discrete, and are far inferior to a similar product (but released in 2007) such as Warhammer 40,000: Squad Command, which had style to spare and certainly more complex maps. The mechs of Mytran Wars are not ugly, they have a design that refers to the tradition of Mech Warrior and boast good animation, but the choice of colors in general is really questionable, giving robots and creatures a characterization that would like to be ~cartoony~ but it disappoints in all respects. Things don't improve as far as the maps are concerned, which are too bare and repetitive, while the cutscenes, with their ~partial~ animations, refer to the cartoons of the 60s ... it is not known whether intentionally or not. The game is localized in Italian for the screen texts, while the dialogues are spoken in English and boast a good level of acting. The music that accompanies the missions is of moderate quality but unfortunately they are anonymous and do not remain in the head. The control system is basically based on the d-pad and main buttons of the PSP, with a fast and precise response to inputs and a rational and intuitive layout. Unfortunately, some functions present in other turn-based strategies are missing, for example it is not possible to cancel the movement of a unit nor, as already mentioned, is it possible to skip or speed up the opponent's turn.", "date": "2009-03-10", "grade": "7.0"}
