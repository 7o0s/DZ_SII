Arche, the protagonist, is a little girl who has just moved with her family to her parents' birthplace. The father, a former adventurer, has opened a new shop of items for adventurers, those classic Japanese role-playing games, while the mother spends all day cooking. Now, so far there doesn't seem to be anything particularly alien about Arche's life, except that she's been marked at a magic school that's outside the city, in a wild and dangerous area. Can you imagine students who have to fight with slimes and killer snakes every morning to get to school? They didn't even live in Rome. The beauty is that adults, including teachers, do not seem to care. Luckily Arche's father taught her to fight with a sword, which for a six/seven year old girl is a big advantage over her doll-wielding companions (what a good dad). In your opinion, what does one do in a magic school? Answer: In a school of magic, teachers teach spell casting. Too bad Arche doesn't have an elemental stone, without which at most he can fart, and has to slip into a dark cave to look for it. Parents, as responsible people as they are, don't care about it and, to demonstrate even more how much they care about their daughter, they lost the one who had sent her free schooling (reading the letters concerning the future of one's offspring seemed ugly). .. Oh so sweet. Unfortunately the stone that the little girl finds, collaborating with her partner called Sana, after having risked her life several times, no longer has any power. To reactivate it, our heroine by chance will have to go hunting for three hidden symbols, needless to say, in the darkest recesses of the earth. At least on this dramatic occasion, will the parents help Arche in his endeavour? Not at all, on the contrary, the father will force the little girl to go hunting for objects to sell in the shop and, damned short arm, will make her pay full price for all the goods necessary for the adventure (a small discount for your daughter, right?). Someone at this point will be wondering if at least the school is a more human environment than the family one, with people willing to help the girls in their adventures. Well, it is enough to know how the trips are organized: the students are divided into groups of three and, having chosen the destination, they must be able to reach it alive, otherwise they will get bad grades. Needless to say, the road is usually littered with monsters. And we thought school buses were dangerous. What about the inhabitants of cities and villages? Will there be one who takes pity on poor girls left at the mercy of creatures that scare even adults? Of course, in fact mayors and shopkeepers do nothing but give him very dangerous missions. Do you understand that social milieu? Only one question remains: is this world, inhabited by such people, really worth saving? Is the party here? Fortune Summoners: Secret of the Elemental Stone is a two-dimensional Japanese role-playing game, with pure oriental-style pixel art graphics. As you will have understood by reading the introduction, which apart from some exaggeration is the objective transcription of some moments of the game's plot, the title tells the story of a little girl and her friends who, mainly from school problems, will end up facing an evil that threatens the whole world. The product fluctuates between everyday problems, made up of chats with classmates and parents, school stories and lesson hours, to classic adventures in deep and often very complicated dungeons. The main feature of the gameplay is the ability to form a party of three characters, Arche, Sana and Stella, who fight against enemies at the same time. The player controls one character at a time, leaving the burden of controlling the other two to the CPU. The only influence you can have on your fellow fighters is to decide their behavior in the dedicated menu. Nothing too complicated really, as you just select the spell casting pace. Fortunately, the artificial intelligence does a great job and if you expect to see your companions in difficulty during the toughest fights, you are very wrong. Indeed, sometimes it happens that they come to your rescue, since some enemies are tough and quite clever and, when you meet them for the first few times, it is not easy to take them down if you don't know the right tactics. Don't even expect to drive all the characters right away, because the first few hours are spent controlling Ark, apart from on one occasion, at the most together with aof the two companions. Only later will you have access to all three. Sword or magic, the eternal dilemma! The difficulty level of Fortune Summoners: Secret of the Elemental Stone is quite high. The difficulty is due to two factors: the aforementioned intelligence of the enemies, who dodge blows and have different and rather insidious attack tactics, and the control system which, despite being in real time, tries to maintain some classic mechanics of the type. The second factor needs to be explained better, because it produces some interesting situations but also some frustrations. Basically it is a more rigid attack and defense mechanism than that of action games, in which movements do not have immediate responses and must be performed at the right time. For example, to hit an enemy who attacks us from behind, you can perform a backward blow, or you must first turn around and then attack. All this requires you to meditate on the movements, because pressing the keys too quickly will not produce the desired effect. Even the jumps are heavier than average and hitting in the air requires the right timing and some ~technical~ ability. The same goes for the use of spells which, requiring a charge time, must be performed at the right time and cannot be used in bursts. In short, the combat system of Fortune Summoners requires good concentration and the ability to evaluate situations. Of course, unfortunately there are flaws. For example, it happens not too rarely that the enemies are able to fit the protagonists against the walls, draining them of energy in no time at all. To use the healing items in combat, a certain amount of time is required and, if in the heat of the action you realize that one of the protagonists is running out of energy, it becomes difficult to be able to save her life. Fortune Summoners: Secret of the Elemental Stone is the third Western-adapted Japanese indie RPG from Cape Fulgur. The other two are Recipear: An Item Shop's Tale, which we reviewed at this link and Chantelise: A Tale of Two Sisters, which we talked about in this article. Equipment and levels As an aid in their endeavours, the three girls will be able to count on various objects. Some can be found in dungeons or by exploring scenarios, while others will have to be bought. In honor of the game's high difficulty, the prices are disproportionate and, if you don't engage in long farming sessions, you will often have the amount required to buy the best equipment to tackle an area when you have already completed the itself. To make life even more difficult for the player, level growth is very slow and there are numerous enemies to kill before seeing that damned number grow. In addition to increasing stats, new levels unlock special combos or new spells (depends on level and character). Enemies are of various types. There are slimes, snakes, skeletons, wizards, bees and so on. The strongest are obviously the bosses, who literally spit blood. Even the first one encountered represents quite a challenge and requires a lot of hits to go down (some of the advanced ones are really tough).", "date": "2012-02-15", "grade": "7.8"}
