{"name": "Final justice - Mission One", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-justice-mission-one.html", "text": "Stories of the history of the stories of It's true I've got into this habit of starting to review a game following a certain mental order that starts from the plot, from the common thread that should link the player to the action. Final Justice is a title conceived exclusively for multiplayer and perhaps for this reason the plot was considered by the BrainOpera guys as a secondary element, in fact rather than reading on the back of the package two lines concerning the usual super terrorist group with unknown intentions (probably unknown to themselves, given the faces ) which confronts the super group of the best special departments in the world (you're the best of the best, remember that! who remembers this sentence?) we are not allowed . The manual included in the package does not help us, as apart from a brief insight, if it can be defined as such, nothing more is said about the entity of the two factions to understand where we are and why. Bag and baggage the equipment Before you scream in terror at the next statement, I have to clarify a small concept: Final Justice is a game that will be distributed in ~modules~, i.e. what you find in the store is the first part of a product that will see subsequent expansions be available online. So now yell, in the original packaging the game includes something like four weapons. Nobody claims Raven Shield's armory, but really the proposed scenario is very bleak. Not only are there only four weapons, but they are the same for both warring sides. A knife, a sub machine gun (or machine gun or SMG from now on), a sniper rifle and proximity mines will be your only companions, along with some landmines to be placed around the maps at will. The only satisfaction is that you can carry all these weapons around at once, no pseudo-tactical simulation of the load so, simply, you will always have all the weapons on you to be able to move individually both in confined spaces and on open terrain, something that it's not good for teamplay, in my opinion. Your SMG is also equipped with a convenient grenade launcher that can be loaded with both smoke projectiles and flashbangs, to temporarily blind and block your opponents, but be careful not to fool yourself with your own hands and shoot yourself in the face it's not a rewarding experience and you will need a family pack of eye drops to recover. The weapons are inspired by existing models, but in general the simulation rendering is low-key so it is a bit difficult to actually associate them with their real-world counterparts (contrary to what happens in other titles). The animations of the same, then, are very simplistic, as well as the audio rendering is just enough, but the thing that left me more perplexed is the splendid blue flame that comes out of the barrel of the SMG with each burst, making it look like a giant lighter more than a modern weapon. The levels Four weapons for four levels, in fact this is the number of settings in which you will have to fight in Final Justice. In addition there is a training level, but it shouldn't help you much, unless you have never tried a First Person Shooter before. The only curious note of the training is that the speech is in English, in short, everything in this game is Italian, mission briefings included, but the training speech is not there are more things in heaven and on earth than mine understands philosophy, to paraphrase good old William, but I didn't get this anyway. But let's go back to the levels of Final Justice: a hangar, an exterior with a bridge, a nuclear power plant and virtual reality (I'll explain this to you later). The level design is extremely simplistic, too. The levels are therefore extremely flat: a few large rooms joined by some long corridors and some height differences to be overcome by means of a ladder, just to break up the monotony. If you won't be able to memorize the maps after the first ten seconds of the game, go to a specialist, you obviously have very serious orientation problems and tend to get lost in the shower cubicle at home. The only level that could generate a certain type of challenge is called ~vr~, honestly I have no words for it, I never imagined that a development team nowadays could conceive something as simply stupid as this map: a set of stacked and textured cubes with the classic motifs with which virtual reality was represented in the very early yearsnineties, when, to be clear, the cinema served us certain ~The Lawnmower~ style meatloaf. The difficulty of this map lies not so much in the design as in the psychedelic effect of the textures that will bombard your tired pupils, but I'll leave you with the screenshots for further comments. Graphics and surroundings Sore point, yes, because the title was developed by very few people and with an extremely limited budget, so it is difficult to say what could have come out with greater support from the production. However, what we have here is insufficient for today's title. The animations are below average, the number of polygons on the characters is low and even more so is that of the environments. Lighting effects, textures and everything else seem to come out of the worst use of license of the old Half-Life engine or similar. Unfortunately, above all the very low level of detail of the interior brings it below, not only the games on the market today, but also below the various mods circulating on the net. It could be said that the graphics are ~functional~, but generally something is functional to something else, so for example to the ~gameplay~. But even from this point of view Final Justice does not particularly shine, trying to imitate the arcade speed of Counter Strike and at the same time setting some limits typical of slightly more ~serious~ games such as Raven Shield and company. In the end, the result is a product which, in a very sparse aesthetic packaging, offers elements that have already been seen and overseen, removing any justification for a possible purchase. The green stuff The price of the title should in any case make us reflect: fifteen euros, a budget title, which promises to expand over time. But honestly, despite the appreciation for the effort of these compatriots of ours, I can't help but find that Final Justice is inferior, in essence, to the worst mod for any game on the market today. I could not advise anyone to spend the money they could invest in a reprint of Half Life (with subsequent download of some of the best mods ever), in a title like this: poor in content and absolutely devoid of any minimal aesthetic appeal to the point to make it one of the worst games I've played in the last couple of years. Pros: It's Italian (?) Budget price Cons: Outdated graphics Bad level design poor equipment of weapons The Italian production of software, especially video games, has never been particularly flourishing. Ours could be defined as an almost bleak panorama, especially when compared with the English, French and German ones, obviously without mentioning the mega-productions from overseas. Final Justice tries to break this bad trend, entirely developed in Italy and distributed by Leader, it is proposed as the first Italian FPS, following in the footsteps of Counter Strike, Raven Shield and various tactics.", "date": "2003-07-12", "grade": null}
