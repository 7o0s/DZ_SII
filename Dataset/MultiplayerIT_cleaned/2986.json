{"name": "Rogue Company", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rogue-company-recensione.html", "text": "Just a few weeks ago we gave you a preview of Rogue Company, Hi-Rez's third-person shooter designed to capture a market niche currently discovered on consoles. Because if it is true that on PC there are many, perhaps even too many, exponents of competitive shooters, on home platforms the situation is quite different, especially on Nintendo Switch. However, the relationship with multiplatform titles for the American publisher is not new and it was therefore quite predictable to find a title in your hands that was able to handle the critical issues of each different console well, and then obviously give its best on PC. However, all existing versions are united by the total absence of barriers, which means that your account can be moved from time to time depending on where you prefer to play, maintaining progress and finding yourself competing against a unique pool of players. In short, the community will not be divided, as we have often seen happen lately, thus decreasing the possibility that the servers will empty faster than necessary in the event that the title fails to make inroads. However, there are really all the possibilities that the game can do much more than expected, let's see why in our Rogue Company review. No revolution but Let's be clear right away: Rogue Company is not and does not want to be a revolution for competitive team shooters. You play four against four, in anything but original modes (at the moment a sort of ticketed Deathmatch and a Search & Destroy mode) and also the characters are a great mix between those seen in Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege and dozens of other shooters sui generis that we have had the opportunity to play in recent years. This is not to say that the Rogues are ugly or poorly modeled, we simply found them lacking in impact and lacking in charisma. A marginal problem when the game works, but which in any case closes several windows to the diffusion of the product, without that possibility, at least for now, of making players want to become attached to their alter egos. In our hours of play of the thirteen Rogues available, just a couple have remained impressed, but even those are very far from the character design of Riot and Blizzard. The implication of this, however, is that finally, before playing, we look more at the skills and armaments available, trying to understand which one can do more for us. In fact, in the Hi-Rez title all the characters have active and passive skills and equipment in unique combinations for a concept that has sincerely satisfied us. More armored characters have weapons with a high volume of fire while those based on mobility carry shotguns and submachine guns that are much more useful at close range. To be honest, although a well-defined META does not yet exist, you find yourself being able to play each character almost freely and good results can also come from the correct reading of the maps and the rotation between the various objectives. This, of course, does not mean that with the passage of time and with the increase in the number of rogues available, more performing team compositions will not rise to the fore but, at least for the moment, you can use any fighter without feeling in clear difficulty. It shoots great! As we said, Rogue Company does not want to steal players from Valorant, but rather slip into that niche of players fed up with Fortnite and determined to take a step further towards a competitive system with stricter rules and less room for maneuver. In fact, the maps present are a continuous intersection of streets with dozens and dozens of potential firing lines, impossible to keep under control in four. The feeling is that you can always surprise the enemy and make a kill, rewarding players in the exact same way that Call of Duty and the aforementioned Fortnite have built their player base. Yet it is fun to unload entire magazines against the enemy team, to check around corners simply by moving the third person view slightly, without having to expose yourself and risk taking a bullet in the head. In short, Rogue Company is not a wild west where the player with the fastest reflexes and best positioned takes home the kill but it is a game where knowing how to move quickly and lose track counts enormously more. The whole system is therefore much more casual and relaxed and although the time to kill is relatively low, there is the regeneration of automatic life and the possibility of being put back on track by one's companions to greatly extend the duration of the clashes, in modo simple but tremendously effective. The hitscan-based shooting system works very well and the feeling of the weapons is also good, with really excellent server stability for the moment. However, the desire to become attractive to a wider audience and the consequent use of the third person also have their negative sides. First of all, the speed of the game does not suit having the character in the middle of the screen, which often ends up obstructing a large part of the view; to add to this the need to keep changing shoulder to manage the right and left angles, with the risk of remaining anchored to the preferred shoulder only for a matter of practicality. There would also be discussions about managing the economy between games. Unlike titles like Counter Strike or Valorant, everyone will keep the equipment they bought between rounds, with the option to buy gun upgrades, additional passive perks or extra gadgets. The system structured in this way risks putting the losing team at a strong disadvantage already after the first round, which will often find itself in a continuous chase. In short, the risk of having an imbalance during the match is concrete but the brevity of the matches, about 15 minutes each, will not make it too heavy for you.", "date": "2020-07-28", "grade": "7.5"}
