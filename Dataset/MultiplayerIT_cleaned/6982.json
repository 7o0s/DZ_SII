{"name": "La setta dei boscaioli alcolizzati", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/135447-wooden-sensey-la-setta-dei-boscaioli-alcolizzati.html", "text": "We have had the opportunity to say it several times: the now not very recent success of the so-called indie games resembles in various respects what is commonly called the golden age of video games, the one in which to create a successful title it was necessary to have teams of hundreds of people and billionaire budgets, but a few computers and three or four talented, and willing, artists and programmers were enough. In fact, Wooden Sen'SeY, released last year for PC and Mac and now landed, as a first step in the console world, on Wii U, seems to have been developed by just two people in a garage, exactly as was often the case in 80s. And as proof that certain things do not change, it must be said that the result, although not sensational, is not bad at all. Already released on PC and Mac, Wooden Sen'SeY also slices on Wii U! Skip, slice, drink The whole game is permeated by a humorous and light atmosphere, starting from the very short narrative premise. Goro is a Japanese martial arts master, we can't say which art but surely something born from an ancient congregation of woodcutters, since his weapons are two axes this big. Goro also lacks legs, although this is probably a stylistic choice (after all, even Rayman has no limbs and no one has ever discriminated against him for this) and we can safely postpone. Finally, Goro is an alcoholic. How else to define someone who hid a reserve of liquor in his dojo (which the game calls Sey, but honestly we haven't been able to find any Japanese drink with the same name, so in the review we will resort to the most trivial names, obviously starting from ~sake ~) absolutely exterminated, and that, when this reserve is stolen from him, instead of going to the nearest police station to file a regular complaint, he freaks out and starts wandering around the whole of Japan slicing anything he can? The purpose of the development duo was to pay homage to the old school platform/action, both in terms of gameplay as we will see shortly, and probably also in terms of setting, although taken in a humorous key, since among the titles that we can best recognize as references of Wooden Sen'SeY there are classics such as Ninja Gaiden or Shinobi: here too the action is purely 2D, with the protagonist who finds himself facing levels full of platforms to be managed with the classic millimeter jumps, more or less natural obstacles to overcome using different skills, and enemies to be eliminated with speed and precision. To help him in the enterprise, above all his axes: pressing the key assigned to the attack starts the blow, and a three-hit combo is possible, the last of which is a sort of very effective reel. But the axes have other uses too: by jumping, pushing the stick down and attacking (or simply moving the GamePad down with the nice motion controls activated), the weapons will be unleashed on the ground with a powerful blow that not only manages to destroy enemies and interactive elements of the stage, but also provides Goro with a useful upward throw. Furthermore, the versatile hatchets also act as a grappling hook, to cling to the platforms above and climb onto them, or to be used as a liana always through the movement of the GamePad. Other weapons that you will use (little) during the game are generally throwing, from the classic shurikens up to real missiles. All this for the beauty of nine levels, also built with the dictates of the old school in mind: built, however, generally well, without ever making people cry for a miracle. The ninja master moves with the appropriate speed and precision, the controls are in short well managed even when the movement ones are adopted - and this is not a trivial thing - and in general the game is very simple to manage, intuitive and immediate. Schizophrenic difficulty But the great classics of the past decades, the more elderly players will know, also had the characteristic of being damned difficult; after all it was the age of the arcades, and what better way to force the poor player to deprive himself of industrial quantities of coins? Well, Wooden Sen'SeY can certainly be defined as a difficult game, but... at times. Although the difficulty curve generally rises proportionally to the level, there are some truly, truly infamous points where you will lose tons and tons of lives and you will repeatedly want to throw the very expensive GamePad out of the window; past these points, however, there will generally be relatively quiet sections until the next bastard passage. In short, the difficulty is not managed perfectly, and this, together with thethe brevity of the levels, which are also decently numerous, affects the total duration, which will probably settle on three hours at your first game; three pleasant hours, of course, but where the specter of repetitiveness will appear from time to time. The game situations, after all, are not very many and not even particularly original especially as regards the variety of enemies, although always well thought out, and to aggravate this small problem we think the fact that Goro's skills, even if in acceptable number, practically all of them are present from the beginning. If three hours may seem few to someone, moreover, we are talking about a single playthrough: to flesh out the replayability various expedients, such as the possibility of keeping track of the bottles of sake found and the enemies killed, and a time set by the programmers to beat for each internship complete with related objectives and trophies. In short, the fanatics of completeness will have bread for their teeth. If the variety of the gameplay occasionally runs the risk of being low, fortunately this is not the case for the artistic characterization. Each level has its own distinct setting, all united by the Japanese-humorous theme, and if some settings are decidedly classic (the Japanese village surrounded by nature, the forest, even the aquatic level with a lot of Goro swimming) others are original, such as the stage set at sunset which creates a suggestive silhouette effect; however, the same variety is not present as regards the characters, the enemies are few and to distinguish the various types only a few elements, a hat, a particular weapon, little more. High variety of settings and low of characters are however served by excellent graphics, full of details, colors, lights, effects and various touches of class. Nothing exceptional, of course, from the point of view of the number of polygons, Wooden Sen'SeY is not the game that makes the Wii U hardware sweat seven shirts, but made with skill and taste, with particular attention to those elements , such as the cleaning of the textures and, as we said, the colors and light effects, which Nintendo also often gives preference to, and which will not fill the data sheets with high-sounding numbers but create high-level, suggestive, big impact. The same care can be seen in the auditory department: each level has its own music, which is not a given for an eShop title, obviously Japanese-themed, of fluctuating quality but fortunately from ~decent~ to ~little tune that doesn't take off the brim for a while po'~, and even the effects and the speech, although not very present, are taken care of and contribute to the comedy and lightness of the whole. We conclude with two notes, one for the excellent Italian translation, and even this is not always present on the eShop, and one for the possibility of playing offscreen: on the GamePad the game renders excellently, but the TV screen is always preferable, not only for a matter of definition, but also to be able to use the motion sensors in peace without getting seasick.", "date": "2014-07-29", "grade": "6.7"}
