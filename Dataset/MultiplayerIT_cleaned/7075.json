We've been playing Tomodachi Life for more than a month already, imagining the bewildered and perplexed expressions of the players bombarded, meanwhile, by the trailers and photos of what, at first glance, appears to be an incomprehensible title. Tomodachi Life's success at home, after all, is also due to a uniquely Japanese humor and quirkiness. The first impression it can make is that of some kind of Animal Crossing clone, but that's a decidedly wrong description. Tomodachi Life looks more like The Sims than the other Nintendo title, and anyone expecting the same depth and complexity as Animal Crossing is likely to be in for a bitter disappointment. In the following lines we will explain why, telling you about our experiences with the Miis who have come to live on the Colli island: it is perhaps the best way to understand Tomodachi Life and find out if it is a game that is right for you or not. Tomodachi Life is not a real life simulator, but a nice and carefree game Neverland The differences with Animal Crossing are already felt in the ~creation~ of our island, to which in reality we will limit ourselves to giving a name since it is the same for everyone. At the beginning it will also appear rather bare: there will be just the town hall and the large condominium of Mii apartments, which we will be able to fill with our imported Miis (wireless, QR code, etc.) or created ad hoc. We have moved a heterogeneous group of people made up of relatives, friends, imaginary characters and VIPs to the Colli island. It's a bit impressive to see that Shigeru Miyamoto lives above our apartment and that Samus Aran lives at the other end of the condominium, between mum and dad, but this also happens on the Colli island. Each Mii has a personality based on a handful of parameters established at creation, such as its seriousness or its agility: the psychological profile that the software traces is quite spot on and serves to establish the affinity between the inhabitants and the type of objects and foods they like. Apart from this, the creation of Miis immediately unlocks other points of interaction: in addition to the aforementioned town hall, which allows you to consult the list of Miis and change some options, among the first establishments that will open we will find the restaurant, the clothes shop and that of headdresses. This is just the beginning: the Miis in the apartment building will frequently need our help to meet their needs. In most cases they will ask us to eat or to buy them a new garment: just a few clicks on the comfortable interface (Tomodachi Life is played entirely with the stylus) to fulfill their wishes or ignore them completely. In the second case nothing will change, in the first one we will modify their appearance and make them more or less happy, increasing a real experience bar. At each level up, it is possible to give the Mii in question an object, a piece of furniture, a song or a personalized phrase. Tomodachi Life, in fact, integrates a customizable vocal synthesizer that gives voice to the Miis, who will speak to us completely in Italian. Sure, the robotic tone is what it is, but the effect is pleasant enough, especially when you hear them singing in the theatre. Because, yes, in Tomodachi Life there is that too, and like many other attractions it is unlocked by meeting certain requirements indicated under the relative land lot. The more complex premises will obviously require greater efforts, but already in the first minutes of the game it is possible to unlock several activities without struggling too much, expanding the game's offer. It will thus be possible to perform on stage in real musicals, take personalized photos (which can be shared on social networks using the appropriate integrated feature) and exchange Miis and objects with other players, watch rap or chain word competitions, perform affinity tests and more. The results are almost always hilarious, but they leave the time they find: the challenges, for example, last a very long time and never go anywhere, while most of the Mii's activities do not affect the existence of the island in any way. We could find them strolling on the beach or enjoying the scenery at the top of the observation tower, but perhaps it will be enough to leave the attraction to see the same Miis magically engaged in a completely different activity. In short, there is a lack of that sense of logic and cohesion which, definitively, dispels any doubts: Tomodachi Life is not a life simulator. At least until the Miis marry each other. The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect is surprisingly well done for a casual title of this genre. The visual depth does not have the slightest impact on the gameplay, but it's nice and it makes some island scenarios more interesting. The protagonists are the Miis The interactions between the inhabitants of the island are certainly the most interesting and fun element of Tomodachi Life. When they're not on their own, Miis tend to congregate in various stages or in their own apartments to indulge in the most unusual and nonsensical activities. It therefore happens to spy on a friend's apartment to find him hopping around for no reason with Miyamoto or to catch a mother busy doing yoga thanks to the manual we gave her at the previous level up. At night most Mii sleep (precluding practically any type of interaction) and during the day it is possible that they take a nap: in these cases it can happen that they dream and we will be able to observe their thoughts, often decidedly absurd. When a friend dreams of being shrunk and hiding behind pots or sitting at a laid table, surrounded by other Miis in French wigs arguing about bon-ton, it is clear that the developers are missing something. But that's okay, because these skits elicit quite a few smiles. The customization of the Miis, then, is another characteristic element of Tomodachi Life: in addition to feeding them and dressing them on request, we will be able to dress them up at any time with any type of dress or costume, regardless of whether they like it or not. And so it is possible to dress our best friend in a cat costume or make Samus wear a decidedly sexy outfit. It's not clear how our choices affect their behavior, if at all, but sooner or later Miis will start to form friendships or dislikes and, in some cases, even develop crushes on each other. At that point they will ask our opinion and we can encourage them to pursue or not a relationship that could turn into an engagement - complete with a proposal! - and lead to marriage, all under the eyes of the other Miis and their demiurge, in spite of voyeurism. Weddings involve the Miis living together and, in some cases, the birth of a baby... or even divorce. In Tomodachi Life this also happens, in a perverse miniature replica of real life: it is bizarre, because the Nintendo title does not want to be a life simulator, yet it offers dramatic implications with a realistic flavor, while showing them with a pinch of irony. In the general context, considering that these twists and turns only marginally affect the life of the Miis on the island, it seemed to us a somewhat exaggerated addition, beyond all the controversies that have arisen around the game in recent times (one above all on sexuality). The problem, if anything, is that all this variety of events and situations, however irrelevant, is not distributed in a homogeneous or predictable way, and the game sessions are often reduced to fulfilling the Miis' requests and challenging them in short and simple mini-games. -game in a repetitive succession that in the long run can do nothing but get tired. However, the general technical realization, quite mediocre, contributes marginally to this problem: the Miis are what they are, but Tomodachi Life is a decidedly spartan and characterless title that mixes a narrow polygonal modeling with backgrounds and photorealistic images that create a contrast not always spot on. All this, then, is accompanied by a few cheerful but highly repetitive pieces of music.", "date": "2014-06-06", "grade": "7.0"}
