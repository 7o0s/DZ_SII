Michael Jordan's adventure in the world of Looney Toons against the fearsome, but not too much, Monstars was a story capable of entertaining, entertaining and also hiding healthy morals behind the jokes between Bugs Bunny and Bill Murray, with the belief in oneself elevated to a mantra to overcome moments of difficulty. A story for everyone, for the kids of the time and for the adults of today, who find themselves having to deal more and more often with the most disparate reinterpretations of the titles they are most attached to. Even at the time of Space Jam, a video game peeped out under license, a rather mediocre arcade basketball title, but in line with the spirit of the film, where basketball was still the master. In 2021, however, things went a little differently ... Let's find out why in the review of Space Jam: A New Legacy A game full of Bugs...Bunny Lola, Bugs and LeBron ready to take down AL-G Michael Jordan passes the scepter to LeBron James as basketball's main star by bringing the Lakers, instead of the Bulls, into the spotlight. To promote Space Jam: A New Legacy, a very curious initiative was launched, so much so that in 2020 it was the budding game designers who proposed ideas for the creation of the title. A certain Ricky was elected winner thanks to his idea: a 2D scrolling fighting game with extremely simple mechanics. So if you were waiting for an NBA Jam-style basketball game you will be soundly disappointed and you will find a sweetened and simplified version of that Street of Rage 4 masterpiece on Xbox Game Pass. In this case LeBron will be joined by Lola Bunny and Bugs Bunny, ready to be selected to beat the robots led by the artificial intelligence created by the evil AL-G very hard. In our adventure we will thus have to make our way through fists, kicks and basketballs through very few levels, overcoming opponents with very little artificial intelligence and defeating a handful of bosses with just enough realization. In short, as you will have understood from these very first bars, Space Jam: A New Legacy is not exactly an unmissable title, but at least it comes in a completely free version (for Game Pass owners) and the thousand points it offers for achievements can be tempting to some collector. Completing the adventure is not a task that requires particular effort, it is enough to know that our first complete run, from the beginning of the adventure to the killing of the final boss, lasted just 35 minutes and we even got distracted in while slightly stretching the broth. We are talking about a title clearly aimed at a very young audience, whose difficulty, however, is not perfectly balanced, so much so that very few hits will be enough to finish KO. This, most likely, is because Space Jam: A New Legacy can be played by three simultaneously, but only locally. An added value for an evening on the sofa with friends or, given the ridiculous longevity, to play while waiting for the pizza to arrive. Finally, you can decide to face all the bosses in sequence in a special mode or replay the campaign on a higher difficulty, but with your first playthrough you will have basically already seen everything you need. But is there any gameplay? Space Jam: A New Legacy is a really disappointing game For those interested in learning more, know that what awaits you is absolutely nothing complex or profound. One key for basic shots, one to jump and perform flying kicks when necessary and a special area-of-effect move to damage multiple enemies simultaneously at the cost of a small portion of your life bar, a great classic in short. We will also be able to collect special cards in the game to summon the other Looney Toons to ask for help during the most agitated situations to restore our health, clean up the play area or perform unique special abilities. If in 1990 a similar game structure could be tolerated today it will be difficult to have fun with a title like this, destining this curious experiment to soon end up in oblivion. The charisma of LeBron James and the Looney Toons is not enough to erase an excessively marked repetitiveness of the enemies and a pixel art that just did not convince us, also due to poorly cared for animations and characters, understandable if we think of the very short development times elapsed from the approval of the idea to its realization but not justifiable.", "date": "2021-07-03", "grade": "5.0"}
