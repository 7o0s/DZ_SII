Sure, most of the products offered by the Sony console don't seem to take advantage of the platform's features properly, but those that have done so up to now have turned out to be quite interesting. Especially in the case of new IPs, such as the one we will be discussing in this review. Produced by Game Arts and developed by PonKotz Troops, Dokuro is a horizontal scrolling platformer with puzzle elements that tells the story of a princess locked up by a fat demon king, and for this reason a maniac of physical fitness to be obtained however through magic potions, in the dungeons of his dark fortress, whose beauty and fragility conquer the heart of a skeletal creature who works there and who bears the name that gives the title to the video game. The latter, moved with pity, decides to open the cell doors and to free the unfortunate young nobleman to help her escape. If the plot behind the production is certainly not very original, bringing to mind much more famous video games than this, the concept behind the gameplay is equally so, which is quite simple: in fact you have to help the princess avoid enemies, traps or overhangs, and therefore to move without problems along certain paths. The dry, the beautiful and the ditzy The aim of the game is in fact to make the young noble cross the scenario unscathed, bringing her to safety from a hypothetical point A to a point B, therefore until the end of each level. Which is easier said than done, given that as you progress in the adventure things get more and more complicated and it will take a lot of skill and a lot of patience to overcome some really difficult sessions, including the clashes with the bosses at the end of the area . The traps increase in number, the enemies as well and some puzzles prove to be particularly tough to solve. As if that weren't enough, the girl is not the best of intelligence and collaboration. She just runs haughty around the screen, as her rank dictates, left and right, often risking a bad end. So in addition to the problems inherent in the obstacles to move for her, the levers to operate, the jumps to be made and the demonic guards that stand between the couple and the exit from the castle, poor Dokuro, and consequently the gamer, must also worrying about not losing sight of the girl, given the ease with which she gets distracted and gets into trouble. Mind you, it doesn't act like a Lemming moving dazed towards a precipice (it usually stops) but it certainly doesn't know how to defend itself and doesn't cooperate. Luckily, the likeable skeleton can acquire new skills as the adventure progresses, above all that of being able to occasionally transform into a much stronger handsome prince and able to carry the princess in his arms when necessary. To do this, you need to drink a potion and tap twice on the Vita's touchscreen (alternatively, you can assign the command to a key). Just the controls are one of the flagships of the production, since they work quite well and respond quickly to input provided by the user. And this is true for both the classic ones and the tactile ones of the Vita, which go well with the commands linked to the buttons and the analog stick, even if it must be emphasized that they have in any case been implemented by the developers to be used minimally essential. PSVita trophies Dokuro offers players 31 Trophies, including the Platinum one. The rest are divided as follows: 5 of Gold, 9 of Silver and 16 of Bronze. To obtain them, just progress in the game and satisfy some requests, such as for example passing the various stages, holding the princess in your arms at least 200 times or collecting a certain number of coins, up to the most difficult challenges such as the one that proposes to complete all areas in a maximum time of 250 minutes or to defeat 100 monsters in skeleton form. Art and style You can thus drag a finger across the screen horizontally above a plant to make it grow rapidly so that you can jump on it to use it as an improvised escalator, or to make the water flow into holes inside which there are wooden crates which, rising to the surface, become platforms on which to jump. Or again, use virtual chalks (and fingertips) to draw trajectories useful for connecting platforms, moving chandeliers or creating fuses to connect and light candles capable of blocking demonic caarmored knights. A bit like Okami with the Celestial Brush. These are just a few examples of what the user can do in the various game areas, but the variety of situations is by no means lacking in Dokuro. There are obviously some defects, primarily those related to the detection of collisions between the little skeleton, the princess and some objects of the scenario, which can sometimes lead to an immediate and involuntary death just because one of the characters has made a slight wrong movement, and the fact that there is no checkpoint system within each level. This means that once you have died you have to start the stage from the beginning, and it is not pleasant at all when you reach the more advanced points of the game, decidedly difficult, as mentioned at the beginning, to deal with. Finally, as regards the technical part, the Game Arts title offers a particular and in its own way elegant graphic style, which rests largely on an atypical color palette focused on different shades of gray. The scenarios then, despite their technical simplicity, black or white lines that seem drawn in chalk or pencil on a blackboard or on sheets of paper, are quite captivating, with environments characterized by often interconnected geometric figures that gradually change into forms completely different, and characters whose character design cannot leave the viewer indifferent: behind an apparent underlying simplicity there is in fact an in-depth study of every single creature that appears in the video. Going to close this review, let's take a look at the audio part, which is qualitatively in line with the rest of the production: in addition to a soundtrack that goes well with the context, edited by Yasuhiro Kawasaki, the author of the music of a great classic of the past on Super Nintendo which is Illusion of Time, the excellent role-playing game by Enix, it boasts a series of ad hoc effects that accompany each action of the characters and their consequences.", "date": "2013-01-15", "grade": "8.6"}
