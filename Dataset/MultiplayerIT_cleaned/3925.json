This is already true for consoles, let alone on devices not properly designed for videogame use such as smartphones, so it is clear how difficult it can be to reproduce this type of gaming experience on mobile platforms, without the aid of traditional controls and with an approach that should somewhat follow the style of short and fragmented sessions. From these points of view, NBA 2K Mobile Basketball, as we will see in this review, does an excellent job of reproducing the bulk of the versions for gaming machines but adapting everything to a different sensibility, which prefers fast and spectacular action over of faster pace of play and more compressed tempos. It is a real reduction of the classic NBA 2K for consoles in a portable version, lightened and stripped of the numerous game options and modes present in the original and proposed in a condensed version. Everything is based on building a team of players starting from various stickers that can be won or purchased during the game, in the MyTeam mode which essentially forms the basis of the whole structure. Teams and players are based on official NBA licenses and follow the characteristics of their real counterparts, so the sense is obviously to put together a group of players as strong as possible by collecting the rarest and richest cards, possibly also making them evolve individually through the training sessions, to then launch the best formation onto the pitch. The matches take place in quick sessions of a few minutes, divided into two halves during which control over the players can be direct or managed by artificial intelligence through Auto-play, an interesting option for those who want to dedicate themselves only to the managerial component but who severely limits the gameplay, also because the CPU tends to be too skilled in our place. Indeed, it becomes almost a problem to resist the temptation to activate this option, with which the games become a little too easy. The matches instead take place along the Seasons or the Leagues, both reachable from the main screen and representing the two possible fields of action, i.e. the NBA-style single player championship, in which we find ourselves facing the various teams of the top American series of basketball, and multiplayer clashes, which allow us to test our team against other online players, moreover through a rather balanced and fast matchmaking system. NBA 2K Mobile Basketball is free-to-play, which translates into the presence of an in-game currency that can also be purchased with real money: this allows you to recharge the energy bar that is consumed by taking part in games and sessions game or to buy new cards without great effort, but in both cases they are rather free and never overwhelming choices. Basketball in your pocket The control system is based on a simplified version of the classic NBA 2K interface, reducing everything to a few commands arranged on the screen according to the ~virtual joypad~ principle, with all the traditional problems that this solution entails. ~Analog stick~ on the left and various buttons on the right, this system allows you to perform the main movements with or without the ball, such as passes and shots in the attack phase or pressing, ~stealing~ the ball from the opponents' hands and blocks from the other . There is therefore a simplified but rather broad control of the player in 3D, the problem here is represented by the solution adopted (and rather inevitable) considering that a virtual controller on the screen never represents a precise and comfortable solution for the player. This is particularly true in the most agitated phases of the games, when even the fact of finding and touching the right keys is not everyone's business. The impossibility of setting up sensible actions due to this control system can lead, out of frustration, to the use of auto-play, in fact triggering a sort of vicious circle that is quite harmful to the fruition of the game, therefore the problem of the controls it is not to be underestimated. On the other hand, all the rest of NBA 2K Mobile Basketball is particularly enjoyable, with clear and well-designed menus and a progressive and collectible mechanic at the base of collecting the various stickers which, as we have seen in years of NBA 2K and FIFA, always works very well. Well. It is clearly a small reduction of the original, but carries with it the elements that probablyand are more attractive or which are in any case more suitable to be transferred to a mobile context. The whole structure of the game obviously tends towards the collection of stickers, considering that the progression - as regards victories in single and multiplayer - is always marked by the possibility of obtaining new ones through the ~draft~ system, a sort of lottery with discovery of new cards. This, combined with the fact of being able to increase the value of individual players by subjecting them to various training sessions, determines considerable care in building one's team. For the rest, the graphics are simply impressive: clearly there is a certain scalability in terms of complexity and performance also based on the power of the hardware, but in general the achievements of NBA 2K Mobile Basketball in terms of graphics quality are truly remarkable. considering that the style points directly to the realistic one of the major simulations, without many simplifications.", "date": "2018-12-01", "grade": "8.0"}
