{"name": "Il gioco definitivo?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/181607-playerunknowns-battleground-il-gioco-definitivo.html", "text": "Although the market is saturated with a series of titles always belonging to the same genres, one cannot fail to consider the quantity of players who ask for further iterations at every opportunity. Populated by early access titles and fundraising campaigns, the situation regarding the so-called battle royale is getting more and more crowded. Born as a mod for Arma 2 and 3, it is a mode that stages a classic last man standing within a map that is initially very extensive and which is reduced from time to time to concentrate players in a specific point. After years of working on the aforementioned mods and fine-tuning the now hugely popular H1Z1's King of the Kill, original creator Playerunknown had the chance to make his own title. Don't think you're dealing with something new or particular distortions of the formula. Playerunknown's Battlegrounds responds to the usual simple rules, but combining them with a series of details that are decreeing its enormous success. Battle Royales are enriched with an exceptional new contender with Playerunknown's Battlegrounds Team that wins, little changes When the battle royale mod for Arma came out a few years ago, what decreed its success was the incredible immediacy, combined with the high rate of competitiveness and adrenaline that each game was able to generate. Over the years this formula has been perfected, becoming very famous and decreeing the success of games like H1Z1. DayZ's survival contender, developed by the guys from Daybreakers is going through a new youth, thanks also to the help of the media boost generated by the various online streamers. For this reason, the original creator and collaborator of King of the Kill himself, aware of the enormous success of his idea, has seen fit to find the funds and a team capable of creating his definitive game. After a long development and a beautifully managed beta phase, the title was released last week, in strict Early Access. Strengthened by the fame generated next to the rather evocative nickname of the creator, the game tries to put together all the good things that have been done in recent years. Removing where it was appropriate to remove and adding where there were some flaws. So the idea remains unchanged: a hundred players - alone or divided into groups of two, three or four people - are brutally launched into a map that is always the same, but with a series of different elements with each new game. The generation of weapons, armor and possible airdrops arriving from the skies form the core of the gameplay. Already from the deployment you can see a small but huge difference with its largest and current contender. While in H1Z1 you are parachuted into a random point from the game itself, in Playerunknown's Battlegrounds we will decide when to jump from a cargo plane that contains the total amount of players. Choosing the place in which to launch is the first of the great possibilities that the game offers. Making the wrong choice means finding yourself in the middle of the wildest fire already after the first few seconds but, on the other hand, if you were lucky enough to fall on top of an assault rifle, it only takes a few moments and you are armed and ready to make a carnage, immediately accumulating a large amount of game currency. We will return to the latter later. From the moment they land, veterans of the genre will feel right at home. It will be a matter of going around houses and warehouses, accumulating weapons, ammunition, healing items and possibly a means with which to move quickly on an extensive, but not boundless, map. Just the search for objects has one of the enormous differences with H1Z1: where the latter made crafting a fundamental element, Playerunknown's Battlegrounds eliminates this feature altogether, adding accessories for the various weapons. The writer found this extraordinary choice and extremely congenial to the gameplay. The not incredible amount of weapons present is therefore fleshed out by the possibility of adding telescopic, holographic sights, kicks, silencers, extended magazines and so on and so forth. This means that two players with the same shotgun will hardly have the same accessories equipped. From here on everything takes place as always, with a different gimmick than that of the gas to restrict the playable map area, which is replaced by an electric dome of ~kingiana~ memory. If this is exceeded, it gradually reduces our energy more and more. The ultimate goal remains the same: to remain the only ones alive on the map to enjoy eternal glory, in the secothem of the centuries! I got rich The issue of rewards and the monetary management of the title deserves a small note. At the moment it is not possible to buy anything with real money. Based on a series of parameters in the game, you receive a certain amount of coins, which can be spent to buy boxes containing an item to wear. The system devised by the BlueHole guys is interesting: with each purchase of a box, the next one will cost an ever-increasing amount, until the weekly reset which will bring the cost back to the original price. This tends to ensure that an incredible difference in level is not created between one player and another, although these are certainly not elements that change games, but pure aesthetics. It has also recently opened the market linked to Steam in which players sell - at crazy prices - the objects recovered during their games. A concept that has been dear since the days of Counter Strike, but which has also made the fortune of the aforementioned H1Z1. Optimization, this (un)known User reviews on Steam speak for themselves. Although difficult to consider from a ~journalistic~ point of view, reading hundreds of comments that praise the game, but beat it from the point of view of optimization, perfectly explains the condition of the title. Just today - Thursday as we write these lines - Battlegrounds received a very substantial update patch, which went to fix a series of optimization flaws, which make it much more digestible by a different multitude of configurations. If it is true that the title, strengthened by considerable graphics compared to direct competition, struggles to run well on mid-range computers, it is equally fair to assert that by fiddling a bit with the graphic options, a more than acceptable frame rate can be reached . The developers have promised daily patches for minor tweaks, weekly for more demanding optimizations, and monthly for new content rollouts. The conditions for excellent support are all on the plate, now it's up to the BlueHole guys to confirm the good intentions. However, one cannot fail to take into consideration the more than discreet general technical level and an aiming and ballistics system, halfway between simulation and arcade, which works perfectly. Aiming and shooting is a pleasure and the creator's experience on a simulation title like ArmA has allowed him to play with his skills to create the perfect hybrid. If you add to this a spectator mode that allows you to watch your companions if unfortunately you are dead, you understand well how Playerunknown's Battlegrounds forcefully enters the panorama of the genre, with the intention of making a clean sweep of all the competition. Just look at his sales numbers and success on platforms like Twitch to understand that the goal is increasingly within reach.", "date": "2017-03-31", "grade": null}
