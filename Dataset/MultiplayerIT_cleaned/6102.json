If the 70s were a time of breaking the rules and free love and the 80s were the era of lightheartedness, the moment we are living in is undoubtedly characterized by recovery. In fact, more than ever we are witnessing a continuous looting of what was in the past in cinema, fashion, art, music and even video games. Everything seems to have been created to thrill thirty-somethings who can't wait to relive the happy period of their childhood and young people who yearn in the simulation of a nostalgia made up of reboots, quotations and blatant copies. Even the first Evoland was part of this vein, more than a game it was a sort of collage with references and winks made on purpose to melt the heart of those who had trained with the great classics, from Zelda to Final Fantasy, passing through Super Mario. Its problem was perhaps a certain lack of depth and the fact that it was obviously not made for smaller players. With this new chapter Shiro Games seems to have broadened the horizon of the game, multiplying quotes, story and game modes, but once again most of the references are mainly dedicated to the old guard. Evoland 2: more than a game, a guided tour through the history of video games Stroll through time A bit like Chrono Trigger, one of the many sources of inspiration, Evoland 2 is a title that makes temporal paradoxes its strong point by representing each era with a different graphic style linked to the evolution of video games. The distant past will therefore have the monochromatic tones of the Game Boy, the future detailed 3D graphics, while the eras in between will follow the transition from 8 to 16 bit. The story of Evoland 2 tells of yet another memoryless and nameless hero who wakes up in a village and is looked after by a girl who tries to make him remember who he is. The world, on the other hand, is a sort of vaguely steampunk fantasy realm in which men and demons have always fought for supremacy. Our task will be to experience all the phases of this conflict while trying to understand who we are and why some people seem to remember us, not always in a friendly way. And since time travel will be the main theme, we will be able to see the world and the population grow and evolve around us, also according to our choices. Paradoxically, it may even happen to meet characters in the future who remember us because in the next section we will meet them in the past. We know, it sounds crazy and tangled, but with time paradoxes it always is! An avalanche of quotes Like the previous chapter, Evoland 2 is more than a real game, it is a gallery of references, winks and moments that want to retrace the history and genres that characterize the world of video games. It can happen that you meet Lara Croft, spot the carnivorous plants of Super Mario or escape from a prison by hiding in a box, complete with a co-star who is amazed that the guards are so stupid and scripted and so on, a sea of quotes in which is easy to get lost. The main part of the game is done in The Legend of Zelda style, same view, same bushes to cut, same monsters to kill, same sword and as many characters to talk to. You can even come across a woman who is very angry because a guy dressed in green has destroyed all her vases with his sword. But this is only the beginning, because in Evoland 2 there are platformers, Candy Crush, Guitar Hero, Bomberman, turn-based mind-fights, puzzles, shooters, endless runners, Street Fighter-style fighting games and even a card game. It is no coincidence that at a certain point one of the characters says ~Let's hope we don't end up in a future made only of shooters!~ Unfortunately with this swirl of different gameplay not everyone has succeeded perfectly, especially in the more intense platform sections the controls are not as precise as they should therefore it can happen that you have to redo a portion of the level due to a mistake in the collision, fortunately the checkpoints are well distributed. As far as the puzzles and plot points are concerned, in most cases we will know more or less what to do, but there are also moments in which to advance we will proceed at random trying to hit or interact with everything around us. Learn the lesson Even if some defects remain, Evoland 2 has undoubtedly treasured the observations made in the first chapter. The characters level up, we can manage inventory, improve equipment and almost everythingwhat we see on the screen is useful for something, even if it's just to make us laugh with yet another meta-videogame joke. However, if the first chapter was all too simple and full of useless fights, here the difficulty is undoubtedly fluctuating and you go from fairly easy sections to ~ragequit~ risk moments in just a few minutes. In particular, some bosses are very tough and in one case we happened to have to repeat everything from scratch because a bug had blocked our alter ego in the wall. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that if the original Evoland was inspired above all by Diablo and Final Fantasy, here the reference genres are many more. However it is a pity not being able to progress in the story, which is interesting anyway, just because the boss of the shooter section is really too tough to swallow or because the character jumped badly. Luckily the really difficult parts aren't that many and overall they don't affect a really fun and exciting gaming experience.", "date": "2015-08-25", "grade": "8.0"}
