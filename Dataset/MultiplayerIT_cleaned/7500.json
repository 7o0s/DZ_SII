Structure Echoes of Magic, the expansive explorable hub The one proposed by Echoes of Magic is actually a strange and unprecedented mix, given that it starts from a very traditional structure, with a chaotic central hub full of texts and icons, as per the Eastern tradition, from which you access numerous missions set in ten different scenarios and side modes, which at a certain point even include competitive battles for eight participants. The interface is really confusing and it will take you a few hours to familiarize yourself with all its items: it's a shame, because focusing on a more dry and simple could have played in favor of this experience. In any case, the monetization needs, with the various microtransactions, appear very clear right from the start and manifest themselves with an unpleasant paywall starting from the fourth chapter of the campaign. Gameplay Echoes of Magic, the boss fight in a frozen scenario The peculiarities of Echoes of Magic as far as gameplay is concerned are linked, as mentioned, to the use of classes and skills, which work within a dynamic system in which we are not asked to choose what type of warrior we want him to become our character, but you switch seamlessly from one approach to another thanks to switches. Mighty warrior or bow and arrow shooter? Or quick killer? There are twenty classes, but no limit, and the same goes for the skills, many, which we will be able to organize in different sets and equip as needed, as long as we do it before facing enemies. In terms of layout, the touch controls they manage everything through a constellation of small buttons that surround the one responsible for the main attack, while the classic virtual stick allows you to move, but even here the feeling is of excessive abundance thrown in too quickly. Echoes of Magic, a special ability among many selectable In short, taken by the eagerness to show users all that the game has to offer, the developers have not considered a more gradual progression system in the slightest, limiting themselves to guiding us through the tutorials in an automated way, but without making us understand much of what happens , the role of objectives and the inevitable prize boxes, equipment and special powers. In short, you find yourself with a wide repertoire of moves to manage, each with its own cooldown, as in the most typical action RPGs with a three-quarter isometric view and a rather rich bestiary of enemies, which counts something like a hundred different creatures and quite a few huge bosses. The problem is that once in the field, the feedback from the clashes is modest, the impacts are not valued and bizarre accelerations occur that seem to be set on purpose to create artificial obstacles. Graphics and sound Echoes of Magic, our character's inventory Even from a technical point of view, the title of Onefun Games proves to be highly contradictory. In fact, if the graphics can count on an excellent use of cel shading and colors, as well as on a set of options that allow you to scale the experience even on older devices (but we with an iPhone 12 Pro were able to focus on quality maximum and 60 fps), the sound is perhaps one of the worst we have heard in recent years. The musical accompaniment is in fact extremely generic and repetitive to the point of becoming annoying, and when you put it on mute you are practically enveloped in silence, given that the scenarios do not produce any noise, not even that of our steps, and the only thing we will hear will eventually be the blows exchanged with the opponents: a really poor sound design.", "date": "2022-05-20", "grade": "6.5"}
