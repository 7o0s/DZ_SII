A couple of crossroads, some trivial dialogue and a little character in the words of heroes and enemies. Unfortunately Arcania: Gothic 4, after about 20 minutes of almost open gameplay, left out all of this, taking us along a largely bare corridor. Sure, there were a couple of open environments, some tough golems, and some unique encounters. But in essence it was a few minutes of gameplay lost in several hours of repetitive fights and crowned with a disappointing ending. With Arcania: Fall of Setarrif, Spellbound, now under the wing of Nordic Games who have acquired JoWood, tries to improve the offer with a standalone expansion that serves as an epilogue and closes all the remaining loose ends. Towards the grand finale Rhobar the third is finally seated on the throne and the situation finally seems to be under control. But what happened to the city of Setarrif and where have all the heroes of the realm gone? In the chaos generated by an impending war and by infernal creatures, everyone has forgotten about it. And where is the demon who controlled King Rhobar III hiding? These and other questions whirl in the heads of the ~responsible~ of the kingdom, but like all ~responsible~ even those of Arcania are reluctant to take real action and therefore guess who will have to come back to see if everything is in order. Of course, we hadn't had enough since those quiet days when we thought that a couple of sheep and a bow would have been more than enough to marry the supermodel of the village. From the point of view of involvement, and this is immediately evident, the work of the developers is weak. The engine is still valid but the environments are less well-finished with HD textures alongside low-resolution elements that compromise the overall performance. Furthermore, the locations are extremely similar to those of the main chapter, if we exclude a skimpy jungle, with the dungeons that are even more anonymous and the destroyed Setarrif that seems automatically generated by a computer. The biggest problem, however, is on the narrative front. It starts with an anonymous cut-scene that frames a couple of lava flows to get to a screen that allows us to load the character used in Gothic 4 or to choose one of three presets which are warrior, mage and archer. The intro is all here with the character relegated to the role of a soulless puppet who expresses his faded character in a couple of side situations. Dodge, fold, dodge, dive and dodge We start the title already armored with tons of chests defended by extremely weak monsters. Obviously this is a trick, which further worsens the degree of involvement in this stand-alone expansion, aimed at allowing us to immediately use crafting to further enhance the equipment. As far as combat is concerned, the formula is the same as in Gothic 4, slow spells to avoid, hand-to-hand combat to be resolved as soon as possible by pressing like madmen and loaded shots to be avoided with the somersault. It is obviously possible to strike from a distance, with arrows and spells, and combinations such as ice spells and arrows are always effective. In fact, slowing down and targeting with a bow allows you to exterminate many enemies before they get close. Obviously the runes also return, which guarantee timed powers such as greater running speed, and there is no shortage of various potions that allow you to further speed up the experience and which are therefore essential if you intend to see how it all ends without suffer too much. On the other hand, starting with the character who has already pumped skills eliminates the feeling of growth and mercilessly kills the balance, making this expansion even flatter than the main title. Much of Arcania: Fall of Setarrif is in fact little more than dj vu with new monsters that are slightly changed versions of the old ones, rather easy fights and extremely repetitive situations. Luckily there is something new. It's about the possibility of using our allies to experience some flashbacks of what happened in Setarrif shortly before our arrival. This allows us to use the skills of the characters we find ourselves controlling, but the possibility has been wasted with short, linear and poor bite missions. More than an expansion, a reduction The whole thing takes about 5 hours. Not a few for an expansion but decidedly not full-bodied and devoid of relevant news. In fact, as you may have guessed from the words spent previously, the contents are not exciting. Of course, if you enjoyed the plot of the first chapter hereyou will find the conclusion of many events that began in Gothic 4. Furthermore, the dialogues, dubbed in English and subtitled in Italian, are not lacking and are sometimes even more entertaining than those of the previous chapter. But in most cases the words of the characters remain unable to involve us and moreover in this round the cut scenes and the shots of the dialogues are, without mincing words, of the lowest quality. In short, Arcania: Fall of Setarrif offers us a couple of situations, a meddlesome sheep, bogus crossroads in the dialogues and the possibility of guiding some other PG in addition to ours. In addition to this we find the same combat and the same crafting of the first chapter but with fewer recipes, fewer objects, fewer plants, fewer minerals and so on. In a nutshell, the offer is not sufficient to justify the expense of 15 euros when there are entire role-playing games of excellent quality that can be found at a cheaper price. From an aesthetic point of view, the engine remains valid, although by now PC has already moved on to the next generation, but Spellbound has managed to worsen its performance with masochistic commitment. The lighting is excellent, some textures are good and the vegetation is decidedly rich, although still affected by some not very credible or grainy element. On the contrary, the textures of the ground leave much to be desired and the contrast with the excellent quality of the main character enhances its defects. To this must be added less inspired locations, smaller and less refined, the silly interlude scenes, the dialogues framed at random and the decidedly anonymous structures, incomparable with what we saw in Gothic 4. Furthermore the shadows generated by the sun, which credibly follow the movement of the light, now they move by visibly snapping and in this way they almost completely ruin the suggestion generated by one of the most refined elements of the engine. Fortunately, so to speak, the damage is minimal since the open spaces have been reduced to small and anonymous courtyards for chickens. In fact, the excellent vegetation soon leaves room for repetitive scenarios and the usual anonymous dungeon that leads us towards the final battle, full of monsters but decidedly poor in imagination.", "date": "2011-11-03", "grade": "5.0"}
