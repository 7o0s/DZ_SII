{"name": "Disney's Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disneys-magical-quest-starring-mickey-mouse.html", "text": "In Magical Quest there is a background story that sees Mickey Mouse (or Minnie) wandering through the six levels that make up the game in search of Pluto, kidnapped by King Gambadilegno. The six levels are divided into three or four sub-levels, some of which will see you engaged in boss fights. However, the mechanics do not differ much from the classic platformers and consist in jumping from platform to platform, leaping on the heads of enemies (once to stun them and possibly throw them at other enemies, twice to eliminate them completely), collecting fruit for increase the score and money to be used in some shops to buy energy supplies or useful items to be able to use the three clothes in the game. The gimmick of the change of clothes is the only distinctive note of this title and helps to add a minimum of reasoning on how to deal with the various stages and end-of-level bosses. At the beginning you will have the classic look of Mickey Mouse (the one with the shorts and suspenders) but as you progress you will be able to wear a wizard suit that allows you to throw lightning bolts and be able to swim underwater for a long time, the firefighter suit equipped a fire hydrant useful for turning off and moving burning platforms and finally a climber costume equipped with a harpoon to be able to cling to platforms that would otherwise be impossible to reach. The change of clothes can take place at any time of the game and is accompanied by a nice skit. To a fairly simple mechanics and devoid of original solutions on how to deal with the various levels (maybe because Mario Sunshine happened to me?) is added a only discreet technical realization that disfigures compared to some productions designed exclusively for GBA (Pinobee, Rayman, etc). The backgrounds, while being appreciated for a good use of the color palette, are quite bare and lose comparison with the similar version for SNES. However, the rather inspired design of some bosses and the presence, in some circumstances, of good-level special effects are to be appreciated. Even the sound is not the best, not so much for the quality of the songs which are very catchy (in typical Disney style), but for the lack of use of the potential of the GBA sound chip; in a nutshell it seems to have returned to the quality of the old Game Boy with a clearly perceptible difference compared to the latest production. This lack is also reflected in the sound effects, moreover not present in the right amount. Where the programmers have spent some of their time is the section dedicated to multiplayer (two players with a single cartridge) made up of mini games useful for spending some time with a friend and the possibility of connecting the GBA to the Game Cube , to use items purchased in Disney's Magical Mirror game. Ultimately a title certainly aimed at a very young audience but which fails, due to a too simple and banal mechanics, a reduced longevity (you end up in a few hours also helped by the continuous infinites) and a medium-level technical realization , to fascinate the most experienced users. Pros: It's Mickey Mouse! Catchy music Some end-of-level bosses Cons: Improved graphics and sound Too simple Levels without original ideas The GBA will go down in history as the most ported console ever created; I don't think I'm exaggerating if I say that at least half of the games that are placed on the market are conversions of titles previously released on the SNES, the ~home~ console of which the GBA seems to be the portable version. If for certain ~titles~ it may be attractive, it is less so for games of only a moderate level, for which a complete remake would have been more appropriate. D.M.Q.S.M.M. unfortunately it belongs to the latter category since it is an old-fashioned platform that has no defects such as to classify it as ~videogame garbage~ but which in any case has nothing that can make it emerge in the flood of similar titles present on the GBA.", "date": "2002-11-29", "grade": null}
