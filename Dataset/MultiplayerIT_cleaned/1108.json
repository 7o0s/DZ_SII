{"name": "La recensione di Tribes: Vengeance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-recensione-di-tribes-vengeance.html", "text": "The most important structural novelty is certainly the implementation, for the first time in this series, of a single-player component that satisfies the justified curiosity of fans regarding the background of the Tribes universe. So don't think of a sort of training-tutorial (even if in the end, it also performs this function) with the usual bots to familiarize yourself with the commands but of a real adventure complete with a plot and cutscenes, in which the stories of 6 different characters will intertwine (including some rather ~peculiar~ but I won't tell you more because I don't want to spoil the surprise), components of the various ~tribes~ (and not only) and where there will be some variations on the subject rather interesting as some levels in which we will not have even a miserable fire mouth available. The single component is a real adventure complete with a plot and cutscenes The narrative will be structured chronologically over two generations (with the events of the two princesses, mother and daughter, Victoria and Julia at the center) and we will finally discover the reason for the conflicts between empire and tribe. There will be shocking twists and surprises even if the level of the plot is not exactly at the highest levels. Despite this, the 10-15 hours you will need to complete the campaign run off very well thanks to a good variety of situations and the scripting of the opponents proves to be qualitatively high even for an adequate artificial intelligence. Certainly, however, it is the multiplayer component on which Tribes relies to catalyze the attention of the Pcistica videogame community. By referring you to the box dedicated to the various modes provided for the 15 maps present (we hope that others will be made available soon ...), let's move on to the main features of the Sierra signed fragmentation. As I already wrote in the preview, here I reiterate that the use of the jetpack, Tribes' ~exclusivity trademark~, still makes the difference with the other online FPSs. It is not only the wonderful sensation of freedom that one feels in flying without the need for any mechanical means, but this element has a decisive influence on the modality of the battles themselves: of course, there are moments in which you will try to use up as many magazines as possible against the 'opponent, but the freedom of action given by the jetpack leads to a much more refined battle that requires a strategically very advanced team game. If we then add an excellent arsenal of weapons and vehicles (in both cases, enriched with new elements), the variety that three different types of armor (light, medium, heavy) can give, the additional possibilities that the anti-friction boots give us to slide on various elements even in combination with the jetpack, you can easily understand that Tribes Vengeance has fully achieved the goal to continue the uniqueness already so much appreciated in the previous chapters. Some perplexity perhaps arises from the 5 methods that do not offer a high rate of innovation compared to competitors. Tribes Vengeance has fully achieved the goal of continuing the uniqueness already so appreciated in the previous chapters How to play Tribalwar with friends Are you ready to become the protagonists of TribalWar, the most popular sport of the 35th century? If the answer is positive, know that you will be able to fraggare in the company of 31 other players (exclusively human: no possibility of inserting bots) in a maximum of 5 different modes that I am going to present to you Arena: Behind this name hides the most classic of team death matches but divided into several rounds. At the time of your elimination, you will have to wait for the next one So long to make your murderous fury grow in you. Ball: Clearly inspired by the mode present in Unreal Tournament, with Ball, Tribes Vengeance turns into a decidedly violent handball in which we will have to score into the opponent's goal by making our way through players to whom fair play is very little interested Fuel: Collect the fuel containers (up to a maximum of 15) scattered on the game map and bring them back to the depot as quickly as possible without getting killed since otherwise this will penalize your team's score.Capture The Flag: There is very little to say on capture the flag, the most appreciated and popular game mode by the ~tribal~ people. I can only confirm that the supremacy over the other variants is clearly visible by observing the various game servers.Rabbit: Variant of Capture The Flag, you will have to try to keep the banner as long as possible while all the others will hunt you like poor scared bunnies  Tribes against everyone Once we get to the audiovisual aspect, I go backWe are faced with the difficult task of giving a value meaning to what we see and hear when running on our Vengeance PCs. The difficulty arises from the fact of considering the work of Irrational Games as a product in its own right or in comparison with other similar titles. In the first case, the tribes make an excellent impression thanks above all to some visual effects such as the smoke emitted by the departing jetpacks and the colored light trails while we are in flight which give a truly pleasant touch of glamour. Moreover, the physics of the interactions remains at very high levels to which must be added the excellent animations of the contenders. If we compare it to Half Life 2 and Doom 3 from a technical point of view, Sierra's game comes out rather resized But if we place ourselves in the perspective of comparing TVs to the authentic protagonists of the season such as Half Life 2 and Doom 3, Sierra's game comes out rather resized especially as regards the textures with which the environments were built, decidedly subdued and not even comparable with the cult objects just mentioned. Another problem is the remarkable aesthetic resemblance that the game has with Unreal Tournament 2004 (besides having the game graphics engine in common, the Unreal Engine in version 2.5): someone could argue that Epic borrowed some elements in the past from Tribes but today UT is a point of reference for multiplayer on PC and therefore a greater visual diversification would have been desirable, also in order not to pass Tribes, in the eyes of less experienced players, a sort of clone of the Atari production. Brief note on the sound that remains at adequate levels with musical compositions in line with the genre of belonging. Too bad for the total lack of localization (not even in the subtitles) to which unfortunately Vivendi Universal Italia is getting us used to... Comment Taking such an important title generated by others and giving it new life was by no means an easy task but the Australians of Irrational Games have largely succeeded in their goal. Tribes Vengeance confirms the uniqueness of the gameplay of the series which after so many years confirms that it has unique somatic traits (the use of the jetpack in primis), for the moment not yet replicated by others who have decided to move on other coordinates. The inclusion of a real single component, definitely appreciable from every point of view, the novelties in terms of weapons and vehicles and a technical realization full of touches of class (starting from the colored trails that jetpacks leave sublime!) are the excellent ~dowry~ that the programmers have brought to this new chapter awaited for many years. On the other hand, however, we cannot fail to take into consideration the fact that Tribes Vengeance comes out simultaneously with the authentic protagonists of the season such as Half-Life 2 and Doom 3 with which a technical comparison is disheartening for the Irrational creature, especially as regards the detail of the textures with which the various game environments were built. The excessive aesthetic similarity with Unreal Tournament 2004 and the lack of innovation in the multiplayer modes are the other two weak points for a title that we however warmly recommend for its uniqueness and its high play value in the strictest sense of the term. We're tribes, We're tribes, We're tribes generation! Pros: Tribes remains unique in the panorama of online FPS Very appreciable single game mode Some valuable aesthetic elements Cons: Technologically behind the new sacred monsters (Half Life 2 and Doom 3) Visually too similar to Unreal Tournament 2004 Not too innovative game modes Tremble, tremble, the tribes are back! And yes, that's right: after many years of waiting, the well-known Dinamix brand (which has unfortunately ceased to exist in the meantime) returns to our homes for another adventure based on jetpacks and shooting. As many of you already know, Vivendi has entrusted the creation of Vengeance to the Australians of Irrational Games, known to the general public thanks to some excellent works such as System Shock 2 and Freedom Force. What to do then when you have in your hands the great responsibility of carrying on a series that has a large niche of very loyal and faithful fans?
