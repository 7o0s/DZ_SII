It is a subtle difference, an essential concept on which Insomniac Games builds the entire narrative structure of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Having already told the origins of Miles in the PlayStation 4 episode, the very first minutes of this pseudo-sequel quickly summarize the character of the new protagonist, his passions, but also the context in which he lives and the prejudices he will have to face when wearing the costume from spider. A recent mover to the Harlem neighborhood, Miles is eager to help his neighbors, make new acquaintances in his community, and has inherited a strong civic sense from his mother. In addition to being more outgoing, Miles is also more stylish than Peter, loves listening to hip pop music, wears brands and adores the street art that colors the streets of ~El Barrio~. However, the excitement and sense of loss of living in a new area of the city last a few seconds, because - exactly as in the incipit of the first Marvel's Spider-Man - duty calls (literally) and it's time to put on your superhero costume . For the review of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales we thus return to swinging among the skyscrapers of a New York which, this time on PlayStation 5, has never been so beautiful. There's a new spider in town Miles is not Peter, we said. Yet Spider-Man: Miles Morales makes us relive that maturation of the protagonist that was missing in the first episode. In fact, on PS4 we met an already shrewd, casual Peter Parker who is familiar with his powers and knows well the responsibility of being Spider-Man. Miles, on the other hand, is a novice Spider-Man, an impulsive hero who is only now discovering his abilities and still unclear what the weight of being the guardian of New York is. Especially when the town's favorite hero decides to take a vacation. The Little Boy, the denizens who populate the streets of Manhattan call him, not only because he looks clearly younger than the original, but because he has a tendency to cause more damage than he fixes. The Insomniac animators did an excellent job of communicating Miles' inexperience: his swinging between the buildings of the city is awkward, reckless, he seems to continually lose his balance, while maintaining that sense of fluidity, speed and dynamism that made the New York of Marvel's Spider-Man one of the most fun open worlds to traverse in a video game. In the initial stages, Miles strives in every way to emulate Peter, and we who play perceive this in the enormous sense of dj vu: from the tutorial - a copy-paste from the previous episode - to the combat system which, on the ground as in the air, is based on the same successful foundations of the original. Even the costume that Miles wears at the beginning of the adventure bears the colors of the first Spider-Man, giving the false impression of being in front of a new DLC rather than a new episode. It is only when the venom power comes into play that things begin to change: the protagonist discovers that he can master bioelectric discharges, use them in combat or to move, and both for him and for the player begins a path that will lead him to become a Spider -Man with his own identity. The venom power doesn't just increase the power of Miles' blows, but introduces new attacks, techniques and skills that can be combined with each other, extend chains of blows, allow you to move from one point to another in a flash, but above all allow to keep multiple enemies at bay at the same time, where the old Spidey's approach was more one-on-one oriented. The result is a combat system that is not only more complete, but also more disruptive and challenging. The other ability with which Miles distinguishes himself from Peter is in the ability to hide, becoming practically invisible for a handful of seconds and thus being able to eliminate opponents in a stealthy way or run away if he finds himself in difficulty. Concealment makes stealth feel more ~intimate~, allows you to get closer to enemies and take greater risks, but at the same time introduces a sense of urgency, as camouflage time is reduced when attacking. As you enhance the different techniques and climb the skill tree, more devastating area shots are unlocked, the concealment lasts longer and the venom power charges increase, but to avoid the experience becoming too simple Insomniac introduced new enemies and new weapons designed to neutralize the powers of Miles. To mark the passage of time, some construction sites from the first Spider-Man are now complete buildings Over time the protagonist's animations become more convinced, saferand explosive, the inhabitants of New York begin to comment on his actions, which are reported by the usual Daily Bugle by J. Jonah Jameson but also by the underground podcast Danikast. However, this awareness on the part of the protagonist ends in the first half of the game, because once people's prejudices have been overcome and the spider-impostor syndrome has passed, Miles finds himself facing a decidedly more familiar (and familiar) story, with some characters successful and a couple of very emotional sequences, but which in general does not have the breath and impetuous strength of the first Spider-Man. The reason is partly due to a problem that unites all superhero games: you just need to know a little about the starting universe, its characters and its villains, and what should be sensational twists completely lose their strength . However, Insomniac must be recognized for the attempt to rethink and re-propose the figure of Tinkerer (the Repairman), undoubtedly the best defined and most interesting opponent of this episode. Unfortunately, also to the demerit of others. In addition to being few and telephoned, in fact, the main bosses of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales rarely give life to memorable and truly exciting fights, occasionally testing Miles' skills but never pushing them to the extreme as a fact - for example - from Vulture and Electro in the first Spider-Man. Costumes from another world To distinguish himself from the original Spider-Man, Miles will be wearing his iconic black and red suit very soon. But with great power comes great wardrobes, and so during the adventure in Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales it is possible to unlock a fair number of extra costumes (about twenty), each characterized by modifications and customizations that can give a gear more in combat or introduce small cosmetic changes. Among the most successful is undoubtedly the Ragnoverse costume, taken directly from the animated feature film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse), and which replicates the peculiar ~two~ animation technique seen in the movie. The slow motion effect of Miles' animations is surprising and effective when doing stunts through Manhattan, but it makes melee combat much more complicated and difficult to read. Luckily, one costume's modifications and upgrades can be deactivated and even applied to other outfits, while Components and Tokens earned through side activities unlock and upgrade Miles' gadgets, from a web shooter to a holographic drone that assists him in battle, right down to a gravity blast that pulls enemies to a specific spot. Feeling Spider-Man The neighborhood of Harlem has been extensively rebuilt from the first Spider-Man While New York's survival is always high at stake, the story and subplots of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales give the impression that Miles' story is a parenthesis within a larger tale. It is not necessarily a negative aspect, since the Harlem Spider-Man is the protagonist of an adventure that is certainly less epic, but certainly no less personal, which through ordinary and intimate moments makes us appreciate more the nuances of some supporting actors. However, it is when one swings among the skyscrapers of the immense American city, between dives, shots and pirouettes, that one almost forgets any imperfection in the work of Insomniac Games, because - like and more than in Marvel's Spider-Man - the sensation that it feels to traverse the map is unequivocally the most liberating and galvanizing that can happen to you in an open world game. Insomniac has added dozens of new animations into the game's stunt system Blending a sense of explosive speed, perfect feel of the controls, smooth animations and cinematic sound design, the first Spider-Man flawlessly managed to communicate the idea of being Spider-Man, making New York City his playground. It was the fulfillment of a fantasy. Here, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales does not dare to touch that perfect formula, but limits itself to enriching it with a couple of skills related to the venom power. Again, moving from one corner of Manhattan to the other is an exhilarating experience, and taking a detour in Central Park, stopping a crime in Midtown, or stretching to pick up a collectible in Hell's Kitchen is never dull or repetitive, even though Miles Morales suffers from the same poverty and flatness that characterized the missions and secondary activities of the previous episode. As you swing between the buildings of the city you find yourself continually stopping to look for a lost kitten, picked uphiring audio samples or recovering stolen goods, all trivial chores, but which never get heavy precisely because they represent an excuse to do a few more twirls in mid-air. Rarely do you want to fast travel, even if doing so has never been so convenient in terms of time saved: uploads to PlayStation 5 are absolutely instantaneous, whether it's using the subway, loading the last checkpoint after a game over or switch from interior settings to the streets of Manhattan. Probably some loading is cleverly hidden by an intermission scene or by some ingenious technical and level design gimmick, but once you enter the game, the feeling is simply that there are no moments of waiting. Point. Miles Murals Like the real Harlem, the one in the game is also full of murals that tell the culture and roots of the predominantly Puerto Rican community that inhabits the northern neighborhood of Manhattan also known as El Barrio. In Miles Morales these paintings are done by Hailey Cooper, a deaf street artist who also uses her art to support Spider-Man. While wandering the streets of the neighborhood it is not uncommon to come across a mural depicting Spidey or satirizing his opponents. However, Hailey is only one of the inhabitants of Harlem that Miles will get to know, and in the course of the side missions he will have to deal with the owner of a bodega, with a barber who knows everyone's business or with the new girl who runs the shelter F.E.A.S.T.. Even when away from home, Spider-Man will never feel alone, constantly accompanied by Danikast's podcasts, JJJ's chatter at the Daily Bugle or constant phone calls from his mother Rio or his best friend and ally Ganke. New York in a new light The photo mode returns, with a large number of new options and filters The city itself makes your stay in New York even more memorable. For Miles Morales, Insomniac Games has obviously recycled a huge amount of graphic assets created for Marvel's Spider-Man, yet the setting has a whole new atmosphere thanks to an artistic and technological effort by the Californian team. As if to reflect the style and tastes of the new protagonist, the Harlem neighborhood is much more lively and diversified, with murals of all sizes that color the facades of the buildings. Above all, the choice to set this adventure in the Christmas period has allowed Insomniac to present a New York with a very different dress: from the snowflakes that whiten the streets and the roofs to the Christmas markets full of people looking for gifts, passing for the decorations and lights that are reflected on the streets and shop windows. The use of ray tracing and more advanced lighting only enhance an absolutely magical setting, which changes color and character according to the time of day and the climate that exists in a given mission. We've spent far too much time looking at the ways the sunlight reflects off Miles' costumes, or how the city mirrors itself in the glass, and the neon colors reverberate off the floor (and yes, even in puddles). We obsessed over the smallest details in the characters' faces and clothing, scaled Avengers Tower and gazed at the skyline of a city that appears even more expansive. However, how the inevitable Spider-Man 2 will present an even more interesting and unprecedented New York is a question that we will think about in the future. The performance mode The addition of ray tracing, the most advanced lighting system and a generally higher level of detail makes the PS5 version of Spider-Man Miles Morales a real treat for the eyes. Yet, just try the performance mode for a few moments to find yourself at a tragic crossroads: play at 30 frames per second and enjoy the Insomniac game in its most spectacular version? Or sacrifice ray tracing and graphics details to play at double the framerate? Because, trust me, swinging among the buildings of New York at 60 fps is a whole different story, a much more fun experience and from which many will hardly go back. For the undecided, the New Game + can be a good excuse to play the game in both modes.", "date": "2020-11-06", "grade": "8.5"}
