{"name": "Super Bust a Move", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-bust-a-move-2.html", "text": "The Magnificent 4! There are four styles of play contained in the Super Bust A Move cd: we start from the classic game mode, i.e. your aim will remain only to throw bubbles towards others of the same color to make them disappear and once the area has been cleared, you will proceed to the following; this mode is therefore dedicated above all to extreme fans of the prequels who want to savor the old-style gameplay of the saga. There are full screen levels, and not just about 1/3 of the screen, introduced with Puzzle Bobble 2, perhaps the most appreciated and converted episode of the entire saga (Pc, Playstation, Saturn, Game Boy). We then move on to the normal game mode, i.e. the main dish served in the menu: technically speaking the sprites are animated much better than in the past while the backdrops, now rendered, have mobile, floating and rotating elements in the Mode 7 manner (those who have had a Snes or bought a Game Boy Advance he understood what I mean, for the others suffice it to say that it was the strong point of the graphics of the legendary 16 bit Nintendo). Inexplicably speaking, Bub and Bob now take the place of the assistants of the 8 new protagonists (selectable only with the one-on-one mode that we will analyze shortly), whose names written in Japanese (at least in the release in my possession) do not allow me to list them. , apart from Mogu, the undisputed purple creature protagonist of this edition. Among the peculiarities introduced with the new episode of the Taito franchise, we have chubby beings enclosed in giant bubbles which, if exploded (only by bubbles of the same color) transform all the other bubbles scattered throughout the level into the color of the largest bubble (monstrously simplifying the level resolution). Again, there are small bricks where you can divert the bubbles to better areas (or considerably worsen the launch trajectory) or self-propelled walls that push the ball downwards or upwards, depending on the direction of motion. In the levels I viewed for this timely review (I still have to make up for Dominion Wars I guess, right boss? ^_^), the balance introduced with the fourth chapter of the saga was inexplicably missing, very strange given that it was a much appreciated feature in Japanese land. The Magnificent 4! The third game mode that we will analyze is perhaps the most appreciated and played: the one-on-one mode (computer or human) which places 2 antagonists on either side of the screen and whenever groups of bubbles are swept away, they go to place in the part of the screen occupied by the contender so the winner will be the one who will explode the greatest number of bubbles in the shortest possible time. This game mode to be fully appreciated anyway, so a beginner can find an adequate challenge with the computer ~bots~ but once you become very strong (like you can't miss a single placement of bubbles) you will spend hours playing it (I and my girlfriend that we set the victory with 2 rounds out of 3 won, we also spend a full hour on a single challenge). The last game mode included in the package (apart from the ever-present training mode which certainly doesn't deserve 2 lines of explanations) is the one called Challenge: with very little time available and with a counter of the number of bubbles used to overcome the various levels proposed by Taito, you will have to pass small tests which usually consist in making the bubble perform evolutions such as to position itself on that single bubble on the game screen which causes the destruction of the others and instant victory. Arcade Perfect (one more time) Even if arcades are in crisis almost everywhere, we very unfortunate Tarantinos hardly have the possibility to play Virtua Striker 3, so after surfing the web to investigate the goodness of the conversion, I can say (although I suspected it) that once again we are faced with a perfect conversion of the original coin-op. Unfortunately, I don't have at hand the data regarding the system requirements to play this puzzle game but since it is two-dimensional graphics I believe that a P3 500 with 128 mb and a 16 mb video card is also enough but in which case you have an older system, the programmers have included the possibility of playing a version of the same game with less flashy graphics (fewer animations, elements on the screen, etc etc) which considerably lightens the workload entrusted to the processor. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the graphics of Super Bust A Move are certainly the most elaborate of the saga, withsuper smooth animations and lots of rendered elements in motion, unlike the static bitmap backdrops of the prequels. The review of the technical side of the Taito game ends with the sound side: the music, as always very whistleable, is well done as always, the sound effects are, predictably, the usual ones that we have already come to know (and appreciate) and always the voices chosen for the characters are very apt, all characterized in a more than satisfactory way for expressions, movements and voices. Conclusions Super Bust A Move, by virtue of a very good technical realization (for the genre to which it belongs), but above all of sky-high playability and great longevity (especially if you often play in pairs), is a title definitely recommended to anyone: from the teenager who wants a cheeky game not to go crazy after it to assimilate its structure to the head of the family who wants to have some fun after a day's work passing through your girlfriend/little sister/best friend who gets annoyed waiting when you play video games whether you run out of fragging your opponent or would like to try something with less than five to six function keys. Fans of the saga shouldn't waste time, it's a highly recommended purchase, all the others, less savvy in the genre or Taito's puzzle series, can always buy the second episode distributed by Halifax in its economic line for twenty thousand lire, always extremely valid . Conclusions 9 Taaaaaaaaaaito! Before starting, it is good to warn the nostalgic ones to have copious anti-tear tissues, given that the introductory procedure I have pondered to introduce the game reviewed therein will lead to remembering sacred monsters of fun and true mastery in the field of game structures . At the dawn of the 80s, a promising Japanese software house called Taito (incidentally, creator of Space Invaders, not bruscolini) had released a video game on the coin-op market that would have changed the lives of many chubby little boys who, after twenty years, still keep in their hard disk, the person responsible for so many weekly pocket money lost in the arcade near their home: this game is called Bubble Bobble (applause, please), an extremely addictive platform where the little dragons Bub and Bob had to defeat the wicked Baron Von Blubba and become 2 normal guys. What was special about this coin-op? Spartan graphics but so tender? That little tune that is still whistled cheerfully today while we set up the latest version of Mame? The undersigned fondly remembers the 100 (exactly, one hundred!!) levels where the 2 protagonists had to engulf the enemies with bubbles and then finish them off by hitting them (concept, in my humble opinion, partially taken from the Nintendo Mario Bros coin-op) , as well as forfeiting tons of various bonuses scattered in the form of various delicacies and extricating yourself from the many platforms scattered here and there by Japanese coders. After the parentheses of Rainbow Island and Parasol Stars (the latter relatively little known in the West), Taito has revived the 2 dragons in Bubble Bobble Symphony, a real sequel to Bubble Bobble for the game structure where, for example, Rainbow Island it was an up-scrolling plaftorm and not a fixed pattern. Let's get to the early 90s: as a frequent visitor to the arcades of my city, a game called Puzzle Bobble did not fail to arouse my amazement. The writing Taito was unmistakable (although the hardware used was Neo-Geo by Snk), Bub and Bob even more but what the hell game was I getting ready to play? A puzzle, as the name suggests, and also one of the most intriguing. If then Tetris had completely invented the puzzle game category (the indescribable success of Alex Pajitnov's game, bundled with the first incarnation of Nintendo's Game Boy) and rivals like Atari's Klax only made the Russian game smile, well the situation that occurred around the mid-nineties was different: Tetris was joined by new pretenders to the throne such as the aforementioned Taitian Puzzle Bobble, Puyo Puyo of Compile (the second episode, Snes version, caused an enormous addiction if played in 4) and the hilarious Super Puzzle Fighter 2 X created by CAPtive COMmunication. Personally, I loved and played these games ad nauseam but it must be admitted that the success of the Taito puzzle game was much more massive given that it generated 3 sequels (and endless conversions, from the Snes to the Game Boy, from the Neo-Geo to the Playstation, etc) and the here present Super Puzzle Bobble (inWest Super Bust A Move), conversion of the homonymous coin-op, converted months and months ago on Sony's black monolith. But what is so passionate about the Puzzle Bobble franchise? Surely its enormous playability, gradually refined with the sequels (in the same way as the 2D fighting games of Capcom and Snk, annual events until recently) which becomes a real wedding invitation if played in pairs, which is definitely feasible since there are so many boys and, above all, girls who grew up on bread and Puzzle Bobble and I certainly wasn't the only one who, at the time of the maximum splendor of the Playstation, had to be satisfied with reading some manga because the console had been ~ temporarily sequestered. After this long (I admit it) introduction, we can finally welcome with open arms (especially if you own a PC only, not inclined to playability made in Japan) the new episode of this hilarious saga and, girlfriend permitting, (since she wants the PC all for her to play and cares that you have to read these lines), let's immediately analyze the gameplay.", "date": "2001-08-18", "grade": null}
