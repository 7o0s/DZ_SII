{"name": "Macchine a Scontro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/macchine-a-scontro.html", "text": "The scenario of Macchine a Scontro is precisely the one just described: a city built to escape the stress of everyday life, where you move around on board harmless electric bumper cars. The user assumes the role of an aspiring new citizen, who must earn residency by obtaining the consent of the inhabitants. This is possible by completing some missions, which award a quantity of stars proportional to the skill demonstrated. Stars who, having reached 50, will give our alter-ego the longed-for citizenship. The game develops within a handful of environments, real stages characterized by a time limit (represented by the battery level of the bumper cars) in which you have to earn as many stars as possible. The missions are obtained from the various characters simply by colliding with them, and include activities such as collecting cones, colliding against the greatest number of characters, escaping from pursuers and so on. In reality, here lies the main limit of Clash Machines, or rather in the scarce variety of situations, which soon become boring: despite the search for the hi-score, it still sufficiently spurs the user to go on, at least a couple more variations would have been welcome. Nor does the level design help, which is so standardized as to make them almost indistinguishable from each other. And that's a shame, because with a little more effort, Machines Clash could have been a real gem. In fact, the peculiar playful formula of the product allows it to be ideal for short game sessions (the various missions all have a time limit of twenty seconds, and your own bumper car has an autonomy of a couple of minutes), but the good the amount of locations and stars necessary to complete the enterprise give it a considerable longevity. Unfortunately - we repeat - the defect of Macchine a Ccontro is that it runs out of arguments too soon, forcing the user to proceed by inertia already after the first handful of stages. What is certain is that the work Digital Chocolate is a harbinger of interesting ideas, not only in terms of gameplay: Macchine a Scontro is in fact one of the few mobile games to take into consideration the sound sector, consisting of a variety of melodies freely exchangeable by the user during the game, just like you do with radio stations in the various GTA. Even from a graphic point of view, we certainly cannot be said to be dissatisfied: the world of Clash Machines is lively and colorful, not without some touch of class and populated by a fairly diversified population. A completeness, that of the technical sector, which clashes not a little with the relative scarcity of the playful offer of the Digital Chocolate product.
