We easily concede that for many it is not easy to share passion and fascination for such a particular sport as cycling, where there are very few moments of real action on stages that last up to six or seven hours, and where the beauty lies elsewhere. In the superhuman effort that athletes make, for example (except for pharmaceutical aids, of course, but we are not here to talk about this), or in the almost chess-like strategy that the various teams prepare and implement behind the scenes and then unleash it at the right time , or again, why not, simply by scrolling through beautiful landscapes on our televisions such as those that characterize the roads of the Tour or of our Giro. If we were at the sports bar, the conversation could end here, with a peaceful ~de gustibus~; but faced with the videogame transposition of such a discipline then it is necessary to investigate further, and ask ourselves, assuming that we are not aiming at the widest possible audience, how we can return certain dynamics and sensations to those who know them best and loves them. Cyanide and Focus Home Interactive have been trying for years, will this be the right time? Le Tour de France 2016 is the new edition of the official game of the Grande Boucle: our test! Among the French who get pissed off In terms of content, Le Tour de France 2016 does not miss anything. In addition to the titular race, which is present in both this year's and last year's versions to unlock, there are other shorter stage races, the Critrium du Dauphin, the Critrium International, the Trittico Tour and the Circuito degli Climbers, each with its beautiful stages that can then be assembled at will in My Tour mode, in which you build the Tour of your dreams. Said then of the presence of a Challenge mode that offers you some of the most spectacular and fastest descents in the game on which to launch at breakneck speed to get the best time, of a necessary and quite well done, but not perfect, tutorial, and of the editor with which to change the composition of the teams (all participants in this year's Tour, complete and duly licensed) and the personal data of the riders, as well as the possibility of enjoying some of the modes in local multiplayer for two players, both competitive and cooperative, through the now obsolete split screen (here, one thing that Le Tour de France 2016 is missing is the online multiplayer, which would probably add a discreet value to the package), it must be emphasized that the stage races mentioned above can be used in two mode. The first is the classic Tour, in which you take control of a really existing team, possibly modifiable but without any economic implications. The second is instead the Pro Team, which adds a managerial touch to the whole: the team is to be built from the ground up, choosing the athletes on the basis of economic possibilities which at the beginning are very narrow, but then, from success to success, increase allowing us to aim to involve the most important names. Nothing comparable to its cousin Pro Cycling Manager for PC, but certainly a great way to increase longevity and engagement. Whatever your choice, once you hit the road, however, things do not change: the control of the cyclist is basically delegated to the stick for the direction and R2, rather than for the speed, for the effort to be used in pedaling. Effort that can be increased for a few seconds with a jerk, set to an automatic level so you don't always have to dose the pressure on the backbone, or keep on par with that of another runner simply by simply following him with the pressure of a button. All expedients that, excellent on paper, together with other gems such as the aerodynamic position to be assumed when going downhill or the fact that you are sufficiently sheltered from the wind, you get less tired, are necessary to make the fundamental concept of cycling and above all of stage races, the same for which if you want to approach Le Tour de France 2016 as a ~simple~ racing game you won't go far: on stages well over a hundred kilometers long and perhaps peppered with climbs (of course, here they are reduced but we are however in the order of an hour and the game passes for the longer ones, except for the possibility of speeding up time), the parameter to keep an eye on is not speed, but energy management. Playstation 4 trophies 34 Trophies awaiting all virtual runners: 16 Bronze, 13 Silver, 4 Gold and Platinum. If you complete all the modes and all the races on the maximum difficulty level, you will most likely get them all, it being understood that the races and some stages you will have to win: in fact they are all essentially thelinked to actions you will normally take as part of a good performance. The Cobram Cup In the race everything is entrusted to indicators, to always keep an eye on and to replenish up to a maximum of two times per stage thanks to the supplies. In a video game, of course, there is no other solution, but the yield leaves something to be desired. For example, on the same stage with arrival on the legendary Col de l'Izoard we happened, at the same level of difficulty, to win once with a young long distance rider simply by inserting ourselves in the right break many kilometers and a couple of climbs before the finish , and then, with a climber like Nibali and following a much more sensible strategy, that of attacking only in the last kilometres, running out of energy a few hundred meters from the finish line because we had anticipated the right moment by a moment to sprint. It may seem realistic, but in reality it is not because pure climbers like Nibali, Aru, Quintana or Valverde can, when they are in a day, make even more than one sprint on the same steep climb and at the same time maintain a strong and constant pressure on the pedals without go out of energy, but the game, with its rigidly deterministic approach and which does not seem to make excessive differences between one cyclist and another despite the completeness of the statistics, does not make this aspect. And this leads us directly to the other great concept, of cycling as well as of the title: team strategy. That the emphasis is placed on the team more than on the individual athlete can be understood from the fact that not only is it possible to establish which man of one's group to control at the beginning of each stage, but also to change him during the race: one of the strong points of this sport it is in fact being both team and individual, and even here on paper Le Tour de France 2016 performs well. It is possible to give individual companions or the whole team a great variety of orders in real time, ranging from the pace to be sustained, to collaboration or otherwise with the rest of the group, up to the request to a wingman to protect a more important man; all very nice, a pity that the finest strategies are sometimes rendered useless by an artificial intelligence which, if in one's own team it is not very reactive but in any case always sufficient, in the other competitors sometimes seems really deficient, especially in the case of dangerous escapes which the big group of the Yellow Jersey often seems not to take into consideration at all, forcing us, if we have ambitions to win, to send only our team into jeopardy with a relative great expenditure of energy. Unfortunately, all this ruins, not always but too often, that simulation capacity that Le Tour de France 2016 demonstrates on paper and in some rare moments when everything goes right, supported by an audiovisual rendering which, very engaging in the sound (the effects of the bike, the wind and the runners' breath are very effective, as are the cheers from the fans which, however, are not many and above all do not seem linked to what is actually happening), it still lacks in that graphics afflicted by a heavy pop up of polygons and textures. However, we don't feel like we're being too bad towards the programmers in this aspect: we're talking about an engine that has to handle two hundred runners and related vehicles as well as the entire landscape and the public, and despite the many flaws, the glance manages to be sometimes truly spectacular, suffering frame rate drops very rarely and especially when playing with the camera.", "date": "2016-07-07", "grade": "6.2"}
