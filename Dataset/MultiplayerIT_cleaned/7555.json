A description that would seem to fit Deus Ex: Human Revolution Director's Cut, given the significant amount of improvements promised by Eidos and Square Enix following the announcement of the game. So let's see if the words have actually turned into deeds, testing the Wii U incarnation curated by the Australians Straight Right, already authors of the porting of Mass Effect 3 for the Nintendo console. A light make-up You need to have a 26-month-long alibi to justify never having played the excellent Deus Ex: Human Revolution, originally released on PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in August 2011 and reviewed very positively on these pages as well . Here we will not dwell on praising the virtues of the work Eidos Montreal, preferring to devote our attention to the unpublished features introduced by this new Director's Cut. The title has in fact remained completely unchanged as regards the plot and the basic play structure: we therefore return to the cybernetically modified clothes of Adam Jensen to face a first-person adventure characterized by a great freedom of choice left to the user as regards the way of tackling the missions, the attitude to adopt with the secondary characters and even the direction in which to evolve the protagonist's power-ups. Very noble intentions that in the original product occasionally clashed with a technical component that was not always up to the situation, starting with an artificial intelligence of the enemies that indulged in too many carelessness. In Deus Ex: Human Revolution Director's Cut it can be said that the problem has been filed rather than definitively solved: the opponents therefore show off slightly more complex routines that make them slightly more stimulating obstacles especially for those looking for a stealth approach, but not it can be said that it is a radical change compared to the past. The two years that the Square Enix work carries on its back then make themselves felt in a purely visual sphere, for a title that already at the time could not boast of a cosmetic for which to tear one's hair out: the few tricks made by Straight Right did not therefore they appear sufficient to soften the rather angular look of the game world, highlighted above all by woody polygonal models that are really struggling to compare with current productions. However, the improvements are there, and mainly concern the lighting effects, shadow management, a more full-bodied antialiasing filter and faster loading by a few seconds. You begin to breathe a big sigh of relief when you discover that Deus Ex: Human Revolution Director's Cut has applied more in the segments where there was more room for maneuver: the reference is to those battles with the bosses so - rightly so - criticized in the original for their total lack of cohesion with conventional gameplay, and which have been appropriately tuned here. Here, therefore, that the arenas that host the clashes have undergone a substantial facelift to allow the user to face the opponents also acting with cunning and stealth, without limiting the choice to only brute force as happened instead in the first edition of the title. Deus Ex: Human Revolution Director's Cut is the best way to experience Adam Jensen's adventure Cyber gamepad The most stimulating novelties of Deus Ex: Human Revolution Director's Cut obviously come from the intensive exploitation of the Wii U Gamepad, which basically takes care of all those functions which in the original version of the game provided for the opening of a menu and the consequent splitting of the action. The touchscreen is primarily invested with a didactic role, hosting the display of all the tutorials and textual documents encountered during the adventure. During normal action, however, the controller display hosts a defined map of the surrounding environment, complete with enemy locations and markers for objectives. It is undoubtedly a useful solution but not comfortable enough to completely replace the minimap located in the lower corner of the main screen, deactivated by default in the options but which it is advisable to restore immediately so as not to be forced to constantly look away from the TV to identify opponents. A series of virtual keys positioned just a tap away on the sides of the touchscreen are then used to call up immediatelyall the game menus, which obviously benefit a lot from tactile control: therefore managing the inventory, viewing statistics and objectives and assigning Praxis Points useful for enhancing Adam's skills are all routines that turn out to be much more practices in Deus Ex: Human Revolution Director's Cut, to the full benefit of the fluidity of the action. Proceedings relating to the hacking of computers and electronic locks have also been transferred to the Gamepad display, which proves to be an ideal companion when it comes to typing codes or passwords but also does an excellent job of managing the hacking minigame. In addition to inserting the features listed so far, which to some might even appear obvious, the developers of Straight Right have also thought of slightly more active uses of the Nintendo controller: you can therefore use the Gamepad as a sniper sight for shotguns sniper or as a tool to locate enemy grenades and send them back to the sender with a swipe, and with the relative Adam power-up it is even possible to raise the touchscreen in front of the TV and use it as a scanner to see through walls and steal useful information on enemies . Finally, the integration of the so-called Infologs is really curious, real multimedia notes that the user can leave on the map to make them available to his friends via Miiverse: it is allowed to enter messages written with the keyboard or freehand, screenshots and even short audio files for the purpose of communicating secrets or particular tactics to solve certain game situations. In an attempt to pass as many actions as possible through the Gamepad, Straight Right however seems to have forced the hand in a couple of fortunately isolated cases: the reference is to the looting of corpses and to the selection of objects via the quick menu, both moved to the touchscreens when it would have been better to keep them on the home screen. Even the possibility of playing directly on the controller display is a welcome presence but hardly preferable to a classic setting, mainly due to icons and text characters that are reduced to such small dimensions as to be almost illegible. The roundup of an undoubtedly rich Director's Cut is closed by the presence of all the DLCs that followed the release of the original, a New Game+ mode (which allows you to restart the adventure by carrying all the power-ups and equipment collected in the first round ), a 45-minute documentary on the making of the game, and some eight hours of audio commentary from Eidos Montreal developers that can be activated during gameplay.", "date": "2013-10-21", "grade": "8.4"}
