Rare's collection of sports disciplines had stood out for being one of the ~cleanest~ experiences of the launch of the Microsoft peripheral and, not to be underestimated, one of the most enjoyable with bowling, for example, which no friend invited to dinner could resist from launching into long gaming sessions. This year, it's up to six new sports: Golf, American Football, Darts, Skiing, Baseball and Tennis, which apparently were the most requested by fans around the world for a possible sequel. The past tense has served to set up a more precise experience than the previous one and a few more modes, but what remains is a game to have fun with friends, perfect for long winter evenings. Career who? Apart from the various sports disciplines, the first novelty of Kinect Sports: Season 2 is the introduction of a sort of career mode, given that at the end of each trial you acquire a greater number of fans depending on whether you have won or lost and of having brought home events without errors or embellished with certain athletic gestures. This is a very tenuous addition, since apart from the rewards for the avatars and the highest level, nothing else is unlocked and that, if you continue to play, it will be with friends online or at home. For each discipline there are three levels of difficulty, which are progressively unlocked after having played the previous one at least once, the third of which fields respectable opponents who require you to engage in each event with maximum concentration if you want to succeed to take home the first position. In disciplines such as Golf, also playing at maximum difficulty, the position of the hole on the green and the weather conditions change, with the wind blowing stronger and which must be taken into account when trying to go under par in the nine holes available. This is precisely one of the most successful disciplines, with the fields very pleasant to look at and with an indicator that marks the distance from the hole, information that allows you to choose the necessary club, if you don't want to follow the base indicated by the caddy to try different approaches to the greens. With a little practice, it is clear how it is possible to manage the races as you see fit and with remarkable precision. Another pleasant novelty is Baseball which, although not very similar to the tastes of a European public, proves to be the most entertaining of the lot, with both phases, both in defense and in attack. When defending you have to throw the ball, following the instructions of the receiver, and catch it on the fly when it ends up close to some defender, when you attack you have to hit, obviously, and run at breakneck speed if you don't hit a home run, with the need to stretch one leg forward to simulate sliding to safety on base. Darts are the most likely candidates for Bowling's throne last year, given how intuitive they are and how much, in fact, they are the discipline that comes closest to the real counterpart. The Ski version is fun, but it's very simplified, as you just need to go through the slalom gates, duck and jump over bumps to gain speed. Even Tennis only asks you to hit the ball, even though Kinect is able to detect both the direction of the shot and the way to hit in topspin or buoy (lobs are completely missing, unless they come from a buoy on a shot violent), while you have to move to the sides or forward to slide or to hit the ball harder. American Football is the real sore point of the package, given that it is already the least popular sport in our area and given that, apart from calling the different schemes (which, however, will soon be left to the choice of the coach), you just need to launch the ball with the quarterback and start running when it is received, without the possibility, however, of dodging the opposing tackles (remembering that in Kinect Sports you run faster the higher your knees are raised). It lacks the defensive phase altogether and we doubt it will be tried more than a few times with friends. Here, as for the first chapter, to have fun and appreciate the work done by Rare you need a good room with space available, especially if you play in two. Xbox 360 goals Covering the career a marginal role, most of the objectives are linked to the achievement of some feats in the individual disciplines. Playing around four hours, you should get a score between 400 and 500 of the thousand points available. To make the loot full, however, you will have, for example,winning a game of Darts with three 180-point rounds will take some time and practice. Voice commands, follies and challenges As in all games this season, voice commands finally appear, which would allow you to navigate through the menus, full of variations and options, in the blink of an eye. The conditional, in the case of Kinect Sports: Season 2, is a must, given that, unlike what happens in Forza Motorport 4, here they are not at all precise. With a little practice you can understand that, pronouncing the different combinations of options quickly, you can use them easily, especially within disciplines such as golf in which they all work, but some just don't want to activate and most players are likely to give up after a few tries. A note precisely for the voice commands of Golf, in which to abandon the practice shots and return to hitting, it would be necessary to pronounce ~Execute Shot~ according to what is indicated on the screen during the game, a command that never works. During the loading screens, however, we learn that the verb to pronounce is the simple ~Tira~, which in fact works every time. Each activity, except the infamous American Football, has a crazy discipline accompanying it which constitutes a nice diversion from the basic sport and which, as in the case of skiing, is likely to be more successful than the main mode. In this case, in fact, you have to bend down, jump and move quickly to avoid obstacles arranged along the track, otherwise you will lose a ~life~, at the end of which you have to give way to another player, rather than face the subsequent tests which are increasingly demanding and exhausting. In darts you have to hit balloons, avoiding mascots tied to the rotating target, while in golf you have to hit greens in the middle of the ocean, with the different areas of the same giving a different score when hit. Above all, these constitute a quick and fun diversion from the classic disciplines and with these it is possible to try the new Challenge mode which allows you to record a time or a performance and send it to a contact on your friends list to see who is the strongest, even when these are not online. The usual methods on Xbox Live and the possibility of sharing on Facebook and saving on hard disk via computer, the replays recorded by Kinect during games, all seasoned with the usual graphic care, both in game and in the menus, and musical with a very catchy song that acts as a leitmotif for all the disciplines and the usual plethora of hits that accompany the different moments of the matches.", "date": "2011-10-26", "grade": "8.0"}
