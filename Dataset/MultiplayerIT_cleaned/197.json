The version used for this review is the Xbox 360 version. Money in the bank After the quick intro, we make our triumphant entry into the game's main menu, immediately giving a quick view of the game possibilities provided. We immediately realize how things haven't changed much compared to last year, also because in the previous edition we already had an infinite number of variables available on the types of matches. The only novelty, from this point of view, is the ~Money in The Bank Ladder Match~, a match that involves 6 athletes in the ring ready to give each other a thrashing to get to the briefcase placed at the top and reachable only through the use of a ladder. The presence of the ~General Manager~ mode has been confirmed, which can be considered as a reduced version of a classic management style in Football Manager and the like, only that here we will clearly find ourselves managing one of the federation's shows and our ultimate goal will be to have a greater audience than our antagonist. We are not dealing with a product capable of countering the masterpieces of the genre but it is undoubtedly a ~plus~ that could excite many wrestling maniacs also because the interface and game mechanics are clear and simple to learn and partially improved compared to last year. The character editor is inevitable, only optimized since it already gave excellent results last year The character editor is inevitable, only optimized given that it already gave excellent results last year (with all the possibilities of recreating the various superstars not present by default) and the substantial multiplayer component is fundamental, which provides many possibilities and variations both offline and via the XBOX Live services where up to 4 videowrestlers will be able to beat each other up without hesitation. Speaking of multiplayer, an interesting feature also concerns the career (which has remained almost completely unchanged compared to the prequel) where, like last year, we will be able to control either an already established superstar, or our alter ego who will slowly try to get to the plans Stamford Federation treble. Before each match, by clicking on the ~multiplayer~ box, one of our snack partners will be able to take part in the match in the role of any protagonist of the event (the opponent, our tag team partner, referee if he is a ~ special guest referee match). Although this implementation deserves our blessing, this feature makes us regret even more the absence of the possibility of developing the same career with a friend in the role of two different wrestlers, something present in the first two episodes of the series and which we have not found again in the subsequent titles. Will it be for the 2008 edition? The Roster The time has almost come to get into the ring, but first let's analyze another very important element in a Wrestling game: the characters available. WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2007 is updated to spring-summer of this year with the presence of some wrestlers who are no longer in the federation (starting with Kurt Angle who moved to NWA-TNA, but also Psicosis, Lita, Trish Stratus and others) while the stars of the resurrected do not appear, within WWE itself, Extreme Championship Wrestling (and some wrestlers such as Sandman, Kevin Thorn and CM Punk we would instead have controlled with great pleasure). In addition to signaling the presence of Eddie Guerrero ~forever in our hearts~ among the wrestlers, the presence of a congruous number of legends should be noted: the ~regulars~ such as Hogan, Austin and The Rock are joined by other prominent figures such as Bam Bam Bigelow, Mr Perfect, Jim Neidhart, Dusty Rhodes, Tazz and more. WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2007 is updated for spring-summer of this year with the presence of some wrestlers who are no longer in the federation while the stars of the resurrected Extreme Championship Wrestling do not appear Copernican Revolution Already last year, taking note of the new interactive dynamics of RvsS 2006, we talked about a revolution, but in reality, as we approach the new episode, we discover how the prequel was only an intermediate step to real change. Raw vs Smackdown 2007 in fact decides to cut the mini-games of the prequel, confirms the stamina bars and for loading the final move but above all completely distorts the grappling system. It is no longer a button on the pad that initiates the move on the opponent but the right analog stick: if the latter is used individually, we will perform a quick and ~light~ grip.If, on the other hand, we combine it with the right back button, the powerful moves will come into action. In both cases, for each direction given to the lever, different moves will be performed, which in the case of ~massive~ grips will initiate further different combinations since to execute these moves we will have to give a second command to the stick. Beyond everything, the element to highlight is the substantial change in the approach compared to the previous episodes also regarding the timing of the defensive counter-move (which, however, has remained unchanged in terms of keys). But the news didn't end here since we will also be able to drag the opponent to different points of the ring or the arena: arriving near certain areas (ropes, ring corners, barriers) it will automatically be possible to perform actions using the environment that surrounds us. These moves, which can be recalled using the ~R3~ key, will be done by mimicking the movements of our wrestler with the right stick (for example: finding ourselves near the barriers we will have to press up and then down to lift our opponent and throw him against the protections) and will require a very high cost of resistance. Certainly this component makes the game even more spectacular with brawls in the midst of the delirious crowd that reach the climax of the ~gladiatorial~ climate. Raw vs Smackdown 2007 decides to cut the mini-games of the prequel, confirms the stamina bars and for loading the final move but above all completely distorts the grappling system In addition to other practical effects (execution of the Irish whip or entering and exiting the ring), the revolution of the grappling system makes WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2007 a deeper and more varied product in terms of possible moves and combinations. The price to pay, however, is a rather high decrease in immediacy and a sort of ~scar~ for fans of the series who will have to deeply review the baggage of their automatisms. Undoubtedly the path taken is interesting and perhaps the only possible one to give a strong turn to the series as well as giving the programmers the opportunity to further review the interactive dynamics with greater freedom in the next episodes. Finally, the latest annotations are for a considerably improved artificial intelligence compared to last year, the confirmation of the realism in terms of the balance of power and size between wrestlers (therefore you will never see a body slam by Rey Misteryo Junior against Big Show) and a net decrease (but still not total, especially as regards the collision system) of graphic bugs of various kinds. Music for the People Before arriving at the coveted conclusions, we cannot escape the analysis of the audiovisual sector of THQ's production. WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2007 undoubtedly does not make the most of the XBOX360 graphics chipset and its multiplatform origin is clear. However, this does not mean that the digital transposition of Batista, Undertaker, Triple H and associates is not of high quality, far from it: in addition to having been able to count on the motion capture of all the wrestlers, RvS features graphic models of excellent workmanship (although with some ups and downs). In some situations perhaps the sensation of ~plasticky~ becomes excessively visible but the fact remains that we are dealing with a very good digital representation of the real counterparts in every respect (including the sweat that will peep out on the Wrestler's body after a certain number of minutes in the ring). The creation of the game arenas is excellent with a completely three-dimensional audience animated in a wise and credible way in addition to the many side effects such as titantrons, fireworks, cinematographic filters which give the right rate of glamor to the huge and amusing ~circus~ of the WWE. Confirmed the bad choice to eliminate any musical accompaniment during the matches Unfortunately, a very different judgment must be assigned to the sound sector: in fact, the bad choice of eliminating any musical accompaniment during the course of the matches, which so loaded the players up to a few years ago, was confirmed, leaving only the commentary (in English and excessively reiterated) in the audio part. the roars of the crowd (sometimes completely absent) and the sound effects (some of them quite ridiculous) that arise from the action in the ring. The intention is probably to recreate the same alchemy of television shows, fortunately on Xbox 360 it is possible to listen to the music on your Hard Disk at any time and in the background, using the appropriate function of the Dashboard. The goals of WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2007 The thousand points of THQ Wrestling are divided into 29 objectives, ranging from salaries of 5 to 100 points and which concernsThey really give all aspects of the game: therefore not only linked to on and off line combat, but also to the editor and general manager mode. Worth noting is the presence of 4 secret objectives and 5 others related to the legendary Royal Rumble. Time for changes for WWE Raw vs Smackdown: in addition to the end of the series' exclusive relationship with Playstation, THQ's production overturns the grappling system and performs a sort of ~reset~ to all the automatisms that longtime fans had developed During the years. If this initially can cause a reaction of bewilderment, in the medium term the new proposals are appreciated, despite the greater playful depth being paid for with less immediacy. For the rest, as always, RvsS can be expected to have an outline of match modes, editors, multiplayer support at very high levels, difficult to find in other sports video games. There was still something to file (especially as regards the sound sector) but fans of Batista, Undertaker and Triple H cannot miss the usual appointment with THE videogame Wrestling par excellence. Pro WWE Raw vs Smackdown is a guarantee Playability and editing at the highest levels Revolutionized and much deeper grappling system Cons ...but much less immediate and intuitive Sound accompaniment during matches to be completely reviewed Roster updated to 6 months ago and without the ECW stars Wrestling Mania is Coming Back While in Italy the ~Wrestling Mania~ has weakened slightly mainly due to a programming of Smackdown on Italia 1 that is nothing short of bizarre (but next April the planned tapings of Raw and Smack will make the beautiful country explode again for sport entertainment ), the pairing Yuke's - Tq offers the eighth chapter of the best series ever dedicated to the beasts of the ring. The anticipated first novelty concerns the end of the exclusivity relationship between Raw and Smackdown and the Playstation 2 and the consequent happiness of the ~Xboxari~ who can finally get their hands on THE videogame Wrestling par excellence. But this is only the first revolution brought about by WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2007...", "date": "2006-12-22", "grade": null}
