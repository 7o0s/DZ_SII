{"name": "Street Fighter II Mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/street-fighter-ii-mobile.html", "text": "Unfortunately the answer is negative. On the other hand it is very difficult to imagine that a numeric keyboard can do a job at least similar to that of joysticks specially designed for gaming, and although Capcom has tried to get around the problem, the final result is neither gratifying nor satisfactory. But let's go in order; first of all, as the more experienced will have already ascertained, this mobile version is based on the very first chapter of the series, from which numerous re-editions and updates were subsequently born. Therefore, the available characters are only the 8 historical and unforgettable Ken, Ryu, Blanka, Chun-Li, Dhalsim, Honda, Guile and Zangief. The animations have been preserved at least sufficiently, albeit with some obvious cuts, the fluidity is good, and the special moves are still in their place, starting with the now unforgettable Hadoken. Unfortunately, already starting from the technical component, the serious gaps of this conversion are starting to be found, evidently made in a somewhat listless way by Capcom, given the absurd presence of only one background; in fact, all the fights take place in the same level, the one to be clear on the roofs at sunset, cutting off all the others available in the original. Not a small blow for anyone who grew up on bread and Street Fighter II; but even if you want to turn a blind eye, unfortunately it is the aforementioned control system that definitively clips the wings of this conversion. In fact, all the special moves can be activated by pressing a single key, thus effectively eliminating the component of the player's skill in knowing how to activate them. In addition, the triple kicks and punches have also disappeared, reduced to one for the first and one for the second. These choices, while acceptable in view of the need to adapt the interface to an uncomfortable and limited numeric keyboard, in fact completely distort the product's foundations. The modest sound and lack of multiplayer closes the loop for a production that only the most dedicated Street Fighter II fans would consider. PRO Graphically appreciable Nostalgia for the good old days... AGAINST One background Control system disappointing Limited sound", "date": "2007-04-17", "grade": "S.V."}
