We followed the individual threads, getting lost in the tangle, but without an overview. But now the carefully orchestrated script has exploded in front of us like a huge firework. The Devil's Toybox is a great story, with characters who have gone beyond the screen and who can, indeed must, become part of contemporary culture. That's right: Sam and Max are good for the spirit and are a remarkable creative stimulus. Knowing them was a pleasure and spending time with them a small fortune. Therefore, as the credits roll, after having foiled the threat posed by the intersection between Max and a Lovecraftian deity, we can only hope for a fourth season. The last episode closed every plot left open and answered all the questions. The visionary power of the narrative mechanism has reached its peak, and all the main characters seen in the past episodes have presented themselves, including some from previous seasons. Only one flaw: Sam is alone for almost the entire adventure, while Max is evoked above all by contrast, the great absentee. We have spoken heartfelt words, and if you have followed the third season from the beginning you will surely understand us. But The City That Dares Not Sleep is not only story and dialogues, but also a video game. And we can spend some criticism from that point of view; we don't want the duo, we love it anyway. Experimental screenwriting school The gameplay does not betray the basics of the previous four episodes, but Max's psychic powers are absent. The variety of environments is remarkable and the scenography first-rate, with perfect cinematic framing. Such dynamism partially compensates for the poverty of the puzzles, so simple that even Sam has to laugh about it, unable to deny the evidence. As always, they enter the narrative rhythm in time, but are subdued compared to the pirouettes of the story. The bravest choices were made from the point of view of the script, neglecting the gameplay a bit. Even if this speech is especially true for the last episode. In fact, Max's powers and very limited inventory came as a big surprise to fans of graphic adventures. In any case, if you are expecting puzzles up to the lucid madness of the screenwriters, you will be disappointed. The only trump card of the gameplay is the ability to move the monster that has become Max through the streets of Manhattan, as if it were Godzilla. The graphics are what we've come to love and the excellent voice acting lives up to the hype. There's also another detail we never celebrated: the choice of colors for the dialogue fonts. Each character speaks with its own color, so to speak. Pay attention, they are never random and testify to the obsessive attention to detail that has distinguished the Telltales throughout the season. If anyone still claims that graphic adventures are over, it's only because they haven't played The Devil's Toybox. And now lights in the room, it's time to say goodbye. Thanks for staying with us.
