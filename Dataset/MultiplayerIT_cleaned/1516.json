We are talking about the absence of any championship and the monetary availability functional to the doping of the engine department. Unfortunately we won't find any of this in FR2, the game limits itself to proposing a series of single-issue challenges not too dissimilar from the infamous GT licenses, subject to precise parameters (time trials, guided tours, chases, etc.). The only reward bestowed on the player consists in unlocking new cars, tracks and modes in the free race, which allows for a less linear use of all the tests previously addressed. Far too little even for a title with strong arcade ambitions, by its very nature limited to the choice of only Ford racing cars and a certainly not exciting overall number of tracks. Everything is treated with disheartening superficiality, we can't see a project or a purpose that deviates from the clear propaganda message implicit in the product, if we exclude an entertainment in watertight compartments and, worse still, quickly subject to boredom. The forced minimalism of the menus and the excessive rigidity of the structure (only a path that can be used at the beginning) forces the user to use it monotonously, passively, and which reeks of something already seen in every passage. It is not clear the motivation in having to put up with a build that represents the synthesis of the antechamber to the entertainment offered by GT (Oh yes The hated licenses), thus breaking down the already precarious foundations. The programmers have tried to mix the cards by diversifying the races through the use of cars with peculiar characteristics, which justify off-road raids and in the Nascar/Indycar style oval circuits. It's a pity that this gimmick contributes more to the creation of a nebulous and confusing minestrone, rather than a multifaceted multiracing. None of the competitions is able to fully convince, and the interest fades inexorably between the weak apes of the classics of the genre (including EA's Need For Speed). In short, pure b-gaming, even if not without occasional entertainment. All in all, the game is accessible thanks to a simplified driving system to the bone: the cars bounce very unrealistically with each other and use the seabed to adjust their trajectory in an unlikely way, making the use of the brake almost harmful. Barring a slight frustration induced by the forced fulfillment of the tests, the Empire product begs for a chance to assert itself. Why it should be granted, or how long the idyll can last, remains strictly at the discretion of the end user, certainly the product from this point of view did not fully convince us. Let's save the shapes The situation on the technical side is decidedly more rosy: the engine encoded by Razorwork Studios is undoubtedly good, whose speed manages to ignite a vital spark in an organism that is certainly not in good health. And frankly, we didn't expect that. Although not taking full advantage of the potential of the Microsoft console (we are talking about a multi-project), we are faced with an example of commendable optimization. The unassailable framerate at 60fps leaves us fantasizing about how a Racing Evoluzione could have been more fluid, where the excellent polygonal modeling does justice to a series of lively and credible settings, even if certainly not original (the path in the jungle was spot on in any case ). The virtuosity of the engine is further highlighted by the presence of numerous animated elements on the edge of the track, from trucks on the freeways to hot air balloons, passing close to the tracks crossed by mighty locomotives. Clipping is limited, the fictitious bump mapping routines are good and effective to make the asphalt, and the environmental mapping used to underline the compactness of the cars is functional, the rendering of which tends, however, excessively plasticky. Particular mention for the possibility of importing a soundtrack from the console's hard disk, an option that is becoming standard in this kind of product, much appreciated and, in this case, highly recommended. A flaw to underline is the partial support for Live, which only allows you to post your best times in a virtual ranking and not to challenge each other directly. Comment Ford Racing 2 is apassable but inconclusive product, whose predestination to oblivion is already written in the genetic code. And it's a shame, considering the excellent graphics engine, which while not making use of the Crusader hardware, does not fail to give satisfaction. However, everything is mortified by a structure that is too thin, which rests wearily on a frayed series of ideas that have already been extensively explored (and abused) in other forums. What remains is a feeble attempt at self-proclamation of the Ford brand, devoted to a futile eclecticism that risks not really pleasing anyone. Ultimately a harmless pastime and little more, superfluous for those who are not interested in diversion while waiting for the future bigwigs of the genre, but certainly a good title to rent on rainy weekends. Pros: Solid graphics engine Immediate driving system Guess some environments Cons: Lack of depth No championship mode Boredom sets in quickly The category of pseudo arcade racing games is dangerously close to evolutionary saturation. If there is currently a pinnacle, it certainly was reached by the Gran Turismo series from Polyphony, which has traced a real character line in the genre market. Empire's Ford Racing 2 diligently queues up, taking as a pretext a roundup of races orbiting the cars of the historic car manufacturer.", "date": "2003-10-27", "grade": null}
