{"name": "Uno", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/173180-uno-tutti-pronti-a-esclamare-uno.html", "text": "In the past, numerous digital variants of the well-known card game Uno have been proposed, although in all probability the most remembered is the one developed by Carbonated Games for Xbox 360. This time it is Ubisoft who has taken the baton to offer us a new version, available both on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One since last August 9th. Uno is particularly appreciated for its immediacy, the rules are simple to learn and, since it is not a game of skill, the outcome of the matches is based predominantly on good luck. Basically you receive seven cards in your hand and you have to try to discard all of them before the other players. To do this, it is necessary to associate cards of the same color or bearing the same number, or take advantage of the special ones to force the other participants to draw penalty cards, skip the round or reverse it. The criterion is really straightforward to understand but, in the event that you don't know the mechanisms, an initial tutorial is available that illustrates everything you need. Ubisoft offers us a new version of Uno, complete with Rabbids Xbox One goals Uno's objectives are only twelve and do not require great effort to be unlocked all of them. With a minimum of patience you can get 1000G without too many worries. One classic and One Rabbids In Ubisoft's version of Uno, you can choose to play with two types of deck: the first is traditional, while the second is customized by the presence of the crazy Rabbids. In this second case, in addition to the basic rules and any secondary options, there are four bonus cards that influence the progress of the game. For example, by drawing ~Five and Five~ it is possible to distribute a first round of penalty cards only to the opponents and a second round divided among all the participants. The ~Hurry~ card obliges all players to carry out their action in just three seconds, otherwise they are forced to draw a penalty card and skip their turn, while ~Like a bomb~ requires the next player to draw three more cards. Finally, with ~no man's land~ you can defend yourself from a draw two or draw four joker, being also able to choose the color to continue with. In both decks it is possible to activate some variants at will, for example to repeat a joker card and pass the penalty to the next player, or to foresee that by playing a seven the cards can be exchanged with someone else. The final goal is always represented by the achievement of a cumulative score, ranging between two hundred and five hundred points at will, which is calculated on the basis of the cards left in the other players' hands at the end of each single frame. Single-player matches are played against three opponents managed by artificial intelligence, but if necessary, 2vs2 matches can be selected to share the game table with a friend and develop combined strategies. When you are left with only one card in your hand, you must press a button to communicate it to the other players and avoid the penalty; with the right timing you can therefore force the other competitors to draw new cards and prolong the conclusion of the game. Objectively, the longevity of Uno's offline mode is not very pronounced, in fact there is a lack of sufficient content to stimulate the player after completing the first matches with the only two decks available. The situation improves by dedicating yourself to the four-player multiplayer mode, which also allows you to take advantage of both voice chat and video chat with the help of Kinect or PlayStation Camera. In this case you are automatically associated with a new game, where players can join and leave seamlessly. In the event that a participant is missing, the empty seat is replaced by artificial intelligence, until someone is available again to join. Also in this case it is possible to fall back on the 2vs2 mode and collaborate with another user to win the match. The main difficulty encountered in online sessions is due to the dilated times that elapse between one play and another and to the continuous entry and exit of players from the game, which can sometimes alter the progress of the challenge.", "date": "2016-08-29", "grade": "7.0"}
