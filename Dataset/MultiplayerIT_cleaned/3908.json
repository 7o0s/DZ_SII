When playing on historical brands of the gaming industry and even daring to distort them to adapt them to a market - the mobile one - which continues to be seen by historical users as marginal, if not downright harmful, one cannot expect a positive reception and also the recent controversy unleashed on Diablo Immortal confirms this principle, which we had already seen at work with the announcement of Command. Joke with foot soldiers but leave the saints alone, EA, the traditionalists will have thought: transforming one of the oldest and most loved RTS in the industry into a Clash Royale clone is simply an affront. But did it really go like this? There is no doubt that Rivals is something profoundly different from the classic Command & Conquer, but given this assumption it is also easy to see how many elements in common there are between the classic series and this new spin-off, as we will see in this review. Rivals has certainly adopted a different structure, inclined to mobile use, moving far away from the original RTS, but the ties with tradition remain visible and its founding elements still emerge, characterizing this game in depth. The pressure put by the users, if nothing else, must have pushed EA to work with extreme care and try to pack the best possible mobile game and on the other hand the desire for Command & Conquer should be satisfied (hopefully) with the remakes of the recently announced classic episodes. It still remains a mobile game and it is clear that we cannot expect the complexity and depth of the classic RTS, due to intrinsic limits in terms of hardware and interface potential, as well as methods of use, but in the heart of the action we recognize the trait d'union with the old chapters of the series. The only truly critical element in all of this remains the free-to-play structure, which triggers the usual annoying drifts in the scientific destruction of the game rhythm to push towards micro-transactions, certainly avoidable but in any case always imminent and capable of condition not only the duration and frequency of the game sessions but the very mechanics of the strategy, imposing itself on the progression of the units and structures. Modern day Command & Conquer There are GDIs and there are NODs, but forget all the trashy storytelling that built the Command & Conquer myth, because there's practically no story here. The battles take place on rather small maps, in the style of the strategic MOBA on mobile platforms: it is basically a question of destroying the opposing base, either by attacking it directly or by triggering the launch of nuclear warheads from the sites arranged on the maps. The mechanics therefore expect to conquer these sites and maintain control of them until the warheads are launched against the opposing base, which makes victory quite easy. This obviously leads to violent clashes in the focal points of the map, for which some main lines of movement for the troops emerge at the control points where a large part of the action takes place. There is a lot of Command & Conquer in this phase of the game, also because structures and units are obviously derived from the tradition of the series and well recognizable by fans. The mechanics of the clash follow the classic principle of rock-paper-scissors-style circular power relations, for which it is necessary to mix the patrols well and select the right target each time to attack with the right unit. For the rest, the classic strategic elements appear rather simplified, with a strong reduction of the structures and an almost total absence of base management in energy and economic terms. The need to collect Tiberium remains to have the possibility of creating new troops and it is nice to see how the harvester is always an element also present in this title, another obvious connection with the canon of the series. An army of cards Where, on the other hand, Rivals completely differs from Command & Conquer is in the mechanics of building and progressing one's army, which here is based on the collection of cards. Each battle won allows you to open the inevitable chest which contains a certain number of cards characterized by a different level of rarity, obviously corresponding to the power and refinement of the unit it represents. Before facing the enemy, we can decide the composition of the army by deploying a certain number of cards of our choice, each corresponding to a type of unit or vehicle, so being able to collect a good assortment of rare cards affects the power of your army. He's a mechanichighly random dogism because it is impossible to predict the contents of the boxes, according to the classic principle of the loot box, but if nothing else, the collection of duplicates still has the fundamental function of increasing the level of the corresponding unit, also through the expenditure of the currency in -game. All of this translates, of course, into the trend towards buying chests with real money. It's always the same: the game doesn't force you to buy, but if you want to avoid the grinding caused by trying to get good-level rewards, then the micro-transaction is probably the fastest way and for those who get carried away by the progression of the units it is easy to fall into the trap, also because the pace of the game risks slowing down a lot, otherwise. This, paradoxically, is also a reflection of how much Rivals manages to immerse the player in its constant evolution, which is essential to give continuity to the gaming experience given the absence of a real structured campaign: the card system works well all too well, the problem is the artificial slowdown in the pace of evolution given by the randomness of the rewards in the chests.", "date": "2018-12-08", "grade": "7.5"}
