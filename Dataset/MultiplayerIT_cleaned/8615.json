Despite its radically indie soul, the spartan form, the minute dimensions, its fragmentation into many episodes represent perfect conditions for digital delivery, putting aside for a moment even support for the just cause of digital distribution for independent titles, it is to think that the journey of Commander Video deserved to be collected in a good old DVD distributed within an anachronistic package. Inside, the six titles belonging to the series seem to find their place like never before, within a celebratory collection that finally does justice to Gaijin's creature by giving it its right dimension, its overall picture. Bit.Trip Complete is not a simple budget-priced collection of previously released titles, made available at a favorable cost, much less a mere commercial operation: it is to all intents and purposes a concept album. As in certain rock works of the 70s, in the integral and compacted fruition you can see the common thread, a broad design that opens up to different and stratified reading levels and which gives a more complete sense to the epic of pixels and chip music, a project that risked remaining sketchy and misunderstood, diluted in the waiting times between the releases of the various individual chapters. Moreover, it is not even a simple naked and raw sequential collection, since Gaijin had the excellent idea of inserting new contents that substantially enrich the original offer, as well as various extra-game bonuses that will be widely appreciated by fans of the series, for whom even the beautiful CD containing the soundtrack could actually be enough to justify the purchase of the complete package. So long, Commander We are not here to analyze in detail the six chapters that make up the saga in question, to get a more precise and specific idea of what each title is about, we refer to the reviews of Bit.Trip Beat, Core, Void, Runner, Fate and Flux. already gutted at the time of their release on WiiWare and its surroundings, limiting ourselves now to giving an overview and evaluating the complete package, which also has several new features. On the other hand, taking a look at the individual reviews, it doesn't even matter to make large calculations to notice that the vote assigned to Bit.Trip Complete is not an average of the evaluations given to each single chapter, but it is somewhat above that value and we will see why. It is not easy to frame the six chapters of the series within the prevailing genre logic in the market: we can define them as puzzle games, arcades, rhythm games... any attempt at precise cataloging would still be reductive and misleading. These are concentrates of gameplay that dig to the roots of the videogame medium, deconstructing its forms and reconstructing them in an alternative, obsolete way, represented by means of a classic iconography but with disruptive effects. It's about pouring new wine into old wineskins and making them explode in phantasmagoria of colored pixels, recovering old forms and inserting them in different situations. Pong's bar is then inserted into a sort of scrolling shooter and becomes the protagonist of a fantastic story, light and dark pixels vie for control of an enclosed space and Pitfall runs meet endless running, the icon of the ready-to-wear video game. -porter of the third millennium, with highly original effects. All revised videogame archetypes that dismantle the superstructures to which the industry has now accustomed us to present us once again the beating heart of the interactive electronic experience: lights, colours, reflections and the constant, hyper-real danger of Game Over. Challenges that a gamer worthy of the name shouldn't miss. The news All this concerns the intrinsic value of the 6 games gathered in the collection, but Gaijin wanted to add something, which has proven to be essential to further increase the overall quality of the product. From a ~physical~ point of view, the package contains a beautiful CD containing 18 tracks from the soundtrack of the various games, some examples of chiptune music that will certainly be well appreciated even by those who are not normally exalted by the genre, re-arranged in order to be more suited to real songs, since the sound within each game is an integral part of the gameplay. As extra-game digital content, there are various side elements including 12 videos, 18 concept art and 6 ~letters to fans~ that can be unlocked by tackling the game in the most difficult modes and obtaining various results within each cchapter. These last letters are quite interesting as they partially explain the complex hermetic symbolism that characterizes the proto-history of Commander Video, providing interesting interpretations while leaving enough room for everyone's interpretation. Finally, as regards the actual game contents, important additions have also been recorded here: three selectable difficulty levels have been introduced, 20 new levels for each game, or a total of 120 new schemes to add to the original equipment and finally the long-awaited online rankings at the end of each single level, an introduction that was so lacking at the time of the release of the single games and which has finally been included in this collection, giving a remarkable sense of completeness to the gaming experience. Between bits and trips It is not easy to correctly convey the idea of what lies ahead once you pick up the controller and start each of the six games in the collection. Bit.Trip Complete is one of those titles that is truly mortified by the simple publication of screenshots or even videos, since the gaming experience is based on a particular fusion of gameplay and aesthetic sense, music, movement and colored pixels that influence each other each other and contribute to a continuous sensory stimulation capable of completely captivating the player. The fact that the performance of the latter affects both the graphic aspect and the sound, passing from the more spartan visualization and elementary sounds to a progressive increase of visual effects and pressing music hand in hand with the correct execution of the maneuvers on the controller, makes us fully responsible for what happens on the screen. The search for the correct performance, then, is not necessarily linked to the mere search for the high score as an end in itself - even if the fundamental introduction of online rankings also reinforces this non-secondary aspect - but overlaps with the desire to maintain the ~momentum~ , expand the multipliers, don't miss the correct musical rhythm. It seems strange to read if you haven't had to deal directly with the games in question, but the effort made in executing the levels in the best possible way takes on an aesthetic character here, understood precisely as a search for beauty, for sensory satisfaction which in this case derives directly from the skill of the player. Having then the possibility of seeing all the chapters together, it is interesting to try to give interpretations to the graphic and structural differences of each fragment of the Commander Video story, in search of that unitary design that seems to go from the first appearance in Beat to the primordial soup of Void up to the more complex plays of Runner and Fate and the ~homecoming~ of Flux.", "date": "2012-04-06", "grade": "9.0"}
