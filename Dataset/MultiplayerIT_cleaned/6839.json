Every year new figurines to buy. How long can an economic model of this type really be sustainable? How long will parents indulge their children's expensive wishes, and how long will their children still crave Skylanders? Questions that surely even in the upper floors of Activision will be asking themselves, trying to find new ideas and solutions in order not to starve what has so far been an authentic goose that lays golden eggs for the US company. Always stellar sales figures, well over 4 million Starter Packs sold for each chapter, albeit with a slight and constant decline year after year. But the moment of the revolution has not yet arrived: with this fourth chapter, back in the hands of Toys for Bob, the franchise continues on its path, consolidating a gameplay that is confirmed qualitatively well above the standards of ~boys~ games that we are used to knowing. Skylanders Trap Team is the best chapter in the series, but also the most economically demanding one Traptanium of wishes However, let's remove the field from any doubts: Skylanders Trap Team, this is the title of the new episode, is certainly the best chapter of the series produced so far, from every point of view. The decision to guarantee the Californian team 2 years to be able to carefully develop the product proved to be absolutely successful, and it is precisely by appreciating the all-round quality of the product and the attention to detail that we understand how the extra time was well spent. But let's go in order: as far as gameplay is concerned, Skylanders Trap Team is certainly not a turning point, since it basically finds itself retracing the action formula strongly based on combat that has distinguished the series. Obviously the ability to jump, introduced last year with Swap Force and proved to be highly beneficial to give greater depth to the gaming experience by allowing you to insert some platform elements, has been maintained. To expand the contents, Toys for Bob has also included a series of rather structured extra activities: the most robust are undoubtedly the Challenges of Fate of Kaos (a tower defense), the Arenas and the Clashes of Pietracielo (a simplified Hearthstone). However, it is a very pleasant, fun adventure, with an excellent pace and discreet variety, which can also be appreciated by those who are not necessarily a first-time player. The distinctive elements of this chapter are therefore to be found basically in three components: the Trap Masters, the traps and the portal. The first are the new Skylanders, which are recognized for the use of transparent weapons composed of the mysterious mineral Traptanium, and which are obviously distinguished not only by the aesthetic aspect but also by the associated element. The second ones are instead crystals through which it is possible to trap enemies (not all, only certain bosses, for a total of almost 50) thus transforming them into allies to be controlled directly just as if they were a Skylander. By pressing L2 you can in fact exchange the character in use at any time, thus being able to manage the abilities and powers of both in the best way. If the normal Skylanders have an energy bar which, once depleted, forces the player to put that character ~to rest~ by replacing it with another statuette, the Villains instead have a timer which determines the maximum time during which they can use. This bar can be restored by putting the Skylander back on the field, while it can be reduced prematurely for the hits suffered. Be careful though, because even the traps are distinct based on the element, as are the Villains. And guess what? Each Villain can be trapped and consequently used only if you have a trap of its own element. Finally there is the renovated portal, now more elegant and sober, transparent, lit up inside by an iridescent and colorful light. In addition to the platform in which to place the statuettes as usual, however, this time there is also a slot, which acts as a lodging for the traps. Particularly amusing is the presence of a speaker, of rather modest quality similar to the analogue integrated in the Wiimote, through which the Villain imprisoned in the crystal continues to express himself during the game, commenting with often hilarious phrases. It seems like a minor detail, and in reality it is, but it actively contributes to strengthening what is probably one of the best qualities ever of the Activision franchise: the characterization. Toys for Bob has managed over the years in fact to create a universe of settings, characters and enemies characterized by a personality at the level ofand the best animated films, and the level of attention placed in the care of this fundamental aspect of the game, to which a large part of the brand's commercial success is linked, is extraordinary. Doing the accounts As is well known, more than from the Starter Pack itself, it is through the sale of the extra statuettes that Skylanders has managed to consolidate a turnover with stratospheric figures. The main issue for each episode is therefore to offer a stimulus for the purchase of new characters, while maintaining a balance between this need and that of not forcing the hand too much so as not to annoy the most loyal users with their precious collections of statuettes . However, this balance, in this Skylanders Trap Team, has perhaps been somewhat lost: as in the past, there are in fact areas of the levels accessible only by the characters of a specific element, but in this case they must necessarily be Trap Masters. To understand this, if the access door to the area is of the Air element, a brand new Air Trap Master is required, not a simple ~old~ Skylanders with that affinity. It is obviously a marketing choice that however leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, above all in the face of the fact that in the past each new episode had tried to ~protect~ and give an effective meaning to the previous statuettes by granting them greater specific weight in the context of the game. Considering that each new Trap Master costs 17 euros for a total of eight elements, it is easy to calculate how much it is necessary to spend in order to appreciate the title in its entirety without incurring limitations of any kind. The same goes for the traps - from 7 euros each - which, as already mentioned, are also distinguished by the eight elements, plus the extra one required to trap Kaos: in this case, fortunately, their importance is not linked to access to portions of the level, more limited to the possibility of using all the Villains and the ability to enhance them through specific mini-games scattered within the levels. It should also be noted that, in a further level of consumerist perversion, six aesthetic variants of the traps are available on the market for each element. In short, for collectors, a real bloodbath. Turning instead to the technical component, despite being a cross-gen product, Skylanders Trap Team is simply delightful, especially if played on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. In our test with the Sony console version we appreciated lively, dynamic settings, full of details and characterized by an exceptional variety, obviously supported by the splendid work done on the characters (especially the more recent ones) and on the enemies. High definition, in this sense, helps and not a little to appreciate the work done by the American team: everything is more vivid and clear than in the past, enhancing colors and details. Just take Chompy Mage's transformation, for example, and get close to the camera to understand what we're talking about. And precisely with regard to the camera, the choice to keep it fixed continues to prove to be absolutely successful in order to avoid frustrations for the younger audience while almost always maintaining the optimal viewing angle.", "date": "2014-10-15", "grade": "8.5"}
