The Konami mobile game, available in soft launch in 2019, had in fact been shelved and removed from stores, it is not known for what reason, only to then rise from its ashes and become an exclusive for the Apple Arcade platform. In short, we are talking about a a more unique than rare event in the mobile and videogame panorama in general, which gives us the wonderful opportunity to try a real sequel to the classic Castlevania episodes in a premium format, free of microtransactions, exclusively in single player (the cooperative mode has been removed ) and comes with all-important controller support. History Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls, a dialogue between Alucard and Jonathan Set before the events of Aria of Sorrow, the story of Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls tells of the return of Alucard in his ~human~ version, the secret agent Genya Arikado. It's been some time since the last fight with Dracula, when the count and his cursed castle were sealed inside an eclipse, but apparently the menace of the vampire lord has not yet been eradicated forever. one day he receives a letter from Lucy Westenra, manager of Elgos, asking for his help: the magical books of Castlevania have begun to manifest an uncontrollable power and Alucard needs to enter the dimension of the grimoires to restore order, eliminate the monsters that are generating chaos and prevent the dark creatures from crossing the barrier that separates them from our reality. Personages Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls, the screen with playable characters, equipment and skills Alucard's expedition proves to be a success, even if in the book that retraces his deeds the warrior is endowed with inferior abilities compared to those he really possesses. This is the expedient that the authors of the game have devised to justify the solid RPG-style progression system that allows the characters of Grimoire of Souls to gradually improve their skills, unlock new ones and equip more powerful weapons and items. We talked about characters, in the plural, not surprisingly: in addition to Alucard, in the Konami mobile game we will be able to control several historical protagonists of the series, from Simon Belmont (Castlevania) to Charlotte Aulin (Portrait of Ruin), from Maria Renard (Rondo of Blood ) to Shanoa (Order of Ecclesia), and unlock more support ones. Each of them has different characteristics, capable of substantially changing the approach to action. Gameplay Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls, Simon Belmont faces some monsters with his whip Unlike the excellent Contra Returns (here the review), Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls presents traditional levels rather than short challenges suitable for mobile gaming. This means that the times for completing each stage are the standard ones, to the full advantage of a gameplay that thus has the opportunity to develop but which at the same time must give up the metroidvania component typical of the franchise starting from Symphony of the Night (here the review than the mobile version). The formula is therefore closer to the classic chapters, strongly action-oriented thanks to the presence of numerous enemies, bosses and mini-bosses to defeat, but there is no shortage of secrets to be discovered within the scenarios, primarily walls that can be destroyed or hard-to-reach platforms for finding hidden chests and obtaining extra resources. As mentioned above, the various Alucards, Simon, Charlotte, Maria and Shanoa are different figures in terms of skills and repertoire, which significantly increases the variety of experience when you decide to face an internship in the role of a rather that of another. It is possible to do it freely, but it is clear that continuing the progression of all the protagonists will limit the growth of those we prefer. From this point of view, the gacha elements have obviously been rethought on the occasion of the game's arrival on Apple Arcade , and although they are still present, they do not have a concrete impact on our ability to move forward in the campaign and overcome its challenges. The same goes for credits, which apparently don't run out when you need to use them to continue the game after game over. Checks Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls, one of the campaign boss fights The control system of Grimoire of Souls presents a set of touch controls of discreet workmanship but with some criticalities that are evident during the most agitated situations. the sticvirtual k is in fact equipped with a sensitivity that is too low, not adjustable, and therefore it happens to invade the screen with the left thumb, while maneuvers such as dodging, which require a slide, are often not implemented correctly. Luckily the game supports controllers Bluetooth, and this definitely changes the cards on the table. Using the physical controls, the gameplay gains a lot in precision and reliability, becomes more approachable in the boss fights (very well done, by the way) and, in general, conveys the sensations of a traditional Castlevania, even more so where you can enjoy the experience in front to the screen of an iPad. Structure and technique Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls, Alucard fights through the streets of a foggy city The system at the base of Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls is therefore surprisingly solid and interesting, capable of offering situations that are perhaps not very original, but capable of igniting the spark in the heads of fans of the Konami series. Well, to these successful aspects is added a rather generous structure, with over 60 levels divided into various chapters and a large number of extra challenges that can be accessed from the main hub. From a technical point of view, the original raster graphics of the Castlevania episodes has been taken as a reference for a transition to polygons that for once appears pleasant and harmonious thanks to the work of Ayami Kojima, with a good amount of animations and sufficiently varied scenarios, often capable of bringing the traditional atmospheres of the series. The soundtrack signed by Michiru Yamane is also excellent, which accompanies the action in an inspired way.", "date": "2021-09-20", "grade": "8.4"}
