{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess.html", "text": "Let's criticize it, love it, remain indifferent to it or get involved, in any case the N-difference is something that exists. Halfway between the marketing masterpiece, the unconditional adoration of the fans and the effective high quality of the products with the Nintendo brand, in fact, there is this kind of ~magic~ that makes the presentation, development and finally the market debut of some products of the Kyoto house something truly unique and special within the world of video games. Today, simultaneously with the debut of the Wii, we can witness one of the best, most explosive and brilliant expressions of the N-difference; we are talking, of course, of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. Wii love Link Since the leak of the first images and information, to then move on to press releases and movies, Twilight Princess has attracted particular attention to herself; on the other hand it was to all intents and purposes the ~real~ Zelda that a large part of the fans would have wanted instead of the courageous and - far too much - criticized Wind Waker, poorly digested in its cel shading graphics by those who had in mind a realistic and mature Link. Therefore, if we exclude the equally courageous and not very loved Majora's Mask, this Twilight Princess was framed from the beginning as the true heir of the absolute masterpiece Ocarina of Time. An enormous weight, however, brilliantly carried on his shoulders, and which has been able to withstand both the numerous delays and the news, at the last E3 in Los Angeles, of the hijacking of the project from Gc to Wii (although the cube edition has continued to survive with a semi-contemporary publication). The result of all these months of programming? A ~monster~ of 50-60 hours of gameplay, a colossal adventure destined to captivate players from all over the world for a long time within a universe that is extremely familiar to most, but not without its charm and attraction. On the contrary. But let's go in order, starting from the plot which once again is destined to make a very normal boy who lives in a small and quiet village into a legendary hero. The kingdom of Hyrule is threatened by a darkness that has enveloped every corner, transforming the inhabitants into frightened spirits and populating the territory with evil monsters. A dramatic scenario, which is accompanied by an often surprising development of events for the topics covered, which we could define as more complex and ~adult~ than the standards of the series. After a classic and slightly boring (however dutiful) introductory phase in which the rudiments of the control system and game mechanics are explained, Twilight Princess begins to get into gear with a series of not insignificant twists. Far be it from us to want to take away the taste of the surprise, we will limit ourselves to touching on the points already known such as the transformation into a wolf of the young protagonist, who in his first creation actually marks the point of detachment between the ~kid~ Link and the ~hero~ Link . A shocking change, which is accompanied by the knowledge of Midna, a kind of bizarre shadow being destined to accompany and help the player along the adventure, confirming a sort of ~tradition~ of the previous episodes. The transformation into a wolf will be the only way that Link will have to initially face the dark kingdom; this status obviously brings with it limitations (the impossibility of using objects and weapons above all) but also advantages compared to the human condition. The agility of being able to reach inaccessible areas, for example, but above all the presence of the ~instinct~ to be able to follow tracks, detect familiar smells and so on. A left-handed life The control system in Twilight Princess for Wii can cause a few more problems for left-handed players. In fact, the need to entrust the movement of the character or the use of the Wiimote to the right hand, obviously less precise, can create some embarrassment in particularly demanding situations, such as jumping between platforms or managing the viewfinder. Reversing the two hand controllers is a somewhat cumbersome and not always feasible solution. In general, this ~problem~ will probably recur with all Wii games characterized by a certain complexity in the interface; left-handers from all over the world, be warned! Long live the tradition Twilight Princess, as we said, is the ~ideal~ sequel to Ocarina of Time, and the references to the fantastic episode for N64 are numerous. There is Epona, there is the forest dungeon (as well as many other ~historical~), there is realistic graphics, and so on, there are numerous situations that seem to clearly want to step back from the road of experimentation for go to meet insteadsafely to the wishes of fans of the series. This chapter of Zelda can therefore undoubtedly be defined as less ~courageous~ in the strict sense of the term, representing at least initially the desire to return to tradition to perfect every aspect. And in fact, perfection seems to be the only concept that can be associated with the incredible ability that Twilight Princess demonstrates in skilfully connecting every situation and every action within a huge, vast, but strong world of absolute cohesion. Hour after hour, new opportunities continue to open up in front of the player, new motivations to return to places already visited or to move to unexplored lands; although the game is ultimately divided into large chunks, everything contributes to the feeling of an overall amalgamation without equal. All this not only thanks to the genius of the level designers, but also to the creatives who have written a story of such a high level as to maintain constant interest and motivation throughout the long adventure. An almost total involvement, which makes clear the goodness of the Nintendo production. Previously, we spoke of dungeons, which have always been one of the characteristic elements of the Zelda saga; within them a series of puzzles are solved in a nutshell until you reach the inevitable boss. There is little to say about the quality of the dungeons, since they are confirmed as excellent examples of game design even with some slight decrease in tone on a handful of occasions; only the archaic saving system is irritating, which always forces you to start again from the first room even with the puzzles already solved. The bosses, on the other hand, deserve a mention, representing in fact one of the highest playful moments that a gamer can experience in his career; the enormous size, the variety in the attacks and the need to discover their weak points in order to be able to knock them down bring with them several similarities with that Shadow of the Colossus who has made this experience his fulcrum, drawing inspiration from and developing the aforementioned aspect in turn from Ocarina of Time. And just like the Sony title, taking down one of these huge monsters brings with it a satisfaction that is difficult to describe in words. Wii? One of the big question marks at the time of the announcement of the Wii version of Twilight Princess was obviously how a project born and developed for Gamecube could adapt to the different potentials and above all to the different control system of the new Nintendo console. As for the technical component, the new Zelda is a splendid, at times incredible title for GC. That means it's best to forget the polygonal complexity and texture quality of next-gen consoles; it is not uncommon to come across a few too many edges or to see the definition collapse when approaching objects and settings. But frankly thinking otherwise would have been absurd, given that Nintendo has always been very clear from this point of view. The differences between Wii and GC are in fact limited to the presence of 16:9 on the new console and very little else. But anyone who is able to make the effort - or presumed such - to observe the graphics from an artistic point of view, will be able to enjoy an authentic show truly capable of not fearing comparisons. If the settings offer excellent variety and care, it is undoubtedly in the representation of the characters, Link in primis, that the graphics have surpassed themselves by managing to give the breath of life in each of them. The sound, on the other hand, can lend itself to numerous criticisms, starting with the contribution that orchestrated pieces could have brought to the overall gaming experience compared to the midi which instead constitute the musical accompaniment. Excellent, epic and engaging, mind you, but evidently limited by a choice not in step with the times; in this sense, therefore, the development on Gc is felt, with the capacity limits that the mini disks must consider. The absence of dubbing, on the other hand, appears less incisive overall: much better not to hear the characters speak, than having to accept voices perhaps of a quality not equal to the rest of the game. Speaking instead of the control system, it is clear that Twilight Princess was not developed around the Wiimote + Nunchuk; in most cases, in fact, the controller is used in a classic way, and pointing on the screen is practically only required to aim, for example, with some weapons (such as a slingshot, bow, boomerang, etc.), for splendid fishing - an authentic game within a game - and little else. In reality, the management of the sword has been delegated to the Wiimote, and in fact it is necessary to shake it both to draw it and to give a blow. But the need to take such an action insimultaneously with the pressure of a button or the stick to make the most complex slashes and the non-identity between the movement of one's arm and that of Link makes everything little more than a marginal feature. It should also be considered that more generally, the clashes with the creatures that populate the world of Twilight Princess are in most cases decidedly undemanding, making the aspect of the combat a little unbalanced also in terms of the numerous shots available to Link. Finally, the impossibility of manually managing the camera is rather irritating, especially during passages that require greater precision; the only alternative is to press Z to realign everything behind the protagonist's shoulders. Quick mention for the small speaker in the Wiimote, which reproduces some of the sound effects with an overall pleasant result despite the poor quality of the audio it offers. Zelda on Cube Twilight Princess on the GameCube is the complete opposite of the Wii version. At least if we refer to the conformation of the maps, given that these are all mirrored and that any object, house or character is on the right, on Cubo it is on the left. This, together with the lack of ability to display graphics at 16:9, a less clean video, but with the Free Camera in addition, is the most evident difference on a visual level. The rest is done by the Wiimote with its features that make everything more intriguing. You will have done it a thousand times to cut the grass with Link on the hunt for hearts and rupees, but not like on Wii, as it happens to aim with a bow or go fishing. Since the long tutorial, the curiosity to discover all the new things possible with the remote control make Twilight Princess an even more rewarding experience. That said, the Cubo version keeps intact all the charm and quality of a game capable of giving great emotions. Choosing which console to play it on probably depends on your desire for Wii. If you needed a little incentive to buy, the swipes of the Wiimote will finish convincing you, no doubt. Otherwise, fear not because Link's latest adventure is also wonderful on the GameCube. Antonio Jodice Comment Is Twilight Princess the masterpiece we've been waiting for? In a word, yes. What is surprising about Nintendo's work is, above all, the ability to provide a sparkling example of game design, making a huge world and an adventure of over 50 hours always, we always repeat solid, engaging, intriguing and above all perfectly connected in every juncture thanks also to a narrative accompaniment that is a real triumph. That said, however, it is necessary to underline how Twilight Princess is not an innovative chapter in the series, focusing instead on a refinement of most of the aspects that made Ocarina of Time great and thus fully meeting the requests of the fans. The step forward will probably be decreed by the next episode, the one really built around the Wiimote and which will exploit its characteristics to create new game situations, instead of asking it to reluctantly adapt to existing ones. But until then, Twilight Princess is hands down the best Zelda ever made, and a must buy for any video game lover. Pros The best Zelda ever made Incredible cohesion of every element Artistically sublime graphical appearance Cons Technically does not exploit the potential of the Wii Very limited innovation Control system not flawless The official guide from Nintendo If you are lost in the lands of Hyrule, kidnapped by the magical world of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, the strategy guide is probably the one for you.
