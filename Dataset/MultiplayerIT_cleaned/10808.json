{"name": "Men of War - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/men-of-war-recensione.html", "text": "We don't know how many of you remember a strategy game, released several years ago, called Soldiers: Heroes of World War II. It was a strategically interesting title, with rather detailed graphics that allowed you to tackle the title as one of the most classic real-time strategy games, ordering your units the position to reach and the actions to be performed by clicking on the mouse, or by checking these directly, moving them with the arrow keys, almost as if it were a third person action. The result was quite interesting and, especially for the time, decidedly successful, but it did not collect critical or popular acclaim: this experiment managed, due to a series of defects, to dissatisfy both strategy lovers and those of action titles, finding a niche only in the hearts of the most concessional players or those most attracted by innovations. Men of War collects the heavy legacy of the first Soldiers, with its baggage of criticisms, and aims to reproduce the same game mechanics, but better chiseled: will it succeed in spreading to the masses? Finally something realistic As mentioned above, the game mechanics have remained almost unchanged compared to the predecessor: what has been seriously revised is, first of all, the aesthetic aspect of the title. In addition to significantly increasing the number of details of each game map, reaching a very high level, the developers have made any element of the scenario completely destructible: however, this is not just a quirk or a cover feature, but rather something that it will seriously change how you will approach your mission: in fact, destroying all the buildings on the map will certainly help you in the offensive phase, but it will give your opponents an amazing advantage in a possible defensive phase. You will therefore have to carefully plan all your actions and foresee, as far as possible, even the immediate future: in Men of War you will have total freedom of choice and, as far as possible, also of action. Unlike many strategists, the best tactic will never be to annihilate the adversary, but rather to make him unfit for combat and then use his means to your advantage, after the necessary reparations, and thus the discourse of realism, which permeates every single aspect of the 1C Company title: you will have to pay attention not only to the various calibers of firearms, but especially to the areas where you decide to hit the enemy vehicles, given that a penetrating bullet, fired on a track of an enemy tank, it will render it immobile at the mercy of your infantry units, while a direct hit in the turret will force the crew out, allowing you to capture it and reuse it to your advantage. The perfect interaction between realism and the environment will allow you to improvise explosive traps using abandoned vehicles or to prevent the passage of the enemy in certain points by destroying structures and buildings, so as to force him to pass exactly where you want, all using only your ingenuity. This is, without a doubt, the best aspect of Men of War: to succeed in the missions you will have to put your neurons under pressure to get out of situations, generally, of strong numerical and technical inferiority. Finally something challenging Men of War is a game that, in no uncertain terms, does not forgive: an unfortunate tactical choice or a decision taken too quickly could make it tremendously difficult for you to successfully complete the mission. This translates into a level of difficulty and realism that we have rarely encountered in a strategy game, which is, without a doubt, the second main strength of this title: by now many of the strategy titles have flattened out on standardized mechanics, asking the user to perform the usual routine actions, making the whole gameplay too, far too simple. In this title by 1C Company, on the other hand, it will be truly a rare event not having to load a previous savegame once, even at the lowest difficulty levels: without a doubt this represents a very strong deterrent for the casual gamer, but it offers all players more serious a truly well-balanced challenge and a consequent satisfaction when you manage to defeat the enemy troops. Just the enemies boast a decidedly above average artificial intelligence and it will be very rare to be able to surprise them in error: it must be admitted that your enemies will always start from a position of clear advantage, and will be able to quickly analyze the positionion of your men on the battlefield and go and attack the weaker side, taking care to stay out of the reach of your weapons. Especially in the more advanced levels, when the challenge becomes really very high, we also had the opportunity to see the AI develop fake attacks (and they were certainly not scripts), to try to understand what was the weakest point of our training, as well as articulated encirclement maneuvers to hit us on the flanks. The defects Unfortunately, since it is still a production carried out with a rather small budget, Men of War has some particularly striking flaws: first of all, the impossibility of rotating the camera at will, which more than once will lead you to exasperation, forcing you to continuous adjustments to try to get a shot as precise as possible. Immediately following the very poor quality of the interlude films: not that the plot is, in any way, interesting, but such badly made films make us think that those videos were inserted only and exclusively to act as a link between a mission and the other, shortly before proceeding with the burning of the final version of the game: it is, of course, a secondary aspect, but which immediately makes the eyes jump to the scarce availability of money on which the developers have been able to count. On the one hand, we would like to compliment them for having focused on important elements, such as gameplay and graphics, rather than focusing on elements considered more secondary, but on the other hand, it would have certainly improved the overall evaluation, delivering a version to the market more cared for. On the other hand, the high difficulty of the game missions cannot be counted among the defects: finally, after years of flat RTS, Men of War will offer you a decidedly high level of challenge. Comment Men of War is a niche strategy title, which will certainly not be a great success among the masses, but which for fans, especially WWII fanatics, will represent a small, flashy diamond in the rough. Some basic problems greatly affect the playability of the title and will lead most to uninstall this title, but for those who have the strength to insist and look beyond these defects, we are sure they will find a title not only with very high replayability, but also capable of really testing the player's skills. Which is, in the current panorama of PC video games, quite rare.
