Yet, if with Assassin's Creed Recollection Ubisoft has shown that it understood and knew how to put it into practice, Square-Enix's attempt to propose a card game whose strengths were the splendid illustrations and the fame that some creatures of the Final Fantasy universe they carry with them. Guardian Cross is nothing more than a card game for iPad and iPhone in which the monsters to fight and collect include names such as Siren, Ifrit, the Moggles, Cerberus, and others well known to JRPG enthusiasts, while a role-playing structure supports a of collecting and upgrading the various characters through a campaign made up of quests and side missions. It is a pity that the Japanese giant has left a very important ingredient at home: the substance. Catch them all! And then? Square-Enix must be recognized for the effort of having set up a minimal narrative framework which, however banal and full of inconsistencies, acts as the glue between one battle and another. The lands of the Northern Cross have been invaded by the Guardians, powerful spirits who have reappeared after having rested for thousands of years, and the empress of the kingdom decides to send the player, in the guise of a talented Guardian Master, to investigate some mysterious happenings that are causing riots among the people. As in Pokmon, the player's goal is therefore to use his unique abilities to capture the Guardians and use them in combat. Not to the contrary, were it not for the numerous contradictions and inconsistencies of the story, such as the fact that even the most insignificant of brigands will challenge the player with a team of spirits. Other than unique skills. Leaving aside the dialogue cutscenes, Guardian Cross is essentially divided into two main parts. In the first, that of capture, it is possible to go to a special area inhabited by wild spirits, and through a top view and a viewfinder you have to shoot them down with a sniper rifle: time is limited, just as the number of times you can hunt Guardians in a day, but all creatures you eliminate during that time are added to your deck of cards. There are more or less rare, more powerful or of particular types, and the beauty of the illustrations is perhaps the only magnet that pushes you to collect them all by turning a blind eye to an extremely anonymous capture system. Curiously, collectible monsters are also cannibals, and can power up and level up if the player ~feeds~ them by sacrificing other cards. Increasing stats becomes an important element when you switch to the combat side and compare your cards with those of your opponent, but unfortunately this is where Guardian Cross trips, tumbles and crashes into the wall of the room. superficiality. The game has no active combat system, and once the game has started all the clashes between one's own Guardians and those of the opponent are resolved in cascade, until one of the two opponents runs out of cards. Between continuous turn-based attacks, the card comparisons are based on a classic system of attack, defense and other characteristics, but the inability to select the next Guardians or perform any action means that there is no strategy in the various matches. Get out of your head the idea that a weaker deck can prevail if in the hands of an expert player: if you were to start a match with a weaker team of Guardians than your opponent, defeat is almost certain. It's a system that for its simplicity and strategic inconsistency recalls Rage of Bahamut but which, unlike Cygames' hit, has the misfortune of having to support a game with different expectations made by a much better known company. The developers have also put their own into it, with some secondary modes and a sort of PvP tournament in which to face other players and win rare prizes, while the possibility of exchanging cards and interacting with other users highlights the more social component of the application .", "date": "2012-10-05", "grade": "5.0"}
