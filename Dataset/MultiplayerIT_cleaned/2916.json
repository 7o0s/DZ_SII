Very few, as we imagined, and on the other hand we had already addressed the problem of market saturation a few weeks ago with the review of Hyper Scape. Not even Ubisoft, betting everything on the close collaboration with Twitch and putting hundreds of thousands of euros up for grabs, managed to move players from Warzone and Fortnite, while implementing many different innovations in a game that, despite everything, was fresh and rather original. One wonders then how the boys of Proletariat will perform the miracle, even in the face of a beta that has failed to leave its mark or to attract hordes of players to its servers, a unique and fundamental element to establish the success of a massive game like this. Spellbreak tries anyway, landing on all platforms with a cross platform plus cross save system that could initially thicken the community and a classic free to play type of monetization ready to attract, hopefully, more than a few curious ones. However, there is no shortage of packages to purchase to get an initial boost of gold and aesthetic objects, with an outlay ranging from 50 euros for the Mage DLC up to 120 for the most complete bundle. So is Spellbreak worth our time? Where the magic is born Spellbreak is an atypical battle royale and this diversity is immediately evident as soon as you enter the game. Instead of the usual 100 players, the servers host half of them, while maintaining a generously sized map. All this therefore translates into a game system that rarely puts under constant pressure, instead trying to distinguish well the moments of research and enhancement from those where the fights to the sound of spells and magic are the masters. As the title easily suggests, in fact, in Spellbreak the guns are replaced by magical gloves, which remind us so much of Gully's from Battle Chasers, and which allow us to cast up to four spells once worn. In all we have six classes, obviously linked to the elements of the fantastic imagination with skills related to ice, lightning, poison, fire and so on. Overall, therefore, the game is varied even if it leaves something to be desired on the balance, despite the many months of closed beta that took place before the launch. In fact, if the Pyromancer and Cold-blooded skills can instill fear, the damage that can be generated with combinations of Geomancy and Thunderbolt are of a completely different kind. However, before being catapulted into the world of Spellbreak, you will have the opportunity to choose your left glove which, mind you, you will no longer be able to change for the entire duration of the match. Choosing one glove rather than another is not such a trivial choice because in addition to giving you two specific starting spells it will also allow you to acquire passive bonuses once you level up in battle, providing advantages depending on the chosen style of play . Quite uniquely, Spellbreak allows you to level up by surviving the various bubbles closing critical zones, granting you bonuses, upgrading your spells, and generally making you more dangerous. However, since the battlefield is common to all players, the exact same advantage will be given equally to all spell casters still alive, for a feature that tends to rapidly lower the time to kill as the game progresses . The skill therefore counts up to a certain point and luck, like any self-respecting battle royale, has its fundamental role. In addition to the gloves in the chests scattered throughout the game you can find belts, potions and amulets to inflate your health, mana and armor stats but also extra skills which, just like the Hyper Scape hacks will allow you to become invisible, identify the enemies behind the walls and much much more. The more you upgrade, the more you accumulate agility and the ability to move quickly around the game map until you become very difficult targets to hit and thus being able to give life to spectacular dogfights. Avada kedavra! The spell casting system is no frills and does its job fairly well except that the spells themselves create total confusion on the screen when multiple spellcasters collide in the game making it difficult to spot other players and essentially reducing almost to zero the readability of the action, an uncomfortable and unpleasant situation when two spells of the right ones cast will really be enough to put you out of the game. We then try to play cunning and exploit the environment to avoid creating this kind of situation but like thisin doing so, we also lose much of the fun for an alchemy that hasn't exactly satisfied us. It is a pity that the game does not return more pleasant feedback because the peculiarity of being able to combine spells to create even more devastating effects or try to counterattack with the opposite element at the right time were mechanics that could give more satisfaction if taken care of more. Even with the rewards and the game modes we are far from excellence due to very little originality, with the risk of boring the new apprentices after just a few game sessions. On the other hand, the graphic style is particularly pleasant, in a successful mix between Fortnite and Dauntless with a cel-shading that is not overly marked but still capable of giving a cartoon look that gratifies the eye. A waste then to inextricably link the decorations and customizations to the models of the various magicians, rather than managing them as usual aesthetic skins; what's the point of making us choose the character initially if then to select the rarest clothes we have to bend over to completely replace our hero? A carelessness that also drags on in the scarce end-of-mission rewards, which will force you to play for a long time before being able to buy any item from the daily shop. In case you want to spend some hard money, know that the prices are lower on the Epic Store and given the cross progress, we suggest you download the PC client if you decide to take the initial bundles.", "date": "2020-09-06", "grade": "6.5"}
