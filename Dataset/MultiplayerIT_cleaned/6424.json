The Capcom mascot has been missing for a long time, if we exclude its appearance in the roster of the recent Super Smash Bros. or the two retro games produced a few years ago, and the need for a new Mega Man or a game that follows is increasingly felt the footsteps, proposing that mix of unbridled action and difficulty over the top. Azure Striker Gunvolt is exactly that game: part platformer, part shooter and even part RPG, it draws heavily on decades of Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX and is an interesting but not very interesting hybrid. free from any flaws. The heir of Mega Man has arrived: it's called Azure Striker Gunvolt and it's a literally electric game One plug for each socket Azure Striker Gunvolt tries to outline a plot that unites about twenty stages, staging the clash between the homonymous protagonist, Gunvolt, and the Sumeragi, a company that has learned to control adepts like him, beings endowed with extraordinary supernatural powers . It all starts with the rescue of an adept named Joule, for which Gunvolt will decide to change his life, going from special agent to private detective, only to end up fighting against enemies that only he can face. The story is told through vaguely noir illustrations and dialogues that portray bizarre and fairly stereotyped characters, according to the tradition of Japanese cartoons. The style, moreover, is that of the old Mega Man in all respects, even from a graphic point of view: no polygons, only well-kept two-dimensional sprites and backdrops rich in details, accompanied by a techno soundtrack occasionally interspersed with real songs. The setting is also reminiscent of Mega Man X, and almost all levels are set in science fiction industrial complexes, warehouses or laboratories. After the first stage, which acts as a tutorial on the peculiar game mechanics, you move on to eight stages each presided over by a specific boss, which can be selected at will in pure Mega Man style. After completing four, you have to face an intermediate mission, then you defeat the four more bosses and we move on to the last four stages that conclude the ~campaign~. A ~boss rush~ mode and a handful of secret special stages complete the offer, within the limits of the typical longevity of the genre. From this point of view, indeed, Azure Striker Gunvolt employs the ~challenges~ system to extend the life cycle of the game without limiting itself to the typical scores without art or part. In fact, between one mission and another, it is possible to select up to three challenges to complete within certain stages: you go from achieving a certain score or a certain record time to overcoming special objectives, such as defeating certain enemies in particular ways. Once the conditions indicated in the challenge are met, you get money or materials as a reward with which you can manufacture objects, and new challenges are unlocked to face. In this way, the player should feel encouraged to complete the various stages over and over again to obtain each reward and improve his performance, simultaneously scraping together the experience points that allow Gunvolt to level up, to become stronger and more resistant and to learn new special skills to use in combat: up to four of them can be equipped at the same time, and each skill consumes a certain amount of points that recharge slowly, forcing us to choose which skill to use and when, perhaps whether to finish off the boss on duty with the devastating but expensive Luxcalibur or restore some life energy on the cheap. The 3D effect Negligible - just detaches the interface and dialogue boxes from the game plan, without affecting the gameplay in any way. For what little it does, you can also turn stereoscopy off altogether. A new Blue Bomber The choice of skills to equip and use is not the only strategic nuance of Azure Striker Gunvolt, since the entire gameplay revolves around the electric super powers of the protagonist. Indeed, Gunvolt fights enemies by opening fire with one of the various guns that are unlocked by passing levels, and which can be exchanged at any time: the Naga, for example, can load a piercing shot, while the Orochi generates a drone that fires a spinning burst in every direction, and so on. Guns do damage, sure, but mostly they mark targets,in a number that varies depending on the weapon held, redirecting the electric discharges that surround Gunvolt on them when we press the appropriate key. The energy field of the adept not only serves to damage enemies, but also to protect Gunvolt from various missiles or projectiles, at the same time allowing him to float slightly in mid-air and, therefore, to dodge various attacks more easily. The energy field consumes a dedicated gauge, however, and you have to wait a few seconds for it to fully recharge, or press the stick or D-pad down twice so that Gunvolt instantly recharges it: if it were to completely run out of electrostatic charge , our hero couldn't defend himself or attack for several seconds, so we'll be forced to micromanage the electricity reserve while marking enemies, dodging their blows and jumping from platform to platform. To our aid comes the equipment that can be equipped between one mission and another, namely two eye implants, a ring and a necklace. Some of these items alter the guns properties, others make the energy field more or less defensive, still others give Gunvolt the ability to dash or leap in mid-air. This RPG component seemed moderately useful to us, even if it is possible to complete the game without ever changing equipment, but the manufacture of the various accessories requires a fair ~farming~ of the levels already played to complete the challenges or collect the reward materials. The problem is that the level design is a bit fluctuating, and alternates particularly complex stages full of puzzles that leverage Gunvolt's electric powers to other much more linear and repetitive levels both in terms of layout and as regards enemies common, a little too similar for the whole game. A separate discussion for the bosses at the end of the stage, who repeatedly mention the historical nemeses of Mega Man and Zero: these opponents, much tougher than normal, have extremely complicated attack patterns and devastating super abilities that must be observed and assimilated if you want to dodge every attack and take out the target. In reality, Azure Striker Gunvolt is absolutely not a difficult game, not in the way the frustrating advanced stages of Mega Man Zero had accustomed us; on the contrary, it is actually a pleasant title that lends itself well to quick games, since it is possible to complete each stage in a few minutes. If on the one hand this approach seemed more in step with the times, on the other we can perfectly understand how little appeal it can have on those looking for a level of challenge that justifies the short duration of the adventure.", "date": "2015-04-10", "grade": "8.0"}
