In this sense, the modus operandi of the developer Colin Lane Games is moved by truly appreciable intentions, since he refuses to conform to the mass of similar titles to turn the source material inside out like a sock, proposing with this Battle Golf Online something that c has little or nothing to do with real golf, but at the same time it works very well as a mobile game... Golf for those who want to fight It is necessary to premise that Battle Golf Online is not a completely original idea, given that in 2016 the same software house had launched the almost homonymous Battle Golf on the App Store, an identical product as regards the basic gameplay mechanics but characterized by Atari 2600-style graphics and above all without the multiplayer mode which instead takes the lion's share in this new title. The basic but effective main menu allows you to start a game against artificial intelligence, to challenge an online user caught at random or to give life to a duel locally, with the two players sharing the same device. This is made possible by the very simple title control system, which literally requires the use of a single finger: in fact, in front of your character there is a dart that swings automatically up and down, pressing it once will block it, determining the trajectory of the shot and making the power indicator appear which must be stopped with a second tap on the basis of the force to be applied to the ball. So far, however, we are talking about things that for better or worse have already been seen several other times in the mobile sphere, while it is in the actual gameplay that the most original and genuinely fun part of Battle Golf Online is found. The objective of each game is in fact to make five holes before the opponent, positioned on a platform at the opposite end of that reserved for the player: an island stands in the center of the screen with a flag to point to, and as soon as one of the two challengers realizes the point, the structure disappears to make room for a new one with different characteristics. Speed of execution and precision are therefore two fundamental requirements to aim for victory, but Battle Golf Online stands out for a whole series of ~incorrectness~ that it is possible to perpetrate to the detriment of the contender: therefore, instead of concentrating on the hole, a user particularly petty could decide to aim at the opponent's head to stun him momentarily and have an advantage, or even to use his own balls to reject those of the other on the fly or to move those that remain lying on the playing field. Adding to the equation all those points that can arise due to the involuntary intervention of the challenger, it becomes clear how Battle Golf Online is a title that compensates for its almost total lack of technique with an out of the ordinary frenzy, which always makes the matches a lot of fun and unpredictable, despite the poverty of content put on the plate by Colin Lane Games. In addition to just the three modes, in fact, we must also take into account the poor diversification of the islets to aim for, which end up repeating themselves after just a few game sessions. Nothing that can't be remedied with a future update, just as the unattractive progression model would also deserve a tweak, which pushes the player to accumulate coins with the sole aim of unlocking headgear that has no value other than purely aesthetic . At least the application is honest in the management of the free to play model, inserting a single type of in-app purchase that allows you to disable all advertisements, which are not even excessively frequent or annoying.", "date": "2017-09-08", "grade": "7.7"}
