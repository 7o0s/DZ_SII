{"name": "Touken Ranbu Warriors", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/touken-ranbu-warriors-recensione.html", "text": "Sengoku era, samurai, time travel, monsters to be annihilated: ingredients that are actually a bit strange, especially for a hack 'n slash to be published just in time for the summer period. Yet, if Koei Tecmo has taught players anything, it is precisely to rely on its long-tested formulas, beyond content and protagonists. So don't be surprised if you find yourself pre-ordering a title like Touken Ranbu Warriors on the main digital stores, whose name may not tell you anything, nor are its images explanatory. Even the price seems justified by a precise multimedia context: Touken Ranbu Warriors is the second video game - this time completely in 3D - of a niche anime, Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru. The first was an online trading card game, Touken Ranbu -ONLINE-. Koei Tecmo's operation was to adapt to Touken Ranbu a genre that he masters perfectly: that ~1 vs. 1,000~ warriors that the writer personally can never distinguish so well from the real mousou. The result? An immediate, fun and discreetly cared for action game. Don't believe it? Read Touken Ranbu Warriors review. Plot: samurai and historical revisionism For the first time the protagonists of Touken Ranbu Warriors are shown in 3D The narrative context of Touken Ranbu Warriors is the same proposed by the anime Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru, but the vision of the second is not necessary to understand the first: the video game, in fact, explains everything you need to know through quick opening videos. Thus we learn that in the year 2205 the historical revisionists have begun, we don't quite know how, to attack the past in order to alter the history of humanity in their favor. The Sengoku period is especially targeted. The Government of Time has thus decided to run for cover, making use of the powers of the Seniwa, individuals capable of giving life to objects or of bringing historical swords of the time back to life by giving them the bodies of young warriors. The real protagonists of Touken Ranbu Warriors are precisely the Touken Danshi, fifteen of the most powerful Seniwa ever, in charge of protecting the historical era of Japan. So far everything is clear, despite a minimum of complexity still linked to a production that is not well known. To this context, the production by Koei Tecmo adds ~its~ plot. The Tounken Danshi are enjoying the spring, in a period of relative tranquility: but here comes yet another attack by the demons of the Army of Revisionism. As they face the monsters, a messenger from the Government, the fox Konnosuke, explains to them that the best is yet to come. The main fortress, called honmaru, is under siege, and yet another war against the enemy is looming on the horizon, in which the current forces of the Touken Danshi may not be enough this time... Gameplay: Part hack 'n slash, part mousou Bladed combat is at the heart of Touken Ranbu Warriors All the first missions of Touken Ranbu Warriors are designed to allow the player to become familiar with the basic (and advanced) mechanics of the title. Perhaps someone has come to the video game only because they are a fan of the anime in question: the developers of DMM Games have thought of them too, because the ~easy~ mode allows you to automatically perform all the more complex and powerful actions, so as to advance without the even the slightest problem. The purpose, in this case, is simply to enjoy a good story. The gameplay of the title, on the other hand, constantly oscillates between pure hack 'n slash and mousou. Before each mission the player chooses which Tounek Danshi to control (initially the choice is limited, later he will have the complete squad available), each with different parameters, movements and moves. The objectives of the individual missions may vary, but roughly it is always a question of eliminating every demon present on the screen, starting from point A and arriving at point B of a given environment. Nothing original, but the immediacy of everything and the combat system make Touken Ranbu Warriors a very satisfying experience. Touken Ranbu Warriors characters can interact with each other, if the player assigns them to the same rooms Each character performs the basic attack with Y, the powerful one with X; only the first of the two can be chained into a series of combos. Pressing R with the addition of one of the four basic keys then gives rise to a special action, which varies according to the combination and above all according to the characters present. In this way, the actions in combat and the offensive itself are extremely varied; masterall this keeps boredom away for quite a few hours, and the latter has always been the main threat of the genre in question. On the other hand, it is difficult to establish which of the two souls is the predominant one in Touken Ranbu Warriors: the action is always central, this is established, but the offensive methods by the enemies vary. Sometimes they attack in small groups of more powerful demons than usual - even triggering interesting QTEs with white weapons, in which one of the two duelists must prevail - other times it is impossible to keep count of the rivals on the screen, who rise in the order of hundreds . Here the hack 'n slash gives way to the real mousou, in which the main purpose is to demolish row after row of enemies, all identical and all equally insignificant. At the end of each level, the characters used gain experience points, powering up and unlocking new skills. Honmaru: home sweet home Graphically speaking in Touken Ranbu Warriors there is little to complain about Samurai, even those with magical powers, are not always at war: they have to rest. And when they rest, they go to the Honmaru, that is to say the personal fortress hosting the special forces of the Government of the Time. In the context of game mechanics, the Honmaru serves as the main hub, i.e. as a home base. But this is not the simple two-dimensional screen from which to save progress, access the settings, view the DLCs and, of course, replay the old missions and start the next ones to continue the story. The fortress also gives you access to a variety of passive activities. Individual Touken Danshi can in fact be assigned to specific rooms and environments of the Honmaru: that is, it will allow them to increase their experience, to unlock new skills, to obtain useful materials at a later time for upgrades. Not only that: the fandom will be able to witness original and unexpected interactions between individual Tounek Danshi, if the player is able to assign specific couples to equally specific areas of the house. In short, it is a variation in the constant flow of battles, a bit to make an offer more varied, and a bit also to finally experience something new. Action, style and a thousand thousand enemies await you in Touken Ranbu Warriors Incidentally, Touken Ranbu Warriors, in addition to a good narrative rhythm, also demonstrates in other aspects that it is not simply a product designed and sold ~just because the reference anime exists~. The soundtrack is excellent and combines songs designed in a balanced way for moments of action and not; the overall glance is more than satisfied, even in portable mode; minimal delays. The environments will not be excessively vast, but they compensate in care and variety.", "date": "2022-05-25", "grade": "7.5"}
