Being an expansion, Iceborne only marginally alters the dynamics of the gameplay that we have already explored in the original Monster Hunter: World review and in the numerous specials that followed. In short, if you want to know how the game works, we refer you to that article, assuming here that you have already played it and that you know the mechanics and contents that Iceborne is going to retouch and, indeed, expand. In this review we will therefore focus on the main innovations both in terms of gameplay and purely content. We will also dedicate a last and very short paragraph to the endgame: Capcom has strictly forbidden us to discuss it in detail, so we will limit ourselves to explaining how it affected our evaluation, referring you to a future study on the matter. New campaign, new monsters Monster Hunter's story never really mattered, although Capcom has taken a few small steps in that direction starting with Monster Hunter 4 to arrive at a fully voiced and cinematic Monster Hunter World. In this sense, not even the Iceborne campaign surprises for script and writing, but at least it serves as a pretext in a more intelligent way, pushing us to hunt for a specific reason: in this specific case, it all begins when the Legianas, a species of the new world, begin to migrate as if following a kind of ancestral litany. The hunters of Astera, investigating the behavior of these monsters, then discover the existence of Velkhana, an elderly dragon capable of changing the ecosystems in which it lurks. Thus begins a chase that will lead us to the Frosty Expanses, a new completely snow-covered region where the hunters will establish a new base: Seliana. Iceborne, playable once you reach at least Hunter Rank 16, immediately catapults us into a new level of difficulty, Master Rank or GM, which we could consider Monster Hunter World's G Rank. Although the GM versions of the old monsters are present from the beginning, the campaign does not linger on them, relegating them to optional quest objectives, and instead gives us various tasks focused on the new monsters, although in this sense it is important to make some distinctions . The Iceborne expansion integrates around twenty large monsters into the Monster Hunter World bestiary, but only a handful of them are truly new, while all the others are variants of the creatures introduced in the 2018 game, such as the Ebony Odogaron or the Tobi-Kadachi viper, or monsters from older episodes, such as Zinogre or Tigrex. And also from this point of view, the new monsters - such as Banbaro, Beotodus or Velkhana himself - are not completely new polygonal models, but skeletons remodeled for the occasion. This is perhaps the biggest limitation of the Capcom title, which probably recycles the same assets for reasons of time and memory. However, having overcome the initial distrust, we did not feel so disappointed by these new challenges which, on the contrary, surprised us when we thought we were facing the same monsters that we had already hunted for hundreds of hours. Monster Hunter World players will have to learn to dodge the water jets of a coral Pukei-Pukei that behaves completely different from its normal counterpart, while hunters who have faced the Glavenus in the Nintendo 3DS titles will be forced to relearn its attack patterns and then to forget them when they face its even more mangy variant, the caustic Glavenus. The unpublished monsters are then the ones that have given us the most satisfaction, starting with the Banbaro who sweeps the maps by dragging huge tree trunks with his horns. However, it is the elder dragons, especially the Velkhana and the Namielle, who steal the show from all the others: Capcom has really outdone themselves, designing fast-paced and dynamic battles with multiple mechanics to take into account while dodging the impossible. The Namielle spits water everywhere, setting up a deadly conductor for its spectacular and lethal electric attacks, while the Velkhana, which many of you will probably have faced in the demo version, is a fearsome opponent who initially can seem almost unfairly unbalanced, but which once assimilated certainly becomes one of the funniest monsters to face in the whole series. Even the old monsters, upgraded for the GM rank, reserve some surprises, new moves and much more damaging attacks, but we arehowever far enough from the prohibitive difficulty reached in the G-rank Monster Hunters for PSP, the one that conquered players all over the world, while binding them to a niche of fans for many, too many years. The facilities implemented in Monster Hunter World also and above all stand out in this context, softening the impact with new opponents thanks to greater clarity and accessibility as regards the accumulation of resources, the manufacture of weapons and armor, access to information useful on monsters' weaknesses and so on. The weapons and the new slingshot We must admit that we would not have minded to find in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne one of the best features of the latest Nintendo 3DS titles, namely the ability to choose the hunting style and arts that further personalized our builds. However, Capcom has not remained idle and has updated the game with a whole series of balances and additions that have significantly transformed the previously tested strategies. In Monster Hunter World: Iceborne most of the weapons have been revised and corrected with the introduction of new combos and special techniques. It would be difficult to list them all, but we can take as an example the Longsword, which can now be sheathed and unsheathed if necessary like true samurai to attack and counterattack enemies, or the Hunting horn, graced by new melodies that make it even more versatile in offense than it already was as a sidearm. In almost every weapon, however, the slingshot that Capcom had implemented in Monster Hunter World without ever expressing its full potential finds its place in one way or another. Initially designed to replace the old throwing bombs with a view to greater interaction with new and more sophisticated hunting scenarios, the slingshot turned out to be an uninteresting gadget that hunters used only in sporadic circumstances, for example whenever they had to blind or sully a monster. Its usefulness began and ended like this, although the maps were littered with resources to be transformed into relatively useful projectiles. The Iceborne slingshot, however, plays a much more interesting and convincing role, although it can now be considered a whole with the claw grappling hook that we have used so far to hook up to wedges and little more. Hunters can now unleash a sling shot in the middle of certain combos to deal additional damage based on the type of projectile loaded, force the monster to stagger, or radically alter combos, such as shortening Greatsword combos to charge the last one faster hit. Not all weapons use the slingshot in their combos - the Hunting Horn is one of them - while others gain, thanks to it, extremely damaging special shots, such as the new close attack of the Bow which discharges all the ammunition in a single shot . Now, finally, you need to start paying attention to the types of projectiles you pick up and load into your slingshot if you want to maximize damage. The slingshot / grappling hook and its ammunition, however, also affect the fights in another way that is much more elaborate, engaging and satisfying. Considerable as an evolution of the mechanics that allows us to ride monsters since Monster Hunter 4, the claw grappling hook can now also be used to cling to monsters - provided they are not angry - and actively intervene in the fight with two different maneuvers. The first depends on the weapon you are holding and allows you to hit the monster with a spectacular animation that will drop a special ammunition for us or for our companions, or it will weaken the part of the hit attacked, allowing us to inflict more damage and, if possible, split or cut it first. It goes without saying that, from this point of view, the choice of weapons in the team assumes significant importance, especially if the aim is to destroy a certain part of the monster to obtain specific materials. The second maneuver is a little more complicated and forces the player to micromanage the resistance that decreases as long as he is holding on. By attaching the monster to the head, we will force it to move, and then by unloading all the ammunition of the slingshot in one shot, we will induce it to charge in a precise direction, where an obstacle could await it against which it will hit its head, thus ending up on the ground for a few precious instant of vulnerability. Although the game automatically communicates through the interface when players weaken enemies, there is something magical about being able to communicate it verbally to other hunters to synchronize attacks, but after all it is well known that Monster HunterWorld is at its best in multiplayer mode. The latter hasn't changed one iota - except for the monsters' statistics, which now scale in real time depending on the number of hunters on a mission - and frankly we would have preferred a streamlining of the still cumbersome and limited participation system that penalizes a bit all when a connection problem occurs or some players have yet to see a cinematic alone before tackling a certain mission in company. Fortunately, net of these logistical problems, our experience on Capcom's private servers has been without problems: everything went smoothly and we can only hope that it will go like this at launch too, when all the hunters of the world will attack the online mode of Iceborne . Seliana and the Frosty Expanses Speaking of the multiplayer mode, it's a pity that Capcom hasn't found a way for players to meet in the city of Seliana, the new hub that will win your hunter's heart in a matter of hours. Compared to Astera, the new village is certainly smaller and less visually spectacular... but also much more versatile in terms of services and accessibility. You will find that you have practically everything within walking distance, from the botanical laboratory and the merchant ship, now represented by a single NPC, to the orderly who will be waiting for you in front of your quarters, without forcing you to load them every time you want to manage the hunted shipments. The distribution of services in the village helps to optimize times a lot, without forcing you to run here and there between one hunt and another, and if you really want to meet the other players you can do it in the new connected Gathering Hall. Seliana also welcomes a nice mini-game that dispenses consumables in abundance by literally pressing random keys, as well as the adorable Poogie to cuddle and take for a walk to find hidden objects in the corners of the village. Furthermore, Seliana's quarters are literally a game within a game: this time you can furnish them as you like with a plethora of collectibles such as curtains, carpets, furniture and paintings, all to be unlocked by completing the many optional missions. Obviously the scenery is snowy, perhaps a bit monotonous in its gray cast but consistent with the new map called Frost Wastes. We're not sure if Capcom has delivered on its promise of a larger map than its predecessors - let's say, the Ancient Forest still feels bigger to us - but the Frosty Wastes is still an interesting setting, enriched by a certain geographical variety that limited to icy ups and downs where hunters sink into the snow up to their waists, proposing underground caves, thermal clearings and suggestive crystal nests. The Japanese developer didn't skimp on the details, including geysers exploding around us, unstable ledges that risk collapsing under our feet and various other environmental interaction points that we can use against monsters and which help define a certain visual realism and in gameplay. Face to face with the blacksmith In this sense, we appreciated the introduction of new weapons and armor that were a little more ~fantasy~ than those seen in Monster Hunter World which, in terms of the visual variety of the equipment, left something to be desired. Players can now craft alpha and beta versions of every old and new monster armor with Master Rank materials, eventually forging level 12 items. Most new armor, and those related to major monsters, change significantly between the alpha form and the beta form and reflect the differences that distinguish each individual piece in terms of abilities and jewel slots. Hunters will have to rack their brains and find the most appropriate combinations, now also calculating the existence of level 4 jewels that can guarantee up to two random skills simultaneously, in addition to the increasingly curious and original powers that some outfits give. The weapon balance we mentioned, which tweaked the effectiveness of elemental and status bonuses, is likely to disorient many newcomers, especially now that most of these additional effects ask for the Awakening/Ammo+ skill , but the amount of weapons that can be crafted is, believe us, disorienting. We are met by the Bounties with the bonus rewards, the Monster Guide which tells us exactly how to obtain certain materials, the Alchemist with its fusions, but make no mistake: you will also have to ~farm~ in Iceborne and you will have to do it badly if you want build the best weapons and armor, but also armor styles and", "date": "2019-09-04", "grade": "8.5"}
