{"name": "Akka Arrh", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/akka-arrh-recensione.html", "text": "Akka Arrh (which stands for ~Also Known As Another Ralston Hally production~) is a Dave Ralston and Mike Hally coin op for Atari from 1981/82, which never saw the light of day in arcades. In reality, some tests were done, but the results were not satisfactory and the game, a kind of tower defense ante litteram, was shelved, i.e. production never started. It was basically too complicated for the kind of experience it required, so it was shelved even though it was practically complete. Of the original Akka Arrh, only three cabinets survived, which were found in Atari's warehouses in 2013. Having become a cult object, it was the source of a huge push and pull among retrogaming enthusiasts, to the point that legend has it that the rom arrived to The Dumping Union group in 2019, then emulated by MAME in the same year, was obtained through theft. The three collectors in possession of the cabinets had never granted the possibility of dumping the rom (it will be one of them to report the crime), which nevertheless found a way to get on the internet. Disputes aside, the first official launch of Akka Arrh took place only recently, i.e. on November 11, 2022 within the Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration collection. Almost simultaneously with its launch, it was announced that Jeff Minter was working on a more modern reinterpretation of the game, entrusted to him by Atari itself. Let's find out if the author of Attack of the Mutant Camels and Ancipital has managed to make sense of all this story in the review of Akka Arrh. Gameplay Yes, Akka Arrh is definitely a Jeff Minter game The original Akka Arrh told some kind of story that we don't believe has been retained in this remake, as there is practically no trace of it in the game. In essence Minter has maintained the structure of the original, but has changed many things, putting a lot of his own and reaching an almost absolute level of abstraction. So we still have the central turret, needless to say bull-shaped, and the levels are still abstract geometry, but the game itself works completely differently. As? The player fires bombs whose explosions create a shock wave that radiates in a different geometric pattern for each level. The enemies involved explode in turn, starting a new shock wave for a chain effect that can last several seconds (in some cases for the entire duration of the pattern). In the event that no enemy is hit and each bomb launched the combo is interrupted, but it can continue using different systems, in particular using the secondary weapon, i.e. direct projectiles, available in limited quantities (they are recharged by destroying enemies with explosions), which do not produce explosions of their own but can be used to eliminate survivors. The gameplay is as simple as it is addictive. Having learned the few concepts necessary to play, it doesn't take much to let yourself go to the flow of the combos, that is, to the mere pleasure of watching the screen fill up with lights and colors. The game immediately invites us to think not so much about how to eliminate enemies, but about how to create increasingly long chains of explosions, which allow you to multiply the score dramatically. From this point of view it almost seems to be in front of a puzzle game, rather than a shooter. The idea is precisely to create something dedicated to lovers of points challenges, offering a progression based more on the conformation of the levels than on the release of bonuses, however present in the form of collectible objects that give various advantages, such as indirect projectiles, more defenses and whatnot. Despite the many visual effects, the action is always legible The basic objective is not to be stolen or destroyed by the green capsules, crammed inside the base, located under the turret. When the enemies reach them, it is possible to go down to drive them away, always taking care not to completely lose sight of what is happening outside. As the levels progress, fifty in all, the enemies become increasingly aggressive and variations are introduced, such as surfaces on which the shock wave cannot propagate or creatures that fly above the explosions and can be only hit with bullets. Jeff Minter Akka Arrh's goal is to defend these pods Akka Arrh is a work by Jeff Minter, which translates into a simple, immediate and captivating game, with a deliberately psychedelic style. To understand the underlying philosophy, which is the one that has always characterized the good Yak, just think of how he made the music: he took samplesni audio from his personal collection accumulated over the course of his career, third-party stuff and his own stuff, so he created a sequencer that mixes the samples with those of various musical instruments, following more or less what happens on the screen. The effect is deliberately abstract, certainly not reducible to the classic concept of a sequence of musical pieces, but unique and highly creative in its own way which, combined with the graphics, made up of pure shapes, colorful explosions and a multitude of over the top visual effects, they create a decidedly acidic final effect, which very much recalls the author's latest works such as Moose Life and POLYBIUS. The race for points is the most exciting part of Akka Arrh Akka Arrh is proud of its uniqueness, which however is also somewhat of its limit because it closes the experience within a very small enclosure. Perhaps more modalities would have done him good, but asking them seems to be victims of the usual bulimia of an insatiable gamer, who in the face of a work of very marked authorship, still starts stamping his feet. For once we may as well avoid doing it.", "date": "2023-02-20", "grade": "8.0"}
