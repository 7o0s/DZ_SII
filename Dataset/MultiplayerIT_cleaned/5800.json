{"name": "Disney Infinity 3.0", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/161210-disney-infinity-30-star-wars-il-risveglio-della-forza-il-risveglio-del-play-set.html", "text": "In the huge marketing machine that is Star Wars, between gadgets and related products of all kinds, the release of Episode VII did not bring with it a real tie-in: a situation that was unthinkable just a few years ago, like video games taken from the most important cinematographic films represented a custom. Unfortunately, most of them were actually bad products which, with rare exceptions, limited themselves to making the most of the license by leveraging the passion of the fans or simply the less informed public. Fortunately, in recent times the mechanism has jammed, and proof of this is precisely The Awakening of the Force, which is in fact the first episode of the saga created by George Lucas that cannot count on an official video game: the thing that comes closest to it is therefore this Play Set for Disney Infinity 3.0 which, after the one dedicated to the classic trilogy and to the episodes I-III, concludes the series of contents of the Star Wars universe offered by the Disney product. The Force Awakens is a Play Set in line with the previous ones, dedicated to young Star Wars fans Where is the Force? The sales formula in this case is also identical to the previous Play Sets: it is in fact an expansion sold for around 35 in a package that contains two characters - i.e. Rey and Finn - and the miniature that allows, once positioned on the portal , to access the adventure. Poe Dameron and Kylo Ren are also available separately; it is obviously necessary to already own the Starter Pack of Disney Infinity 3.0. The quality of the statuettes is confirmed, it is worth repeating, excellent once again: the stylized and cartoonish trait that unites all the different series included in the Infinity cauldron is also appropriate in this case, capable of offering a credible alternative version of the characters from the films without these undergoing particular impoverishments in their personality and characterization. The actual game does not differ at all from what was shown with the previous Worlds of Together against the Empire and Twilight of the Republic: the gameplay is in fact always the same, with an adventure with a strong action tone in which it is necessary to face a whole series of missions to be able to reach the conclusion after about four hours, which become a couple more by deciding to complete the secondary ones as well. The combat system plays a very important role, a rather wise decision given that this element was one of those that enjoyed the most incisive improvements in this third installment of Disney's ~toys to life~ series. The large tree of skills, to be unlocked as your characters level up, allows you to expand the capabilities of the protagonists, making the clashes - both in hand-to-hand combat and with weapons - particularly pleasant. In this specific case, Rey is more skilled in close encounters, while Finn is at ease with his rifle. The exploratory element, through which the player is encouraged to examine every corner of the three macro areas available to collect power-ups and objects and to collect secondary missions, then constitutes the other important component of which the gameplay proposed by Avalanche Software is substantially composed . Although it is perfectly clear that the target of Disney Infinity is that of children, we continue to find, also in the case of this Play Set, an offer in terms of mission design that can be improved: the repetitiveness of the basic structure, which in most cases rotates around the classic dictates of collecting quests, it inevitably makes progression repetitive rather quickly. If some of the most interesting and spectacular sequences even manage to excite, others leave the player in a kind of emotional torpor that only the Star Wars atmosphere can interrupt. However, it must be said that, compared to Together against the Empire, the progression appears more fluid and flowing. As with the previous Play Sets, The Force Awakens also proposes a revision of the plot which in several respects differs from the original by eliminating characters, ignoring important events or proposing new and alternative ones. The result is undoubtedly functional to the development of the game with the appropriate rhythms, but it is clear that purists could find themselves turning up their noses perhaps in the face of a Kylo Ren engaged in philanthropic deeds of various kinds. Finally, from a technical point of view, no significant improvements are perceived compared to the previous Worlds of Disney Infinity 3.0, and the cross-gen component imposes a modest effort on the latest generation consoles both in terms of polygonal complexity and effects. The Force Awakens is therefore a Play Set that confirms the strengths and weaknesses of the previous ones, and for this reason the purchase is recommended mainly to those who have already appreciated the Star Wars-themed offers of the Disney video game and are interested in extending for one more handful of hours the same experience. It is certainly not a title for purists of the Lucas saga, but rather a variant dedicated to the youngest that allows them to creatively manipulate the universe of Jedi and Sith.", "date": "2015-12-28", "grade": null}
