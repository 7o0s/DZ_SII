Presented several years ago, Agony set out to redefine the concept of modern horror, offering us an extremely accurate version of Hell (based halfway between Dante and the paintings of the Polish Beksinski). All very interesting, except that the final result looks like something totally senseless and disconnected, with sections that have no reason to exist and a campaign all deadly the same and without any kind of bite, going to damage even an art design that goes from intriguing to anonymous in a matter of minutes. I'll take you to hell with me We would like to be able to tell you that, at least from a narrative point of view, Agony is capable of giving good moments throughout its campaign. Unfortunately, however, thanks to a gameplay bordering on the marketable, it resolves itself into scenes with little meaning that lead to a journey through some of the most iconic areas of Hell. If this weren't already enough, the (few) multiple choices present, praised as useful for discovering important narrative implications, give rise to pompous and rhetorical discussions, which would also make sense if they weren't instilled in a progression that completely loses its meaning. light of reason after the first handful of minutes. An unclear progression and an infinite series of documents act as a corollary which, while remaining among the most interesting things in the title, are not enough to mitigate the general confusion of a truly botched project. The production problems must have probably also contaminated the success of a campaign which could certainly have been interesting, but which absurdly finds in its extra content (the sessions in the guise of the succubus) the most valid moments and, probably, those that were least affected of cuts and censorships. The journey in the guise of a damned soul in search of salvation is therefore totally failed, between weak and repetitive demons and the search for an answer to the ~who we are~ which basically never arrives, if not for your interpretation that at a certain point you will force yourself to find it to justify the hours lost looking for it. To round off an extraordinary picture in style, we think of an ending so senseless that at times it recalls that of Firewatch, which however had a decidedly more successful journey on its side. Run, be silent, repeat Let's get to the heart of the matter: the gameplay. Agony desperately tries to combine the progression of the now inflated walk simulators with a stealth component that works with the same efficiency as the train timetables of the Bel Paese. During its duration (extremely variable, between five and ten hours based on how many collectibles you search for and above all how many times you get lost), Agony will take you through rooms and corridors of Hell manned by other martyrs, from which to draw in case of death, and by a small number of demons, who will not change their behavior for the entire duration of the title and who will simply require you to stay crouched and hold your breath in order not to be identified. As if the repetitiveness of these actions weren't enough, the reiterated mechanic of going in search of seals drawn on some walls, with the aim of then being reproduced on boards that open the next door, represents the icing on a cake that risks being indigestible well before the final bars. Even the nice found adopted after death, or the possibility of hovering with your soul in search of other martyrs or the same demons to possess, is ~embellished~ by such a quantity of bugs that you will often find yourself reloading the game without even understand what really happened. The actual death is then managed through a series of checkpoints that are sometimes too close and at others extremely far away, which moreover experience the annoying mechanics of counting the deaths. Once you have used the same checkpoint three times, you will be forced to return to the previous one, with the consequence of retracing areas you have already visited, further distorting a progression that is already tedious and not very stimulating in itself. To further complicate things, we think of environments that are always the same and a series of alternative routes useful only for the unbridled accumulation of collectibles and for getting totally lost on the streets of Hell. Precisely in the face of this, we advise even the most stoic to take advantage of the possibility of using, as many times as you like, the tracer that will give you the right direction. Also noteworthy is the Agony mode: facing it means putting yourself in frOpen to procedurally generated rooms, within which you will be called to survive as long as possible, killing as many demons as you can. Too bad that even the system that manages this mechanic is leaking from all sides: in fact, it will not happen infrequently to find yourself with labyrinths that end up exactly next to where you entered. I'm going to dinner at Satan's From a technical point of view, Agony is confirmed as a title that thrives on few lights and many dark moments, we would say almost in the dark, to be clearer and more direct. If any of you remember the beautiful first trailers released, in which you could admire an interesting technical sector and the possibility of experiencing the best videogame transposition of the underworld, the final product is far from this result. Between dancing textures, low-detailed models, so-so animations and rampant darkness, you will hardly be able to notice any of the interesting glimpses of the game. On the contrary, a frame rate that has rarely been so volatile will remain etched in your mind, which never reaches 30 frames per second and often drops to the point of almost freezing for fractions of a second; and the more unique than rare possibility of admiring an annoying tearing even on a console version of a title. Even the audio sector, which indeed enjoys a discreet dubbing in English, is undermined by a perpetually deceptive proximity, which in a stealth game is hardly forgivable. A soundtrack has not been received that we can hardly even remember, despite the writing of these lines a few hours after the last test pad in hand.", "date": "2018-06-04", "grade": "4.0"}
