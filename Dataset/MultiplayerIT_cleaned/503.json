We will therefore analyze the adventure starring Yuffie in a separate piece, trying here to concentrate instead on the news and improvements made by Square Enix to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake experience with the PS5 version, which as you know can count on a substantially enhanced technical sector and on a whole series of tricks that try to fix the sometimes funny artistic oversights , let's call them that, of the original edition. Prerogatives and original version If you have read the excellent review of Final Fantasy 7 Remake signed by our Christian Colli, and even more so if you have already completed the game, you basically already know everything there is to know about the playful offer of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade. Otherwise, give us a few minutes because we're about to give you a quick but dutiful recap. The result of years of work, an extremely complex project on paper yet brought to a conclusion in the best possible way, the remake of the 1997 classic Square lends itself to multiple interpretations , which inevitably change according to the nostalgic value attributed to this ambitious production. However, there are no doubts when it comes to the quality of the direction, the characterization of the characters and the ability to enrich the original system in an effective but respectful way. What landed on PS4 last year is obviously a new game and as such it has taken the responsibility of reworking various elements, also and above all narrative, to offer a relatively fresh and unprecedented experience both to old-guard gamers (who will most of all perceive the value of this remake) as to those who have never picked up the It's the original Final Fantasy 7. Free upgrade from PS4 version If you have already purchased Final Fantasy 7 Remake for PS4, and therefore it is not the version of the game given away by Sony to PlayStation Plus subscribers, you can upgrade for free on PS5 in a very simple way. In fact, just find the Intergrade edition on the PlayStation Store, press on the adjacent dots and select the free upgrade. If you have the title in digital format you can proceed directly with the download, otherwise you will be asked to insert the disc into the player for verification. No work to do instead for the Trophies, which will synchronize automatically. The free upgrade does not apply to those who redeemed the game via PS Plus. Gameplay Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, a fight sequence in the slums. Beyond the excellent atmospheres and the care with which every little detail has been brought to the screen, net of the well-known blunders with the textures and a very limited degree of interactivity of the scenario, basically old-gen, the developers have put field effective and interesting solutions on the gameplay front, combining real-time combat, dynamic switches and strategic planning to obtain a surprising and satisfying mix. motion), but the degree of challenge and, in general, the fun are guaranteed by the number of threats that we will face along the way, by the facets of the combat system and by the excellent boss fights, which often require changes of tactics and put table rather varied situations, with moments of great spectacularity. A system that holds its ground during the eighteen chapters that make up the long game campaign, for a duration that easily reaches forty hours and that does not experience particular moments of tiredness, also thanks to the characterization of secondary missions and the depth given to inventory management between different weapons, materials and upgrades. PhotoMode Among the novelties of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade there is also the unprecedented Photo Mode, which allows you to take advantage of the great spectacularity of some sequences and the most evocative moments of the experience to take memorable virtual photos. To activate it, just pause the game and press the Square button, then moving the camera to get the desired angle, possibly hiding the pesupport characters and scroll with the d-pad through the various adjustments, which include a series of filters capable of substantially changing the atmosphere of the image. New features on PS5 Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, Cloud Strife in an intense shot. If in terms of content the PS5 version of Final Fantasy 7 Remake resumes what was seen on PS4, net of a couple of surprise additions that we do not think is the case to reveal and which are linked to the aforementioned Episode INTERmission, it is clearly the technical sector that traces a clear separation line compared to the original edition of the game. In addition to the much faster loading guaranteed by the SSD and a frankly basic DualSense controller support, Intergrade in fact allows you to select two different graphics modes from the options screen to prioritize the definition or to performances, therefore playing at 4K and 30 fps or at a lower real resolution (1620p, approximately) but with a stable 60 fps. Resolution or performance? Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, the fights gain a lot in the transition to 60 fps. We tried both graphics modes and there really isn't the slightest doubt about which one to prefer: the 60 frames per second revolutionize the experience and make any phase of the game substantially more enjoyable, from night walks between one assignment and another, in where one often stops to admire the eerie but fascinating sky from the slums of Midgar, to the most frenetic fight sequences, provided you adjust the camera well. The difference between 30 and 60 fps catches the eye in particular because the resolution mode seems obtained through a simple lock, characterized by a frame pacing that never really gives a sensation of great fluidity, almost communicating a component of effort on the part of the graphics engine in managing the large settings and the characters that move within them, as well as the 'effects that especially enriches the boss fights. Other technical improvements Therefore, the 60 frames are better, which are also very sharp even on the 4K panels and allow you to grasp the clear improvements made by the developers to the general cosmetics of Final Fantasy 7 Remake; with an eye towards the lighting system, now more present and interesting albeit net of some small blunders, and the textures, visibly redesigned. Speaking of textures, as previously mentioned, one of the problems of the PS4 version revolved around to the quality of some assets, inexplicably blurry or pixelated. Well, the Intergrade edition fixes the vast majority of these defects, giving us much more refined graphics, up to the importance and ambitions of this production.", "date": "2021-06-10", "grade": "9.4"}
