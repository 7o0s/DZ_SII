One of these is the arrival of licensed titles on the market which, year after year, see the development teams commit themselves to completing a product that is based on a fine balance between innovation and tradition. We have to recognize that you churn out a game every 365 days, given the times that are running, it's not that simple, even less if you think that in a year developers have to pull something out of the hat that can intrigue and convince players to buy the new chapter. In this review of MotoGP 23 we will take you to discover the innovations designed by Milestone, the undisputed queen of licensed two-wheeled titles that arrives punctually for the appointment with some innovations that promise interesting changes capable of dampening the repetitiveness of the periodic cadence imposed. full package MotoGP 23 presents itself at the annual appointment with interesting news Over the years, the Italian company has demonstrated an immeasurable passion for the world of two wheels, with products such as Monster Energy Supercross, MXGP and SBK, not to mention RIDE, one of the most successful games of all the titles dedicated to this world. Working under license requires different attentions, cutting off creative freedom in order not to stray from the official sport championship and reference category. MotoGP 23 is no exception and looks like the title we would have expected, made up of the classic sectors: Career, Multiplayer (local and online), Quick modes and Training. The strong point, as usual, is the official content, with the inevitable update of riders and tracks designed to reflect the current World Championship of the top series, in addition to the Moto2, Moto3 and MotoE. As far as Multiplayer is concerned, there are the classic online races which, thanks to the crossplay function, can count on a very large number of players and pit players from various platforms against each other, even from different generations. Although it is not new, we find in MotoGP 23 the much appreciated split-screen mode, with which we can play side by side with a friend on the same console or on a single PC. This chapter has not limited itself to doing a lazy homework , updating the riders list and the progression of the tracks: MotoGP 23 in fact introduces new features capable of intriguing both long-standing players who confidently await the new title every year, and those users who are not inclined to buy licensed titles annually, but they decide from time to time based on the news. Towards the world title The arrival of the Rivalries in MotoGP 23 will lead us to the world title by dampening the boredom of the succession of races As we said above, the heart of MotoGP 23 is undoubtedly the Career, the most important content to deal with on an annual basis. Being a licensed title, this sector must reflect the official championship, but it is the how that makes the difference: although Milestone has its hands tied and must faithfully respect the real world, it has a wide margin on the activities to be proposed during the race towards the title, in other words the key to dampen the repetitiveness of the races. Many sports titles in recent years have sought the right formula to entertain the public, giving more and more controls in the hands of the player, who can decide the set-up of the vehicle and must pursue various objectives during the race for the world title. In this chapter, in fact, in addition to choosing compounds, set-up and the possibility of asking the team to intervene on braking and stability problems, there are the Rivalries, i.e. the need to place above a specific driver or more generally, for example, to re-enter the top 15 or 10 during qualifying and races. MotoGP 23 In essence, if you decide to embark on a Career, we will find ourselves facing the last Moto3 races, the decisive ones for making a name and a good reputation before moving on to Moto2. In addition to achieving the team's objectives, attitude will also determine the contract proposals we receive and, in the small part inherent to social media, our replies, contemptuous or cautious, will determine our reputation within the paddock. Furthermore, Milestone has decided to introduce an interesting peculiarity compared to other sports titles: only the first rider is able to decide the development of the bike, something that should spur the player to improve quickly and conquer this even more coveted place in theto your team hierarchy. Finally, we liked the fact that you can move up a category or continue in the same class until you feel ready enough to switch. In the saddle In MotoGP 23 the Flag to Flag finally arrives to liven up the races Although these innovations have pleasantly impressed us, the most important part of the game is represented by the driving model, a black beast that for many has represented a sometimes insurmountable obstacle to fully appreciate the world of two wheels. This chapter introduces the Neural Aids, a support from the artificial intelligence that intervenes while driving by helping the player in the braking, acceleration and handling phases. This feature can assist both novices and those who have already had to deal with the series, helping him to learn the right trajectories and the correct braking points to make the braking with perfect timing. Test in hand however, the takeover of this sophisticated AI rather than teaching takes away any possibility of intervention from the player: neural braking, for example, allowed you to simply hold down the trigger to accelerate and little else, without ~teaching~ anything concrete. The learning curve also in MotoGP 23 is quite steep, almost prohibitive for new players This is a real shame because MotoGP 23 is really tough even for the most seasoned players. The driving model that tries to be more and more advanced and realistic every year collides with a rather steep learning curve that requires some time before being able to tackle a race obtaining good results. For novices, all that remains is to spend the necessary time inside the MotoGP Academy, a section of the game dedicated to studying the tracks, with help and indications on how to become familiar with the circuit and the bike on which you are riding. However, fans will be happy to know that one of the most requested features over the years has finally arrived; we are talking about Flag to Flag. Due to the introduction of dynamic weather, it will now be possible to return to the pits during the race to switch to the bike with a dry (or wet) set-up depending on the weather conditions. Unfortunately, currently, everything is completely automated and there is no possibility of controlling the jump from one saddle to another, but we undoubtedly appreciate this first approach which will probably be explored in depth starting from the next chapter. New game, same problems The rivalry in MotoGP 23 also lurks inside the pits; only the first pilot can choose the technological upgrades The innovations introduced in MotoGP 23 are undoubtedly interesting and manage to refresh the progression of an annual title that inexorably risks being boring race after race without that something to tease the player in the climb to the world title. Milestone has therefore found the right formula, the same one that fortunately is consolidating itself in every title dedicated to two and four wheels. The pace is the right one, but unfortunately this attention is still not appreciated on the technical front. One of the main problems that has always afflicted titles of this kind is the behavior of the AI of the other drivers on the track, aggressive and not ~intelligent~ to the point of avoiding forced contacts. Also in this chapter we must record that, although there is greater tolerance in small contacts in braking, the artificial intelligence continues to be rather mischievous, effectively ignoring our positioning on the track most of the time. While changing difficulty levels, both of the game in general and the percentage of skill of the other drivers, they travel on pre-set tracks and they didn't give us the impression that they have become more correct or able to challenge us fairly in the corners or even on the straight . Fortunately, contacts don't always lead to a disastrous crash or opening the throttle while leaning unseats the bike: Milestone decided to turn a blind eye and let him ride to the limit, aware that in reality it would instead lead to a retirement and the closing of the zero-point race. Finally, the graphics sector has not undergone major improvements compared to the past, given that the engine on which it is based is the same. Of course, we were more than aware that this chapter would not make a leap in quality and all in all the performance of the bikes and tracks is excellent, which unfortunately cannot be said for the facial models which are now really dated. As far as fluidity is concerned, on PCs with an i7-13700K and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070Ti on board, we have witnessed noticeable frame rate drops in the most agitated phases, condition that does not change even with lowering the image quality. Some updates will probably be needed to optimize the code.", "date": "2023-06-08", "grade": "7.5"}
