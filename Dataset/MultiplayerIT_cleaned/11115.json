The gameplay of Chronicles of the Chosen is certainly faithful to its original spirit, and although deep and well structured, it is still a bit too classic for 2008 palates. Random battles, for example, are still characterized by excessive difficulty right from the start, despite the conceptual simplicity that distinguishes them: traditional turn-based clashes with the possibility of casting spells, as well as attacking with the weapon supplied, and nothing else. Certainly, the variety of spells available, often necessary even for the simplest clashes, helps to deepen a battle-system that is however obsolete, which still shines during the clashes with the most impressive bosses, truly deadly if they are not faced with the right strategy . However, there is a lack of all those features now proposed by the vast majority of modern RPGs, starting with the equipment, here really limited, or the interface, the real sore point of this remake, so minimalist and antiquated as to clash even with the new hybrid graphics. Both the portraits that represent our characters and the simplest menus seem to come straight from the NES, with color palettes at historic lows and excessive navigation slowness. And yet, Dragon Quest IV is still today one of the deepest JRPGs on the market, full of sidequests, mini-games and secrets. For the occasion, Square Enix has also implemented a multiplayer mode that is actually rather useless: by keeping the Nintendo DS on, it is possible to detect another Nintendo DS with Dragon Quest IV set up for an exchange of objects between players via wi-fi. A rather remote and implausible possibility, but we appreciate the effort, so to speak. Dragon Quest: Chronicles of the Chosen is available for Nintendo DS. The Chronicles of the Chosen, DS edition It has been mentioned that Dragon Quest IV has been widely imitated, and as an example we can mention Wild ARMs, a series that has metabolized a feature of this Dragon Quest that was decidedly original at the time: the real story of the game begins after a short prologue and a series of separate chapters in which we get to know various characters, discovering their motivations and adventures, before they join the real protagonist, composing the group which, in the last stages of the adventure, will have to face the usual super - villain before he takes over the world. In reality, the plot of Dragon Quest IV, albeit delightful, today appears a bit dated, and resolves itself into a hunt for the villain that may perhaps appear naive, while maintaining a decidedly epic and captivating tone. Compared to the original Japanese and the PlayStation edition, this version for Nintendo DS offers revised and corrected texts, for the first time in excellent Italian: we can therefore savor the nuances of the various characters, perhaps among the most charismatic of the series, and appreciate mostly the crazy world that was Enix and now Square Enix. The Final Fantasy softco, however, did not stop there, and has placed a decidedly particular care in this version of Dragon Quest IV. Instead of rebuilding it from scratch, as happened with the recent Final Fantasy IV, he instead proposed a very successful mix between old and new, which is already expressed by the graphics: the world, the cities and the various explorable settings are three-dimensional, while the various characters are pretty classic 2D sprites; the peculiarity of the new setting is constituted by the rotation around an imaginary Y axis that can be practiced by pressing the back buttons, while the perspective of the sprites will change accordingly. This crossing works wonderfully and keeps the classic feeling unchanged, however, projecting it in a more modern, albeit spartan, guise. What really amazes is instead the maniacal care placed in the animations of the enemies during the fights: as per tradition (at least, before Dragon Quest VIII for PlayStation 2) only the enemy is visible, and each of his animations or special attacks has a high number of frames and, in some cases, of particular rotations of the shot that make its features spectacular. As for the sound department, most of the melodies have been rearranged, resulting in a good quality if not particularly memorable musical accompaniment, while the sound effects have proved absolutely terrible and outdated. Comment Dragon Quest: The Chronicles of the Chosen is an excellent starting point for those who have never played an episode of this historic saga, thanks also to the excellent Italian translation. There is certainly the impact with the archaic spirit of the game to face, but its twenty years of legacy knownot yet loaded with a fascinating playful power. An overly classic but still compelling battle-system, supported by a well-crafted hybrid visual sector and excellent longevity... Square Enix's nostalgic operation is decidedly successful, but the game is really old-fashioned and newbies will feel the weight of it, mainly due to the crude interface and the total lack of touch-screen support. Perhaps we could have done better with this remake, but we are only at the beginning of the trilogy, and with Dragon Quest V - already released in Japan - and Dragon Quest VI we will see some good ones. Pros Technically very good Still an addictive JRPG Cons Outdated gameplay Old fashioned sound effects, okay, but still bad There is a premise to make, before talking about this Dragon Quest. It is a remake, of course, and to be precise of the fourth installment of the series. But it is also a port, of the PSOne edition which was the first, true remake, and which was the first to offer this adventure in the West. It is also fair to underline how Dragon Quest IV is a game for the NES almost twenty years ago, and how it is considered a bit the paradigm of many modern Japanese Role Playing Games. That said, welcome to the usual fantasy world designed by Akira Toriyama, mangaka who gave birth to Dragon Ball, where deadly colored jellies with stupid smiles are some of the deadliest threats. Those who love Dragon Quest can't miss this historic appointment with the past - and the future! - of the series.", "date": "2008-10-22", "grade": null}
