Two years later, we also have confirmation that ~In search of robots~ was actually just an appetizer of what would later arrive in the form of ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission, a title released a few days ago. The game signed by the Japanese team takes up and expands on what was seen in the collection with which Sony wanted to demonstrate the potential of its virtual reality viewer, completing the work done to make these potential concrete. ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission makes involvement its greatest strength, and it is a platform with which Japan Studio has perfectly achieved the goal of creating a title that PlayStation VR owners must not miss. Let's go see why. Playstation 4 trophies ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission has a total of thirty-seven Trophies. In addition to the usual Platinum, we find three of the Gold type, nineteen of Silver and fourteen of Bronze. Many of them can be obtained during the five worlds that make up the adventure, but we also find some linked to specific actions at certain times that make the undertaking a little more difficult for completion freaks. Plot and mode: in search of robots From the minigame featured in The PlayRoom VR, ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission takes up the basic concept. A brief introduction shows us some happy robots in their ship, until a bad alien arrives to spoil the party: the robots end up scattered among the surrounding worlds, while the pieces of the ship are similarly catapulted into the clutches of scary creatures. The prologue therefore offers us the pretext to go through the five worlds that Japan Studio has prepared for us, each of which has special characteristics and game elements that manage to keep the level of fun high. The single world is made up of a series of levels in which BOT (ie ~us~) and Captain ASTRO (ie the surviving captain we control) must find the rest of the gang. An undertaking easier said than done, because the robots are often placed in hidden places, which on the first pass may therefore not be noticed by the player. Each level also offers a certain amount of coins, which can then be spent inside the ship itself: in fact, the latter acts as a recreation area, allowing the user to have fun with the rescued robots and play with vertical fishing where with the claw you can Collect balls that contain ASTRO BOT collectibles. Also during the normal levels it is possible to unlock a series of over twenty challenges, thus finding a concrete way to break the course of the main adventure. The exploration of all the worlds takes about five hours, after which, depending on one's desire to complete everything one hundred percent, the player can go back to the levels where he hasn't found all the robots, or devote himself to secondary activities described above. It won't be exceptionally long lasting by the standards of non-VR games, but compared to other virtual reality experiences ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission can definitely have its say in terms of longevity. Gameplay: a volcano of ideas The game dynamics of ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission take advantage of all the equipment the user has, making whoever has the viewer on his head the true protagonist of a dimension suitable for a robot. Indeed, Japan Studio has done an exceptional job in developing a platformer that uses PlayStation VR not only to make us an element of the world around us, but also to make us interact with the environment around us in ever new ways. In general we find ourselves moving ASTRO with our DualShock 4 (the only supported control peripheral) while strolling on platforms and making jumps, marveling from the first moments at the precision with which the developers have realized these aspects of the game. An aspect that is not at all trivial, considering the visual depth to which ASTRO BOT sometimes resorts to make us go to discover its secrets. Each level offers its own dynamics, and it's amazing to see how Japan Studio has peppered ASTRO BOT with gameplay-related ideas, introduced as we go along to keep the bar constantly high for fun. There is, for example, a level where, taking advantage of the waves of the sea that gradually arrive, it is necessary to advance between platforms and enemies, while in another we emulate Indiana Jones on board a trolley. The player is called to inteoften interact with the environment, using the three hundred and sixty-degree view to look for the robots hidden in the most unthinkable places, even going to lean around corners to see what is hidden behind them. To allow ASTRO to continue its journey, it also happens that we have to headbutt what is in front of us, or have to perform other actions in the first person with the help of the viewer. In many levels we are also granted the possibility of using particular gadgets, hooked to the reproduction of the controller that we see within the game: a couple of them are a grappling hook or a pump that shoots water, but we won't stay here to list everything because the pleasure of discovery is part of a gaming experience that we absolutely do not want to spoil. We therefore complete this paragraph by talking about the bosses that we find at the end of each world, typically represented by a creature with disproportionate features compared to those of our little protagonist. Once the shift pattern has been identified, the challenge is not particularly high, but between teeth to be extracted and other inventions, ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission also hits the target from the point of view of the final clashes. The latter are then part of the unlockable challenges, thanks to which we can then go back to facing one of the creatures even separately. The graphics: a show of colours The task of describing the sensations experienced during the course of ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission can be difficult at times, especially when it comes to the sensory aspect of Japan Studio fatigue. Under strictly technical analysis, ASTRO BOT is one of the titles with the best graphic detail among those present in the PlayStation VR playground. At least on PlayStation 4 Pro, the definition of the image leaves no room for unpleasant graininess, allowing the user to appreciate all the care that the developers have placed in the details of each single level. Each passage is characterized by a setting of its own, which thus takes us from exploring the belly of a whale to walking in the clouds, or going in search of the robots on a beach crowded with enemies playing football. As the camera moves forward to follow ASTRO we have never had problems with motion sickness, instead experiencing a sense of vertigo when jumping from particularly high platforms: we imagine that this is in any case an effect desired by the developers, to allow the user to ~ feel~ on his skin the evolutions of the robot thanks to virtual reality. The audio sector accompanies us with an excellent soundtrack, never annoying, also taking advantage of the 3D sound to help us find the robots: by straining our ear we can in fact hear their request for help, thus following the direction from which it comes to save them . And then there's ASTRO, our little travel companion. LittleBigPlanet's robotic version of the Sackboy takes advantage of our being part of the environment to interact with us, urging us to move forward or performing an amusing ballet at the end of each level. All the animations are very nice, even in the phases in which the rescued robots ~enter~ our controller after a short curtain.", "date": "2018-10-04", "grade": "9.0"}
