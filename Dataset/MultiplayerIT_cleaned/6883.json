Beyond the superficial ~resigned~ hack'n'slash aspect, in the new project of Arrowhead Game Studios, those of Magicka, there is really more. The spirit of the old 1989 coin-op has remained intact, including high difficulty, all strengthened by a nice diversification of the four heroes that we can choose and by a very diversified and functional upgrade path. Too bad, however, that so much attention paid to customization and cooperative dynamics does not correspond to a wealth of content that allows the game to survive in the long run. But let's go in order. Four heroes in deadly dungeons - the 80s classic Gauntlet returns In our recent Early Access trial, we were struck by the interesting and effective diversification of the skills of the four protagonists. The elf is equipped with an infinite bow and arrows, but also with a providential somersault to get out of the way, without forgetting a grenade with a generous reload time, to be rolled among the enemies or, better, to be thrown instead of a simple dart. The warrior, the ~tank~ of the group, is perfect for causing a lot of damage while standing in the midst of dozens of enemies with his ax, with a quick and light blow or with the more powerful but slow and loaded one. If we then want to intimidate the opposing ranks we can charge them directly like an enraged bull. The Valkyrie is similar to the warrior for normal attack melee, but is more versed on ranged attacks, thanks to the Captain America-style throwing shield and the ability to lunge with the spear. But we cannot fail to mention that the ~boomerang shield~ itself can also be used to great effect to protect us from enemy attacks. And then there's the wizard who, like the elf, shares an almost dual stick shooter setting. Fire, ice and lightning. Three elements, each equipped with a double fire mode (pass us the term) to be triggered by key combinations that are not exactly immediate to use or better to memorize. But once you learn the combinations properly, the magician becomes perhaps the most fun and rewarding to impersonate. The wizard is the emblem of the cooperative approach of the game. For example, it can launch single or parabolic fireballs from a large area of impact, ice beams, area lightning, or protective bubbles. All types of spells perfect in conjunction with the attacks of the other party members. In fact, Gauntlet is a title that should be played exclusively with other friends: all the flaws of the Arrowhead Game Studios project come to the surface even more strongly, starting from a level of difficulty calibrated on a multiplayer approach. Alone the normal difficulty is really challenging, almost punishing also considering that if you die at the hands of dozens of enemies you go back to the beginning of the level. We are not at the level of a Dark Souls but the first few games can be a good test for the nervous system. Obviously, in solitary it is possible to better appreciate the growth path of the character through the acquisition of skills that reward the player with real perks which over time have a significant impact on the gameplay. They are obtained by doing a little bit of everything: by eating or destroying food, by killing hundreds of enemies, by dying, by destroying everything that ~furnishes~ the levels or who knows what else. They are all passive characteristics: it is possible to obtain reduced damage, more time in ethereal form once dead, or less gold lost after each departure. Gold that is used to buy relics, which give bonuses to our statistics but also effective and powerful artifacts. Unfortunately, however, all the customization of the character is only aesthetic, therefore no changes to the basic characteristics. There is therefore a lot to unlock, especially in view of the four characters to be properly eviscerated. Unfortunately, however, Gauntlet does not seem very rich in terms of variety and playful offer. The three areas, in turn divided into four sections, complete with a normal level, a special level, an arena and a boss, although different in terms of setting and fauna to be killed, give the impression of being all the same. The spirit of the game is that and revolves around killing dozens of enemies seamlessly. But it is immediately clear that we are not dealing with just any Diablo, and after having turned the corner and destroyed yet another nest of monsters from which enemy after enemy come out in time, it is possible to feel a certain tiredness. It must be said that Arrowhead Games has done everything possible to remove this feeling, including traps, bosses, secret rooms, hidden keys to open doors and so on, variousthen going to the maximum enemy ranks from the perspective of the stone-paper-scissors scheme of our heroes' abilities, but the sense of repetitiveness is really very high. Alone so it's almost better not to play it. Together with other friends, the game literally explodes, but more for the goodness of the alchemy between the protagonists (but also for the ~bad things~ that it is possible to implement, such as destroying food restores energy) than for the actual quality ( and variety) of the contents offered. In secret rooms On a technical level Gauntlet is certainly not an exuberant title and even at the maximum detail it does not make one cry for a miracle. Wastelands, fiery caves or labyrinthine castles are truly standard settings, but despite not being particularly inspired, they effectively immerse us in the mood of the game. A technical aspect therefore decidedly functional to stage epic battles with tons of opponents on the screen, in which, however, it is easy to get lost even when playing alone, let alone four. Also because the view from above is really ~very high~ to allow you to embrace a large portion of the dungeons, and this can make it a little difficult to enter some rooms, hiding the outlines of the door from view. Venial sins of course, but when you are surrounded by mummies, demons and so on it can sometimes be annoying.", "date": "2014-09-30", "grade": "7.8"}
