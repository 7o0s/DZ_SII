Even if there are quite substantial differences between the two versions: in the case of the albums born from the mind of Robert Kirkman, Michonne is in fact shown in the grip of an inner drama much greater than the one glimpsed on TV, caused by feelings of guilt for the loss of her two daughters after the outbreak of the zombie epidemic. Precisely this element was at the center of the Telltale Games miniseries, which we are dealing with today thanks to the publication of its third and final chapter. The Walking Dead: Michonne closes with a good ending, waiting for Season 3 of Telltale Games What we deserve With What We Deserve, therefore, the brief experience of The Walking Dead: Michonne concludes, on which we will express an overall judgment here, together with the usual considerations on the final episode. For details on In Too Deep and Give No Shelter, we refer you to the respective reviews, limiting ourselves to remembering that they had disappointed us a little for different reasons, while being appreciated for the possibility of deepening the knowledge of a beloved character like Michonne. Just after the experience of What We Deserve, we can say that the developers have achieved this goal, taking advantage of the events proposed by the trio of episodes as a way to deepen the conflict that torments the protagonist. At the same time, the curiosity of those who wanted to know what happened to Michonne after temporarily leaving Rick's group is satisfied. The epilogue of The Walking Dead: Michonne also manages to do justice to the fates of the secondary characters, leading the player to develop empathy for some of them as the story reaches its action-packed and bloody finale. Trying to avoid spoilers that are not functional to our evaluation, we can say that the plot of this third episode naturally begins where we left off the second, namely the showdown with Norma and her group. The initial flashback, apparently unrelated to the rest of the story, has the task of making us a little more attached to Pete's group, whose members will then become a crucial part in the scene of the hostage exchange, in our opinion one of the most guessed not only of this miniseries, but also of several other Telltale Games productions. The same goes for the final scene in which Michonne faces the ghosts of her own remorse, through a dramatic montage that manages to excite even the hardest of hearts by alternating visions of the past with the reality of the present. The third is good Also in terms of videogame experience What We Deserve presents itself as the most successful episode of all three, leveraging on the things appreciated on the occasion of its two predecessors. The quick time events are always present, but fortunately, as in Give No Shelter, they are never abused, finding the right compromise to give a good adrenaline-pumping dimension to the various action scenes. As already mentioned, the attention towards the feelings of the individual characters also returns, both in view of their confrontation with particularly difficult events to digest, and in interpersonal relationships, through scenes such as that of the hostage exchange in which it becomes really difficult to decide what to do. We return once again to this scene, because with our actions it allows us to define important contours for the story of this miniseries, even if in the end everything goes the same way as the writers expected. Although the false impression of being able to change the events remains, typical of the titles developed by Telltale, it is a good compromise that allows us to hope for something different for the third season of The Walking Dead, scheduled for this 2016. merits of What We Deserve, the main flaw concerns its duration, equal to even just under an hour. Not so much for the choice itself, given that the rhythm of the narrative seems to gain from a more television series cut, but for a consequent need to slightly review Telltale Games' pricing policies. The Walking Dead: Michonne was and remains purchasable in a single solution for 14.99 euros, to get on balance just over three hours of gameplay. Before the final considerations, we confirm that we liked the technical aspect of The Walking Dead: Michonne, appreciable above all as an evolution from the point of view of details and performance of what we saw in the previous two seasons. Also good was the performance of Samira Wiley (Orange is the New Black), in the role of Michonne, as well as lsoundtrack, including the True Detective-style theme song.", "date": "2016-04-27", "grade": "6.5"}
