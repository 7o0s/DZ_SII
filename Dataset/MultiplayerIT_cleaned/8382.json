{"name": "Pronti a diventare pittori?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/106717-new-art-academy-pronti-a-diventare-pittori.html", "text": "Art Academy, released in 2010 for the Nintendo DS, has sold very well: more than two million copies worldwide, not counting those distributed through the (previous) digital publication. Inevitable therefore that a sequel would arrive on 3DS, once again developed by the European division of Kuju. Inevitable also because, leaving financial matters aside for a moment, the main problem of the Art Academy was precisely the hardware on which it ran: low visual rendering and a mediocre touch screen (limited to the graphic context, of course) kept it away by people with a minimum of painting experience. Unfortunately, this sequel, rather than an authentic successor, is a sort of update of the previous chapter: an enlargement, a refinement, but still a software intimately linked to the progenitor, perhaps too much. So much so as to develop its merits, leaving its - few - defects intact. In the classroom For anyone who doesn't know or hasn't tried Art Academy, let's specify that it's not a game in the classic sense: just like Wii Music, and other projects on the same line, it's more like software (graphics, in this case). Of course, there are playful legacies here and there, for example certain lessons cannot be tackled if others have not been completed, but they are secondary elements, which do not affect the ~educational~ soul of the work. Educational, yes: because Art Academy, more than a software for professionals, or at least more than a program for those who already know how to draw, is a cartridge that should introduce anyone to painting. And in this, just like two years ago, it succeeds incredibly well. The various lessons (this time more than fifteen, divided into two brackets, simple and advanced) are well structured, clear and precise. And they follow an excellent gradual development, never tiring, capable of brilliantly alternating theory and practice, as is indispensable in the artistic field. First there is the exposition of the concept, with some brief but emblematic historical references, then Leo, the virtual teacher, shows how to proceed before leaving the brush in the player's hands. The various lessons are also internally divided into stages, so as to show one problem at a time, making everything more understandable and mechanical. We go from the ~simple~ chiaroscuro on a fruit to the creation of relatively elaborate landscapes, all while tackling the enormously complex problems exposed here, we repeat it again, in a surprisingly effective way: the alternation of colours, the various combinations of complementary tones, the black chromatic and so on. All difficult concepts that, we say with certainty, you will have clear once you have completed the Art Academy: even if you are not an expert painter, at least you will have several more knowledge to ~read~ the paintings. The biggest drawback in this field lies in the only evident detachment of the game: between the last simple lesson and the first advanced one there is a precipice in the middle. The level of autonomy required is very different, even the colors must be prepared by themselves (Leo suggests the names, without directly showing the tones) so as to be almost a separate mode. To color Among the tools, Art Academy offers various types of pencils, pastels and charcoals, but there is no doubt that the fulcrum of the experience lies in the colours; in oil paints, specifically. In the game it is only mentioned, but the painting methods presented, which often rely on the processing of the backgrounds when they are fresh (or, vice versa, dry) suggest that the reference technique is precisely that of oil painting. And it was precisely in the act of coloring in and of itself that the game was expected to take a necessary and desirable leap forward, but it hasn't arrived. As mentioned, the lessons are excellent, but just like in the previous episode, the sensitivity of the touch screen is a problem: the pressure levels are not many, and the brush inclination is applied digitally. Put simply: whether you hold the stylus straight or bent 45, the effect on the screen is the same. Aware of the problem, the developers have included the possibility of (virtually) selecting the inclination of the instrument, but you don't have to be a designer to understand how different it is to ~select~ something like this or put it into practice directly, both on a purely practical level, because it does not allow improvisations or direct intersections between different signs, both on the mimetic / emulative one, given the unrealistic nature of this option. Another major technical problem lies in the delay, annoying to say the least, which elapses between pressure on the touch screen and the appearance of the sign on the screen. It is not a defect that manifests itself in the initial stages of the painting, but laterhaving already worked a bit on the canvas: once the various layers of color have been created, the hardware struggles to hold the work and starts to lose some strokes. Which makes it practically impossible to get ~dragged~ into painting and get lost in improvisation. We reiterate: all problems that already existed in the previous episode, released on a console dated 2004. And for this reason they were at least limited. Of course, there is also the possibility of trying your hand at free painting, that is, free from lessons, directives or any other imaginable imposition. Just you and the canvas, and if you want a photo to refer to, which you can also take in first person. Here you will be able to see the result of the lessons, but be careful: as written when we reviewed the first episode, Art Academy is an introductory software to painting, not drawing. And in this single field it is the best product on the market, which is no mean feat. For everything else, go elsewhere: Colors! 3D, to draw and paint freely, is certainly more suitable. Both for the precision of the controls, and for the possibility of creating three-dimensional images and for their online sharing, absent in New Art Academy.", "date": "2012-08-08", "grade": null}
