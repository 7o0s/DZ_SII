Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom represents the perfect summa of the will of the current market. Funded via kickstarter now three years ago, the first work of the French team Enigami draws heavily on the stories written about twenty years ago by the designer Samir Rebib himself. The title is studded with great ideas and just as many problems, which end up turning it into a game that is difficult to digest by the general public. A vibrant and palpable passion pervades the whole project, but this is not enough to make it enter the Olympus of independent productions. Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom can give you many hours of fun, net of the technical aspect The (usual) threat looms Talking about the plot of Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom is as simple as it is obvious. We are near fairy tales, despite some sporadic tints of narrative maturity. Everything takes place immediately after the abrupt landing of Cado and Poky on a land unknown to them. The two Waki - this is the name of the race - will be called to save the universe accompanied by three other playable characters and a spirit called Terra. In about fifteen hours needed for the main quest alone, the game will put you in front of initially cold power intrigues and relationships, which will consolidate or finally break up as the events go on. Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom certainly cannot be considered a title that makes narrative (and gameplay) originality its forte; but at least as regards the lack of standard cutscenes, replaced by well-made comics, these make everything more pleasant and worthy of your attention. Traveling to the Celestial Islands freely will give you the opportunity to discover an artistically extraordinary world inhabited by crazy creatures, more or less hostile based on the type and our behavior. Its RPG nature will push you to discover more deeply the characteristics and possibilities of a wonderful land. Surely you will not live the role-playing experience of your life, but the title has several arrows in its bow and tries to exploit them in the best way. Playstation 4 trophies Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom certainly does not lack a good dose of trophies to conquer. Forty-three to be exact, including the coveted platinum. The requests to bring them to your bulletin board are the most diverse, from earning an S a hundred times in combat, passing through the creation of at least ten recipes, up to the need to finish the game without a single KO. It could take at least thirty hours for all these tasks, which can increase dramatically based on the speed and ability of each individual player. Fighting game Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom is particular, even if the first few minutes are enough to understand that we are faced with a very classic role-playing game. Through a menu that can be called up with the triangle you will be able to manage equipment, party priorities, skills and quests. All normal, at least until the first fight during which we find ourselves catapulted into an episode of Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm. What we would normally deal with a series of characters and their abilities becomes one-on-one combat within a well-defined arena. The possibility of taking turns with another companion and the need to deplete the life bar of all opponents, before they do the same with you, is the basic rule on which the whole experience is based. It wouldn't be a fantasy RPG without magic, which manifests itself here in the form of elements. In the wake of products such as The Last Airbender, in Shiness each of the five playable characters is associated with an element and, through this, can use their ~shi~ to perform the most disparate actions. Understanding how the elements work, and knowing how to harness the right party members in battle, will often make the difference between life and death. For example, consider that you are facing an enemy that you know is resistant to water and weak to fire: choosing to take the water-bound hero with you into battle and leave the one who can manipulate fire out, I will put you in double disadvantage. Furthermore, the shi, to be recharged, needs a period of concentration of his character. The combat arena itself comes to your aid in this. Each of them, once generated, alternates its color.Concentrating while the arena is the corresponding color will recharge its shi pool. A rather nice and original idea, able to make people smile and have fun on more than one occasion. If dodging, parrying and the possibility of counterattacks to be performed at the right time are added to these elements, Shiness proves to be appreciated by both purists and those looking for an experience that is different from the usual. At the end of each fight, experience points will be awarded that can level up the characteristics of each of your companions. Alongside their growth with ever better equipment, you will be able to face any battle that the Sky Isles are ready to throw at you. Like a cartoon, but I move it We have already praised the artistic sector of Shiness, made up of colorful uncontaminated territories and warehouses full of the worst desolation. The title of Enigami is a pearl from the point of view of animation and is seasoned with comic scenes that have nothing to envy to much more expensive productions. Everything about the background of the world of Shiness and the maniacal care for each element exudes the passion of those who have spent decades designing the characters and the story. Too bad that the disappointing technical realization can not hold a candle to the rest. Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom is the classic title that, due to its ambition and the time needed to make it, has not enjoyed that phase of optimization and filing necessary in the current market. Here you will often find yourself unable to jump from one level to another on a map, just because some absurd invisible wall forces you to necessarily go around. One certainly cannot cry out for a miracle even with regard to the textures and polygonal models, splendid in the case of the main characters and dull and difficult to recognize for all the enemies on the field. The menus, an essential element for the writer when it comes to RPGs, suffer from little aesthetic and manufacturing care, putting in your hands a confusing management of the elements and graphics that almost recall a one-day placeholder in full development. If you are able to overlook these elements and take Shiness for what it is, that is a great effort and style exercise of a truly independent software house, you will be able to enjoy a pleasant and satisfying experience, even if crippled by a budget. up to the needs.", "date": "2017-04-26", "grade": "7.7"}
