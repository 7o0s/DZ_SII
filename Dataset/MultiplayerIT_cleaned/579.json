{"name": "Lula 3D - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lula-3d-recensione.html", "text": "You've come a long way baby... After a presentation halfway between humor and eros (in both cases, not too elegant anyway), we are immediately launched into the game. Lula has come a long way and has now become a director and producer of her films which she makes in a luxurious villa in Beverly Hills that she owns. Everything seems to go on well until our ~Lulina~ discovers that three actresses of her new hard production have disappeared into thin air. Starting to search the mansion, we will discover that the disappearance occurred due to the kidnapping by some masked big men who forced the three girls into a black van. Since Lula is a tough girl, she decides to go on the trail of the kidnappers and to reach the resolution of the mystery she will have to move far and wide on the roads of the States between San Francisco, Colorado, Las Vegas and Mount Rushmore. Excessively fluctuating puzzles... As you may have guessed from the images on this page, Lula 3D moves on the typical point-and-click adventure coordinates with the exception of the fact that we will be able to move the protagonist freely using the keyboard. Certainly, however, we are far from the quality that had distinguished Lucas productions or the most recent masterpieces by Benoit Sokal: the CDV title presents puzzles that are sometimes all too simple and then move on to situations that are difficult to solve except with the help of some walkthroughs or through the most bizarre attempts to continue the story. As if that weren't enough, during the game there are various problems in the interaction of the characters or objects (quite simply the interaction with the latter, in certain cases, will only take place by placing oneself in very restricted spots without a precise reason other than that of a nice and good bug ...) and in addition to having to put up with an excessively long split of our Lula's legs every time she takes a new object, even the dialogues are rather flat and unable to give any depth to the narrative plot. the title presents puzzles that are sometimes too simple and then move on to situations that are difficult to solve except with the help of some walkthroughs or through the most bizarre attempts to continue the story But at least the sex Things are not even better for some mini-games present (some ~shooter~ and ~beat'em up~ sections) which have an imprecise control system to say the least. Arrived up to here, someone may be saying to themselves: ~but at least there will be some hard material in this Lula!~. Also in this case, unfortunately, the game turns out to be very disappointing since one could have thought of a minimum interactivity in the few and short ~sexy~ cut scenes starring the busty blonde. The rest of the ~sexual elements~ present in some settings can at best elicit a smile but nothing more: moreover, the magazines and hard DVDs that we will collect, unlike what one might have thought, are by no means unlockable extras given that these last there is not even the slightest trace! If until now we have certainly not presented an idyllic picture for Lula 3D, things get even worse when commenting on the visual quality of the CDV production. If we were in the last years of the last millennium, we would have talked about a discrete 3D engine with a few too many bugs. In 2006, we can't help but shudder at what we see on the monitor: although the game ran on a computer with more than double the recommended requirements (1.5 GHz processor, 512 MB RAM and 64 MB video memory), Lula , despite its provocative and sensual forms, is among the ugliest things seen on PC in recent years. In addition to a resolution that does not go beyond 1280x1080 pixels, in addition to the very few polygons on the screen with which the characters were created (with the sexy protagonists practically ALL THE SAME), the objects and settings of the game, in addition to the incredible pop-up continuous that will peep out in each level, in addition to some sudden blocks of the game, in addition to the minimal animations also of the protagonist herself, in addition to all this the graphics engine is full of bugs with interpenetration of polygons at full speed. A sexy digital girl as busty and exciting as Lula deserved a different guise... At least the sound is acceptable with ~light~ background jingles and the dialogues interpreted in a sufficiently sparkling way. [CC]Lula, despite her provocative and sensual forms, is among the ugliest things seen in recent years on PC[/CC] Final comment The return of Lula, the hard sexy video game queen par excellence, could not have happened in a worse way. There is only the embarrassment of choice in listing the defects of a title that does not do justicea of a now historic character (his first appearance on PC took place in the distant 1999) and who deserved a much different realization. We are facing a point and click-like adventure with little bite, with a level of difficulty that fluctuates from too simple to absurd, with an embarrassing and buggy graphics engine. And for those who hope at least in ~value~ hard content, expectations will not be met even in this case. If you really love Lula madly, the very low price with which it was decided to market it in Italy could be a minimum incentive to buy, otherwise keep well away from a title unable to meet the minimum requirements to judge it at least acceptable. Pros Lula is the hardcore icon of the gaming universe Budget price (19.90) Accompanying jingles and interpretation of acceptable dialogues Cons Very poor graphic design with continuous and obvious bugs Puzzles too simple or absolutely incomprehensible Even the ~hard~ part is decidedly lacking Although there are many much more famous videogame protagonists (starting with Lara Croft), Lula can be considered the videogame icon of the most ~hard~ and ~sexy~ titles. After the irrepressible blonde had presented herself to gamers from all over the world as the star of The Sexy Empire, a pleasant management game in which we had to create a three-X empire, starting with the marketing of hard home movies, Lula has peeped out again on PC with other titles such as Wet Attack and various spin-offs in which the busty digital babe took on the role of a red-light Tamagotchi and those of a pinball machine testimonial.
