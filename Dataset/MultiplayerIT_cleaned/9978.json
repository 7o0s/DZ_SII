{"name": "Pikmin Bloom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pikmin-bloom-recensione.html", "text": "Before tackling the Pikmin Bloom review, a necessary premise must be made: this Niantic title cannot be treated as a real video game, because it is something different: a fitness app or more simply a particularly rich pedometer and well characterized are perhaps more fitting classifications for this strange product, which in any case manages to remain faithful to the spirit of the original Nintendo series and to present some truly playful characteristics. The idea is very interesting: it is a question of recovering once again the technological base exploited by the development team in its previous games (Pokmon GO and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite to name two) and applying it to the Pikmin, with a truly very cunning and fit. The little creatures in question can count on a remarkable charisma and have an appreciated series behind them, representing ideal subjects for a title focused on augmented reality and the direct relationship with the player. Pikmin Bloom takes what was considered a side effect to the extreme consequences positive of Pokmon GO, or the fact of pushing the player to leave the house and walk, which here becomes a fundamental and unique element of the ~game~. All the activities foreseen in this case are simply ancillary to the fact of walking: the goal is to take steps, therefore it is not so much a question of going around looking for something and, consequently, moving and exercising, here is the cause-effect relationship it is reversed, so to speak. It follows that Pikmin Bloom is not really a game but a real app that can fall within the sphere of fitness or well-being in general, but certainly with a certain playful and social meaning. In the intentions of John Hanke, CEO of Niantic, the aim of the game is to get people out of the house and make every walk a sort of adventure, stimulating exploration, physical activity and interpersonal connection, with some vague environmental references in the ability to plant flowers to customize the map. Gameplay: walking and gardening Pikmin Bloom: main screen, an AR photo and the inside of the planter backpack After having customized our avatar according to the classic Nintendo Mii system, we are immediately ready to go: the aim of the game is to make the seedlings germinate which the protagonist carries inside a special ~backpack-planter~ simply by walking. Each seedling requires a certain amount of steps, which are detected by connecting the game to the iOS Health app or Google Fit on Android, in order to hatch and give birth to a pikmin, which can be of various types depending on the planted seed (red, yellow, blue or even rarer types). Once the pikmin team has been built, they accompany us during the walks finding fruits and further seeds around the maps: the fruits can be transformed into nectar, which can be thrown at the little creatures to make the flower they have on their heads blossom and allow us to collect various flower seeds, with different colors depending on the type of nectar. From the flowers we can draw the petals, which can in turn be sown as we walk, in order to cover various parts of the map with colored vegetation. This is basically the basic gameplay loop, to which some interesting elements are added. Planting flowers has the double purpose of accelerating the growth of the seedlings in the planter backpack and also of the mega-plants that can be found around the the map, until they hatch. Pikmin follow us wherever we go The latter represent a bit the equivalent of the PokStop in Pokmon GO, functioning in a similar way: they are arranged on the map in correspondence with real points of interest and guarantee an extra distribution of fruits and seeds to obtain new pikmin. Planting flowers is a cooperative action: anyone can see the flowers planted by others on the map and, by working together, it is possible to increase the amount of flowers in some specific points, accelerating the flowering of even mega-plants, which otherwise take some of work to start the business (about 300 flowers to be placed nearby, or a lot of steps to take in the same area). Collect them all Pikmin Bloom: the nectar to throw at the creatures, the customizations and the sowing of the flowers By discovering new areas on the map, it is also possible to send teams of Pikmin towards some specific objectives which include the collection of fruits or plants or the removal of gigantic mushrooms, which often require cooperative action given their size. It is probable that further missions may be envisagedrite later, but they should not deviate too much from the mechanisms currently present. As it is easy to see there is no element of challenge or competition, nor of course a story or a real sense of actual progression beyond the collection of badges and medals, because collecting Pikmin clearly does not have the same implications as it can have the building of a team of Pokmon, resulting above all in a collection of aesthetic and sentimental value. Micro-transactions also insist on this element, which are present, but not at all invasive, favoring the purchase of power-ups and customizations that do not modify the actual gaming experience. Leveraging on these aspects, going forward is It is possible to unlock some customizations for the rarest creatures or types, all elements that come in handy for taking pictures of your team and in this way take advantage of the inevitable AR technology that makes the Pikmin run around in reality. The Nintendo creatures are certainly charismatic and it is impossible not to make yourself smile when you see them walking busily around their Mii, proudly showing off the fruits collected around or running in a group emitting verses to pace the comminate when they are sent on a mission. From this point of view, the idea of exploiting them for an app of this kind was truly brilliant, even if it can easily fuel the wait for a Pikmin 4, now widely believed to be missing. On the other hand, a return of the brand in the spotlight with this operation could also have positive influences, paving the way for a real new chapter.", "date": "2021-11-10", "grade": "6.8"}
