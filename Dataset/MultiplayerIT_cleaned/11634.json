It's not a matter of fun as an end in itself, but of the enthusiasm that is transmitted to you by what you see on the screen and which makes the experience you are living worthy of being considered as such. Psychonauts 2 review will explain why Tim Schafer's work is one of these special games. In the mind of Tim Schafer Raz is back We are in one of the advanced levels of the game and for the umpteenth time Double Fine makes us withdraw from the belief that we have now seen everything there was to see, leaving us amazed. We entered the mind of one of the main characters to carry out a mission and we found ourselves in a very strange situation: we have to prepare courses within a time limit to please three goat judges, who are nothing more than giant puppets. Inside a kind of reality show led by a fourth puppet, in which the audience is made up of the ingredients we have to cook, delighted to get killed for the cause. All around there are gigantic kitchen tools with which we have to prepare the ingredients, slicing them, boiling them, blending them or cooking them in a pan. When they are ready, we have to take them and serve them in front of the judgments. By managing to do what is required within a time limit, we will receive a prize, otherwise we will simply continue in the mission. The size of the area is limited, but what happens is truly incredible: some of the obstacles we encountered in previous levels have turned into aids that allow you to move more quickly between one piece of equipment and another. There are no enemies, apart from in the moments of the ~sponsor~ (after all we are on television), but an intensive use of the powers is still required to do as soon as possible. In theory we can exploit them all, but it is up to us to decide which ones to favor and which ones not, based on our attitudes and the movement strategies that we consider most effective. Some levels of Psychonauts 2 are completely insane Psychonauts 2 is a continuous manipulation of its game system to generate new and incredible situations. There isn't a single level where something different doesn't happen to the previous ones and that doesn't have its own unique idea around which everything else is built. After all we are inside human minds, each with its past, its memories and its traumas, so each one can be represented in a peculiar way. The powers of Raz There are many enemies in the game Psychonauts 2 starts exactly where Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin ended, which itself started from the end of Psychonauts (the events that took place in the two previous chapters are told by a long introduction, for more details, read our recent dedicated special): Raz managed to free Truman Zanotto, the head of the Psychonauts, from the clutches of the wacky doctor Loboto and is taking him back to the headquarters of the agency to cure him. The first mission of the new chapter, which also serves as a tutorial, is just a journey into Loboto's mind to try to find out who was maneuvering him. The boy, back from two successful missions, already has some psychic powers: he can bring powerful melee attacks by channeling psychic energy; can use pyrokinesis to burn objects and enemies; can pick up and throw objects from a distance with telekinesis; he can float in the air creating a psychic balloon with levitation (which he can also use to run faster) and he can shoot real psychic projectiles, with which to destroy enemies and objects, with the psychoburst. Continuing in the game he will acquire four other powers: foresight, with which he will be able to look at the world with the eyes of the other characters, thus discovering some secrets; the mental connection, with which he will be able to use floating and forgotten thoughts as means of transport by creating connections; the time bubble, with which he will be able to slow down the movement of objects and living beings, and the projection, with which he will be able to create his own two-dimensional avatar to be used to reach otherwise inaccessible places and to be used in combat to distract enemies. All powers can be improved by spending the intern credits, which Raz earns by rising in rank among the Psychonauts, or by buying pins (a maximum of three can be worn, so you have to choose carefully which ones to use from time to time). It should be noted that the levels are built around the powers, which usually more or less all have to be used to be able to move forward and, above all, tofind the numerous objects hidden in the various areas (such as half-brains which, when paired, increase our energy bar, or memories which raise Raz in rank). Game structure Sometimes you have to set things on fire to find out what's behind it Once the first mission is over, Raz will be introduced to the headquarters of the Psychonauts, of which he will have to visit all the environments. Here he will be able to talk to the other main characters, some already seen in the previous chapters, such as Norman, Lili or Oleander, and others completely new, such as Ellis, the deputy head of the Psychonauts, a group of interns like him and other adult Psychonauts; and will be able to hunt for collectibles: psychic cards, to be used to obtain intern points, psychic stones (the game currency), special keys to open hidden chests and various objects related to the side missions that are assigned to us by the other characters . The latter are completely optional and are designed to let us explore the game world far and wide, so as to discover even the most hidden ravines. Let's say that they are designed above all for completionists, that is, those who want to make the perfect game and unlock all the objectives. Over time we will discover that the agency's base is only the first of four large areas that can be freely explored in reality, each with its own precise function and its own visual style: in addition to the base there are: a large quarry, where the Psychonauts base is located and where other agency structures are housed; the so-called Questionable Forest, a wooded area equipped for campers where Raz's family will take up residence (who has decided to visit him, creating unexpected implications) and a fourth area that we do not mention because explaining it would force us to give a big preview of the plot. Be that as it may, before the game world is unlocked, at least two more missions must be carried out, so there is time to understand all the mechanics and acclimatize with the story, which essentially tells of the return of a terrible threat, already eradicated years first, which will involve the very past of the agency and its founders. Storytelling and level design Psychonauts 2 introduces many new characters One of the strengths of Psychonauts 2 is its narrative side (as indeed it was in the first chapter). It's not just the story itself that is beautiful, which offers interesting twists and is told with great taste, but the way it is integrated into the game world and how it has been used to make sense of the various levels: there is not a single moment that is not narratively justified. Nothing is an end in itself and everything takes on meaning from the circumstances that produced it. Thus the psychic world of a split personality person will be controlled by the stronger personality who wants to dominate all others by removing or imprisoning them; or a man full of regrets will live in a world made up of unreachable islands, eternally grappling with pots that bear no fruit. However it may be, what is determined from the narrative side is not only the appearance of the psychic worlds, but also their characteristics, which as we have mentioned are always different. For example, to reconstruct the personality of a brain that has remained inactive for too many years, we will have to find the members of a band with which to organize a show, or to restore confidence in another person we will have to make him win a cooking competition (the level we described above). One of Raz's powers allows him to create a two-dimensional double of his own The result is a truly incredible series of levels, created with great freedom and creativity, where you always do different things. We honestly struggle to remember a single moment of the game in which we felt tired, such is the variety of situations in which we run into in each mission and there are many gimmicks used by Double Fine to involve us, making us part of the psyche of the characters visited, towards which it becomes impossible not to feel a certain empathy. The impression is never that of being (alone) in a simple 3D platformer, but of really visiting human minds transfigured into a video game, with all their fears and idiosyncrasies. From this derives the ability of Psychonauts 2, which if you like is also the signature of Tim Schafer, to address complex themes by carrying them out with great delicacy and sensitivity, integrating them perfectly into the gameplay, such as when to fix a thorny situation that has arisen because of us, we have to reconstruct a person's thoughts by dragging him out of his latent addiction, or when we have to restore sanity to one of the main characters, going to dig into his historyia so he can remove the shards of madness that block his memories. Be careful though, because the game has no clinical ambitions. We are not dealing with a Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, just to make us understand, but a freer and more creative, almost expressionist representation of the human mind, in which psychoanalysis mixes with art. Combat system People's psyches can reserve some strange surprises The combat system is the weakest side of Psychonauts 2. It's not bad, but it's quite incomplete and, in some ways, insignificant. In the meantime, it must be said that fighting is a present but secondary activity in the game, in which the plaform side prevails. The enemies are all psychic creatures that represent the difficulties that the human mind must face to find its serenity. We have, for example, the censors, employees armed with stamps who want to block the emergence of certain thoughts, or the judges, hammer-wielding beasts who can't wait to issue their sentences by hitting us with a club or throwing books at us. There are also panic attacks, very fast and ethereal creatures that are very difficult to hit, or the supporters, of creatures dressed as majorettes that make the others immortal. In reality, the sample is much wider than that, since new creatures are added in practically every psychic level, but the examples given should be enough for you to understand the nature of the enemies. But here comes the critical points. Theoretically each of them must be faced using a different psychic power. For example, censors can be stunned by throwing objects at them with telekinesis, while panic attacks must be slowed down with time manipulation. A particularly tough foe Unfortunately, when there are too many creatures on the screen, of too many different types, it becomes almost impossible not to let yourself go into the frenzy, attacking a little in bulk, because you don't have time to develop a more refined strategy. Fortunately, the clashes are not very difficult, so you can get out of them even without applying yourself too much. In any case, something more could have been done to make them less confusing and give more weight to the excellent characterization work, however present. It's much better with the bosses: they are not very difficult to beat, they are still very big, spectacular and offer unique challenges, requiring the player to apply ever-changing tactics to survive. The wonder How about a trip to the casino? Psychonauts 2 has something wonderful and almost touching in filling your eyes and mind with ever-changing situations, offering levels full of incredible visual and gameplay gimmicks, different from the beginning to the end of the adventure. Of course, the basis is always that of a 3D platform game, but with so much art and love for the genre that it manages to enchant on several occasions, projecting into a kind of spontaneous trance in which you can't do anything else than admiring the genius of what you have in front of you, with a rare transport and participation these days. It's not a technical question, because graphically, despite being well done, it's not incredible (if we start measuring the pixels with the scale, of course). For example, if we evaluate it only from the point of view of crude graphics, a title like Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is certainly ahead of it, but if we also consider all the other aspects, such as the composition of dream worlds, i.e. the vision that manage to convey, their labyrinthine and imaginative level design, even if always very rigorous, the multitude of situations for which the graphics engine is used and the style and intrinsic charm of what is represented, then there is none for anyone and Psychonauts 2 is clearly at the top of the genre. Some places hide great secrets Schafer and his team have demonstrated an awareness and expressive sensitivity that is difficult to find in modern triple A, a value that is often snubbed (often also by critics, unfortunately), almost as if it were a function like any other, but which can give that something extra making special and, above all, significant, the gaming experience, as actually happens in this case. For this reason we can only recommend it to you without any reservations, especially if you loved the first chapter. Here you will find the same beauty and the same depth, even in a wider game context. As a final note we point out that it took us about 20 hours to finish it, despite not having found all the objects. In any case, once concluded, the game allows you to freely explore the maps to hunt for what we are missing and to replay the missions, moreover", "date": "2021-08-23", "grade": "9.2"}
