In previous versions the difficulty was much higher and there were widespread imbalances in the growth of statistics, but over time the developers listened to the fans and fixed most of the reported problems, adding a third level of difficulty to the two already available and simplifying the intermediate one. We report this because someone might remember the defects of the first versions that no longer exist. The tragedy of Amarantha and Aaron Amarantha, who despite the name is not an employee of the magical world of porn, is in love and reciprocated by Aaron, who despite the name is a normal boy. Unfortunately the two had the misfortune of being chosen as the protagonists of a Japanese visual novel, and therefore at the beginning of the game the two, after some effusion made of sweet eyes, bright smiles and lips that touch each other bathed in the warm light of the sunset , end up involved in a car accident aboard Aaron's moped, which moved thanks to the honey dripping from the bodies of the two. Waking up in the hospital, Aaron no longer remembers anything of his past and Amarantha, who remained practically unharmed, falls prey to the deepest despair, which leads her to flirt with other beautiful boys in an attempt to finally give her to someone (note that in the simulators of dating Japanese guys are always very difficult to conquer). This, in short, is the plot of Always Remember Me, which as you will have understood from the pregnant text you have just read is a dating simulator in which you have to conquer one of Amarantha's dream boys, amicably called Amy. To do it you will have to sweat seven lace panties. You are ready? How many guys can a girl fall in love with at the same time? Let's find out with Always Remember Me. Visual simulator or dating novel? What is the difference between a dating simulator and a visual novel? Let's say in short that the latter favor the narration above all, sacrificing the interaction, often reduced to choices on how to make the plot proceed, while the former require a greater presence of the player, who must be able to lead the gameplay in order to obtain certain goals (usually the conquest of a partner). Moreover, while visual novels can deal with very different themes, dating simulators are all (or almost) romantic / erotic. Genres are often confused due to the presence in both of large amounts of text and very similar setting of dialogues and descriptions. Dilemmas and broken hearts The dilemma that the protagonist will face right away is one of those that fill the school diaries of romantic girls: wait for the man we love to get better or go ahead and start a new life? In Always Remember Me the final decision is in the hands of the player, who through his actions must direct Amy's feelings. The entire adventure will take place over a period of three months in which, wandering around the city, Amy will be able to carry out various activities that will affect her characteristics, visible on the left side of the interface: Culture, Creativity, Romance, Discipline, as well as to morale and energy that are apart. Actions that can be performed anywhere appear in this form. Each feature is linked to one of the four boys that we can conquer: the aforementioned Aaron; Eddy, Aaron's doctor; Lawrence, a colleague of Amy's; and Hugh, an old fashion designer friend of his. Each love story can have two conclusions: the normal one, which is obtained by increasing the characteristic connected to a given character more than the others, while simultaneously keeping morale above 50 and energy above 30; and the perfect one, which is obtained by bringing the same characteristic to the maximum possible score. Let's say that the four regular endings are very simple to reach at the Easy and Normal level, while the perfect endings are another matter and in our opinion they introduce one of the major defects of the gameplay, especially if you play at the Hard level. In fact, to get points you have to guess the right action to perform every time (often you guess, but often not). When you don't necessarily need to accumulate the maximum score, some errors are tolerated, but otherwise you end up saving before each choice to reload in case of an error. Honestly it's not very fun, but as we specified in a box, the situation has been much improved for the first two difficulty levels, which are not prohibitive at all. Do we read or do we love? The gameplay of Always Remember Me is very simple to explain. In fact, a lot of time is spent reading texts, for por having to select one of the executable actions, different for each place, from a graphic menu, evidently designed for touch systems, but usable also with our beloved mouse. You're the love of my life...well the doctor is cool too...but the fashion designer...hmm Each action raises one or more stats. Some also have a certain margin of failure related to Amarantha's morale and energy values. If at the end of the three months none of the four volumes on the special offer has been picked up, the ninth final will start, the one for lonely hearts. Don't worry, we are not anticipating anything, since this information will be given to you by the tutorial in the very first game. From a technical point of view, Always Remember Me has its ups and downs. Some drawings are very beautiful, while others are dumbfounded by some basic mistakes. Let's say that fans of the genre will not mind, but also that we have seen much better. Of note is the background song that accompanies throughout the game. Pretty, but annoying in the long run. Fortunately it can be turned off.", "date": "2014-05-09", "grade": "8.0"}
