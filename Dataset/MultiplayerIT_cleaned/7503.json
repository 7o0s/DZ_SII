{"name": "Alieni contro alieni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125337-xcom-enemy-within-alieni-contro-alieni.html", "text": "A year ago we reviewed XCOM: Enemy Unknown with some enthusiasm, sensing the breath of fresh air that Firaxis Games was bringing back to the world of video games and, above all, real-time strategy games. We had exalted its ability to re-propose deep and articulated gameplay on the mass market, without renouncing the dynamism and greater spectacularity gained with technological development (although from the point of view of pure strategy the original XCOMs remain on another planet). And the alien became a memory... Over the months, the game has been enriched with patches and some minor DLC, until the release today of Enemy Within, a major expansion so large that it was not possible to launch it separately for consoles, but required a stand edition halo containing also the original title (the PC version, on the other hand, is sold as normal DLC). Story-wise, XCOM: Enemy Within has remained largely unchanged from the original title. An unknown alien race has begun attacking our planet for no apparent reason. What do they want from us? Natural resources? Our technologies? Our sense of humor? Sasha Grey? We will find out only by playing. What is certain is that they do not have peaceful intentions, given that they kidnap and kill human beings and destroy entire cities as if they were made of papier-mch, particularly affecting homes where they find Justin Bieber CDs (so we like them a bit... hearing it they must have thought that a race capable of producing such stuff did not deserve to survive). Unfortunately, the regular armies can do nothing against them because they are equipped with completely inadequate weapons. So the only way to stop them is to apologize and sacrifice the warbling kid with the unlikely hairdo? Not that we would mind, but sadly that's not enough. Instead, we need to bring in a supranational military group equipped with all the most advanced technologies on the planet, also capable of studying and using alien technologies: the XCOM team. The world is not enough As you will have understood by reading the previous paragraph, from the point of view of the plot there are no differences from the original version. It is only by examining the individual innovations that one realizes the work done by Firaxis Games to refine the game in all its aspects (also introducing some imbalances which we will discuss later). This new enemy is impressive and can cause panic in his first appearances One of the first novelties that stand out in the eyes is the greater variety of scenarios. Let's face it, the original XCOM was a bit lacking in this regard. Not that there were no maps, they were just very repetitive. We paid little attention to it because of the context and because, after all, in turn-based strategy the purely technological aspects often take a back seat, but it's nice to see that new settings have now been added that blend perfectly with the old ones, like alien spaceships, highways full of car wrecks, new urban landscapes, ports teeming with unhealthy creatures or Exalts, and so on. The unpublished battlefields are a total of forty. Obviously many of these are linked to the new major goals to be achieved, which we will introduce gradually in the article. In the meantime, know that in terms of interface and game structure, little has changed compared to the past; XCOM: Enemy Within is always divided into two main phases, namely research and planning, which takes place in the XCOM base (identical to that of Enemy Unknown except for the new functions), and the operational one, identical in the interface, but enriched from some extra element that we will immediately talk about. The Fusion In the very first mission of Enemy Within, a new resource called Fusion is introduced. It is an alien energy source that will be used to make two new infrastructures of the strategic base work: the genetic laboratory, managed by the researchers, and the cybernetic laboratory, managed by the engineers. Genetic implants improve the performance of soldiers Fusion is not a resource like the others, that is, it is not obtained randomly or by selling objects recovered on the battlefield, but must literally be collected while fighting. In some missions, in fact, containers of this new energy will appear (always two) which must be approached and clicked to assimilate. If you fail to reach them within a certain number of turns, or if you destroy them by shooting at them, the Fusion will be irretrievably lost. At the beginning of the map, the indicators of the fusion containers, located in the upper right, are gray. For deedsTo value them and be shown how many useful rounds there are still for harvesting, you must first find their location on the map. Another effective way to get fusion is to clear a level of aliens before the harvest rounds are up. Be aware, however, that it will be difficult to collect both containers before being able to completely clean them, because usually one runs out faster than the other. So it is better to collect at least the first one by hand. Brought back to the base, the Fusion will first have to be studied, then it will be able to bear all its fruits. Even in XCOM: Enemy Within the aliens seem unstoppable. But we are good and beautiful! MEC soldiers and genetic modifications The fruits of the Fusion are nothing more than two new types of units: the genetically modified soldiers, which are created by the genetic laboratory, and the MEC soldiers, the result of the cybernetic laboratory. The former are nothing more than normal soldiers who are equipped with genetic grafts capable of enhancing them in various aspects. For example, it is possible to give soldiers enormously more powerful reflexes than normal ones, which improve their movements, or the ability to regenerate some life points between turns. There is no shortage of grafts to improve their aim and others to protect them from brain attacks. It looks chunky, but it will go down like the others In general, genetically engineered soldiers keep the same class as the starting soldier and use the same equipment. MEC soldiers, on the other hand, are another story altogether. When an XCOM is transformed into an MEC, their body changes dramatically, becoming half man, half machine. The soldier completely loses his starting class and obtains the MEC one, equipped with specific skills such as, for example, the automatic repair of two hit points per turn, for a maximum of six, that of absorbing excess damage or reducing damage in general, or the ability to completely destroy cover within a given radius, with a targeted shot. The MEC soldier's equipment is also very different from that of other soldiers. Meanwhile, he cannot carry other objects with him except his own weapon. Don't worry, driving an MEC you won't feel the need for grenades, protective vests, scopes and the like. When wielding a rail cannon and wearing full armor (which must be built separately), even the most menacing alien becomes less horrific. It is above all the armor, with its grafts, that characterizes the MEC soldier, in the meantime giving him a massive appearance on a par with that of the new mechanized aliens, furthermore providing him with a series of exclusive abilities such as the ability to become a real complete walking cover . Weapons such as the flamethrower or the portable grenade launcher are worth the price of admission, given the amount of damage they can deal (to enemies and to the scenario). Exalts and other new enemies In front of the new troops, new enemies could not be missing. There are both aliens and humans. As happens with any self-respecting alien attack, a group of human beings, who in this case took the name of Exalt, decided that the nice ETs are right and that it is right that they conquer and exterminate us. So instead of helping members of the human race to save themselves, they use their forces to help extraterrestrials. Much sympathy is manifested in the game with a new series of quests and missions. One of the objectives of XCOM will in fact be to track down the base of the Exalt to put an end to their useless existence. Exalts will get more and more annoying. At least until they are exterminated To do this, it will be necessary to collect information in specific missions, where it will be necessary to face human troops. Generally, Exalt missions all start in the same way: once an enemy cell has been identified, an agent must be sent on a secret mission to bring it out into the open, and then recover it after guaranteeing it protection during the collection of information. In some missions it will be necessary to protect areas from the attack of the Exalts who want to violate them to stop data transmissions. Exalts are normal human beings equipped with weapons similar to those available to XCOM. Later in the game, their members on the field will receive augmenting genetic implants and will be equipped with advanced weaponry. At the end of each mission their weapons will be collected and can be used by XCOM or sold. During the plot, the Exalts will be the excuse for one of the longest and most difficult missions of the entire game, namely the alien assault on the XCOM base which will force you to resist several alien waves with very limited resources. Exalt aside, which are still the biggest newsfrom the point of view of the enemies, Enemy Within also introduces new alien races, such as the resistant biomechanical combat units, usually accompanied by two drones, and the strange octopuses whose basic attack tactic is to become invisible to get over the soldiers and suck his brain, which have the practical result of forcing the whole team to be more cautious, avoiding solitary actions. Unstable balances Once all the new features have been illustrated, it remains to be seen whether they are worth the price of the ticket. Probably many of you are asking yourself the classic questions that crowd your mind in these situations. Is the price, actually high, worth the ride? How much does the novelty actually add to the game? Well, as a general consideration we can tell you that, at the very least, they will make you replay the whole campaign with gusto, even if you have just finished the one of the base title. MEC in action Let's say that if the XCOM: Enemy Unknown campaign was finished in about twenty hours, now it will take more than thirty to get to the end (also thanks to the integration of the other DLCs). Unfortunately, however, some problems emerged during the test phase that must be considered. The most blatant is that Enemy Within is easier than Enemy Unknown. Although Firaxis Games has introduced new enemies to balance the introduction of the powerful genetically modified soldiers and the even more powerful MEC soldiers, the challenge level is lower than in the past. When you have a party with two MEC soldiers and four full-featured genetic soldiers, on Normal difficulty you are practically unstoppable, unless you do colossal stupid things. Things get better by increasing the difficulty but it is clear that the risk of being blown away has decreased enormously. For this we advise you, in case you already have experience with Enemy Unknown, to start immediately from the last two difficulty levels, so as not to soften the challenge too much. Another problem, this one of a structural nature, concerns the breadth of the novelties in the long run. There are more than forty new battlefields It is true: they are many and articulated. But it is equally true that sometimes they clash with the basic contents and that, especially in the old missions, the changes are irrelevant if not even, in some cases, harmful. The introduction of so much content has delayed the appearance of some fixed missions, making them a de facto annoyance. For example some rescue missions, with only Slim aliens as enemies, can now appear towards the end of the game (in our case after destroying the Exalts), when the team is so empowered that they are a nuisance species to overcome that does not require any strategy, since the enemies do not have firepower capable of worrying us. Others, such as the final mission for example, have become much simpler because they have not been revised by virtue of the new features introduced. In short, towards the second half of the campaign we begin to feel a big disconnect between the new and old contents, a disconnect that makes us clearly perceive an integration that is at least problematic. In short, Enemy Within seems to give its best in the first few hours, while it loses a bit in the last ones, when some knots inexorably come to a head.", "date": "2013-11-11", "grade": "8.0"}
