{"name": "Gloomhaven", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gloomhaven-recensione.html", "text": "In the world of board games, Gloomhaven is a product that has always been talked about since its sensational Kickstarter. Isaac Childres' monumental game redefined a genre - that of dungeon crawlers - which has always been a favorite of players, but which hasn't actually seen major innovations for many years. The digital edition, developed by Flaming Fowl Studios and published by Asmodee Digital, was actually already available on Steam in early access, but the version we're going to review has finally implemented the strong point of the game - the campaign - and we can tell you that it did it with great care. Find out with us if this transposition is worth your time in our Gloomhaven review. What is Gloomhaven Gloomhaven features a beautiful campaign filled with strategy and combat For the review of the digital version of Gloomhaven it is inevitable to talk about the original board game. It is essentially a dungeon crawler - like the classic Hero Quests or the more recent Descent titles - in which a group of adventurers, from 1 to 4, face scenarios full of monsters, traps, objectives to reach and treasures to find. The great innovations brought about by this title at the time were mainly three, two of which were techniques: the elimination of any type of dice roll and the use of cards to manage the share pool. Movements, attacks, spells, abilities are therefore relegated to cards which, at each turn, must be played in pairs, often consumed for the rest of the scenario and therefore to be used wisely. The management of their deck, the movement and attacks of the opponents are instead structured to be completely managed by a sort of algorithm/artificial intelligence on paper, operable by the player himself according to well-defined rules. The third novelty, at the basis of Gloomhaven's success , is the Legacy element, i.e. the continuity of the campaign: tabletop players do not face unrelated scenarios, but a huge campaign that will see the evolution of a story with possible forks. The base game has 90 scenarios, but don't be frightened: thanks to a system of choice in the missions, around 70 will be faced in a campaign. The lot ends with the evolution of the playable characters who, like in a video game, will be unlocked by users based on a series of objectives and a whole series of characteristics that brings the gaming experience closer to that of a real role-playing game. Digital adaptation Don't be fooled: Gloomhaven is a very hardcore title, which will take a lot of effort to complete Until now, Gloomhaven was already available on PC, but with a limited number of scenarios and above all without the real strength, the campaign. Instead, during Early Access it was possible to try a sort of roguelike mode, called Guildmaster, with a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty. In this digital adaptation, the campaign that we tried instead left us impressed: the board game experience has been reported in all its facets and details, from the evolution and choice of characters to the various events in the city and on the road, who also enjoy a good quality English dub. Asmodee has packaged an excellent digital adaptation: the atmosphere that reigns between the music, the artistic direction of the scenarios and the general tone is an addition that, almost paradoxically, makes the digital version the most complete way to enjoy the work to the fullest of Childrens. Although the environments are not the most original, they draw heavily on the stereotypes of the fantasy genre and the rendering is certainly valuable: having elements on the screen, immersed in a three-dimensional frame, contributes considerably to the sense of involvement of the players, otherwise entrusted to their imagination. The digital version greatly speeds up a series of mechanical steps typical of the table counterpart: setup, management of the various decks, movement of enemies, keeping track of the many resources that are unlocked during the adventure. On average, a board game session lasts about 2 to 3 hours, while in digital it is often possible to play at least two scenarios at the same time. In general, we can say that having brought some elements into digital make the experience of campaign capable of increasing that sense of more practical engagement: seeing the branched missions on the map and finding yourself automated some mechanisms of evolution of the city - Gloomhaven precisely, hence the name of the game itself - certainly makes the total experience much more fluid, eliminating some chores arising from the physical management of the whole and shifting the focus of the Thurser about enjoying his adventure. Excellent transposition Despite being a transposition of a board game, Gloomhaven doesn't look bad technically The game is obviously aimed both at players of the original game, who will enjoy a very clear interface and will quickly find themselves comfortable fighting demons and ooze, but also at those who for various reasons have never approached the original board game. The transposition from this point of view is excellent, since for them there is a rather simple in-game tutorial, but be careful: especially in the first scenarios, Gloomhaven is a title that requires very careful planning and is sometimes more like a puzzle game for the precision and efficiency required by some scenarios. However, the magical algorithm created by Childres will soon become a real addiction for fans of the genre, so much so that you will very often find yourself playing last card or turn scenarios with immense satisfaction in case of victory. There is a sour note , unfortunately not trivial for those coming from an ongoing session: there is no way to recreate the game with friends and carry it forward digitally. However, the game has native support for mods - absolutely commendable and which will allow you to play scenarios and with characters edited by the community - but we thought it was a detail that could be improved, given the full support for online multiplayer, which still requires a copy per player .Gloomhaven is obviously not the first game to be transposed into digital, with Asmodee Digital which is bringing many titles, also published by competitors, in a virtual version. We are facing an excellent transposition: the production behind the Gloomhaven game is probably the most accurate in terms of art, production and usability compared to others available on the market, often cumbersome or in any case with insufficient care to place the video game step up from the table equivalent.", "date": "2021-11-01", "grade": "8.0"}
