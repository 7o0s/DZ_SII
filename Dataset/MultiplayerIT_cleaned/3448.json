{"name": "Ghost Recon Breakpoint per PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-recon-breakpoint-pc-recensione.html", "text": "A few days after the Ghost Recon Breakpoint review, here we are also analyzing the PC version of the game, which for obvious reasons stands as a point of reference in terms of the technical sector. In fact, where you have high-end components, the latest episode of the Ubisoft series is ready to offer you substantially more detailed graphics than seen on consoles, enriched by valuable high-definition effects and textures, as well as support for FidelityFX technology both on NVIDIA and AMD cards. That's not all: the possibility of reaching 60 frames per second, combined with better controller management, makes the PC game gunplay visibly better than the PS4 counterpart, more precise and responsive, increasing not just the enjoyment of the firefights and the experience in general. To this speech of speeding up is also added the interface, which on the Sony platform appeared rather slow and which here instead scrolls very quickly between the various menus. Gameplay and structure As written in the Ghost Recon Breakpoint review on consoles, we are faced with a production that starts from the experience gained with the rich open world of Wildlands to introduce some new mechanics, in this case the elimination of companions controlled by artificial intelligence, the inclusion of a bland survival approach, as well as RPG and looter shooter elements related to physical resistance and equipment management, which is released in abundance on the map with increasingly high-quality weapons and items, upgradeable and customizable using materials and accessories. For this new test of the game we have created a female character, encountering a really funny situation: the available hairstyles are shared between males and females, and unfortunately offer very few variations, greatly limiting our creativity in front of the editor that can be used to change the appearance of the protagonist. Moreover, Nomad's height remains the same regardless of gender, and this stands out a lot during the cutscenes: what do they feed these girls? Compared to the male version, however, we found the interpretation of the dialogues better, more intense and less flat, while remaining within the scope of Italian dubbing. Already knowing the mechanics and philosophy of the game, we managed to complete the initial missions of the campaign rather quickly, immediately realizing how the controls on PC actually work better, both using the combination of mouse and keyboard and an Xbox controller one. Setting the graphics to 30 frames per second reduces the benefits, but overall it seems to be a given that on PlayStation 4 there are some problems with the inertia, acceleration and analog stick dead zone at the default values, and we hope that the developers Maybe they can fix that with an update. Beyond these differences, the basic problem of Ghost Recon Breakpoint remains: the innovations we have mentioned above are sketchy and unconvinced, so much so that it is possible to tackle the missions without giving them much weight. At this juncture there is unfortunately another major flaw of the experience, namely the repetitiveness of the assignments, which will see us practically always engaged in identifying a target which, however, is in a different place than where we are looking for it: the same pattern is repeated over and over again, highlighting a certain lack of ideas on the part of the development team. The work done regarding the growth of the character appears much better, with many unlockable skills and four classes, each with peculiar characteristics and abilities. On the other hand, the whole looter shooter discourse is less convincing, in the sense that it takes a lot of time and energy to look for objects that in fact do not produce substantial advantages during the fights, except when you are now close to the endgame phase. The enemies boast average behavioral routines of the genre: as long as you proceed with silent eliminations they are very little smart, but once the alarm goes off they lurk, open fire inflicting huge damage on us, change position, send drones to flush us out and, in general, they know how to get us into trouble. Depending on the selected challenge level, you can choose between various more strategy-oriented or action-oriented approaches, possibly resorting to special weapons such as the synchronized shooting drone (which can silently eliminate a small number of enemies), the rocket launcher and various types of grenades and explosives, the latter very useful in situations where there is only one path that the avversari will have to follow to pick us up. You can complete the campaign solo, if you want, or take advantage of online co-op to have human companions with whom to share your successes. Organizing with friends is the best thing, but the system allows you to select other users based on general objectives (main missions, faction missions, exploration or role-playing) and then propose specific quests to complete together with them. to PvE there are also two four-versus-four PvP modes that alternate between the classic team deathmatch and a territorial stipulation in which one must take turns placing an explosive and trying to defuse it. Since the progression is shared, online multiplayer stands as an interesting resource to easily unlock skill points and improve the character also from a single player perspective. The PC version Ghost Recon Breakpoint finds its ideal technical dimension on PC, offering several improvements compared to the PlayStation 4 Pro version that we have tested for most of the time. Net of the same, abundant glitches that involve the graphic and physical aspects of the game, and which in certain cases also extend to the controls (see the inversion of the Y axis, which cannot be used for the drone and which works badly with aircraft), the adjustments available to users are numerous and actually allow you to scale the experience based on the hardware. In addition to resolution, vertical synchrony and the by now inevitable scaler that reduces the pixel count internally while leaving the output value intact, in fact we have an antialiasing option that also uses temporal injection (important precisely in combination with the scaler), the ability to lock the frame rate and apply the extra to the sharpness value consisting of the aforementioned FidelityFX, which apparently does not impact performance even if you use an NVIDIA video card. The advanced settings offer three to four different presets for ambient occlusion, level of detail, texture quality, anisotropic filtering, screen space shadows, ground and grass quality, screen space reflections, sun shadows, motion blur, bloom, subsurface scattering (a technique that enhances the impact of lights on surfaces), long-distance shadows, volumetric fog, and background fog blur. In terms of performance all these options obviously weigh, but by setting each single item to the maximum and the resolution at 2160p it is possible to play at about 40 frames per second on the test configuration: not bad. The problem is that using the scaler you have to go down to 50% to get close to 60 frames, but above all there is no setting that dynamically modifies the pixel count to keep the fluidity stable, as Gears 5 does very well, for example. Going down to 1440p the situation improves substantially, but an annoying stuttering continues to occur when driving a vehicle. No problem obviously at 1080p, an area in which the aforementioned temporal injection and FidelityFX technology prove to be very useful for smoothing and defining the image when playing on an Ultra HD screen.", "date": "2019-10-08", "grade": "7.5"}
