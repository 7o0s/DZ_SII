The speed of the descents, the beauty of the mountain landscapes and the spectacularity of the acrobatic maneuvers were in fact able to mix to obtain an amazing result, capable of involving and entertaining even those who had never even set foot on the snow. The recent (and splendid) Alto's Odyssey can provide clear indications as to why certain scenarios have great appeal, but we are talking about a very different product from Peak Rider, the new title from Battery Acid Games. In fact, the game goes back to the tradition we talked about at the beginning, adopting a third-person view and launching ourselves at full speed on a snowboard to face four possible modes (Arcade, Flags, Stunts and Multiplayer) from the perspective of a structure that makes procedural maps its cornerstone. A choice, the latter, which appears right when it guarantees a certain variety of situations, giving us always different paths as they are randomly generated, but which inevitably leaves a bad taste in the mouth compared to an approach with traditional scenarios , where the developers could have worked on the colors, details and facets of a descent that did not always appear similar to itself. Fine check The first thing that catches the eye about Peak Rider, beyond an unfortunately somewhat botched presentation, is the accelerometer-based control system. There are mechanisms in the game for which you have to proceed hugging the trees to load the trick bar, and this naturally requires a certain precision, which fortunately the tilt controls are able to guarantee much more than the touch alternative, which we instead found approximate and not very reliable. The main menu is gradually enriched with new events with which you can try your hand at the four modes we mentioned earlier: there is the endless free run, the races with a score target, the asynchronous challenges with other users, the precision exercises based on passages between trees or flags, or resistance tests in which you have to total a certain number of seconds in the air. A fairly varied set of options, which can also count on a convincing progression system: with the gold coins earned on the track, it is possible to buy not only new clothes for our character, but also snowboards with superior performance. In terms of aerobatics Peak Rider does not invent anything new and refers to the tradition of the genre, simply asking us to press on the screen to perform different tricks, provided that we return to the correct position before landing, where we do not want to crash . From the point of view of the freemium setting, we have not encountered paywalls nor are there any time limitations or waiting times to play, but at the end of each race you have to spend a few seconds in front of an advertising trailer. The system works very well, it's pleasant and fun, but the procedural nature of the scenarios, as already mentioned, unfortunately takes away the charm of a structure that we see well as a starting point and not an arrival point for the series. The polygonal modeling is good, the discrete animations and the tilt controls work very well, so the developers will just have to keep these aspects of the experience and introduce them in a richer and more multifaceted context to make a bang with a possible second episode. For the moment we have to settle for a formula that is pleasant but shows its limits already after a few games.", "date": "2018-03-09", "grade": "7.5"}
