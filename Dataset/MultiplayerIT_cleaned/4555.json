Between the light side and the dark side, the passions of the Sith and the inner peace of the Jedi, the wisdom of the masters and the impulsiveness of the students. ~Only a Sith lives on absolutes~, Obi-Wan would say, and in fact the biggest challenge of Star Wars Battlefront II is finding that balance capable of satisfying an increasingly demanding and heterogeneous community. The 2015 Battlefront had its flaws, missing parts, some elements out of place, but like the Millennium Falcon it was a heap of scrap metal capable of transporting you to another galaxy in seconds. Building on that foundation, the developers of DICE, Motive and Criterion have created a sequel that is more enjoyable in gameplay and more complete in terms of content, whose experience begins with an unprecedented single-player campaign. The empire in pieces There is a brief moment in the Star Wars Battlefront II campaign where you find yourself walking among pirates, smugglers, bounty hunters and scum from every corner of the galaxy. If you listen carefully, you can overhear the conversations of some of those present: there are those who speak of the Black Sun, whispering so as not to be heard, and those who discuss the independence of the planet Ryloth with the tone of someone who has already had a few drinks. drinks too many. In writing a story set between the events of Return of the Jedi and those of The Force Awakens, the guys at Motive indulged themselves with cameos and references to the current Star Wars canon. You can relive battles retold in the novel Star Wars: Aftermath, discover barely hinted backstory in the comic Shattered Empire, and even winks at the TV series Star Wars Rebels. For the most diehard fans of the franchise, it is therefore a four-five hour journey between already known planets and completely new settings. Unfortunately, however, four-five hours don't seem to be enough to delve into facts and characters, and the result is a fragmented, confused story that seems to start off on the right foot and then hasten events and leave several outstanding issues. If you've only seen the Star Wars movies, you'll struggle to fully understand some of the events, and on multiple occasions the story assumes you've read (or will read) the novels and comics. Once the references have been removed, what remains is a simple and too predictable arc. The developers promised a different point of view, an original story told from the perspective of the imperials, a tale that would dig deep into the inner conflicts of the characters and their ideas about the war between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Unfortunately, like any imperial stormtrooper, the Battlefront II campaign misses the target: Iden Versio's ideals are never explored, nor her relationship with her father or with her companions in the Inferno Squad, so much so that it is hard to understand and justify many of his decisions (and this even after reading the novel Inferno Squad by Christie Golden). During the various missions, interaction with companions is reduced to the bone, and one never feels part of an elite team, one never perceives the bond that, in theory, should unite the different members of the Inferno Squad . Janina Gavankar's performance struggles to shine precisely because of a character that appears too two-dimensional, and the fact that Iden is the protagonist of a shooter shouldn't be an excuse: after all, with Republic Commando, LucasArts managed to make us fall in love with an unfortunate group of faceless clones. It's a wasted opportunity, because all in all the Battlefront II campaign has its spectacular moments, a fast pace, a huge dose of fan service and a level of production never before achieved by another Star Wars game. Like the previous chapter, DICE's shooter is technically sumptuous both on PC and on consoles: undoubtedly the most detailed representation of the Star Wars universe, also thanks to an exceptional sound design and a soundtrack that alternates new musical themes with most famous songs of the film saga. However, together with the challenges of the Arcade mode (which replaces the Missions option of the old Battlefront), the campaign represents in all respects a sort of flamboyant tutorial to prepare for multiplayer, undoubtedly the main dish of the game. A combative negotiation Since the announcement, the premise (and promise) of Star Wars Battlefront II has been to expand and enrich the formula of the previous chapter, introducing heroes, units and settings drawn not only from the Classic Trilogy, but also from the prequel and more recent feature films. So here are characters like Yoda, Darth Maul, Kylo Ren and Rey who join Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, while the maps range from the platforms of the stormy Kamino to Maz Kanata's Castle on Takodana, from the corridors of Starkiller Base to the streets of Mos Eisley , passing the royal palace of Naboo and the forested moon of Endor. In short, Battlefront II has become a huge toy box capable of satisfying all fans regardless of their favorite trilogy, but the developers have welcomed the feedback and criticisms of the old chapter to make the gameplay more interesting. The possibility to choose between four different classes, each with particular skills and strengths, makes every match more varied and stimulates you to make a specific contribution to your team. Vehicles, heroes and special units are no longer tied to power-ups randomly scattered across the map, but to Battle Points that are accumulated by eliminating enemies or by pursuing team objectives. It is a more meritocratic solution that adds a pinch of strategy to each respawn: with which class can I make a greater contribution? Is it better to spend the collected points to immediately use a tank or wait until you have enough to take the field as Yoda? There's also a new mechanic that stimulates team play by rewarding collaboration between certain team members. Let's be clear, Battlefront II is still a very arcadey experience, frenetic and light, accessible to a wide audience and that does not require a particular synchronization work via voice chat (also because, once again, the game does not support it). Yet these substantial innovations make everything more stimulating and articulated, excellent news for those who have not appreciated the ~rose water~ approach of the first Battlefront. The game modes are instead a version on steroids of those already seen two years ago. For example, Galactic Assault is the evolution of the old Walker Assault, with forty-player battles in huge objective-based maps. Depending on the setting, the two teams can have different roles and missions: on Endor, for example, the rebels must first steal an AT-AT and then escort it to an imperial base; on Naboo, you must stop the advance of a droid transporter and stop the Separatists before they can take over the throne room. The other flagship mode of Battlefront II is Starfighter Assault, version 2.0 of the old Fighter Squadron once again entirely dedicated to aerial combat. Here Criterion worked closely with DICE to improve the aircraft control system: fighters are now more maneuverable in aerial pursuits, making each engagement more exciting and challenging. The maps invite risk-taking, chasing opponents through clusters of asteroids or the debris of the Second Death Star, so it's a shame when you occasionally crash due to sloppy hitboxes. Heroes against Villains is once again the most frenetic, carefree and fan service mode, but the rules have changed compared to the first Battlefront, merging some mechanics of the old Hero Hunt: two teams composed only of heroes must try to eliminate the target of the opposing team before others can do the same. The remaining options are undoubtedly the least successful ones: Elimination is the classic Team Death Match, inserted only because, according to the developers, ~it cannot be there~. Attack is instead an option in which two teams of eight players face off in smaller maps, with the aim of conquering or defending a couple of outposts. It's a more compact and faster-paced mode, but it completely lacks the dynamism and unpredictability that Dropzone and Droid Rush had in the old Battlefront. The latter are not the only steps backwards made by Battlefront II: unlike the previous chapter, for example, it is not possible to unlock aesthetic customizations for infantry units, change their gender or race. Then there is a menu of personal statistics, from which to check one's performance and online statistics. However, a few inaccurate collisions, a couple of subdued modes and a missing option are minor matters when compared to what is undoubtedly the Bantha in the room: the game economy and the progression system linked to the prize boxes. Damage control In the weeks between the public beta and the game's release, much of the discussion and criticism from the community centered around the potential ~Pay to Win~ nature of Battlefront II, due to its new loot box system, containing not only credits and elementaesthetics (such as victorious poses or hero skins), but above all Star Cards with which to improve the skills of heroes, ships and units. Let's get one thing straight: in all the matches we've played online, not once have we had the impression of being eliminated because the opponent was better equipped than us. A few but fundamental stakes require you to spend several hours before you can unlock the strongest weapons and rarest Star Cards, while the team has already announced that at launch the matchmaking will take into account not only the player's skill, but also the time past with the game and the rarity of its Star Cards. However, the progression linked to obtaining new cards is cumbersome, confused and anti-intuitive, a Frankenstein monster born from having forced an economy based on loot boxes into a formula, that of the first Battlefront, which followed a more linear and traditional progression system. Not everything worked out for the best, and in the days that preceded the review (and the launch of the game for those who pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition), the community of enthusiasts arose, storming social networks with criticisms and controversies towards the costs too many heroes to unlock. Reddit has turned into a battleground where community Rebels have attacked the Electronic Arts Empire, in some cases resulting in shameful excesses. Put behind a situation now out of hand, Electronic Arts did an about-face just in time for the launch of the game, significantly reducing the credits needed to access the unlockable heroes. The result is a smoother and significantly less frustrating experience.", "date": "2017-11-14", "grade": "8.3"}
