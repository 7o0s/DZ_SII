{"name": "Driven", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/driven_a.html", "text": "Driven, or when Wipeout meets R-type. All of this is Driven, a trivial racing game that works little and badly as an arcade, and as a simulation not at all, with truly ridiculous results. Basically the title offers us two main modes, Arcade and Story. The first makes us compete on all the circuits, racetracks and improbable city tracks with lots of traffic, unlocking secret tracks based on our victories, the second one hides the real fulcrum of the title Bam! Entertainment. In Story Mode, the events of the film will be relived, and in addition to competing on the various tracks present, we should also pass small single tests that recall the GranTurismo licenses. This is it, the title offers nothing else, very little compared to its direct competitors. The control method is completely negative: at whatever speed you go, you always travel as if you were on ice, it is a continuous wandering from one part of the track to the other, moreover the brakes never work as they should: a picture very disheartening. The air brakes typical of the cars featured in Wipeout are definitely missing!! As if that weren't enough, nothing short of ridiculous accident physics has been implemented: the car breaks down and this is ok, but if the front mustache pops off we run as if nothing had happened, in spite of the stability of the car, if instead we break a suspension, at least we should go around on three wheels sadly heading to the pits, instead in Driven the unthinkable happens. As in a navigated horizontal scrolling shooter, the inscription candidly appears: Do you want to repair the car? You still have three lives! What poetry, what melancholy towards the good old days, a naive touch that does justice to a title that deals (with a lot of freedom) with car racing to the death. 2002 odyssey into scandal Graphically speaking, we navigate between highs (few) and lows (many). The only good thing is that the frame rate is constant at 60fps and nothing else. Everything else is a riot of coarse textures, risky color combinations and a use of motion blur that rarely allows us to see anything clearly in the distance. The polygonal landscape is bare and roughly mapped, while the cars are absolutely average, made without infamy and without praise, a pity about the liveries which are in pure American tamarro style, a punch on the eye in other words Also the hyper effect The speed you feel entering the ~zone~ is quite poor: always the usual motion blur totally obscures the corners of the screen, in a sort of Kubrick-type 2001 mega trip, leaving the car or cockpit defined. The results are more like a fogged mirror than warp speed: here too, nothing good to report. On the other hand, the static screens made in something very close to cell shading are well done, which introduce our adventures into the story mode. Even the audio sector rests on general mediocrity. The good things are some music, and the voice of the immense Ferruccio Amendola, who gives us advice on how to face the races. The samplings of the roar of the engines are not good at all, all a bit the same and not at all charismatic. Those who have been able to try Dolby Surround have told me of a poor and ineffective use of encoding, nothing to do with the pyrotechnic Dolby Pro Logic 2 of Rogue Leader. Ultimately there is little else to say: Driven is an unattractive title graphically, with poor playability, and not least not very fun and rewarding to play. It can be played in two, the framerate is constant on 60fps, we can hear the voice of dear Ferruccio, this and all the positive things that the Bam!Entertainment title gives us; a little too small for our tastes. pro 60 fps Ferruccio Amendola is dubbing!! two player mode versus unfunny poor graphically frustrating control method Tie-ins and various conversions Among the first titles to be released for the new Nintendo machine, here is Driven, already released for Ps2, tie-in of the mediocre film with Silvester Stallone. Unfortunately for us players, this racing game is also a clear example of how film-licensed games are very little compared to ~original~ titles in all respects. The tradition has been respected: the film comes out, and more or less immediately afterwards a game is played that can exploit the appeal that the title of the film arouses with minimal production effort. What is certain is that, given the not excellent quality of the film, to say the least in short, the result is a couple of very uninteresting products.", "date": "2002-05-17", "grade": null}
