Well, Bus simulator 16 is part of that category of software that promises to faithfully recreate the experience but most of the time they fail because they are released with too many bugs and physics that aren't up to par; if your dream is to be a bus driver then you should get the appropriate license and send your resume to the local transport company. Bus Simulator 16 is a total disaster in many ways Step aside Keanu Reeves After a tutorial on driving controls and a short test drive in a modern German city, you enter the heart of the action with your own bus company that will quickly become the reference point of urban transport in the area. At the beginning, the engine compartment is somewhat spartan, with only one vehicle available which must serve a large slice of the population in the suburban area of the metropolis and a single driver, who is the player himself as well as the undisputed master of the company. Each week begins with the selection screen of the route to be followed, a map with a series of stops and the route, and ends with the monetary balance showing the receipts and any losses caused by a driving style that does not respect road rules and the property of others. The management side of the game is the least interesting component and seems decidedly underdeveloped: in addition to the garage and the bus shop, there is the section dedicated to human resources in which the work of employees can be organized, or specify the path that must be followed. There are also a series of objectives to be overcome in order to unlock new neighborhoods that gradually become more and more challenging, such as being able to cover all the stops in a given area or creating a route that connects the suburbs with the city in less than ten minutes. industrial area; in any case, the level of challenge is never high and it doesn't take much to understand how to get around the objectives in a clever way. If, as mentioned, the management part has not been exploited properly, the same also applies to the guided part, which presents quite a few problems both from the technical side and from the purely videogame side: first of all, let's start from the name of the game itself, which despite the simulation promises it has very little if not some details that in the face of a complete disaster are like a drop in an ocean. The cab controls are, incredibly, all working and using the mouse you can click on each of them to operate, for example, the windshield wipers or the car radio, which always repeats the usual four or five country-rock songs; outside the vehicle there are only the door open buttons and the one to extend the ramp for the disabled which, we assure you, is used all too often. The physical model is not exactly that disastrous and using a steering wheel is even pleasant, which cannot be said if the only options available are a joypad or a keyboard, absolutely not recommended: the bus responds well to the commands and the sensation of being at the wheel of a beast of several tons is reproduced satisfactorily, a pity that in case of rain with wet asphalt the behavior of the vehicle does not change one iota, as if the water were only a graphic element that does not influence in any way the grip of the tires. Certainly, if we are talking about real simulation, the passengers are really irritating since not only do they dare to linger in long chats with the driver, something absolutely forbidden, but more often than not they position themselves close to the door with the unpleasant consequence of block it, delaying departure: artificial intelligence, in essence, is not exactly the best and is especially noticeable in the risky maneuvers of car drivers, who sometimes scrupulously follow the highway code, while on other occasions they don't care and go to crashing directly into the bus, which obviously penalizes the player who is charged the costs of the accident despite the obvious faults of the CPU. All this makes the game not very fun even for the most extreme fans of the genre, who after a handful of hours will hardly be able to resist the delusions that can be seen on German roads. Total disaster So far we have seen how the gameplay does not present peaks of excellence in any respect, but if you believe you have overcome the worst then prepare to sink into utter despair, as the technical side is a disaster of biblical proportions. The graphics, as can be seen from the attached screenshotsati to the article, is bad with poorly defined polygonal models and effects that seem to be from a title of at least ten years ago, frequent pop-in phenomena that are in no way justifiable in a title of this kind and a lack of details to say the least little puzzling. The thing that is really annoying is that despite the above considerations the title has a frame rate locked at 30 frames and many, too many times there are noticeable drops in performance due to the pop-in of the trees: you got it right, frequent drops in frame despite the fact that the technical sector is absolutely below average. Frankly, such a thing is an indication of little attention from the developers or a simple demonstration of their incompetence since it is not possible that a title with graphics worthy of a low-end mobile title struggles to run on a PC with specific high hardware. The audio sector, fortunately, is not a total disaster and there is a varied palette of ambient sounds that can be heard wandering around the city on foot, when you don't feel like doing service and prefer to take a carefree walk in the center. The defects, as you have been able to see, are far superior to the merits and very little is saved in this title which is fully part of the cauldron made up of all those simulators that have very little of reality, if not the price necessary for the purchase: if you're looking for a game that does justice to the job of bus driver, you'd better look elsewhere, since Bus simulator 16 has very little substance, just anger and frustration.", "date": "2016-03-25", "grade": "5.0"}
