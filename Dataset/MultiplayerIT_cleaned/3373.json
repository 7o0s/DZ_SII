{"name": "Rune 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rune-2-recensione.html", "text": "It's not often that we start writing a review of a game with its active development team and end it with the same one that has now failed, but that's exactly what happened to us with Rune 2, the title that concludes the sad parable of Human Head Studios , started in 2000 with Rune. Reworking the article almost made us want to make it an epitaph for a studio that has always had excellent ideas, but has never been able to implement them as it would have liked. It is paradoxical that it was Bethesda who saved the Human Head employees who at the time of Prey 2 literally bankrupted the studio, despite the fact that the project was more than promising, taking away any possibility of recovering. Thus the team that had made small rough gems such as Rune, Dead Man's Hand and Prey found itself having to beg for projects with a skeleton staff, descending ever lower until the negative peak reached with the very bad The Quiet Man. From there the survivors of the trickle of negative votes and lost money wanted to go back to basics and tried to play their last card: Rune 2. At this point you are wondering if it is worth playing. The answer is really simple: no, forget it. Unfortunately, the failure of Human Head will not guarantee any support for the game, support it needs immensely, given the state it is in. It's easy to write that Rune 2 is an overly ambitious project for a team with water at its throat, but we don't want to appear too cynical. It almost makes me want to close the review here, so it suddenly became useless to talk about the game. Anyway let's try. Action survival Rune 2 is an open world third-person action in which we play the role of a generic Nordic warrior who has to face Ragnarok, the end of time, defeating for the umpteenth time the god Loki, who returned after Ragnar, the protagonist of the first Rune, had hacked it to shreds with an axe. Guided by the god Heimdall, we must therefore go around the Midgard islands in search of some artifacts with incredible powers, the only ones that can give us the strength necessary to face the colossal enemy, weakening the Gate of the Realms. The artifacts must be collected within a time limit, after which Loki will attack us and take control of a given territory, making our mission more difficult. The territories claimed by Loki can in turn be reconquered, provided that the guardians who guard them are defeated, a not very simple task when the character is still of a low level and does not have particularly high-performance equipment. Luckily, dying does not trigger game over, but sends you back to one of the unlocked checkpoints on the map, from which you can restart with your equipment practically intact. Rune 2 is a mix of different genres, unfortunately tasteless. In addition to the role-playing features, with character growth completely guided by the system, there are also very superficial survival parts, which require you to break stones and cut trees to rebuild houses in which to cook, repair weapons, make new equipment and deposit the excess objects in special chests. All the buildings are rebuilt in more or less the same way and all contain the same work tools, so much so that collecting the material to build them becomes repetitive after a few minutes. The system is particularly agile because evidently we wanted to favor the cooperative mode, where certain delays are not welcome, but the substance is that the survival elements are really superficial, almost annoying from a certain point on. Combat system The world of Rune 2 is populated only by enemies - such as Thrall, undead, giants and so on - and animals, who also act as enemies, whether they are wolves or fawns (yes, Bambi is also aggressive). Apart from the main quests, we are not given any other quests. However, there are tasks to be performed implicit in the game system, which reward us with additional experience points. For example we have to cut down a certain number of trees, kill a certain amount of enemies, explore some key areas and so on. Everything is very straightforward, but overall uninteresting. The combat system is in line with the rest of the game: it wants to be brutal, but ends up being anything but. Incidentally, the shots are slimy, the fights generally chaotic and the strategy completely absent. In most cases it is enough to get into the fray and strike wildly to get the upper hand. When enemies are too strong just walk away and come back witha few more levels or with a better weapon. The only strategy that really pays off is escape. The parade can come in handy on some occasions, but don't expect anything too thoughtful. The bosses themselves are simply tougher enemies that hurt more. There is something better in the second part of the adventure, i.e. in the more remote territories of the map (dragons, larger creatures and so on) but obviously you have to get there. From this it follows that the progression of the difficulty in most cases is entrusted to the number of enemies to be faced simultaneously and the damage they cause, not to a particular variety of attack patterns. Be that as it may, the focus of Rune 2 is on equipment. Around the game world there are dozens of recipes that give access to increasingly powerful weapons and armor, which are the only reason to continue looking for resources and to explore all corners of Midgard. The most valuable pieces have a greater durability and obviously do more harm. Owning them is used to access some of the most inaccessible areas of the map, where it is almost impossible to get to with the basic equipment. In general, playing alone is not very motivated to move forward. In co-op, things change, but at present there are very few who own the game, so either you have a friend available who wants to share the experience, or it becomes complicated to exploit the best feature of the title. Bugs and glitches Rune 2 isn't awful, but it's simply incomplete and unfinished in every aspect. Some things just work, others would have taken a few more months to develop, and still others are simply incomplete. There are also many bugs and glitches, including rocks that never run out, trees that don't fall but still give their resources, momentary blocks in the control system, jumping animations, enemies that get stuck and so on, sometimes there it really is to put your hands in your hair. As already mentioned, the fact that the developer went bankrupt makes these problems particularly serious, because it rules out a priori that they are fixed. Maybe some hot fixes will be released, but we don't think much more can be expected, especially in structural terms.", "date": "2019-11-14", "grade": "4.5"}
