The developers therefore thought it was the right time to return to mobile devices, however finding themselves faced with a different scenario than that of 2009, with the puzzle genre practically monopolized by freemium productions. So Peggle Blast was born, an episode for iOS and Android that re-proposes the traditional gameplay of the franchise by adding some small new elements in the stages, a selection of funny characters to ~control~ and some fairly challenging bosses, all with a view to structure that precisely in its freemium mechanisms refers to Candy Crush Saga and to all the King branded production. This means that the progress in the single player campaign is marked on a scoreboard in stages, with the usual integration with Facebook to view the results of our friends; and that, to move to one of the following areas, it is necessary to pay, ask for help on social networks or wait a few hours. Similarly, the number of lives available is limited and subject to time reloading, although the problem only arises when game over arrives: if we are good enough and/or lucky, our game could last quite a while . In short, no ~energy points~, but a relatively elastic system, which clearly pushes towards in-app purchases to make life easier within the more difficult levels, with upgrades, boosts or ~continues~ that can only be obtained by putting your hand to the wallet. The good news is that these elements remain optional, and during our tests they never gave us the impression of being essential to be able to continue the adventure and - why not - complete it completely free of charge. Peggle Blast is a mix between the tradition of the series and the freemium structure of successful puzzle games The amazing friends Unlike the original episode, in Peggle Blast the action develops by holding the device vertically and using the touch screen to adjust the cannon and shoot the ten balls at our disposal, which we can ~save~ and reuse if they end up in the jar moves to the bottom of the screen. The fire command is sometimes imprecise, which makes things more difficult than they really are when you have to hit the famous orange bricks (our goal is to eliminate them all) and they are in a moving formation . Beyond this lack, which we hope will be resolved through an update, the experience of the new PopCap title maintains the solidity and fun of always, with a challenge between the unicorn Bjorn and his evil brother, Fnord, which is renewed from area to area thanks to the intervention of new characters (each equipped with a special maneuver when hitting a green brick), multiple variables and real boss fights that are consumed over three rounds, with traditional challenges that culminate with a turn-based duel in which you must score higher than your opponent to win; or resign yourself, in case of defeat, to repeat the entire sequence. Certainly there is no shortage of making the action spectacular, thanks to colorful, fluid and particularly dynamic graphics, which start with bullet times when the ball is about to touch the last brick and give life to a celebration complete with ~Ode to Joy Beethoven's if successful. In short, if you missed the Peggle gameplay and couldn't wait for the PopCap Games franchise to return to the App Store and Google Play, this episode won't disappoint you.", "date": "2014-12-10", "grade": "8.0"}
