The first edition came out way back in 1997 and made its echo heard, also bouncing on national newspapers, not so much for its contribution to the gaming world - which the media didn't care about, then as now - but for the ~disarming~ sprites in which unaware pedestrians were gleefully paved over, after yelling in terror. Of course we must add that the beauty was just passing and passing over the corpses, making sure that the wheels, stained with blood, draw hemoglobin strips of pixels on the asphalt. The Italian copy of the game was subject to censorship, with passersby being replaced by zombies and the blood with greenish liquid, but in reality the version with robots also arrived... and it was the pinnacle of trash! To allow the code to be brought back in order and to be able to play it as it was intended, with or without the internet, even then patches were passed on under the table and even the official expansion, which came out later, allowed the restoration of the original version. A few years later we arrived at the moment of the rebirth of the brand, with Carmageddon: Reincarnation which after a long gestation in Early Access is ready to be played in its entirety. Was it worth waiting all this time? Carmageddon is blood and crumpled metal, on these points the title renews the tradition Fist in the eye Judging by the first images promoted as concept art, we immediately had the pleasant illusion of a truly spot-on design, which combined original machines with a profound modern reinterpretation of all those ~tamarri~ grafts that have always characterized the series. However, the final result differed a lot from the first drafts, revealing a more discreet aesthetic and demonstrating a clear cut on details. All this by loading the vehicles with a more narrow-minded and embossed aspect, even not very elaborate from a polygonal point of view. During the various releases during the Early Access phase, some evolution could be seen, especially on Max Damage's car, but the feeling remains that the vehicles are characterized by plasticky and monochromatic surfaces. Turning to the game world, it is right to say a few words about the city scenarios, the scene of the furious clashes of the title. If the machines are already unconvincing, the environments are even worse with basic three-dimensional geometric figures ~painted~ to give us the illusion that a cube is a house and a parallelepiped a building. The level design recalls the paradoxical vision of the first chapter, with extreme curves and dizzying slopes, which require a certain attention but which are (or should be) also a reason for fun. What doesn't work in this maze of concrete and glass is the lack of level optimization. The roads are in fact equipped with elevations, placed randomly, which produce absurd physical reactions in which the cars jump and cause the player to lose control completely. The placement of poles, various types of obstructions and even some road layouts seem designed only to increase the frustration factor and not, on the contrary, to promote fluid and dynamic driving. The physics would require a separate article but, in summary, we are light years away from any potential concessions that can be made to a racing game. Jump off any ramp and the car could even tip over or wheelie, without logic, or roll for five minutes on the clock from falling from a couple of meters in height. Every time you find yourself playing turtles, with your legs in the air and not being able to turn on your side, you will have to pay to be put back on the course, a significant problem given that there are particularly difficult areas in which you will call for help from 'high many times. We close the chapter of the problems by mentioning the bad hardware optimization of the game engine, which creates continuous blocks of the image, even for a few seconds, and a dancing frame rate even on powerful machines. The AI of the enemies is fluctuating. Absurdly, in the first hours of the game it also reaches the peak of frustration: you won't be able to do damage to anyone, in fact the opponents will suffer very little unlike you who will crumple like tinfoil with each impact made. Killer racing After a long examination of the problems, it is fair to underline where things actually work and even well. The possibility of upgrading the vehicle, through bonuses scattered throughout the levels, adds an interesting incentive to replay the various races and is also the only system forr avoid being cannon fodder for too long. The damage system is also quite pleasing to the eye, certainly better than many triple A titles, showing the skeleton of the vehicles and each phase of damage up to total devastation. Engine, Armor and Offense are the three stats that can be upgraded with tangible results. The number of races available is very high and is guaranteed by a variety that includes killing a certain number of pedestrians within a given amount of time, reaching random checkpoints scattered around the level complete with carnage to reach the various areas as soon as possible and so on. There are many cars: some make more sense as opponents because they are not very usable, others are colossal and fill the screen as well as the player's desire for destruction. The power ups, distributed via barrels on the side of the track, exceed the wildest imagination: lightning, springs and armor are the foundations of these timed power-ups which can also be turned against us and therefore always require a certain amount of attention. The soundtrack still has metal pieces that give the right rhythm to the action, even if the boredom of the gameplay distracts from the quality of the notes that come out of the speakers. In our road test, perhaps for the first time ever, we found the keyboard more comfortable than the pad. Driving with the WASD keys and braking with 'space' allowed us to drift around corners at our best but also to control the car by increasing its stability, something that didn't prove as comfortable with a controller. The police are always relentless and furious with anyone but especially with the poor user. If the first police cars are little more than a small car, going forward you will be overwhelmed by real smashing rams that will make the driving experience a little more peppery.", "date": "2015-05-27", "grade": "6.0"}
