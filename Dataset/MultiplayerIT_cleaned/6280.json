Follow us down the short but perilous descents of Yeti Mountain as you discover why Featherweight Games' title should be your next download. A new classic for mobile gaming? Let's discover the amazing Skiing Yeti Mountain! Skiing at your fingertips The greatest among the many strengths of Skiing Yeti Mountain is probably the control system: with a top view, you control your skier, who basically has to pass the gates from the right side as per normal slalom rules and avoid the obstacles that can be found along the slopes, with your fingers. Two different settings are available, one suitable for the index finger and the other for the thumb, and both work perfectly, with the anonymous protagonist following your every wish. A slight movement corresponds to a gentle turn, more angular movements to a sharp curve which also causes you to lose speed, which is often necessary to better manage the levels. Another remarkable feature is the beautiful level design, useful for making an ultimately very simple concept attractive. The doors and other elements (trees, jumps, various types of snow that slow down or make you lose control) are placed with extreme wisdom and able to create the most diverse situations, from those characterized by extreme speed up to the most ~ slaloming~ and chaotic, getting out with dexterity from which will be a source of great satisfaction. In short, the feeling of actually skiing, albeit with the fingers, is perfectly rendered, and all this for a number of levels in the order of, more or less, the eight hundreds, between ~normal~ descents and the very difficult ones of the Challenge Mountain. To go from one level to the next, just beat the time limit, but by beating an even lower one you will get more experience points, which are used to buy useful items to customize the aesthetics of the character, and above all to make a fine show in the online rankings . The product even offers us, which is further confirmation of the care taken, a very simple and intuitive way to go and play the levels directly for which we still have to conquer the gold, without going to look for them on the vast map that serves as a home screen. Fresh snow, warm blood Eight hundred descents, as beautiful and fun as you like, but inevitably not very varied in terms of things to do, there are many. And in fact it is not that you will be in front of Skiing Yeti Mountain for hours and hours at a time: this is the typical game to be enjoyed for short sessions of a few tens of minutes, after which a little boredom and the desire to do something else begins to take over. but in a mobile environment this is certainly not a serious flaw. And the nice thing is that, if it is true as it is true that you will hardly be able to handle more than a certain number of stages at a time, the desire to play again, to advance further or try to beat that record that just escapes you, returns soon. This is not only by virtue of the fantastic gameplay but also, incredibly enough, the story and presentation. In search of the abominable snowman as the title suggests, you will come across a whole series of highly over the top characters, from the highly competitive and obnoxious champion to the conspiracy theorist obsessed with aliens and secret services, who, through short but effective and entertaining of dialogue, they will be able to create both a sort of story that unfolds slowly, and above all a very humorous atmosphere but which does not disdain encroachments on mystery, horror and even splatter. The artistic department is also very pleasant: the choice to use pixel art will certainly not amaze fans of the latest technological cry, but we are faced with a really well done graphic, colorful despite the main theme being, obviously, the white of the snow, and always very fluid. All this goodness, thanks to all the merits that we have shown so far, lasts a long time, with the annotations of the ~game to be taken in small doses~ which we talked about before, and of the difficulty curve which, probably due to the he high number of challenges rise almost imperceptibly. Only far ahead, in fact, will you find it very difficult to grasp the minimum objectives of a descent, but even this should not necessarily be considered a bad thing, especially for those who will be fascinated by competition in the leaderboards. We leave another great advantage for last: not only is the game totally usable for free, as well as the varie in-game ads are cleverly placed. First of all at the right intervals, which do not disturb the flow of the experience at all, but then also in a nice way: one of the various characters is in fact a kind of aspiring marketing genius, who will boast of having sold the various spaces to the sponsored companies himself , also giving life to very nice curtains. The 3.40 Euros required to completely get rid of the ads are justifiable, and another ~monetary~ option of the title is even noble: you can donate a certain amount to help the victims of the recent earthquake in Nepal.
