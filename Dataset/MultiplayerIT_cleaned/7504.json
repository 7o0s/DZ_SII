On the wings of enthusiasm, the aubergine man is now trying to extend this positive trend also in the mobile sector, presenting himself with this Rayman Fiesta Run, a sequel to Rayman Jungle Run with the firm intention of expanding and improving a formula that at the time had attracted great followers . A fiesta full of very enthusiastic people ~Winning team does not change seems~ to have been Ubisoft's motto for this Rayman Fiesta Run, and it is really difficult to blame the transalpine software house given the success of the previous one thanks to a game formula that is nothing short of suitable for mobile use. So here is that the aim is always to get to the end of the levels by collecting as many Lums as possible, using a control system borrowed from endless runners: Rayman therefore moves forward independently, and the player has the task of pressing the appropriate virtual keys to make him jump, attack with a punch and so on. The focus is all on timing, but the excellent level design conceived by the developers ensures that the player still feels in control of the situation and not a mere spectator of an action on the tracks. However, these are all elements already known and appreciated in Rayman Jungle Run, which in this new chapter are highlighted by a structure enhanced in substantially every aspect. We start from the simple number of stages - now counting over 70 units - always characterized by a rate of difficulty sustainable by all kinds of audiences: however, there is also a tribute to the more expert users, given that by collecting all 100 Lums of a level, unlock the ~overgrown~ version of the same, characterized by a greater concentration and variety of obstacles that takes the challenge to decidedly more demanding peaks. Rayman Fiesta Run improves in all respects the formula of the already excellent Rayman Jungle Run Like the longevity, the progression in the adventure has also been improved: if the prequel was in fact divided into small worlds dedicated to each of the protagonist's abilities, here the journey winds along a path in which, in addition to the stages, find bonus characters and gifts, and you can even track the progress of your friends who have downloaded the game. A solution that guarantees greater variety and streamlining and which moreover requires you to do your best in all scenarios, given that the total number of Lums is the yardstick by which the amount of levels unlocked on the map is measured. Continuing the trend of filing the corners rougher than the previous one, Ubisoft has also tried to overcome the trial and error effect that could inevitably be perceived in Rayman Jungle Run if one aimed at 100% completion. At the beginning of each stage it is therefore possible to choose to spend a part of your precious Lums to win bonuses that guarantee a series of advantages for the duration of the level: you go from hearts that allow you to continue even if you get hit to super punches which increase the offensive potential of the protagonist, with the highlight represented by a track that indicates with icons the path to follow to collect every single Lum. In all of this, there was even space to add a component of in-app purchases that were fortunately totally harmless: you can therefore put your credit card in hand to replenish Lum's stocks, but it is a really attractive offer only for users who are so lazy that they don't want to retrace their steps to get the same result with just a little more sacrifice. If to all that has been listed so far we add an equally improved graphic design and an absolutely exhilarating Mexican-style soundtrack, the success of Rayman Fiesta Run becomes a pure formality: it is currently difficult to find a title in the mobile sector which, this price, offers so much quality.", "date": "2013-11-11", "grade": "8.8"}
