And so far, nothing new, at least in the premises. However, the situation immediately changes: in fact, it happens that, tired of waiting to be saved, Mia decides to flee alone, riding a dragon. Not at all intimidated by this strange mount, the princess decides to exploit the situation to get justice against those who have imprisoned her, and from there a mad race made up of underground tunnels, jumps, glides and indiscriminate destruction. Beyond the nice genre and role revolution staged by Rebel Twins with this bizarre characterization, Dragon Hills doesn't actually have particularly innovative or breaking elements, but what it puts together is definitely fun and well packaged. While the scenarios scroll by fast like in an endless runner, we find ourselves controlling the dragon with the simple act of touching the screen to make it dive into the ground. The longer you hold down, the deeper the dragon points, while releasing the key the snake-like monster immediately returns to point upwards with an ascent angle equal and opposite to that of the previous dive, through a physics management system basic but quite convincing. The principle is somewhat reminiscent of Tiny Wings, although in this case the development is reversed, with the dragon launching itself underground and bouncing towards the sky. What derives from it is an extremely simple game but from which it is difficult to detach yourself, which attracts even if only by virtue of its elementary and intuitive controls, the indiscriminate destruction that can be unleashed with simple and short touches on the screen and its fairy-tale and nice characterization , with a well-kept and cartoony graphic sector and an audio accompaniment that well accompanies the action with its epic tone. What if a princess decides to save herself by running away with the dragon? It may seem simple at first but in truth there are several things to keep an eye on in order to best ride the dragon and take it to the end of the levels. Yes because, first of all, it's a game divided into levels. Despite the typically endless runner aspect, the game world is divided into various settings with increasing difficulty, and there are even traditional boss fights at the end of each level. In this way, with each death of the dragon it is possible to restart directly from the beginning of the last completed scheme, giving a sense of progression that is not always easy to find in ~infinite~ setting games. It also follows a greater structuring of each individual level, which despite being built in a procedural way offers obstacles and enemies according to an incremental challenge principle. For the rest, the action does not change: it is a matter of pressing on the touch screen to immerse the dragon (which otherwise travels automatically by rubbing on the surface) underground and releasing to make it bounce upwards, calculating as much as possible the angle of ascent and fall , speed and trajectory to try to maximize the destruction by hitting houses, soldiers, fortifications, sheep and everything that appears defenseless in the face of the dragon's fury. At the same time, however, it is necessary to control the trajectories to dodge pockets of lava, defense systems, spears and various weapons arranged along the way. The coins won in the race can be invested to increase the dragon's armor, upgrade the sword of the princess or buy various additional modes, which adds some strategic elements to the otherwise very light and repetitive structure of the game.", "date": "2015-04-21", "grade": "8.0"}
