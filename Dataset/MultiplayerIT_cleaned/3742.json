{"name": "Darksiders: Warmastered Edition per Nintendo Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/darksiders-warmastered-edition-nintendo-switch-recensione.html", "text": "In the last nine years, Darksiders is a brand that you will surely have heard of, or read about in one of the many occasions of debate. Even before this review. In 2010 it was a courageous, anomalous, fascinating title as well as capable of collecting some gimmicks from other franchises and bringing them together under its own banner. Vigil Games and THQ had managed to put together a few distinctive elements: a convincing design by Madureira, able to catalyze the attention of the public and the press, a full-bodied, layered game design and a moderately inspired universe, all this in a complete maturation stage of the seventh generation. It happens that people like the game, and quite a lot; a community following is built and in 2016 a remastered version comes out on PS4, Xbox One and PC which increases resolution, frames and cleans up some surfaces. A necessary work to present to the public of the eighth generation of consoles - the current one - a nice little gem of a franchise; today, quite simply, it is the turn of presentations for Switch owners, who could take advantage of a decent port to enjoy a product that is dated, but on the move. Performance over everything When we write dated, the aim is not demolishing but simple honesty: the remastering work of some assets helps the user to acclimate with the artistic style, but there is no doubt how the game and level design have remained more or less the same, with all the advantages and limitations of time. Screen elements, physics, animations and platforming approach, unfortunately, remain those of 2010; looking at it from another point of view instead, those who prefer gameplay that is a little drier, more genuine and less sweetened than today's standard can find in Darksiders: Warmastered Edition a dive into the past that does not traumatize. We were saying, Switch: today's port has two modes, not a first for the owners of the platform but not even a particularly frequent situation. On the one hand, the approach that was adopted in the case of Warmastered on WiiU is privileged, with a resolution at 1080p and 30 frames per second (not granite), on the other hand, on a playful level, the octave experience is approached generation thanks to the 60 frames, but the visual system undergoes a lowering of resolution. Frankly speaking, the best mode is the latter: after having tried both, choosing the Performance mode will be a natural gesture because your eye will ask for it. Playing at a high flow of frames represents the most sensible solution on Switch, precisely for an image ambition that is not exaggerated and therefore not even able to withstand the quality / enjoyment ratio. Playing at 1080p on a nine-year-old product, however remastered, fails to create such an impactful visual difference as to convince the player to live the experience at a number of frames that, in addition to being visibly low, are not even stable , with a fluctuation often creating an even lower perception of flow. Around We are not going to tell you once again details of history or anything else, what matters is that Guerra's adventures still manage to be pleasant to experience today, thanks also to a more than decent dubbing. Darksiders remains a product capable of capturing: combat system, bestiary, progression and developments incorporate mechanics of larger franchises revised, repositioned but still well packaged that still today hide an entertainment potential greater than the sum of the individual parts. The not too hidden truth of this port - you're already imagining it - is that Darksiders can finally be played on the go and we confirm that this Warmastered gives its best on Switch right around, away from the dock. It is in this configuration that the difference between modes thins out to be almost imperceptible on the graphic front, while the possibility of playing at 60 frames in the portable version is instead a huge advantage, which gives a decisive twist to the experience and determines the best cause purchase of the title on Switch. We spent most of our time for this review around the house, divided between the sofa, bed and other daily routine areas: there is no doubt that the 60 frames and a not excessive technical weight of the title lend themselves very well to the purpose , ensuring excellent gameplay thanks to the side joycons. Thus, for the first time, Guerra officially becomes a small-screen knight, usable anywhere and capable of giving this version of the Warmastered its maximum dignity, albeit with a playful system clearly anchored in the past.", "date": "2019-04-01", "grade": "7.5"}
