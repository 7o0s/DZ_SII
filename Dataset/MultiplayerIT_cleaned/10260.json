From this point of view, the App Store constitutes a happy island and in many ways continues the discourse begun with the applications for Java-compatible mobile phones: the cost for the development of an average title is anything but insurmountable, the expenses of distribution in practice do not exist and a healthy search for the ideal product can be afforded, even taking into account some failed attempts. It is a bit the story of Mobigame, which already with Cross Fingers tried to use the touch screen (and in particular the multitouch functions) in an original and fun way, thus going to find original ideas in the control system rather than in the structure of game. The discussion continues with Edge, which goes beyond the boundaries of puzzle games (although recalling some aspects) to offer iPhone and iPod Touch owners an atypical and fun action game. How do you want to play? The first thing that strikes you about Edge is undoubtedly the control system, based by default on the touch screen but which allows us to choose two very different alternatives: a classic virtual d-pad with four directions or management via accelerometer. The d-pad undoubtedly proves to be the simplest and most precise type of control, while tilting the device following the perspective of the isometric view immediately appears quite complicated and cumbersome. We said that the default controls are entrusted to the touch screen. Well, our goal in the game is to move a cube within stages that become more complex and full of pitfalls, trying to collect some important objects and reach the exit. To move the cube, we have to touch and ~drag~ it until it picks up speed and starts moving by itself. The inertial context comes to our aid when we need to climb some obstacle, but at the same time it poses a danger when we find ourselves on the edge of an abyss (which happens frequently). The scenario is the undoubted protagonist of the action, and in the forty-six available stages it changes constantly, adding mobile devices and traps that make the challenge increasingly difficult. A ~map~ placed at the top of the screen shows us the layout of the ~terrain~ and the presence of any holes to stay away from, but in general we are the ones who find the limits of the route while moving. The first internships run smoothly, placing us in front of fairly linear and pitfall-free paths: it is certainly a learning phase in view of more demanding sessions. Sessions that arrive on time after a few levels, when you have to beware not only of the abyss but also of the ~catapults~ and the numerous moving objects, essential for reaching the exit but at the same time dangerous if we don't have quick reflexes. Technically, the Mobigame branded product appears cold rather than psychedelic, with a particular choice of colors but not who knows how inspired. The movement of the cubes is fluid and the frequent zooms on the scenario convince of the robustness of the graphics engine, employed in this case only minimally given the essential aspect of the game.
