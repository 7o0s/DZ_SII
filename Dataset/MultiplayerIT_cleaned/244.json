{"name": "Anno 1701 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/anno-1701-recensione.html", "text": "Here we analyze a management game with a clear Central European taste, so much so that the game that comes closest to it is The Settlers by Blue Byte: in-depth economic management of the empire is added some weak strategic features. Expectations were high since the previous Year 1503 had disappointed many fans of the series. The initial stages of the game: a ship, a port and little else The citizens of the village are elated, let's raise taxes now! Set in the lush Caribbean archipelagos of the eighteenth century, Anno 1701 does not include a real campaign - instead there are a dozen scenarios, each with a different story to complete - but leaves the player the freedom to decide any victory conditions (reach as quickly as possible the greatest amount of gold or population, annihilate all opponents and so on). We write ~possible~ because,  la Civilization, it is possible to play games whose sole purpose is to make one's colony progress beyond belief. In any case, the basic resources are standard: you start with a small port, a market and a city center next to which you can build buildings capable of satisfying the primary needs of the population - wood and food. The settlers will quickly begin to ask for more complex goods, such as clothes, for which it will not be enough to build the appropriate shop but also sheep farms. There is a particular modality; which allows you to capture spectacular screenshots like this one Damn, the village is dead. on fire: let's hope the firefighters hurry up! Compared to past editions, the collection of resources has been simplified, even if it is always advisable to keep the various plants under control, ensuring that they operate at full capacity and temporarily closing excess production. In these choices you are helped by the excellent but short tutorial and by the on-screen reports that appear on the buildings that do not work at their best. The updates take place completely automatically: when the degree of well-being achieved by the colony is sufficient, the rough pioneers will turn into settlers and will further expand their basket of needs. The player is given the task of satisfying the wishes of the population by optimizing the limited island spaces. Sooner or later, however, the resources present will no longer be sufficient for the demand of the population and one will be forced to look around for other areas in which to produce otherwise inaccessible goods. The devastating effects of an earthquake... ...and those of an erupting volcano! A fundamental and critical aspect of Anno 1701 comes into play here, represented by the trade routes. We write this not so much for the management of the loading and unloading ports towards which to move the ships, an operation made simple by the intuitive interface developed by the programmers, but rather for the way in which the games are solved. The random map generator in fact prevents the existence of islands in which to produce everything necessary to get to the last stage of updates, so it will be necessary to colonize new ones. Regardless of the type of objective initially set, the spaces available will in the long run be insufficient and the most immediate way to get the better of the adversaries will inevitably turn out to be warfare. Of course, there are diplomatic menus available which unfortunately leave the time they find: it seems in fact that Related Designs has decided to encourage above all battles by sea and on land. The choice, to be honest rather unfortunate (the game rhythms are slow and focused on the economic aspects), reveals its inadequacy for practical action: naval battles are simplistic and the assault on enemy camps is resolved with the usual jumble of men against key buildings. To play against this aspect contributes to the lack of variety of opposing troops and the artificial intelligence of the opponents, not exactly exciting. The multiplayer apparatus, which allows up to four players to challenge each other in LAN or on the Internet, should fill this gap; however, if on the one hand we do not consider Anno 1701 particularly suitable for what are usually quick challenges on the local network, on the other it must be noted that the number of players on the official servers is not very high and, indeed, on more than one occasion we had to give up the desire to compete against other players precisely because of the lack of rivals. The city it is become imposing and people ask for goods more and more; sophisticatedA delightful glimpse of an Aztec map Speaking of technical realization it must be said that the Sunflowers game knows how to be recognized thanks to the splendid animations of the units and the colorful landscapes full of details. There is no shortage of latest generation graphic effects, among which the creation of water obviously stands out, but there are also other spectacular moments such as the eruption of volcanoes or the devastation caused by earthquakes (some of the natural disasters that can activate to make the games more lively). The city it is under siege, luckily the construction of the turrets was well built. snapshot Another spectacular example of a naval attack Graphics and sound (also excellently done, with applause in particular for the dubbing of the characters) are not ends in themselves but help the player focus on the progress of the colony: for example, the statue on the square in the city center will be more o less bright according to the satisfaction of the inhabitants; any discontent about the shortage of tobacco in a certain area of the island will be felt in the form of whining and so on. Unfortunately the hardware requests are not the most modest and to enjoy everything at high resolutions (very useful in this game) a decidedly cutting-edge computer is required. Among other things, during our tests there were some small stability problems that we hope will be resolved by a future patch. The absence of a scenario editor, on whose future release the programmers said they were possible, is not a too obvious flaw thanks to the already mentioned random generator of missions. Year goes mobile That Anno 1701 has a certain style is not difficult to prove, starting from the beautiful cardboard packaging, much more accurate than the anonymous DVD envelopes. Sunflowes has also given enthusiasts the possibility of being informed at all times thanks even to a wap site. The management software saga has already landed on mobile phones with both the 1602 version and the current one, while the release for Nintendo DS is expected in the coming weeks, which as expected will take advantage of the touch-screen. Conclusions With several strings to his bow, Anno 1701 turns out to be the worthy heir to a saga that with the second episode had lost a bit of its edge. The transition to three-dimensional graphics is undoubtedly promoted with excellent marks, even if the requirements could perhaps have been filed. The complex but not complicated economic management of resources is another of the most successful aspects of a title that loses part of its charm by catalyzing the player's efforts on armed clashes - one of the less well-finished aspects. It is to be hoped that future updates will remedy this inconvenience; for the moment the Related Designs game remains one of the few exponents of an endangered genre, thus deserving the recommendation for all fans of the genre. Pros Attention to detail Engaging economic simulation Longevity Cons Some system crashes Poor multiplayer care Combat section too careless For the third episode of the famous Anno series (A.D. in the United States), the German developer / distributor Sunflowers has relied on Related Designs, known up to now for titles of a certain thickness such as No Men's Land and Castle Strike.", "date": "2006-11-30", "grade": null}
