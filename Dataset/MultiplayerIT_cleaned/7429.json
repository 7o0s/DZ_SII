{"name": "The Pinball Arcade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/126175-the-pinball-arcade-ritorno-al-futuro.html", "text": "The golden age of pinball machines is long gone. Where in the second half of the last century it was possible to see them everywhere, nowadays we see nothing but video poker, probably more profitable for those who manage them than the classic coin-op on which pinball machines based their existence. Despite this, the passion of many for this pastime continues to live even now, presenting themselves both in the guise of normal enthusiasts and in those of real enthusiasts, who collect (having sufficient space available) the various versions of the pinball machines that have arrived on the market over the years. Halfway between both categories is The Pinball Arcade, a title that has already arrived on various platforms for some time, but only recently landed on Steam through the Greenlight program, with which the effort of FarSight Studios was given the go-ahead on the digital platform delivery. As you will have understood, it is a game dedicated to pinball machines, presented as free to play, which as good nostalgics we could not fail to try. After all, even the gaming world has never been insensitive to the charm of pinball machines, starting with Pinball Fantasies. After playing quite a few virtual balls, here's our report. The Pinball Arcade revives the myth of pinball machines born in the 50s Free to play? The most attractive promise of The Pinball Arcade is to make available a series of really existing pinball machines, made by the developers thanks to the licensing agreements signed with the various manufacturers. In the packages made available to players, which we will discuss shortly, we also find pinball machines linked to particularly famous brands: this is the case for example of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Elvira, Mistress of Dark and Star Trek: The Next Generation, along with many others taken with both hands from a story that starts from the 50s. With contracts and payments to third parties at stake, despite the formula with which the game is offered, it seems difficult to think of the possibility of seeing a totally free version: the free to play mode in fact allows complete access to only one pinball machine, Tales of the Arabian Nights, which therefore demonstrates all the features offered by the game, which include a series of online leaderboards to keep track of the scores obtained. Precisely on the latter, the fundamental pillar of playing pinball, the limit is set for all the other tables present in the game, playable until a certain amount of points is reached, after which it is necessary to pay to take advantage of the possibility of going further by establishing a new record. If the complete price for the 21 tables that make up the two ~seasons~ is equal to around 30 euros per series, those who do not want to make such an outlay can count on the possibility of purchasing smaller table packs, paying a few euros to buy a small number of pinball machines to be consumed to the core. One more and then I stop The level of addiction aroused by pinball players is perfectly reproduced within The Pinball Arcade. Even if you want to stay with only Tales of the Arabian Nights for life, the game amply demonstrates that it deserves the few minutes to invest to download it, becoming a real drug in case you decide to indulge in some additional purchases. The presence of real pinball machines, then, adds that touch of nostalgia we were talking about at the beginning of the review, allowing old fans to find their favorite tables in digital format, obviously without the need to spend tokens and tokens to have fun. The attention to detail is obsessive for each pinball machine played in the game, described before each game also through a note that summarizes its history. The game takes place quietly both via the keyboard and with the use of the joypad, probably also recommended thanks to the support for force feedback. Only in some cases linked to pinball machines equipped with particularly fast ramps can one encounter a pinch of difficulty in following the ball with one's gaze. The tournament mode in which to take part in online competitions, carried out with the real rules of competitions between pinball players, is particularly awaited for the future.", "date": "2013-12-05", "grade": "8.8"}
