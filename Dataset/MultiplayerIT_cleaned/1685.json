{"name": "Kirby - Nightmare in Dream Land", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kirby-nightmare-in-dream-land_a.html", "text": "An obese vacuum cleaner Kirby is not what he seems. His innocent and likeable air hides some astonishing abilities, in particular the ability to ~aspirate~ objects or the air itself, to transform himself into a small living aerostatic balloon. Its possibilities are many: once an enemy has been sucked in, it can ~spit~ it at another opponent to eliminate both, or simply swallow it. Eating enemies soon turns out to be a fundamental skill, because thanks to it you will be able to use the power of ~copy~ of the character: in fact, by swallowing opponents with peculiar abilities, you will acquire their powers! This means, for example, that swallowing an enemy who launches electric shocks will allow you to do the same, and I assure you that never before have the creatures Kirby will have to deal with are numerous and diverse. Therefore, you really will have dozens and dozens of different possibilities... The other fundamental ability of the character, namely that of becoming a kind of balloon, is equally important, because it allows you to pass levels in which there is the risk of ~fall down~, equipping yourself with an ~improper~ weapon, i.e. the jet of air that you will blow out when you want to ~deflate~. Finally, Kirby can run, throw a low kick (useful for blowing up walls, in some levels) and obviously ~abandon~ the power acquired thanks to the absorption of an enemy, perhaps when this is not needed or there is the possibility to get another one. Variety, take me away... As I wrote previously, Kirby - Nightmare in Dream Land manages to offer some original elements, despite its belonging to the genre of classic platformers. While the ability to acquire dozens of different powers already adds a rare level of variety to the game, the design of the bosses completes the work. You will find yourself facing truly atypical and particular ~final~ enemies, each with its own modus operandi and relative weaknesses to exploit. In this respect, we must applaud the developers, who have really worked with imagination, integrating a respectable technical work with the characters, which is expressed above all in the quality of the settings and in the presence of multiple ~special~ effects. The game's animations are very well done, the levels are quite different from each other and have their own unique features (for example aquatic areas). The enemies, I repeat, are decidedly numerous and varied. The sound of the game defends itself well, even if it doesn't stand out, between nice music and well-made effects. Concluding... If you needed a valid alternative to the various Marios on GBA, while remaining in the context of ~pure~ platformers, Kirby - Nightmare in Dream Land represents an excellent choice. It is a simple and fun title, technically very valid and really nice. The ~linear~ game structure of the various levels is broken up by the presence of a whole series of mini-games, some of which are truly hilarious (one above all: that of the ~samurai~, in which Kirby must attack with the katana as soon as a dot appears exclamation mark on the screen), which allow you to earn extra lives. The possibility of ~copying~ the behavior of numerous enemies, and therefore of acquiring their powers, makes the game very varied and stimulating. Finally, as regards longevity, the number of levels is high enough to keep you busy for a couple of weeks. Which, these days, is perfectly average. Pros: Very nice protagonist Lots of different enemies Very varied, to be a platformer Cons: Obviously, it doesn't boast a great thickness GBA = Platform? Even the stones know by now that the GameBoy Advance is the perfect gaming system for two-dimensional platformers. There are so many available, and this has only made gamers increasingly demanding and attentive to the originality of the various titles. In this panorama, Kirby - Nightmare in Dream Land presents itself as a very well done product, which focuses on the ~visual~ humor of its protagonist and also manages to propose some novelties (which is really not easy, in the context of one of the genres oldest in the history of video games). Let's start from the beginning, namely from the Fountain of Dreams. It is a magical fountain, which holds the hopes and wishes of all living creatures to transform them into dreams. One day, however, the evil King DeDeDe goes to take a bath in the fountain and takes possession of the magic wand, the source of the power of dreams, to break it into pieces and give the remains to his minions. This event causes no one to be able to dream anymore. Kirby, particularly fond of siestas, dedecides to leave to recover the various pieces of the magic wand and defeat King DeDeDe...", "date": "2003-04-14", "grade": null}
