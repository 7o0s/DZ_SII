{"name": "Adam e il Giardino dell'Eden", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/74534-adams-venture-alla-ricerca-del-giardino-perduto-adam-e-il-giardino-delleden.html", "text": "A fearless explorer, a charming damsel and a scholar in the pay of a powerful corporation are the protagonists of an adventure which, in the intentions of the developers (the Dutch team Vertigo Digital Entertainment), should mix intuitive and tested gameplay with historical and obvious references to Christianity. Adam's Venture: In Search of the Lost Garden is really all of this, but those who expect something more than a budget game will be deeply disappointed. The plot is quite simple: Adam Venture and his two companions believe they have found the place where the legendary Garden of Eden is hidden. It is not known what this ~garden~ is, nor exactly where it is located, so the explorer arms himself with dynamite, blows up some rock walls and sets off on an expedition that at first did not seem to include automatic mechanisms, swinging blades, curious ~parking meters~ to interact with and a strange black smoke that hovers menacingly between one cave and another. Toward Adventure... and Beyond! Once the Xbox 360 controller is connected to the PC, the game reveals an immediate and intuitive command system: the left analog stick to move the character in a context relative to the screen, one button to jump, two to interact with the scenario, one to crouch and another (by holding it down) to run. The camera is fixed and is managed automatically, so on the one hand there is room for a little ~direction~, especially when accessing a new section of the map; on the other hand, there is some problem of interpenetration of the polygons, or in any case we find ourselves dealing with a less than ideal view when we need a different angle. In any case, the ~game over~ problem practically does not arise: the writer played a single game which lasted scarce two hours and ended together with the game, encountering some difficulties only during the last puzzle and having to start over from a checkpoint only on a couple of occasions, more for errors induced by boredom than for an actual difficulty of the Vertigo production. The gameplay of Adam's Venture: In Search of the Lost Garden is mostly based on the exploration of the setting, with some jumps and some climbing sessions that are tempered by the presence of simple and always the same puzzles, consisting of ~parking meters~ which we mentioned earlier, with which you have to interact to put a short biblical text made up of three sentences in order. Far too little for an adventure with a simple structure, devoid of any combat, which runs smoothly and without problems throughout its very short duration. Technical realization While using a powerful engine like the Unreal Engine 3, the game doesn't shine for the technical sector and indeed shows the side of more than one defect. The best thing is undoubtedly the scenarios, characterized by a discreet design, good textures and above all by a convincing and atmospheric lighting system, the undisputed protagonist of every scene given the continuous presence of torches that turn on and off depending on the situation, and which distort the shades of any environment. All the rest should be forgotten: the polygonal models are extremely simple and angular, with very woody animation, while the sound sector alternates good music, with an epic air just enough, with a dubbing in Italian which, if you want to be good, could be defined as ~unprofessional~. Tested on the usual Athlon64 X2 5000+ with ATI HD4870, the game ran at 60 fps without problems at 1680 x 1050 pixel resolution, with all effects maxed and v-sync activated, even when the card was downclocked. Xbox 360 controller support turned out to be perfect.", "date": "2010-04-26", "grade": "5.0"}
