Nonetheless, this product made evident the qualities of the Swedish Pixelbite team, which despite having less than 10 elements to its credit has demonstrated both a certain prolificacy and the ability to set up a bigger and better-made following, this time published by the independent publisher Polarbits. Brum brum The backbone of the game, or a structure that organized the races and the progression between them, was ~the great absentee~ within the offer of the first episode; aware of this limit, the Pixelbite guys wanted to protect themselves from any criticism with Reckless Racing 2, offering a large number of modes available to the player. The main ones are career and arcade, which in different ways guarantee a long series of challenges; in the first case these are divided into separate championships, made up of a series of races, by winning which it is possible to obtain cash prizes. Money needed to upgrade your vehicle or buy new, more performing ones, thanks to which you can guarantee the competitiveness necessary to face the most demanding competitions. A structure without particular peaks of originality therefore, but still engaging and equipped with the right level of challenge to stimulate the player to continue in his career as a driver. In this sense, the dynamic difficulty level appears to be appreciable, which adapts to the player's abilities and results. The arcade mode is different, in which you have to complete 40 single challenges with different cars and objectives. There is also an online multiplayer, even if in this sense the reduced experience or simply the limited resources of the Swedish team have given life to an offer that is too rarefied and essential, with limits that prevent you from fully appreciating the potential. If the first chapter sinned in the amount of irons in the fire, it certainly stood out for the driving model offered, yes immediate but also extremely satisfying and rather challenging to master at best. Pixelbite has therefore wisely chosen not to distort this element, maintaining aspects such as the management of physics and the inertia of the cars responding to the different types of terrain on which they are forced to pass. Hence, for example, crossing asphalt rather than dirt becomes completely different in terms of feedback and response from the vehicle, with large drifts to be controlled by carefully managing the steering and throttle. The standard control mode - and from our point of view the best - sees the use of the classic virtual keys on the screen, but there are several alternatives including the one that relies on the accelerometer to steer, thus allowing you to adapt to the tastes of any user . Such a good and fun driving model necessarily requires a track design of the same level to be able to express itself at its best. Fortunately in Reckless Racing 2 this element also enjoyed the care of the developers; while lacking a bit of variety in the settings, the quantity and quality of the tracks is almost impeccable, and the vertical development of some of them adds dynamism to the whole. Finally, as regards the technical component, played on an iPad 2 Reckless Racing 2 offers a more than pleasant show; albeit with a less peculiar and characteristic style than the first chapter, Pixelbite's work still guarantees a remarkable glance, thanks above all to a high level of detail and a convincing use of colors.
