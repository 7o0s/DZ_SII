A title that tried to place itself halfway between the scripted Call of Duty experience and something potentially more emotional for the player who could remember what he felt playing Half-Life 2 or the first BioShock. The result was Metro 2033, a project that divided audiences and critics in half between those who raised it to a cult to be played in one go thanks to its claustrophobic atmosphere and above-average plot and those who instead rejected it as a failed experiment for obvious flaws in the gameplay that mainly involved the shooter mechanics. Today it's time to talk about the sequel, Metro: Last Light which not only marks the developer's debut on PlayStation 3, alongside the PC and Xbox 360 versions but also the almost total departure from the original story told in Dmitry Glukhovsky's books . In fact, the new work by 4A Games continues the story of the original protagonist of Metro 2033, taking paths and narrative insights that very rarely touch what is told in the books of the Russian writer. The direct sequel A year has passed since the events told in Metro 2033. You are still Artyom, the new hero of the Moscow Metro: you have defeated the Dark, mysterious and ruthless telepathic creatures that arose from the ashes of the nuclear bombing that risked extinguishing humanity, and you've got your hands on bunker D6, a rich cache of weapons and food that could forever change the balance between the forces living in the underground tunnels of the Russian capital. Suddenly you realize that having exterminated this new breed of living beings has instilled more than one doubt in your brain and your life begins to be overwhelmed by the nightmares of a past that almost no longer belongs to you, linked to decisions you have made by instinct and without due reasoning. Metro: Last Light opens with the shocking news of one last surviving Tetro, a child, and your joining a small expedition to find and kill him. Or save it to try to figure out what's really going on in a rapidly changing world. As mentioned on several occasions, this new chapter in the series fits perfectly into the concept of ~more of the same~. It is a direct sequel and continues the events told in Metro 2033 with precision: the protagonist is the same, sometimes you will even meet some old acquaintances and the entire ecosystem of the Moscow metro respects and is consistent with what has already been seen in the past. Even the various factions fighting for the domination of the tunnels are the same even if this time their functioning is explored in greater depth and it is always very evident how fragile the balance between the parties is. The Empire, the Reds, the Spartans of Polis and a new addition to the group, Venice, live in the same narrow spaces, separated by a few metro stations: there will be alliances, betrayals and espionage to give vigor to the story told and above all it is well evident how much the departure from the narrative canvases of Glukhovsky's books has done the developer good who, being able to move more freely with the story, has managed to bring a drier and more pleasant narrative to the screen. Sometimes, perhaps, too much in the background, but certainly appreciable for the ability to tell a coherent story and above all with a narrative arc capable of captivating the player and making him feel like the true protagonist of events that he will not always be able to control and which will reach a epilogue capable of concluding with great enthusiasm what began with Metro 2033. Last Light is growing: it starts slow and cumbersome but becomes engaging and even exhilarating at times to end in a way that will certainly satisfy those who are in love with the series, without at the same time leaving players who do not know the saga too displaced. that the constant use of flashbacks and the stories of non-player characters are able to adequately understand what happened previously. The writer took just under 11 hours to finish the game on the normal difficulty level. It is a quantity of hours above the average of the latest productions but it must always be remembered that Metro: Last Light is an exclusively single player title, whose replayability rate is linked to the desire to experiment with higher difficulty levels (there are three in everything) or to collect the only collectible scattered throughout the game chapters (not too difficult to find): a series of notebooks that delve into Artyom's assessments of the vicissitudesde who is living. Then there is the Ranger mode, which comes as a gift for those who have pre-ordered the title and represents the sum of the wishes of the true hardcore player: the total lack of on-screen interface and a very limited availability of in-game ammunition. A simple shooter? Going into gameplay detail, Metro: Last Light is also a first-person shooter that focuses entirely on the atmosphere and great physicality in performing the various game actions. There is basically a survival horror flavor given that for most of the game ammunition is scarce (although it must be recognized that compared to the previous chapter, here the difficulty has been calibrated downwards) and on many occasions the darkness, claustrophobia and a generalized anguish will make you go through the tunnels with your heart pounding and with bated breath, always ready for the sudden appearance of a monster or some element positioned by the developers with the sole aim of terrorizing you. Once again, great attention has been paid to stealth and to moments of relative calm in which we will find ourselves crossing the human outposts and the various capitals of the metropolitan factions. But let's go in order and start right from stealth. In fact, a large part of the Last Light adventure can be tackled by avoiding killing enemy soldiers or simply not triggering alarms capable of putting enemy bases in turmoil. The title meets the player thanks to a level design that seems to push a lot on the micro-exploration of shortcuts and ravines that can allow Artyom to act undisturbed in the shadows and, thanks to a small indicator on the clock, it is possible to see at a glance keep an eye out if you are hidden from the enemy or illuminated by some light. Planning your action in these moments will be essential, as will moving forward by turning off light bulbs and using only silenced weapons or melee rounds. Compared to Metro 2033, however, these sequences are less imposed by the developers, to the point that you can practically avoid killing human enemies and there will also be some levels in which it will be possible to get around even those mutated by radiation, avoiding direct clashes with them too. Unfortunately, however, as also happened with the predecessor, there are some structural defects that undermine the perfect success of this game component. First of all, the stealth mechanics are really bare bones in terms of interaction with the enemy: you just need to be in the shadows and the opponent simply cannot see you even if you are a few centimeters from his face. Sometimes it is not even clear whether the title takes into account the sound of footsteps since on many occasions we happened to run towards the enemy to stun him with a close-up shot without him even noticing the noise caused by our footsteps. Furthermore, it is still not possible to move the bodies of knocked out enemies with the result that perhaps if you kill an enemy in bright light and then continue through the level and unfortunately some patrol passes by, you will find yourself with a nice alarm triggered without being able to do anything about it, except to restart the entire level. Yes, you read that right, even on PC, Metro: Last Light continues to have an automatic save system which in some conditions can be quite frustrating since it is activated in the most disparate moments and sometimes just when the enemy catches us red-handed, making us entering the loop of a practically useless upload, unless you decide to go ahead with guns blazing. But the main flaw of the whole project is undoubtedly the artificial intelligence which continues to remain truly basic. Enemy soldiers simply follow their patrols, enter an attention routine for a few seconds if they see you in the dark, and fully activate if they encounter a dead comrade or see you shot. At that point they do their utmost in convulsive movements passing from one cover to another without ever proving to be truly dangerous since they never tend to get close to your position and practically do not know the existence of throwing weapons. This gets slightly more complex in advanced levels, when the enemy is heavily armored, but only because it becomes more difficult to take him out in open combat. Without wanting to rage too much, the matter gets worse when fighting mutated enemies. In this case, in fact, the behavior is always the same regardless of the opponent: since all the monsters have only a melee attack, they will attack you without worrying about anything else. And strictly in a straight line. The lack of un incisive feedback of the shots of the weapons does not help in this sense and seems to remain a deficit of the Russian developer but certainly there are some improvements in this sense compared to the previous title. This is my stop, thank you But the highlight of the whole gaming experience, as was the case with its predecessor, is the great impact of the world recreated by 4A Games which seems to exude an attention to detail that we have hardly seen even in the most famous productions. When the shooter phase is put aside and we find ourselves exploring the well-sheltered human outposts full of ~normal~ life, the game levels up. The imagery recreated on the screen is in fact very fascinating and extremely consistent in the differences between the various factions. We will pass in a few hours from the dictatorial rallies of the Empire, complete with a Roman salute, to the disruptive degradation of the red line, where no one is truly poor but everything is under the banner of military strength. Not to mention the wonderful life of Venice among its canals populated by fishing boats and a traveling boat full of musicians. Too bad, however, that everything is a simple and splendid nativity scene: the interaction is limited only to the elements connected to the story and to the buying and selling of weapons and ammunition and in Artyom's shoes we will limit ourselves to crossing the streets and tunnels of these protected areas waiting for reach the access area for the continuation of our adventure. More generally, the entire experience of Metro: Last Light is characterized by maximum linearity. Not that this is an absolute evil but it is essential that it is clear that what was said on the occasion of Metro 2033 also applies to this chapter: in the game, exploration is reduced to the bone and, as any Call of Duty teaches, history and the action goes on well scripted binaries set up by the developer. This time there are certainly more outdoor sections, among the streets of a spectral and desolate Moscow, but even in these situations, even if the visual horizon opens up a lot, the practicable areas are always well delimited and the player will have to limit himself to managing the weapon that he holds in the best possible way while with his eyes he looks around marveling at the universe created by 4A Games. And since we talked about weapons and ammunition above, let's also address this aspect of the game. Last Light implements a very particular economy system. Everything revolves around the pre-nuclear conflict military ammunition that the player will rarely be able to collect and which serve both as a bargaining chip and as a temporary upgrade of the game weapons, as they can be mounted in place of normal ammunition. In the various camps we will be able to talk to some vendors to stock up on ammunition and above all to buy or sell weapons. Artyom will be able to carry three of any type at the same time, he will obviously be able to collect them from killed or stunned enemies and, compared to Metro 2033, it will also be possible to do his utmost in customizing the paraphernalia by purchasing and equipping various types of sights, silencers or barrel extensions and modifications to the stock or to the basic functions of the weapon to perhaps make it less subject to recoil or to avoid the loss of pressure of pneumatic weapons. The system seems to meet the player's needs and fighting style very much and offers a great variety, it is a pity that there is still some difficulty in understanding at a glance the type of gun left on the ground by the enemy given that the icons appear on the screen, especially when the weapons begin to be enriched with the various upgrades, they are not easily distinguishable from each other and often we find ourselves picking them up just to see which weapon it is. There are also secondary offense objects, the same ones already seen in the previous chapter: a normal grenade, an incendiary, throwing knives to kill silently from a distance and a type of proximity mine to create very rudimentary traps. Physical, physical, I wanna get physical! Metro: Last Light perfectly respects what has now become a characteristic trait of the franchise: the physicality of the protagonist's actions recreated on the screen. We are not just talking about the reloading of weapons or the exceptional first-person animations but about all those elements of interaction with the scenario and above all with the equipment which, together with the truly minimal game interface, help to increase the sense of identification experienced by the player.
