Of course, the initial impression may be that of a mere commercial operation, furthermore aggravated by certain crossovers that frankly seem to have little sense, but the study behind the various ~Lego something~ has proven to be much deeper than a simple jumble of brands that are sure to appeal. It comes to re-evaluate the entire tie-in sector, in a certain sense, proposing reinterpretations of cinematic successes which, abandoning the pretense of realism and the aping of filmic experiences in videogames, restart from the playful base by bending the graphic and extra-playful superstructure to his needs. We always keep in mind that these are products suitable for an exquisitely young audience, but even starting from this assumption it is not easy not to be captivated by the immediacy and carefree fun that characterizes Lego video games, which are also distinguished by a somewhat stratified structure: within each world there are numerous side activities to carry out, as well as bonuses and secondary objectives to be achieved, determining different levels of use. The less observant player or small child can enjoy simply wandering through the rooms of Hogwarts or the streets of the magical world of Harry Potter, but the older ones, or already a little more experienced users, will probably want to complete the main objectives and solve the many side-by-side puzzles, as well as collect as many bonuses as possible scattered around the locations. The result is a video game that is certainly simple and aimed at children, but which can appeal to large sections of the public, with the possibility granted to the second player to enter and exit the game at any time which seems to be perfectly designed to facilitate the entry of the parent or of a friend alongside the main character. At magic school The characterizing element of this Lego-based video game, compared to the others released so far, is obviously the presence of magic. Where in Lego Indiana Jones or Lego Star Wars the interaction with the scenarios took place through a not excessively large number of different methods, here the possibility of drawing the wand and casting the spells completely changes the cards on the table. Furthermore, representing in one fell swoop the first four years of Harry Potter's magical experience, we are also witnessing a progressive evolution of the main characters, who alternate active missions with lessons and parts of the game aimed at learning new spells, adding a sort of element RPG to normal structure. The Harry Potter (or Hermione or Ron or whoever else, there are many usable and interchangeable characters) of the first levels, in short, able to use only the levitation spell or that of ~enlightenment~, has the possibility of interacting with the scenarios very different from those of Harry Potter (or whoever) of a more advanced state of the game, who with his arsenal of magical arts can change the surrounding environment and defend or attack in numerous ways. Fundamental spells are learned at the school of magic, usually by completing missions that directly involve them, while many secondary spells can simply be purchased by spending the Lego coins collected for the levels. The magical effects often involve the movement and interlocking of typical Lego blocks or objects, which also behave (for example with the use of levitation) with a convincing physical simulation that affects the way the elements interlock and the solidity of the structures thus created. The various powers can be easily scrolled within the classic radial arrangement and selected at any time: the objects are automatically highlighted when they react in a particular way to certain spells, but it is also possible to point the wand directly at the various elements of the scenario and see the various effects that spells have on them, often solving minor puzzles and scraping together a few more coins. Also present in this chapter is the typical element of the series, namely the possibility of playing multiplayer in the company of a second player with a practical ~drop-in drop-out~ system, but a fundamental novelty has been introduced here. The introduction of the retractable split screen allows greater freedom of movement for both players, who no longer find themselves stuck at the edges of the screen in the event that the distance betweentwo become excessive. A bizarre blocky world The game world is obviously based on the first books in the Harry Potter series, specifically Hogwarts and its surroundings with some ~city~ locations used as access zones for various options. The picturesque Diagon Alley is a sort of hub from which you can access various shops where you can buy spells, clothes and accessories (all unlockable by spending coins) as well as providing direct access to Hogwarts through the Black Couldron, from which you can also select previously played levels or review cutscenes. The levels mostly take place in the school of magic or its picturesque surroundings and re-propose some of the events and topical encounters/clashes of the history of Harry Potter, obviously revised in the typical humorous and light-hearted key that distinguishes Lego-branded productions. The effect of the silent interlude skits is perhaps less hilarious than that caused by seeing the historical scenes of Indiana Jones or Star Wars redone with Lego men, but above all the younger ones will be able to perfectly grasp the quotes and will laugh heartily. Hogwarts on the other hand is in itself a vast complex world that expands as the game progresses and as the powers of the protagonists increase, who will gradually be able to access new sections of the castle: the passage to the different locations in fact often depends on the resolution of puzzles, most often related to paintings. As in the film, the numerous portraits hanging on the walls are ~inhabited~ by somewhat alive figures, who in this case require particular actions to be convinced to let you access the various areas, which represents an interesting ploy to insert magic-based puzzles even just to move from one place to another. The story follows quite closely the events of the first books in the series, complete with clashes with various historical enemies of Harry Potter. The combat, the usual sore point of Lego productions, is not fully convincing, showing itself as rather approximate and with a very low level of challenge both as regards minor enemies and the ~bosses~, leaving the role of keeping the interest high above all to the puzzle component of the player. Another persistent problem is represented by the rather imprecise controls that often lead us to fail jumps or fall from the platforms, defects that do not seem to want to be remedied by TT Games which seems to propose the same control system in each new chapter. Hogwarts, for its part, is an extremely lively place and there are many things to do inside it, with characters looking for help for the most disparate reasons and puzzles of various types to be solved to earn points or open certain locked doors, in this way a united and well-blended environment is created where the magic dwells in every screen and where essentially in every room we find many different things to do, as well as being able to freely follow different paths and expand the game map in a not necessarily linear way as happened with previous Lego chapters. Xbox 360 goals The amount of things to do is not fully reflected in the number of unlockable achievements, here less abundant than in other Xbox 360 titles. 35 achievements for a total of 1000 points are still a good challenge, especially for the younger ones. As usual, there are those that can be unlocked simply by continuing through the levels and those that require a deeper commitment. Cubitism The graphic representation obviously takes up the well-established iconography of the Lego series, proposing a reproduction of the world of Harry Potter mediated through the typical elements of Danish toys. In addition to the ~little men~ with a round head and hooked hands, we therefore find all those interlocking elements and those stylized reproductions of common objects that probably populated the childhood of a large part of gamers. While not shining for cutting-edge technical solutions, Lego Harry Potter does its duty well, confirming the care taken by Traveller's Tales in these productions, even if aimed at a presumably young audience. The greater uniformity of the setting, largely based on the Hogwarts castle, makes a certain recurrence of the graphic elements inevitable, which due to scenarios and chromatic choices make the entire graphic system perhaps less flamboyant than that characteristic of Lego Indiana Jones, for example example, but these are decidedly different starting points, based on different scenarios and entire imaginary universes. What Traveller's Tales has perfectly managed is to reproduce the magical world of Harry Potter even in this strange form, creating settings that are teeming with life and places to exploreplay several times to be able to discover everything possible by progressively exploiting the new acquired powers. Therefore, it is not just a question of levels placed one after the other, but of a vast, somewhat persistent setting from which it is possible to access various sections of the game, which evolves and is discovered progressively with the evolution of the story and of the characters. The musical accompaniment is obviously based on the typical themes of the film series, with excellent instrumental pieces. There are no particular steps forward from a technical point of view, but the abundant use of magic, colored explosions and particular events justifies a wider use of light sources and particle effects which, compared to other chapters of the Lego series, are here more convincing.", "date": "2010-07-06", "grade": "8.0"}
