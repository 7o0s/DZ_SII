{"name": "Max Payne", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/max-payne-violenza-sangue-e-pallottole.html", "text": "Power is nothing without control. The originality of Max Payne, compared to the third-person titles of its competitors, however, is not reduced to the cutscenes but can be felt throughout the game and, above all, in the character control system. Our electronic alter ego responds very well to the commands that are given to it and the response to our inputs is rarely fluid and immediate. A separate comment must be spent regarding the ~Bullet-Time~ mode; implemented for the first time in the graphics engine that powers this game, it will give us the possibility of performing incredible actions, both visually and athletically, defying every law of gravity. By pressing the right mouse button we will see Max Payne and the whole environment that surrounds him move in slow motion effect mode that will allow us to make, for example, long slowed jumps while we unload the magazines of our weapons on our enemies. it is not possible to explain in words the visual impact and the sensations that moving in this mode gives, you can have an idea of what you can experience if you have seen the film ~The Matrix~; through the ~Bullet-Time~ you can in fact emulate the movements that made the actions of Trinity and Neo extraordinary. When I saw this title for the first time at E3, I was afraid that the use of this mode could get boring quickly or become too invasive in the frenzy of the actions, but I must say that I was pleasantly denied by what I tried first hand. The slow-motion effect is used by the user only when needed to overcome difficult and complicated situations also because only ten seconds of bullet-time are made available to us, which can only be recovered by eliminating our enemies. This handful of seconds will gradually become more and more important because, if in the first chapters of the game we will almost never run out of ~time~, as the plot progresses the situations in which the use of slow-motion will be very useful will increase and it will become really important use bullet-time sparingly. Alone against all. Returning to talk about the plot, after the initial introduction, we find Mr. Payne inside one of the dirtiest and most dangerous mafia clubs in the city, ready to destroy everything and everyone in order to avenge his family. It is here that the event takes place that leads our alter ego to desperation and a homicidal fury... our friend and head of the DEA Alex Balder is assassinated by a hitman sent by criminal organizations. In addition to the desperation given by the loss of the last person dear to us on the face of the planet, our soul is also overwhelmed by a deep sense of fear as, from this point on, we will also have to deal with the police who, convinced of our responsibility in Balder's death and our involvement in the dealing of Valkir, he will try in every way to put us in the dark. Since the head of the DEA is the only one who knows of our true identity as a policeman, we will in fact have no possibility of asserting our reasons before the forces of order and we will thus find ourselves hunted down both by the guardians of the law and by the mafia who , seeing us by now as lonely and finite men, will decide to do everything to eliminate us from circulation. Hunted by all and kept alive only by the desire for revenge, Max Payne will simulate his disappearance and will throw himself into a fight without quarter aimed at the physical elimination of the underworld and the corruption present in the police. To perpetuate our thirst for revenge we will have only our skill with weapons, our cold blood and a respectable arsenal. The game programmers have done an excellent job of reproducing the weapons both in terms of their physical representation and the ~mechanical~ aspects related to their functioning (reloading, number of shots...). The only flaw is given by the imperfect representation of the range of our paraphernalia which will see us, for example, owners of shotguns able to cover, with their firepower, somewhat exaggerated distances. By eliminating our enemies we will be able to come into possession of numerous instruments of death which will range from the classic pistol (usable both individually and in pairs) passing through the shotgun and the shotgun up to machine guns, bombs and Molotov cocktails. A particular note must be spent on the sniper rifle which will allow us, once we have framed our target and fired the shot, to follow the trajectory of the same in first person by observing the entire flight of the bullet from the mouth of the fire.or up to the body of the victim on duty. Nothing is created, everything is destroyed. Thanks to the arsenal that we will be able to carry with us, we will be able to face any kind of danger by spreading ~terror and devastation~ among the ranks of criminals who will try to stop our path. In addition to the enemies that will appear in front of us, we will also be able to vent our instincts of destruction on almost all the objects that we will encounter in the various locations of the game as the programmers have given the player the possibility to disassemble and interact with a good 80% of the elements present in the levels. We will then be able to take cans from soda dispensers, shoot them by seeing them spray liquid, open water taps, break television monitors and bottles, etc. All this interactivity obviously greatly increases the fun of the game even if, for reasons unknown to me (perhaps related to implementation problems), the programmers have decided not to give total interaction with the environment... we will in fact be faced with indestructible crates, chairs that splinter but do not break, fire extinguishers and gas cylinders that do not explode, etc. Despite this, I can still say that it's been a really long time since I've seen interactivity at such a high level as the one provided in this game (beautiful, for example, the effect of the glass tables that break when objects fall on them lean on). Speaking of ~destruction~ a separate note must be spent on the management of the solid surfaces that we will be able to hit. Depending on the material on which our shots will impact, we will have different effects: the wood will splinter, the tiles will break, the metal will be dented and the bullets instead of getting stuck will fall to the ground, the plasterboard, in addition to getting pierced, will produce the fall of sand ... all to give an effect of realism that settles on really high levels. 4 walls between us and revenge... The walls and walls on which we will leave the sign of our passage will form the environment in which we will have to guide Mr. Payne, an environment that reproduces the real one in a truly excellent way. The programmers claim to have spent a lot of time reconstructing the scenarios by going firsthand to the locations they had set out to reconstruct, photographing them and using the photos themselves to recreate the materials, colors and lights that they had been able to see in person (it is said even visits to the lower neighborhoods of New York with the support of bodyguards). All this work is noticeable and the amount of detail that we will be able to find in banks, hotels, streets and subway stations helps to increase the degree of realism of the whole. While there is nothing to complain about as regards the architecture of the scenarios, some flaws can be noted in the management of lights and shadows, sometimes in fact we find ourselves faced with unrealistically fixed and ~consistent~ light beams (as if there was in the open space) and the shadows left by objects and characters in the game are reduced to simple and small patches. In general, however, also given the high level of workmanship of the textures used, we can safely say that the scenario in which we will move our steps is really well done. Max Payne is therefore a graphically almost perfect game, free from flaws? We would like to answer yes to this question but it is not possible. Perfection is lacking when it comes to analyzing the movements and features of the characters, especially in the cutscenes made with the game engine (not many to tell the truth). Often both Max Payne and his enemies move in a ~woody~ way and on more than one occasion (especially when reloading some weapons) a strange and unnatural disarticulation of the arms with respect to the rest of the body is noticed which suggests an animation separate from the rest of the figure. Another flaw (if it can be defined that way) that can be noticed is given by the faces and facial expressions of the characters. Precisely ~because~ of the excellent workmanship but static nature of the textures used, we will often have the impression of being faced with wax mannequins and not with real individuals. In the entirety of the game this does not impact the fun, but obviously the eye is not positively impressed. Alone against all, the end is near The question that arises spontaneously in the face of all this graphics, quantity of details and special effects is simple: which PC will you need to make Max Payne work decently? The answer is obvious. The minimum configuration (that is, to play with minimum graphic detail) consists of an Intel Pentiu processorm II 450 MHz/AMD, 96 MB RAM and Graphics Card with 16 MB Direct3D; while to be able to take advantage of a greater (but not maximum) level of detail, one must have an Intel Pentium III 700 MHz/AMD Processor, 128 MB RAM and a 32 MB Direct3D graphics card. Personally I would recommend (to enjoy all the details at a resolution of 1280*1024) a 1Ghz processor (better if AMD say the developers), 128Mb of ram and a second generation Geforce. The hardware requests are therefore quite high, but it must be taken into account that by working a little on the texture and detail settings, excellent compromises can be reached (for example, eliminating the option that makes every single fired shell or empty magazine remain on the ground already gain speed). In addition to the issue related to the hardware needed to play, another doubt that may arise is the one related to the fact that this title, being aimed solely at the single player experience in an era where everything tends to have an outlet on the web, risks being monotonous and short-lived. Surely if there had been the possibility of challenging flesh-and-blood characters, the fun would have been total (also because the AI of the enemies does not always shine for effectiveness) but given the good plot of the adventure and the considerable length of the product (we will have to face 4 chapters divided into 9 missions each) we can certainly say that the fun will not be lacking. A further point in favor, linked to the duration of this game within our PCs, is given by the presence of 3 level editors created by the programmers: MaxED, ActorFx and ParticleFX, these utilities will allow us to create in a very simple way (we speak of an intuitive ~point and click~) scenarios, situations and levels to play on our computer or exchange via the web. In addition to the possibility of building new levels, we point out the further incentives that are given to the player to finish the game and start it all over again. Once the title is finished, you will be able to use new weapons not previously present in the inventory, set different levels of difficulty (in fact, the game initially does not provide for the selection of a difficulty level as it is automatically selected as you continue in the game ... the better you are and the less you die the harder it becomes to continue), or play as a character other than Max Payne. In conclusion we can say that the requirements to make Max Payne one of the best games of the year are all there, starting from the spectacular ways of managing the character through the ~Bullet-Time~ passing through the interesting plot up to the endowment of numerous editors. If we then consider the aggressive selling price that the product will have in stores (around 60,000) the way to ensure that Max Payne is remembered as one of the best single-players on the market is really open... hoping that the high hardware demands and the lack of multiplayer don't take over. Oops, among all the things that there were to say I forgot one that is certainly very important... the game will be totally (spoken, written and manual) localized in Italian. ArchaOn in a box... Max Payne is one of those titles that, even after hours of intensive play, leave you in the grip of that peculiar eagerness to get your hands on it again, a symptom of the presence of a worthy blockbuster. Since it is superfluous to continue praising its technical aspects, I will dedicate this box to the various reasons why this title should not be missing in the collection of any good old singleplay connoisseur. First, some considerations on gameplay. Max Payne is indeed a third-person arcade, but the numerous innovative features (first of all the fantastic bullet-time option) constitute as many powerful injections of gameplay, in a genre that after countless Tomb Raiders seemed to have ~settled~. Furthermore, the quality of the plot and the constant gloomy atmosphere, worthy of the slums of the Big Apple, go well with the figure of the protagonist, who embodies the myth of the lonely avenger of Hollywood action films (and in terms of camera management and ~ direction~ of the firefights, the references to the Matrix abound). A final consideration deserves the price at which this popo of videogame goodies will be sold. If we have become accustomed to spending even more than 100,000 lire for a new release, thanks to Cidiverte's convincing policy, it is already possible to book the game at numerous online retailers at a truly competitive price. Signed, Archaon Baldus in a box... It amazes. ~Max Payne~ amazes. Graphics: beautiful, powerful, greedy engine i", "date": "2001-07-25", "grade": null}
