{"name": "Silenzio: parla Fifa 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silenzio-parla-fifa-2002.html", "text": "Preface This new chapter of FIFA marks the third evolution of the new generation (started in 2000). The very small players in immense meadows that characterized the old series are now a distant memory: a sudden graphic change led, in 2000, to perhaps a little more cartoonish detail but tending, over the years, to absolute realism. Never like this year has FIFA created in me a sense of incredible schematization. Accustomed to reviews that accompany the reader through explanatory matches (like last year), this time FIFA 2002 brought with it such important innovations as to immediately put me in the shoes of the financier who puts things done well on one side and on the other from the bad ones. Bad bad... So let's start with the negatives. Anyone who knows the now long series of EA Sports knows what the problems that afflict this game could be. Anyone who has already bought it, owner or not of the old ~versions~, will already know what I'm about to talk about. The problem is that the defects of this game cannot be assessed ~subjectively~, but are unquestionably real errors, actually present in the game and which have no justification. Let's talk about automatisms, for example. FIFA 2000 and 2001 were a concentration of automatism (I'm referring to these games because they are still quite recent): the player's movement is the result more of pre-rendered animations than of the incessant pressing of the arrow keys. In FIFA 2002 there is actually a clear improvement. But not quite. For example, why when a player catches a ball bouncing towards the lateral foul, doesn't he stop it with his foot (even if he makes a mistake, why not) but pushes it with his chest, with the result of throwing him off the pitch? Why does the player who receives the ball start running (with the ball at his foot) further back for about ten meters, instead of stopping immediately, when making a high pass backwards? The automatic problem has disintegrated the FIFA series, let's be honest. The absolute search for perfection in the field of animation has deeply damaged the passion that a player feels when the selected footballer does exactly what the player wants him to do. If, as mentioned, there have been improvements (we will see the merits later), these uselessness still remains (and inexplicably) which not only make the player less involved, but which will certainly have made the animators waste useless time 3D of the EA. Bad bad... It's not over. If before the problem of automatism was a player who did ~more~ stuff than what was asked of him, now the opposite also happens: in opposing goal kicks, my selected player often remains nailed to his place (despite the up button is well pressed), while the opposing defenders move towards midfield. Result: my striker remains offside and I am forced to delay any attacking actions after the opponent's goalkeeper has dropped in. This one that follows is truly exhilarating: when an opposing attacker makes a long ball, and I am marking the player who has to receive the ball, sometimes my player inexplicably slows down (while pressing the run button): looking closely at the monitor, I see clearly he's trotting happily looking in the air at the balloon flying far above his head! Result: whoever I was marking receives the ball and, alone, flies towards the goal. Sometimes even worse situations happen, for example caused by headers: from this year it's not enough to simply press the shoot button to let the CPU decide which operation (between kick and header) is better to perform; now to hit the head you have to hold down the shot button until you make contact with the ball. The problem is in the previously mentioned opponents' long balls: you press the key to hit the header (as soon as possible because the sooner you press the more chances there are of hitting him, word in the manual) and the selected player suddenly he stops (while pressing the direction key, and on my keyboard there are no conflicts), while the opponent, for a change, flies towards the goal. ...and still bad? Unfortunately these positions taken by the CPU, this year, have not only affected the poor and unaware (but not so much) player: the cameraman also seems to have been affected by this misfortune. It happens with incredible frequency, in fact, that long and fast passages suddenly disappear from view of the camera. Was my passage successful? Who knowsto'. It is discovered only after a couple of seconds, when the camera resumes the rhythm and returns to the ball (obviously already in the hands of the opponents). Better to change the subject, while remaining on the subject of negativity. We could now speak of ~frequency~. Some episodes, in fact, happen with a really excessive frequency. For example the posts and passes on the offside edge. If the former were a peculiarity already present in past years (persevere...), the latter seem to be a real innovation in FIFA 2002, which has caused quite a few controversies in the community of players: last year the use of defensive schemes, which allowed to increase the marking on the opposing player with the ball and to carry out the offside trap. This year these schemes have disappeared, and defenders have totally unlearned offside: at least one goal out of two is scored and conceded due to passes on the edge of offside. And the great thing is that offsides practically never happen. Excessive skill of the attackers or excessive stupidity of the defense? Even the tiredness hasn't changed compared to the latest versions. I was really happy when, with FIFA 99, an additional difficulty element was introduced with the inclusion of fatigue. After a while, depending on the state of the players, they started drooling on the field in convulsions (ok, I'm exaggerating, but that's the point), forcing me to carefully manage the substitutions. Starting from FIFA 2000 the fatigue has remained, but the players have become super-men. Perhaps excessively exalted by the effects on the body caused by nandrolone and similar, for those of EA fatigue no longer makes sense, and changes due to fatigue have no reason to exist. Also for this reason the button for clicks and runs (W) is constantly pressed... iwo orwmaiw nownw mwi accowrwgow diw prewmwerlow swemprew... ...and still bad? Be that as it may, let's conclude this long and sad negative side with just a couple of annotations. Bugs are a concept that, fortunately, is not very ingrained in the FIFA series. This year however, (there was no need to), there was a curious case of buggite, verifiable to the human eye: there are documented relaunches that take the planet earth's tangent (at speeds close to those of light ) or provisions in the field entrusted more to chance than to the formations actually designated. Finally, the comment by Bulgarelli-Caputi. Go for the first year, it must have been the excitement. Go for the latter, it must have been some influence. Go for the third, the fourth... in short, after a while you can't stand the laughter ~alla Bolognese~ for Bulgarelli's Balanzone acting and ~Mister Hypocrisy~ for Caputi's kindergarten comments.. . Enough! This year not only hasn't there been the slightest improvement, but we've even gone back! Comments on a particular action that were ~at least punctual~ last year and the previous year are now hopelessly made when the game has meanwhile swung the other way. Caputi's comments became so witty that I had to put buckets under my legs due to the huge amount of milk in my knees. Bulgarelli's acting has really reached the limit: it gives the same emotions as a terracotta saucer. Fortunately no! Did FIFA 2002 really hit rock bottom? Fortunately no. If most of the problems listed above, in fact, are a copy of those already seen in the previous chapters, there are some innovations that have really made the purists of ~videogame~ football nod. In previous years it was necessary to use as many fingers as possible to discard the opponents (with acrobatics that even Van Damme envies): this year we have sought greater realism, introducing an incredibly simpler and equally effective dribbling system. Let me explain: now to discard the opponents it is necessary to play with leaps forward, sudden reversals, accurate circumventions... and all thanks simply to the cursor keys. No more sprained fingers pressing twenty-two keys simultaneously with eight fingers, but simple up/down/right/left, with careful attention to maintain control of the ball, and with realistic ability to jump the opponent. This also introduces a considerable complexity of the game, effectively, where to get rid of a player you can no longer perform some somersaults as in previous years, but it is necessary to go around it or... make a nice triangulation. Fortunately no! This last one is a fascinating new onemust be characteristic of the game: now that the passes (I'll talk about them shortly) have become more complex and articulated, the triangulation, which can be performed by pressing the Space Bar, facilitates and at the same time makes the game action exciting. Passing, as mentioned, is in any case the true revolution of FIFA 2002. Now to pass the ball it is necessary to carefully calibrate the power of the shot: using a bar at the bottom and holding down the pass button, you can set the power of the itself, risking obvious errors of evaluation. In short, they are equal to shots on goal, in fact they too have the power to ~calibrate~. Changing the subject: to facilitate the task for newbies and those who consider tactics superfluous, the assistant coach has been introduced: the CPU will replace injured players (subject to confirmation) without having to go looking for the right player in the right place . Other interesting new features are the automatic saving of games and an interesting ~rewards~ mode, which unlocks important tournaments by winning others. There is also a very large group of teams. Thanks to an endless series of licenses, in fact, FIFA 2002 includes hundreds of local and national teams. Too bad that even big teams, like Holland, have players called No1, No2, No3... A middle? There is also an ~ambiguous~ side, which allows us to glimpse improvements but whose road to take to conquer the ~solution~ is not yet finished. For example, I'm referring to game balance: if the previous FIFA chapters were exaggeratedly easy, now with the introduction of elements of difficulty such as ~manual~ passing and dribbling, the feat of knocking down the most famous teams with small of the province has become very difficult. Sometimes I admit that it can happen, but more by ~chance~ than by real merits. Even the goal system has definitely changed and here a dilemma arose: was the problem better or its solution? In the previous chapters of FIFA, in fact, goals were practically only possible through shots taken in the area or on its edges. Goals from outside the area are now the order of the day. While realism has increased on the one hand, hypertension has suffered on the other: conceding goals because of a poorly organized defense is one thing, it's one thing for a torpedo slingshot on goal from 30 meters : where the player can't intervene, a sense of frustration and nervousness takes over that I don't invite you to experience in person. Lastly, the graphics are gorgeous. Here too many debates arise. Are animations just a good thing or are they the foundation of a soccer game? I think it's fair to think that during a game you only notice a green field (which the FIFA series has been offering with excellent details for years now) and fluid and realistic animations... but with a detail, from the eye of the camera that makes the little players, who ~does his duty~: just like the past years. A phrase that is often heard is: if EA thought slightly less about the graphics and a little more about the game system... Conclusions Take FIFA 2001 with all its features, good and bad, without forgetting any. Now open a DVD box set and put all the negative aspects of the game inside. Then take the positive ones, improve them, renew them, and put these in the box too. Close it, put Totti on the cover and you'll have the new FIFA 2002: a series of innovations always with the same, immutable problems behind it. Ideal for those who want something more than the year before, but with the awareness of rejoicing in the new features of the game and rediscovering (their) automatisms and (your) insults from a year before. But let's do the math: PC alternatives don't exist and all in all the game improves from year to year. It is a purchase that, for enthusiasts, can be made. But wait for those who have time: perhaps there will come a day when it will be impossible to further develop the positive sides, and finally EA Sports will be able to intervene on the negative sides of the game. In the meantime, nobody can take a game with the competition from the consoles. Preface I write this review with football joy in my heart, given by a painful but deserved victory of Bologna in the (real) championship. Indeed, the Bolognese team has many points in common with the FIFA series: expectations are always great, joining the group of ~sisters~ seems real", "date": "2001-12-04", "grade": null}
