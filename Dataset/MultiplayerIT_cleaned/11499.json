{"name": "Spettacolo di Magia - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spettacolo-di-magia-recensione.html", "text": "Developed by Tenyo, this DS Magic Show fits into the circle of games of the ~Touch Generation~, which has now completely deprived itself of its literal meaning and has become a synonym of ~casual games~, probably thanks to the characteristics of the most important and known, Brain Training above all. Precisely titles such as this Spettacolo di Magic, which games are not, could in the future lead to a wider awareness of the medium, focusing attention more on interaction than on the playful instance, and allowing the video game to perform, perhaps, finally, a step forward in the path of art. However, at the moment we are in 2008, and ceasing to admire similar persuasive future prospects we find ourselves facing this interesting and pleasant Nintendo project, a do-it-yourself spellcasting course. Letter to Hogwarts It doesn't always make sense to criticize the paratextual elements of a game when reviewing, but Spettacolo di Magico is a clear exception: sold together with a deck of cards, it shows off its presence on the shelves through a much larger, as well as thick, box of the other titles. The deck is simple, classic, with fifty-two cards - plus, of course, two jokers - not particularly suitable for a professional magician, but more than enough for a child interested in learning a few tricks. The target of Spettacolo di Magia is in fact evident: aesthetics and structuring, everything is aimed at channeling the product towards an extremely young audience. Rather than taking the apprentice by the hand and bringing him to levels of excellence, Tenyo's title is limited to introducing him to the subject, then leaving it up to personal curiosity to delve into the topic elsewhere. It's a shame, because the idea was very interesting, and thanks to the capabilities offered by the video game, one could probably have risked more, since basically there are tools of the trade and a guide to tricks at the same time. The developers have chosen to make everything more fun and less professional, many games run only through the DS, without the cards. Avada Kev emm Abracadabra! There were two possible ways to distance this product from other magic games: one was to make it more complex and professional, the other was to base it on the use of the DS rather than on the cards. As mentioned before, the second path was chosen, which however leads to a question with a difficult answer: Spettacolo di Magico was thought of as a tutorial to prepare the player to publicly perform magic tricks, but it really makes sense to amaze others through the DS, and therefore, consequently, through a machine? The magic and the twists and turns, even outside this area, are structured on the common knowledge of the performer and the audience of the limits of the medium used; if everything is possible, then nothing is surprising. Everyone knows the cards and their characteristics, few know the potential of the DS, so it will be difficult to convince the casual spectator that the trick is due to the man rather than the console. The dilemma would be minimal if card games had been in the majority, but unfortunately these tricks are interludes - numerically - to those to be achieved with the DS, which often consist in pressing the back buttons (L and R) while the spectator does not see . The game is divided into three sections: Magic Solo, Magic Show, and Magic Trials. In Solo di Magia the tricks proposed by the DS are performed, both with the cards and directly with the console, trying to independently understand their functioning, and for the most part they are based on logic; with Show di Magia, on the contrary, one is immediately enlightened on the secret of a certain game, and one has to practice in order to then perform it correctly in front of an audience  here too, of course, there are tricks both with and without cards. Trials of Magic, on the other hand, is a simple collection of mini-games, ideally inserted to polish the spellcaster's ability, practically present to cheer up the breaks between one trick and another; quality and variety of minigames are unfortunately not among the best. In all three sections, points are collected that are useful for unlocking new tricks, but despite this, the number of games present, regardless of the mode, is quite low. Aesthetically, the title is quite flat, legible and clear but with an inconsistent style, which alternates minimalist icons with characters with baroque features. Comment Spettacolo di Magia is a game for the little ones, not for the subject matter, but for the simple structure that constitutes it. The idea is excellent, and with a little more effort this title could have joined the best exponents of the Touchgeneration. The tricks are fun but few in number, and those based on the use of the DS rarely convince, both for the mechanics and for the actual possibility of reproducing them in public. It remains a pleasant gift for a child, given the reduced price, as an alternative to a classic magic game rather than a video game. For all those intending to follow our advice, we specify that knowing how to read is still a necessary condition to use the product.Pros The idea is interesting Cons Too short The tricks with Nintendo DS are not fully convincing The mini-games are a filler", "date": "2008-04-09", "grade": null}
