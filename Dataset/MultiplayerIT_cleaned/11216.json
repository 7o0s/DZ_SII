{"name": "Chuck Norris: Bring on the Pain", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chuck-norris-bring-on-the-pain.html", "text": "~Chuck Norris' lactic ferments are all dead.~ ~There are an average of 1274 objects in a room that Chuck Norris can kill you with, including the room itself.~ ~Chuck Norris can hold his breath for thirteen years.~ ~When the Boogeyman goes to sleep, he first looks under the bed to see if Chuck Norris is there.~ Have you ever read such a joke? These are the so-called ~Chuck Norris Facts~, an almost infinite series of short ~jokes~ that make fun of the aura of invincibility that has always surrounded the American actor, due to the roles he has played in films and TV series. The good Chuck was initially annoyed by the thing, also because many of the ~facts~ bring up rather delicate topics, to then realize the extent of the phenomenon and take advantage of it himself (just look at the way in which the presidential candidate Mike Huckabee played with the actor about it, during the election campaign). This video game breaks the delay a bit, bringing out the ~facts~ for the second time from the mere dimension of the internet and using them as a starting point for an action game with counter-flakes. The game is made up of thirteen stages, which see our Chuck fight with the enemies of America in very different scenarios, which refer to the roles that the actor has played in his career. We therefore start from an Asian jungle, and then move on to different urban scenarios (Texas could not be missing...), with the opponents who alternate in a rather rich and varied parade. The control system is very simple, but at the same time it allows us to perform a large number of offensive maneuvers: the d-pad moves the character, while the 5 key is used to hit through the basic combo. This can be enriched with more or less spectacular variations, as well as special moves, by spending the money collected in the locations within the ~dojo~, a virtual shop that we can visit between one stage and another. If the special moves are performed by simply pressing the 0 key, possibly combined with a direction of the d-pad, the modified combos (which address in particular the theme of roundhouse kicks, often mentioned in the ~facts~) make use of combinations of the numeric keypad sometimes easily accessible, sometimes more complicated. One of the things that amazes the most in the game is the level of interactivity with the environment: Chuck Norris can grab an enemy like in the classic scrolling fighting games, slap him and then throw him towards the ~camera~ (the ~zoom~ effect is fun and done very well), as well as he can lift cars, telephone booths, light poles, trees, clubs, barrels and anything else to crush his opponents. To this we must add the use of firearms, which is predominant in the first stages and almost hides the thickness of a combat system that leaves nothing to chance, fortunately well exploited in the following levels. There is no shortage of alternative sections, in which we will simply have to complete missions within a time limit or try our hand at a variation on the starting gameplay: ~shooter~ phases, car or motorbike chases, helicopter raids, etc. The Gameloft title even offers an original and almost totally new possibility, namely that of photographing the face of a friend (or ours) and then ~mounting~ it on the most common enemies. The result is not exciting, above all because the area to be cut out is elliptical and does not allow for modifications, but the attempt deserves applause and should be re-proposed with more conviction in the future. The graphics of the game show the enormous work done by the developers: although some details can be misleading, Bring on the Pain really has a lot, a lot of substance and it is one of the most well-finished mobile video games that have been seen in recent times. Chuck Norris's sprite is equipped with a disproportionate amount of animations, given the number of attacks and special moves of which he can become the protagonist, and the enemies are very numerous, all different from each other and equally cared for in the movements. There aren't actually thirteen different settings to explore, let's say that there are particular themes that are dealt with several times, always characterized by a high degree of interactivity. In this sense, perhaps even exaggerated, unfortunately, given that on some terminals the game is produced in heavy slowdowns when the situation on the screen becomes particularly chaotic. The sound sector, for once, manages to accompany the action in a worthy way, with a good mix of music and effects, which manage to coexist without trauma. PRO Really fun Substantive gameplay Absolutely great graphics...
