{"name": "Batman Vengeance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/batman-vengeance.html", "text": "Batman Vengeance is a video game inspired by an old batman show, which I wouldn't be surprised to see again on some TV channel. For those who have seen the show, the game will immediately have a great visual impact, because actually, the programmers' goal of reproducing the settings and characters of the TV series has been perfectly successful. Just as Gotham City, with all its gothic and dark atmospheres is faithfully reproduced, Batman himself, with his legendary gray costume, black cape and his ultra-modern arsenal would make the best Rambo pale. As I said before, the initial impact is very effective, but going deeper and after a few minutes of playing, you realize the flaws of this game, flaws that in some cases are wanted, in others they are not. Let me explain ... in fact, that Gotham City is not a city teeming with people as Naples can be, it was known and therefore it is no wonder for the total desolation that you will find yourself facing, but actually the total flatness of the environments and the deliberately sparse textures make Batman Vengeance a decidedly atypical game compared to recent titles, always looking for perfection in the details, high number of polygons and textures up to par. With this I don't want to say that Ubi Soft's game is bad graphically, on the contrary, the characters are well animated with the Flat Shading technique and the atmospheres faithful to the television series, but I mean that to some it might seem decidedly lacking in details when compared to a game like Devil May Cry. The game basically belongs to the third person 3D action/adventure genre, although by pressing the R2 key you can switch to a first person view to select weapons or examine objects, but unfortunately it will be unplayable after a while since it does not allow simpler actions such as jumping, climbing or simply stomping on some enemies. Precisely these actions will very often be frustrating, because although our Batman is a real superhero, in the Ubi Soft game you will often find him awkward in performing the simplest movements. In fact, in most cases, the settings contain obstacles that at first glance seem to be overcome even by a child but which our man Bat will not be able to overcome in any way. In fact we will be forced to follow obligatory directions, which however are not always easy to find. The story develops in a fairly linear way in 19 different levels and the aim is to defeat nine bosses including the legendary Joker and Mr. Freeze, bitter enemies of Batman, all of which can be solved in about ten hours of play. Instead, during the levels we will have to face a series of enemies who, although well animated, look a bit too much alike... indeed let's say that they are the same and that they only change in the various levels. Of note is the inevitable presence of the legendary Batmobile and the Bataereo to be used in some levels, which will serve to distract you a bit from the general monotony that afflicts this game. The sound is average, the music is spot on being taken from the original show, while the effects are decidedly in line with the graphic details, that is poor. I remember that the game is spoken in English but completely subtitled in Italian, even if in most cases you will have to be careful observers to read the writings, since they often suddenly disappear to make room for the subsequent subtitles. Comment To conclude, I don't feel like rejecting Batman Vengeance, because the guys at Ubi Soft have discreetly created a game that is all in all faithful to the series that inspires it. At the same time I feel I recommend it only to fans and nostalgics of this mythical superhero. For them, in fact, going around Gotham City, driving the Batmobile or simply using the Bat-Arsenal will be really pleasant. Those who are now immersed in new generation video games and are looking for a high-level game with a breathtaking story and millions of polygons are asked to look elsewhere. Pros: Atmosphere equal to the show It's Batman Variety of levels Cons: Poor graphics Often frustrating Controls not always precise The bat man The world of superheroes has always fascinated people of all ages. I think it's impossible to find someone who can't say the name of one of them, anywhere in the world. In the world of video games our dear superheroes are certainly not lackingrecent years; the recent and very successful title that Activision brought to PSX a few years ago inspired by spider-man, whose sequel has just been released and will then also arrive on PS2. One of the reasons for the enormous popularity of these fictional characters is probably their ~seniority~. I feel I can safely say that each of us grew up with a comic, TV show or film of Spiderman, Superman or the protagonist of this review of the latest Ubi Soft game, Batman.", "date": "2001-12-11", "grade": null}
