We therefore have the character of Spider-Man, of course, and the city of Manhattan which is the backdrop to his adventures, but beyond the presence of the fearsome Lizard there is very little in the twenty-five missions of this portable reduction that can remember how much you have possibly seen in the room. On iOS and Android we get straight to the point, in short, playing the role of the superhero without his origins being told, hovering from one skyscraper to another using the trusty cobweb, and it becomes clear from the very first moments that this aspect of the game it is the most pleasant and well-kept one. By simply holding down the jump button, Spider-Man launches a web, picks up speed depending on position, abandons it when we release the button and immediately fires another if we wish, or assumes a diving position as he rapidly plummets towards the soil. Then the fact that the fall does not have any negative effect, even from hundreds of meters in height, is a bit of a naivety of this production, which actually shows some defects in the outline and finishing flaws, see for example the multiple polygonal interpenetrations or visual defects. The Amazing Spider-Man offers a good exploratory phase, but disappoints in the often jerky fights With great prices comes great responsibility The Amazing Spider-Man is sold on the App Store and Google Play at a price of 5.49 euros, in line with the most important Gameloft-branded productions, but in many ways it is a good thing that the French house has opted for a traditional publication instead of pushing on freemium in this case too. Let's say that the quality of the title is indisputable, and above all on the large screen of the new iPad the Manhattan in sandbox format shows off good detail, a decent drawing distance (although not flawless) and good fluidity while we project rapidly from one building to another, thanks also to some quick manoeuvres. Unfortunately, the beautiful exploratory phases are contrasted with a problematic combat system: when Spider-Man encounters enemies he can punch them and perform various combos, trap them in the web and counterattack in case they are about to take him by surprise (feature borrowed from the console version, itself inspired by Rocksteady's excellent work with Batman: Arkham Asylum). In these situations, the problem is not the close position of the buttons, but a confusing camera management and, above all, a substantial impoverishment of the frame rate, with the character producing really badly animated attacks. The contrast between the aerial evolutions and the clashes with the criminals is really strong and greatly compromises the enjoyment of the experience, given that you can run around as much as you want within the scenario and maybe dedicate yourself to challenges based on exploration, but at a at some point you have to necessarily access the missions and lead your hands.", "date": "2012-07-10", "grade": "7.0"}
