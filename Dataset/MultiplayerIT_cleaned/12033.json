Little Tail Bronx is, in fact, an absolutely fascinating, sweet, successful recipe, capable of telling interesting stories in captivating settings with all the tenderness of an anthropomorphic cast. Here, Fuga: Melodies of Steel belongs to this vein, in which the characters are canine and feline humanoids, belonging to a steampunk lore, linked to ever-present conflicts and capable of narrating genuine stories. On the genre, well, it's a bit more complex because maybe you've played that pearl of Solatorobo: Red the Hunter and, well, it has nothing to do with it. Escape is a sort of management-JRPG in which you can fight in dry battles, with mechanics that they draw heavily on sacred monsters of strategy such as Advance Wars and Fire Emblem. We said, what a pleasure: yes, this is exactly the title that all those who appreciate a bloody story, but transmitted with tenderness, with a deep and layered but not complex gameplay and with a cast of characters to which it is impossible not to become attached. All, it must be said, achieved on a fairly self-managed advancement difficulty. Taranis A fight of Fugue: Melodies of Steel Everything revolves around an ancient tank, a special war instrument found by kids fleeing a village attacked by the classic evil empire. A trivial premise immediately turns into a tutorial shock: the crawler, to overcome an obstacle, will show children his special weapon, the Soul Cannon, forcing them to choose one of the children to sacrifice him and unleash enormous power. A gameplay gimmick that offers a shortcut for those who have difficulty advancing or overcoming some bosses, but which at the same time immediately traumatizes the player, forced to make difficult choices. If we want to make an analogy, we could compare the gimmick to the trick used by Tri-Ace for Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume, in which to sacrifice a character to make him become very powerful in his last moments of life. The Japanese, as we know, are never trivial and once again they offer almost ethical crossroads which, however, intersect with the gameplay. Escape is not a simple game and there will be times when you can lean towards using the ultimate weapon, but at a considerable emotional cost. Now, having told you what not to do, let's go backwards: how does Escape work? The children's journey is an automatic track, whose path we choose according to simple crossroads of difficulty: we can opt for the easy road or the difficult one, resulting in the architects of the experience and the loot we will collect along the way. Why choose the difficult paths, you will say? Well, because Fuga has a strong managerial-relational soul in which the growth of ties, couples and armaments depends on you. We're not talking about anything shocking in the indie world, but what CyberConnect2 offers works: the Taranis, the tank, has a whole series of things to do and to develop inside, provided you spend at each interlude - moments of pause during the routes - special points. Doing actions, talking to your companions, exploring ruins, sleeping and generally doing things in the headquarters consumes points, so you have to choose well how to invest them. War JRPG The Fugue Soul Cannon: Melodies of Steel in action Apart from this, Fuga is a JRPG with a very strong strategic soul: three pairs of children - you'll have to be good at building their affinities - challenge enemy war machines from time to time by exploiting weaknesses and strengths. The basis of the combat system is easy to learn, but not easy to perfect: within it gravitate a turn-based timeline based on speed, enemy shields to pierce with specific moves, war fears that arise in children after too many hits , special moves to be used at the right time, ability to change the components of the three pairs of characters knowing that it can be done once every three turns. In between we have skills that consume points, health to maintain, skill in knowing how to choose the right weapon to hit enemy weaknesses and make them delay their turn, knowing full well that every now and then you will need to raise your defenses. Without going too far into technicalities, the fights are quite addictive, they last the right time and the votes that are received in their completion are based on standard parameters, such as time, damage suffered and damage done, resulting in experience multipliers. The mechanism works, despite the fact that the villages between one route and another are quite bare; there is also a gameplay digression into the interno of ruins, which however proves to be a fairly simple element to manage. Fuga is localized in Italian and the narration, together with a good sound sector, advances well, managing to enrich the cast in an intelligent way and always throwing new elements of the setting into what becomes a cause of the player himself. Downsides? Just a few trifles in the economy of the intermezzo points, sometimes the impression is of leaving too many things on the road. We now realize that we have not carelessly spent words on the artistic sector, which absolutely works, albeit not crackling: the combat part is good, the management part is good, but in the review we candidly trust that the technical aspect is what we have considered the least.", "date": "2021-08-03", "grade": "8.3"}
