Thor cannot allow this to happen, so he sets out in pursuit of his half-brother through five realms: Nidavellir, the land of fires; the ethereal Svartalfheim; Jotunheim, with its frozen wastes; lush green Vanaheim; and finally Asgard, the land from which the gods of Norse mythology come. Developed by Gameloft and available for free on the App Store and Google Play, in the traditional freemium format, Thor: The Dark World follows the line of the most recent Marvel tie-ins and therefore catapults us into an alternative history to the one we will be able to see at the cinema. while partially reproducing its settings and characters. The choice of creating not a traditional action game with virtual controls, but a real MOBA-style RTS, in which Thor obeys our commands and attacks the enemies with a single touch of the screen, in a semi-automatic way, is surprising. left the possibility to move the character as needed, for example to dodge a particularly dangerous blow, and to recall its special abilities, such as the inevitable lightning storm. There are even minions, or rather two categories of the same: on the one hand the Einherjar, Asgardian warriors belonging to various classes (warrior, spearman, valkyrie, royal guard, alchemist, healer and chariot) that we can recall via icons placed in the lower part of the screen; on the other, Thor's allies, in this case Fandral, Volstagg, Hogun, Sif, Heimdall, Odin and Loki himself, who follow us in the mission as equals and can clearly make a more substantial contribution to the fight. Thor: The Dark World is a fun, substantial and spectacular RTS but the freemium approach is limiting Want to buy thunder? The first impact with the control system of Thor: The Dark World leaves us a bit dumbfounded, but a few minutes are enough to understand the strategic value of the choices made by Gameloft, which was able to pack a real-time strategy game full of substance, enemies, power-ups, and quite a variety as well. In fact, if the standard missions provide for the completion of a linear journey that leads us, opponent after opponent, to destroy the enemy tower, there are others in which we have to defend our own tower, or escort characters towards a portal, trying to defend them from attacks. An interesting achievement system has also been added which, in fact, forces us to replay already completed stages with the aim of eliminating a certain number of dark elves, maintaining a certain percentage of vital energy, collecting objects and so on. This translates into the earning of additional stars to unlock the subsequent missions and therefore move from one scenario to another, within the framework of an excellent technical sector even if inferior to that of Dungeon Hunter 4. Why did we mention the famous action RPG of the house French? Because both titles unfortunately suffer from a highly limiting freemium setting (indeed, let's call it ~imposition~), which requires cash payments to enjoy entire portions of the experience. Unlocking all Einherjar and allies, Thor's armor and variants of the Mjolnir hammer are operations that cannot be completed using virtual currency, which is also released in abundant quantities. Furthermore, just like in Dungeon Hunter 4, there is the clear feeling that the enhancement of our character and his allies is somehow ~read~ by hostile troops, who consequently become stronger and more resistant in the following levels.", "date": "2013-11-07", "grade": "6.0"}
