{"name": "Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Plus - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-gear-solid-portable-ops-plus-recensione.html", "text": "With the fourth episode in the pipeline, Metal Gear Solid confirms itself as one of the most popular and interesting series of the last decade. The debut took place exactly ten years ago on PSone, with a game that introduced the stealth element more or less simultaneously with titles such as Siphon Filter and Tenchu, but giving it absolute importance within the gameplay. The missions that Snake had to carry out, in fact, could not ignore secrecy, so every time he was discovered by an enemy soldier, the character had to hide until the alarm passed, and then resume the action. A series of solutions that were taken up and developed on the occasion of the release of Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3, both for PlayStation 2. The third episode of the series was actually a prequel, as its story took place decades before the events narrated in the first MGS. And it is precisely from there that Hideo Kojima started to give life to Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, recounting the years of Foxhound's success and the psychology of soldiers within a series of ~portable~ operations, enriched by a multiplayer thick online. Expansion? From the outset, Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Plus is presented as an add-on package for Portable Ops, not as a true sequel nor, even less, as an episode capable of walking on its own legs. Not surprisingly, the first thing the game asks us is if we want to import previously created characters, then introduces us to the new features introduced in terms of the interface. If you've already tried Portable Ops, you'll know very well that one of the key elements is capturing enemies, who can be ~convinced~ to join our team. This feature is also present in this case, but the developers have substantially changed the terms of identifying opponents: if previously it was possible to know in advance where the most valuable characters were, worthy of being hired, now everything is a somewhat left to chance. We will first of all have to use the first person view and observe the enemy that interests us to obtain an evaluation of his abilities (depending on the number of stars that appear on his head), this trying to avoid being discovered because in this case we would not be able to evaluate anything. Secondly, we will have to KO our target and then transport him to the starting vehicle or to the vicinity of a cardboard box, inside which a companion is hiding who will take care of the matter. We will be able to capture dozens and dozens of enemies in each map, the problem is that we will have no way of identifying them there and then and therefore we will never be able to know exactly which ones have agreed to join us and which ones have not done so, with the use of efforts and research that may be in vain. Just missions Another novelty introduced with Portable Ops Plus is the total absence of a plot, which you have to get used to. We are faced with an additional package, which also allows us to use famous characters (Raiden, Snake in an older version, etc.) but without justifying their presence in any way. After all, one of the modalities makes the basic idea of the product clear to us: an infinite number of missions, generated randomly, in which a goal must be achieved by facing increasingly greater difficulties. The problem is that a setting of this kind, clearly, will not be able to please everyone, arousing the interest only of those who have devoured Portable Ops and want to access an unknown number of new missions, however using the same structure. In this sense, unfortunately the defects of the original episode have not been filed: the management of the view is still terribly cumbersome, with the analog stick to move the character and the d-pad (yes) to move the view, which can be keep centered on the character only by holding down the left back button. It is a choice that severely penalizes the player, forcing him into an approach that defining ~reasoned~ is an understatement, limiting any quick action and putting him in serious difficulty when he actually needs to move (when the alarm goes off or during some special missions , for example). There also remain the problems concerning the management of weapons, historically present in the Metal Gear Solid series, as well as the extreme slowness with which captured enemies must be transported to a recovery area. As for multiplayer, that hasn't changed either: we have the option to play on the maps present in Portable Ops and to use new ones, but the advice is to build a very strong team before facing any player umano, or you risk being exterminated in a few minutes and seeing your efforts to organize a competitive team in vain. Technical realization Comment Those who expected an ~enhanced~ version of Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops will be disappointed: we are faced with a simple add-on package, practically devoid of its own personality and moreover spoiled by a series of anything but exciting novelties. In the first place, we don't know why, the opponent search system has been changed: if before it was easy to identify them on the map and evaluate which ones to capture to enrich your team, now it has become much slower and more cumbersome . Secondly, what were the problems of the game have not been minimized: the management of the view is always terrible, and using the numerous weapons available is never as fun as it should be. Ultimately, Portable Ops Plus is a product intended only for fans of the original episode, who will really find bread for their teeth in this add-on. Everyone else should wait for the now imminent Portable Ops 2... Pros: In substance, there is something to rejoice in Technically excellent, identical to Portable Ops Attractive selling price Cons: This is an add-on package , no plot or anything Cumbersome camera handling The new features made the game worse rather than better", "date": "2008-04-21", "grade": null}
