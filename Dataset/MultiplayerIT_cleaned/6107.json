After all, it was an easy prediction to make, given and considering the very high dose of fun offered by the Psyonix title, combined with the possibility of downloading it for free last month thanks to PlayStation Plus. The wonderful opportunity offered on PlayStation 4 certainly given the console version a fast track to become the reference platform for the challenges of the successor to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, but the Rocket League phenomenon has still been able to spread to PC as well. For both versions, also joined by cross-platform matches, the first paid package of Rocket League, entitled Supersonic Fury, was made available a few days ago: we tried it right on the computer, to discover all the innovations introduced by the developers at inside this fantastic game. Supersonic Fury is the first paid add-on for the hilarious Rocket League As before, more than before The nature of Rocket League oriented towards the world of eSports has required Psyonix to pay particular attention in the creation of additional content, in order to guarantee the balance of the overall experience. To ensure that the game remains intact from a competitive point of view, there is in fact the absolute need to avoid the presence of elements that can offer some advantage to those who buy them, which is why Supersonic Fury adds further possibilities of customization of your car, operating only in the aesthetic field. Thanks to this package, those who love to develop a look of their own will find a series of rather tempting alternatives waiting for them, among which the first to catch the eye are the two brand new machines: Dominus and Takumi. In the description offered by the developers, the former is presented as an American muscle car, while the latter as a Japanese road racing car. The nature of the two cars is also reflected in the decorations added by Psyonix: twelve in total, divided equally into six on each side to give the new arrivals of Supersonic Fury an even more unmistakable appearance. For all of the cars, on the other hand, new types of paint are arriving: there are five, thanks to which you can also give those already present in Rocket League a completely renewed look. They range from the carbon fiber style to the wooden one, passing through a series of alternatives that aesthetic perfectionists will undoubtedly appreciate, also thanks to the possibility of combining different types of paint for the primary and secondary color of your car. Attention to detail To the macroscopic additions introduced by Supersonic Fury to Rocket League are added elements that are perhaps a little less evident, but equally important for those who want to customize the car with which they will speed around the game arena to the highest level. In the same package we also find two new sets of wheels, called Cristiano and Spinner: the former looks a bit like a soccer ball, while the latter has a more flamboyant style that still deserves to be tried. At this point, only the turbo would be missing: it goes without saying that we also have news in this area, given that the new Dominus and Takumi can enjoy two new effects together with all the other machines, Nitro and Burnout, thus completing the picture of the customization offered by this add-on pack. Finally, we remind you that with the free update, released together with Supersonic Fury, Psyonix has introduced a series of new antennas to be applied to your car, including the flags of additional nations but also some ~disconnection-themed~ elements, to ask for forgiveness to the players of the vicissitudes faced by the servers in the days following the launch of Rocket League. Before closing, let's also take a look at the new objectives introduced, six in total: these are results to be achieved using the cars that arrived together with Supersonic Fury, using them in combination with the new decorative elements to win a game or, for example, reach one hundred kilometers traveled using only the Cristiano and Spinner wheel sets. In conclusion, we would like to recommend Supersonic Fury with eyes closed to those who are constantly working on the appearance of their car to show off new looks on the field, but it must still be said that considering the hours of fun guaranteed by Rocket League the investment can also be reabsorbed without worries by all the other players. Just in case you haven't decided yet whether the combination of toy cars and football is for you, you can continuere quietly playing with the basic version, where customization elements are not lacking anyway.", "date": "2015-08-24", "grade": null}
