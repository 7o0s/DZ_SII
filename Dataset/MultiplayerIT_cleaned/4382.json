Well, Glitch Dash tries the not simple task of shuffling the cards of this highly inflated genre, giving us a different experience than usual, with a first person view, levels with a beginning and an end, but above all with predetermined structures. Trial & error is in fact part of the game: knowing what will happen at a given point along the way so that you can implement the necessary ~countermeasures~ to pass that point and reach the end of the level. An approach that is probably more traditional and undoubtedly subject to a shorter duration, but at the same time worthy of attention also due to the way in which these mechanisms have been implemented by the author of the game, David Marquardt. The touch control system is of the traditional type: the ride is automatic, but we are asked to swipe to the left or right to move on one of the three ~lanes~ of the route, downwards to slide and downwards. 'high to jump. The system does not require pixel precision and indeed uses a fairly elastic approach, but nevertheless getting to the finish line in the more advanced stages turns out to be a far from simple undertaking. Run, jump, slide Accompanied by a driving electronic soundtrack, which seems almost synchronized with the actions that occur on the screen, in Glitch Dash we progress through the stages thanks only to a mix of precision and responsiveness. The route, which builds up as we go forward, in fact presents a large number of possible obstacles and an impact is enough to incur game over, with the obligation at that point to repeat the attempt or watch an advertising trailer to be able to collect a ~continue~ and resume from the last checkpoint. Small parenthesis: the game can be downloaded for free and does not pose particular constraints, but in fact the pop-ups in which we are suggested to unlock certain features, such as the elimination of all notifications, are fairly invasive and it costs to eliminate them completely a bit too much, 9.99 euros. That said, the experience is definitely worth trying, especially if you're looking for a certain degree of challenge and a product that can also surprise you from a visual point of view. In this juncture Glitch Dash is in fact presented in an absolutely solid way, with very well contextualized geometric shapes and elegant effects, all while remaining anchored to sixty frames per second. We must not be distracted, however: between traps, increasing speeds, mobile platforms, devices that entirely move the path and so on, crossing the levels of the game unscathed will not be a simple undertaking at all.", "date": "2018-03-02", "grade": "8.0"}
