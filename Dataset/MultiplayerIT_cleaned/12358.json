{"name": "Virtua Tennis 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/virtua-tennis-3-recensione.html", "text": "Forehands and backhands Historically, tennis is a sport that has been little and badly represented in the videogame world, but a real comeback of this sport within videogames is due precisely to Virtua Tennis, which with its immediate and easy-to-learn playability has captured many players both within the walls of the game rooms and at home. Then, a few years later, the Top Spin saga also arrived, which first on Xbox and then on Xbox 360 offered an approach that was still mainly arcade but with hints of simulation ambitions that cannot be found on Sega games. With the arrival of the ~next-gen~ Sega takes the field again, proposing the third chapter of its saga. In addition to the usual exhibition and training matches, the career mode is naturally present, which is based on the foundations of the one already seen in the last chapter but is revised and corrected. As usual, you start with creating a personalized tennis player (with a rather stingy editor of features) who starting from position 300 in the rankings will have to get to be number one in the world. The player will have to wisely alternate training, tournaments and rest periods. Forehands and backhands The latter are more important than in the past, because in this version the injury is around the corner, and it is therefore advisable to keep your virtual alter ego always in perfect shape. For training, the famous mini-games that we have already seen in Virtua Tennis 2 are back, increasingly varied, fun and numerous, but Sega has also added the Tennis Academy to them, a place where it is possible to undertake ~serious~ and realistic training sessions . The Xbox 360 version also boasts the ability to play online on Xbox Live, a real edge over PC and PS3. There are a total of twenty selectable tennis players, excluding those created with the editor: Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Lleyton Hewitt, Andy Roddick, David Nalbandian, Sebastien Grosjean, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Tim Henman, James Blake, Mario Ancic, Taylor Dent, Gael Monfils, Tommy Haas, Maria Sharapova, Lindsay Davenport, Daniela Hantuchova, Martina Hingis, Nicole Vaidisova, Amelie Mauresmo and Venus Williams. Strange the lack of Serena Williams, winner of the last Australian Open. Too bad also for the lack of emerging talents such as Richard Gasquet or some old glory of the past (never included in any Sega title) such as Agassi, McEnroe or Sampras. The harsh law of the passer-by along the line The gameplay is very similar to what was seen in the previous chapters, but with all the small tweaks and updates of the case (rather necessary after six years of distance) it has been made a little deeper and less angular. The watchwords are always ~immediacy~ and ~fun~, which however leave a bitter taste in the mouth of those who would like at least a further splash of realism and more depth. From this point of view, progress had been made in the downloadable demo on Xbox 360 from Xbox Live: it presented obvious errors in the management of (exaggerated) dives but at the same time it sported elements which, while not undermining the immediacy and arcade nature of the title, brought a certain amount of realism as a dowry: rather truthful changes of direction (in the final instead they are in the ~Automan~ style) and the need to position oneself in the best possible way before executing the shot in order to make effective shots (in the final version this process is very simplified and guided). The harsh law of the passer-by along the line Digressions aside, the game boasts a particularly gentle learning curve that allows everyone to quickly reach more than sufficient levels, but then of course a little more effort is needed to make the leap in quality, especially from the point of view of the reflexes and the ability to read the game. The artificial intelligence is discreet, but of course the game gives its best in multiplayer, whether it is local (PC and PS3) or online (X360). Graphics and sound No fireworks for the graphics sector of Virtua Tennis 3, in 1080p on PS3 and Xbox 360 (in the latter case it is the first native title in this resolution), but the glance is still good. The biggest defect among those attributable is the lack of resemblance of the tennis players to their real counterparts: the faces of most of the polygonal athletes are modeled a little roughly, so much so that in some particular cases it is difficult to recognize the tennis player (and as long as they did for Nadal it even suited me, but one of the worst made ones is Sharapova). The animations, personalized for each individual tennis player, are very accurate, fluid, faithful to the movements of real athletes and therefore, in short, are probably the bestnever seen. The playing fields and surrounding areas are also very beautiful. As for the PS3 version, we note better image contrast, higher brightness and slightly sharper textures. The PC graphics are almost identical to the console versions, with the only differences being some rather rough shadows, a less bright color palette and some minor polygon clipping errors (see Federer's hair). Having said that, the fact that we are able to run the game at a constant 30fps with all effects activated and at a resolution of 1920x1200 on a Sempron 3400+ with X1600Pro AGP and 1GB of RAM demonstrates that VT3 only minimally exploits the potential of consoles such as Xbox 360 and PS3 and of the new GPUs for PC. As for the sound, we have the usual 4-5 arcade-style songs that accompany menus and matches, and the sound effects that stand out for the perfect reproduction of the screams of each tennis player (unmistakable those of Maria Sharapova, halfway between surgery without anesthesia and softcore porn). System requirements Minimum Requirements: Operating System: Windows XP Processor: Pentium 4 1.4 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: Direct X 9.0, 128 MB, shader 2.0 Disk Space: 4 GB Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 2.0 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1 GB Video Card: Direct X 9.0 compatible, from ATi X1600 and GeForce 7600 with 256 MB Disk Space: 4 GB Test Configuration: Processor: AMD Sempron 3500+ RAM: 1 GB Video Card: Ati X1600Pro Monitor: Dell 24 (1920x1200) Comment A very fun, immediate and engaging game, which however pays for the excessive similarity with the previous chapters and an atavistic lack of depth in the game mechanics. Highly recommended for fans of the series and tennis lovers in general who have no simulation claims. And, in principle, recommended to anyone looking for a title that can guarantee many hours of fun both alone and in multiplayer. Nota Bene: For the Xbox 360 version add 4 decimals to the final grade. Pros Lots of fun Great animations Lots of subgames Cons Knows a lot you've seen Online only on the Xbox 360 version Shallow mechanics Virtua Tennis 3 is available on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360. The tested version is the PC version. Goals 360 Of the 1000 points distributed by Virta Tennis 3, at least 150 are rather easy to achieve, being linked to the achievement of the first simple objectives of the career mode, between the character editor and victory in the first tournaments. To get, however, to have higher scores, it will take a lot of dedication. Virtua Tennis is the most famous tennis saga in history: it can boast millions of fans and a myriad of incarnations, from the coin-op version to that for portable consoles. With the next-gen now started some time ago, Sega could not therefore avoid churning out a new chapter, which from the arcade cabinet was promptly converted to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC.", "date": "2007-04-13", "grade": null}
