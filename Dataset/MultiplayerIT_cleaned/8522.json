Perhaps, then, the step is short from the NBA (or WWE) to Danish bricks, given that the guys at Visual Concepts have packed in record time LEGO 2K Drive, published these days on practically any console and on PC from 2K Games. With a partly new philosophy: LEGO video games have always been linked to well-known names from the world of cinema, comics or TV series. This time, however, the protagonists, plot and formulas are completely new, and the title is thus proposed as a neutral solution, suitable for any type of user. Provided that you like racing games, of course, because we are still talking about a racing game all effects. The basic formula has been expanded and declined by the developers following the philosophy of what we could define as ~LEGO madness~, or a mix of light-hearted situations, irreverent characters and constant jokes throughout the adventure. Overall, everything works well, with an alternation of properly brilliant aspects and others that are more subdued. Anyway, we've ~built~ the LEGO 2K Drive review for you, so let's push it on the accelerator - pass us the joke, if we don't exploit it now when can we do it again? - and we rush along the game analysis. Plot: the best of Mattonia The main biome of LEGO 2K Drive consists of the green fields of Brickonia First of all, let's throw a spear in favor of localization and dubbing: LEGO 2K Drive can be used in excellent written and spoken Italian, with particularly apt translation choices. The example of the name of the game world - Brickia - applies for all, which perfectly conveys not only the brick-based nature of the open world, but also the ~madness factor~ that animates the entire production.LEGO 2K Drive possesses also a plot, another plus point. Of course, of course you can select other more immediate modes, such as laps on the track without interruption, cups, and everything a normal racing game could offer you. But the developers have visibly insisted on the main narrative, which brings all these elements together within a sensible and stimulating progression, even if it is not without some flaws. You are the latest additions to a world obsessed with racing (on-road, off-road, some even along waterways); in Mattonia there is a sort of hierarchy of champions, and to become the absolute non plus ultra you will have to be able to win what in the animated film Cars is the Piston Cup, or the Astro Cup (the name alone gives an idea of its importance). It is obvious that they will not offer it to you on a silver platter: you will have to complete every single track of every single region of Mattonia, accumulate checkered flags and finally reach the final competition thus subtracting the coveted prize from your nemesis, that Shadow Z. You will not be alone in this task: LEGO 2K Drive introduces one after the other a whole series of more or less recognizable supporting characters, from the monkeys who manage the garage (useful for vehicle customization) to the veteran Clutch Fulminton and the robotic assistant S.T.U.D. They will guide you through a myriad of endless tutorials (you can skip them using the Options command) and show you one by one all the possibilities offered by Mattonia. In the initial moments this abundance of possibilities is even frustrating, but it is advisable to listen to everything and everyone, also because the game seems simple to master, but in reality it presents a somewhat cumbersome progression and some of the secondary events are not as intuitive as they seem . One open world, many possibilities Who said that in LEGO 2K Drive you only have to drive cars? LEGO 2K Drive is presented as a full-blown open world experience, but the matter is more delicate. Forget the endless open worlds, because the extension of the one in question is very good, but not surprising. It is actually a vast map that contains four different thematic areas, each characterized by a specific biome: but it will not be possible to travel from one to the other at any time, they will be progressively unlocked as real levels; moreover, even within the individual maps, you will always be somehow linked to an exploration whose freedom was dictated from above by the developers' idea. It all makes sense and works, with some reservations. The first is this: LEGO 2K Drive would like to offer absolute freedom to newcomers, but in reality it has made itself bound to a series of secondary activities (or races to be repeated) that are particularlytedious. The progression system is linked to the player's level: for example, you will not be able to access level 4 races without first having reached that specific level. And to achieve it you will have to play to the bitter end, completing secondary tasks, which are very rarely linked to actual racing. Some LEGO 2K Drive missions are crazier than others Some side missions require you to complete improbable feats - fun, for heaven's sake, but closer to the aforementioned ~LEGO madness~ than the formula of a racing game. Bringing blue piglets back into the fold isn't even the strangest request we've come across: there was literally a giant egg to lead to an equally giant frying pan, and there were heartaches because neither object was going to cooperate. Try to bump an egg with your car along a canyon full of rocks and cacti (keeping sanity intact). Since there are mini-games that can be used separately, it would have made more sense to limit the challenges just described to the latter, and perhaps limit the exploits of the story mode to racing on the track (there is often a good half hour between one and the other) . Racing and construction In LEGO 2K Drive you will have to complete a myriad of races to win the coveted Astro Cup In LEGO 2K Drive, it's not just about exploring and completing completely crazy side missions, even if these aspects make up a large part of the whole experience. What matters, in the end, is the road (or off-road) racing. The idea of alternating between three different types of vehicles that change instantly based on the terrain was brilliant: you go from a hamburger car (asphalt) to a quad (dirt) and finally to a motor boat (on water) seamlessly. The driving system, on the other hand, could have been improved: it maintains a clear arcade inspiration, and offers all the possibilities of any Mario Kart, but without the same precision. The drifts allow you to accumulate the turbo, but using it also means losing control of the vehicle, don't believe anyone who will tell you otherwise; track gadgets - that is, power-ups - lead to total chaos, between spider webs that block enemies, self-guided rockets and energy shields. Winning is not impossible, on the contrary; but very often everything is linked more to chance than to skill. We didn't have the opportunity to immediately test the online mode in which six players challenge each other on the same track, but it is difficult to think of a serious ~competitor~ with such premises. Lovers of building itself, however, will go crazy with joy in discovering how every single LEGO 2K Drive vehicle can be assembled from scratch, complete with on-screen instructions, by going to your garage. Sure, the system isn't as practical as it is in reality, but it works; moreover, the title has really many models that can then be equipped and used both in the exploration of the open world and on the track. We had fun with the hamburger vehicle, but there are several possibilities right away. Beyond the general confusion, it is however advisable to take into account the parameters of the individual vehicles: some are heavier, others more easily manoeuvrable, and so on; they are not really aspects that make a difference, at least not in the story mode, but it is still good to know that they exist. Has building a nice LEGO burger always been your dream? In LEGO 2K Drive you can Lastly, the technical sector of LEGO 2K Drive is fully satisfactory on PlayStation 5: we have not noticed any bugs or glitches of any kind, the loads are rapid in every situation, and the glance is always pleasant. Yes, we would have preferred a ~more LEGO~ world - like those of LEGO Worlds, to be clear - but we understand that compromises were necessary for a racing game.", "date": "2023-05-21", "grade": "7.5"}
