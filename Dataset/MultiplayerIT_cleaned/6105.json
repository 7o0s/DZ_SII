{"name": "Finch morte non ci separi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155042-until-dawn-finche-morte-non-ci-separi.html", "text": "Included in the fascinating Chaos Theory, the so-called ~butterfly effect~ coined by the scientist Edward Lorenz in 1972 represents one of the most appreciated physical-mathematical concepts by the Hollywood film industry, a real driving force for the imagination of screenwriters which has often become undisputed protagonist in the narrative plot of the moment. Could the flutter of a butterfly in Brazil cause a hurricane in Texas? The cryptic metaphor, linked to the potential, catastrophic consequences unleashed by a minimal variation in the initial conditions of a chaotic system (such as our atmosphere), has become an inspiring muse for the young British software house Supermassive Games, which around the aforementioned concept has decided to shaping an entire horror-tinged adventure. The initial project was planned for PlayStation 3 and contemplated an extensive use of the Move, however, thanks to the resounding commercial success of PlayStation 4 and the greater computational power in dowry, the developers have decided to carry the work into the new generation, also changing some of its characteristics . In principle, in fact, Until Dawn was supposed to be a simple adventure inspired by the classic teenage horror stars and stripes, but the spur of the community and the potential of the narrative cue prompted Supermassive Games to record the shot, sliding everything into the much grimmer atmospheres and mature films like Saw - The Riddler, Hostel and Psycho, while maintaining some aftermath of the original concept. After ten intense hours of play we have completed the adventure and saved only three of the eight young, unfortunate protagonists: if you want to find out how it went, you just have to keep reading. Despite the formulaic characters and some unhappy choices, Until Dawn makes it through the night There were eight of them, they were young and beautiful In February 2014, a group of ten high school friends gathers in a luxurious cabin in Blackwood Pines, a remote mountain community where the most inaccessible areas are accessible only by cable car. The property of the Washingtons, wealthy Hollywood producers and parents of three of the boys, is located on one of the peaks of the mountain and has no field for mobile communications, a classic narrative pretext to isolate the protagonists and project them into the worst of nightmares, which however it will unleash in all its horror only the following year. During the first gathering, to which the prologue of Until Dawn is dedicated, the two Washington twins mysteriously disappear in the night during a snowstorm, and exactly one year after the tragic event, for which the police have failed to provide explanations, brother Josh decides to organize a new meeting, to commemorate Hannah and Beth and spend time with his closest friends, all shaken by the trauma suffered. The incipit of the plot, the deliberately stereotyped protagonists and the location of the drama enclose all the clichs of the horror genre for teenagers, a hangover from the initial concept and not exactly reassuring business card in terms of narrative developments. In the early stages of the game, you begin to know the status of the relationships between the eight students and to understand details about the character of each of them, elements that are schematized in a personal page accessible from the pause menu. These are not absolute values and ends in themselves, given that the choices made by the player during the adventure constantly shift the balance on the plate and can make the difference between life and death in the most dramatic situations. Honesty, charity, courage, romance, curiosity and humor are the six feelings at the mercy of events, architects of the butterfly effect as much as a wrong Quick Time Event or an unrecovered clue. Boys, as specified above, represent the classic stereotypes of the genre, and with the exception of two or three more in-depth figures they certainly don't leave their mark from an ~affective~ or charisma point of view: Mike (played by Brett Dalton of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) is the ever-present gym class monitor and good-looking embroiled in frivolous relationships; Sam (Hayden Panettiere) is the best friend of the missing twins, a caring person who plays a particularly important role in the economy of the plot; Josh (who has the face of Rami Malek) is undoubtedly the most well-finished character from a psychological point of view and is the one you will remember most at the end of the adventure; Ashley (Galadriel Stineman) is the typical ~water and soap~ girl, sensitive, reserved and intelligent with a crush on Chris (Noah Fleiss), the nice nerd of the group, Josh's best friend and character linked to very difficult moral choices; Matt (Jordan Fisher) isthe good guy on duty, motivated but dominated by his girlfriend Emily (Nichole Bloome), Mike's wicked but brilliant ex-girlfriend; finally Jessica, Mike's current partner, is a blonde all pepper that she knows boys like and relies on her physical appearance to get what she wants. In short, they are all young, beautiful and engaged in more or less serious flirting with each other; the traditional adolescent potpourri that sets limits that are not exactly comfortable to the narrative plot. Despite the aforementioned limit, after an initial adjustment phase in which one becomes familiar with the group, with the advent of the first moments of tension and the entry into the scene of the psychopath, the hormones in turmoil give way to anguish and anxiety, that keep the player glued to his seat to follow (and lead) the destinies of the unfortunate protagonists through choices and errors. In short, starting the diesel is followed by a central part of the captivating and engaging adventure, full of twists and turns and cloaked in a dense aura of mystery, catalysed by esoteric elements translated from Indian culture and above all by the figure of the psychoanalyst, who intervenes between chapter and the other and ~accompanies~ the player with psychological tests, pressing him on the choices made up to that moment. Dr. Hill, played by the excellent Peter Stormare (the John Abbruzzi of the Prison Break series), presents his questions within a study that becomes increasingly gloomy and full of terrifying furnishings, intertwined with the dramatic events of Blackwood Hill. Unfortunately, an unexpected twist towards the end of the adventure completely shuffles the cards on the table, introducing elements that may not be appreciated by some users. Despite being unique, the plot full of quotations can blossom into a substantial number of small final variations, where at the two extremes we have the survival of all the protagonists and the complete massacre. Due to a bad choice made in the final part, we lost two of the five boys we had managed to save up to that point, and we don't hide the desire to replay the adventure to try and get them all to safety, thus discovering further details about the plot. Playstation 4 trophies There are nineteen trophies in Until Dawn, divided into four bronze, five silver, nine gold, and one platinum. Given that most of them are kept hidden to avoid annoying plot spoilers and even those leaked on the net provide clues, for fairness we avoid reporting indications on the matter. Hanging by a thread At this point you should have a rather precise idea of the experience offered; but how exactly to play Until Dawn? As good examples we could take Tell Tale's The Walking Dead and the Quantic Dream titles, however the Supermassive Games work has its own precise personality. First, there are no riddles or puzzles to solve. The player's sole purpose is to explore the environment, recover any clues, make moral choices and overcome the infamous Quick Time Events, which in Until Dawn play a key role precisely in light of the aforementioned butterfly effect. Forget about being able to reload a previous save after a mistake or a choice that doesn't convince you: there's just a very strict automatic system. To support the player, the developers have littered the environments with so-called Totems, mystical objects that show a confusing but potentially useful fragment of the future. The Totems are of different colors and each of them corresponds to a prophecy: the black ones show the eventual death of whoever recovers them; the yellows represent a kind of guide on a choice that has yet to be made; browns herald the potential loss of a friend; reds unveil a threat while whites prophesy fortune, such as showing a useful object or the arrival of a friend in support. Beyond the Totems, clues can be gathered about the missing twins, a mysterious man linked to the Washington family and an incident that happened in the area in 1952, all details that contribute to enriching the narrative substratum of Until Dawn. The camera is dynamic and the controls are a little sticky, probably a legacy of the previous concept for Move, however with a little practice it is possible to move easily in the playing area, often made up of ~corridors~ with well-defined and guided boundaries, if except for some larger and more elaborate environments. With the classic configuration of the controls (there is also the one linked to the gyroscopes) the left analog stick controls the movements of the character, while the right is dedicated to the choices, to the use of any equipped torch (take care(you can't invert the Y-axis) and to specific actions during ruthless Quick Time Events, in most cases performed with the four front buttons. Beyond the daring escapes from the madman chasing us, the Quick Time Events also appear during climbing and while traveling along winding paths. It is almost always possible to choose the longest and safest route, but a possible late arrival at the ~crime scene~ could cost dearly to those we are trying to reach. The most punishing sections are those in which it is necessary to hold the DualShock 4 firmly in the hand without making it move a millimeter, for example in order not to be discovered by the tormentor after hiding. The game is littered with so-called ~jumpscare~, but more than true terror Until Dawn instills anxiety and anguish in the player like a thriller, although there are some sections with deadly traps and chilling outcomes. The story is told over the course of a single night and is divided into ten chapters lasting about an hour each, a good longevity also in light of the considerable replayability factor. Soft light From a technical point of view we are dealing with a work with high production values, which are revealed above all in the creation of the characters, characterized by an excellent polygonal modeling, remarkable shaders (very well-kept skin imperfections) and realistic facial expressions, although there is some snagging from time to time. The camera often lingers with close-up shots just to underline the rendering of the details, enhanced by the graphics engine of Killzone: Shadow Fall polished for the occasion. Sometimes non-definite textures emerge, lip synchrony is not always impeccable as are some animations, nevertheless the work done by Supermassive Games is overall refined and of sure scenic impact. The settings such as the hut, the mine and the abandoned sanatorium are very rich in details and embellished with particle effects, with great care dedicated to the individual objects and a use of lighting that is sometimes shocking, so much so that in some sequences it seems to be watching a film and not a video game. The exteriors are also well done, basically paths that wind through the lush boreal forest, especially fascinating during the snowstorm. Such high graphic detail unfortunately pays duty on the frame rate front, which in some sequences can go well below thirty frames per second. Fortunately this does not affect the ~gameplay~, given the peculiar nature of the product. The Italian dubbing is certainly among the best appreciated in a video game, although the acting is a little fluctuating especially when the voice actors are grappling with the romantic and ironic scenes. The excellent sound samples and a dynamic and spot-on soundtrack close the technical picture.", "date": "2015-08-24", "grade": "8.0"}
