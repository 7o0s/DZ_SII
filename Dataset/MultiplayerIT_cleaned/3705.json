There is a sort of unwritten rule when developing fighting games, a basic law that all developers follow willy-nilly, and is punctuated by four lapidary words: ~don't go overboard with the budget~. This limitation does not depend on a scarce consideration of the genre, which is indeed among the noblest and most solid in the entire videogame industry, but on the almost impossible separation between this and the niche audience, since games that require constant practice, study of innumerable factors , and are almost always calculated around the competitive scene are by nature not marketable to the ~mass~ that grinds the billions that feed the triple A productions. titles in all respects excellent, clearly programmed with love and sensitive resources at the base, yet never once has a fighting game seemed to us to have the production values of a large-scale blockbuster behind it... at least until today. Because Mortal Kombat 11 is a white fly: a product that aspires to exceed the incredible number of copies placed by its direct predecessor (we are talking about over 10 million), and is supported by a marketing machine and investments never seen before in this wonderful but elitist gaming ecosystem. The latest addition to the NetherRealm house therefore represents an impressive milestone for all lovers of virtual beatings: a title potentially capable of disintegrating any expectation of enthusiasts, of exceeding anything that has come before (at least as regards everything that ~surrounds ~ the gameplay), and at the same time to evolve the systems that have made the children of the Chicago house iconic and recognizable over the years. But be careful, because we are indeed dealing with something that cannot be renounced for those who grew up on bread and sticks, but also with a creature to whom the incredible proximity to the aforementioned triple A has paradoxically led to some unpleasant negative influences. Bloody history Unlike most of its peers, Mortal Kombat has always focused heavily on the narrative element, so much so that the series has now given life to a background of monstrous complexity, full of ~colorful~ characters and even survived a total reshuffle with the excuse of the ~alternate timeline~. Not happy with having already overcome the terrible obstacle of time travel unscathed (nightmare of any writer), however, the NetherRealm have decided to further raise the bar in the eleventh chapter, and to concentrate the events around Kronika: a very powerful goddess capable to control the sands of time, who decides to eliminate Raiden and his to restore balance in a world where the forces of good have gained too much power. It is a very clever expedient to recover dead and buried characters, because the fearsome antagonist dressed in white can bring practically any warrior who appeared in the series back into the field, but at the same time a similar choice gives life to a whirlwind of events almost impossible to stabilize in logical way, so the writers decided to focus on the only possible solution... not giving a damn about any finesse. In the Mortal Kombat 11 campaign you won't find an elaborate plot full of brilliant ideas and unpredictable twists, but an epic story where the action is king and the spectacular always wins over the script. That's good, because despite the ingenuity and inconsistencies there is, the long-lived and bombastic main story is very entertaining, and to date it is probably the best operation of this type ever seen in a fighting game, thanks to the impressive work done by the team on the technical sector . The only way to improve everything would have been to insert a few more fights equipped with modifiers (there are only a handful of fights with a different functioning than normal), a lack however dampened by the fact that from chapter to chapter you will be put in command of a large part of the roster available, complete with scenes where it will be possible to choose between two different fighters. As far as we're concerned, it's an outstanding piece of the puzzle, passed with flying colors, which once again demonstrates how much Ed Boon's software house has grown. Beautiful and competitive In any case, we are talking about fighting games, and when this is the topic, the flaming core of the entire discussion can be one and only one: the combat system. For the NetherRealm titles, this is particularly central, because despite the fact that since the 2011 chapter the house has focused on a distortion of the saga, and a notableapproaching the competitive, his games have struggled to be ~accepted~ by the most intransigent members of the fighting game community, because they are accused of being too simplistic and far from the technicality of some of the most renowned Japanese fighting games on the square. Obviously, we are talking about easily negligible discussions: the Mortal Kombat may not have the superhuman technicalities of a Third Strike or a Garou, but they are still very difficult titles to master in full, which in the field and in sport have often offered adrenaline-pumping and hard-fought tournaments. Mortal Kombat 11, moreover, could be the turning point, since as regards the mechanics it is undoubtedly the most tactical, reasoned, and difficult to learn of the saga, thanks to the large quantity of innovations introduced. Let's start from the basics, given that this Mortal Kombat maintains a combo system very close to the previous ones (known as the ~target combo system~, which does not require stellar timing when entering commands to link normals and other moves) where all characters have short series of attacks which - if properly linked to the specials or the shots they throw into the air - can bring great advantages, but also to discover themselves due to the vulnerability of the most dangerous combinations. Where, however, in the previous episodes overcoming the enemy's defense often led to frightening damage, here the combos have been heavily limited, and while there is no shortage of characters capable of making disasters on the corner (or with a little cunning), it results enormously more difficult in the game to empty the opponent's life bar. Everything is intended to underline the importance of the neutral in battle: the game on the ground from medium distance, even if the terminology is now used to indicate the perfect management of spaces and the careful use of the various moves to start the attack in a situation of neutrality on the ground. In Mortal Kombat 11, basically, the fundamentals are everything, and battles are won millimeter by millimeter, using the most efficient combos, and playing with the brain. Each mechanic is built around this philosophy, starting with an energy bar divided into two defensive notches and two offensive notches, designed to offer enhanced versions of blows, or indispensable maneuvers to limit the enemy's aggressiveness and bring the situation back to normal. even. Think, for example, that one of the most interesting innovations is represented by the Krushing Blows, shots with special effects if certain conditions are completed in their execution, useful for inflicting enormous damage or lengthening combos. They can only be used once per type per match (and the characters only have a handful of them), yet they are essential to turn the tables, so abusing them is harmful. Less well the Fatal Blows, a sort of ~X-Ray~ with long animations, usable at 30% of life points. They're a sensible recovery mechanic that can only be used once per game, for heaven's sake, but we would have preferred to see them disappear once parried or wasted, instead they recharge shortly after missing the target. The balance of the dead Going into more detail, the defensive maneuvers available to the player include a rapid fall with invulnerability that interrupts the combos with a throw in the middle (replaces the combo breaker of other NetherRealm games, but it is equally fundamental) a lateral roll after being placed down, and two attacks while getting up, one of which is vulnerable but able to start a combo and the other invulnerable to stop the offensive pressure of an overzealous player. Add to these already remarkable options the presence of a perfect parry, from which you can start a counter-move with similar functionality - always provided you have the slash available - and you will get a commendable range of possibilities in defense, which makes it impossible to attack head-on low against an expert user. Of course, all this goodness is not easy to learn, even for those familiar with the brand; NetherRealm has therefore come to the aid of newbies with one of the most complete tutorials in history, with courses dedicated to each individual mechanic, and a more than worthy explanation of all the fundamental foundations of the genre. In other words, given its not extreme speed, the tacticity of the system, and the incredibly detailed training mode, Mortal Kombat 11 is a fabulous game to start jumping seriously into fighting games. Moving beyond the mass of mechanics that we have just described, one of the key features of the tenth chapter has been maintained: the possibility of using multiple variants of the characters. Only now we are not talking about fixed archetypes, but even about lost optionsnalizable, in whose three slots it is possible to equip extra special moves, to enormously change the style of the chosen fighter. This gives rise to multiple effective combinations in the already large roster (we are talking about 24 characters, if we count an unlockable warrior in the campaign that we will not reveal, and Shao Khan available for anyone who pre-orders the game), but also to several problems related primarily to balancing, and then to competitive. Let's explain ourselves better: balancing a roster with three variants per character is already challenging (and in fact Mortal Kombat X had its problems in this regard), so imagine how difficult it can be to do it when there are customizable variants of the same; NetherRealm therefore had to limit the effectiveness of certain moves, decreasing the preponderance of zoning, limiting the devastation caused by certain specializations, and generally trying not to make anything overly powerful (so much so that certain options require two slots to be equipped, instead of only one). On the whole it seems to us that the work has succeeded rather well, even if it is really too early to evaluate the effective strength of the combatants in the field, and only later will various and possible errors be noticed. In the network, but without Cyrax The second problem? It is related to competitive, and more precisely to tournaments. Since there are no more archetypes, now the problem of the most efficient variants takes over, which however are not immediately available for the various characters (each one has only a default pair, and those remain until you go to the customization menus). This prevents serious players from taking advantage of certain versions of fighters that may be particularly effective, because they simply have not been included among the ~possibilities~ by the developers. In fact, in tournaments you will have to choose whether to use only basic versions of the warriors, or to allow - with all the organizational delays that derive from it - everyone to use their favorite variant. A decent mess, which NetherRealm itself has decided to solve internally by embracing the limitation: in online ranked games, the customized variants are not usable, and it is mandatory to choose the default ones. It will be interesting to see if in the future the house decides to change things, or insert a ~quick skill equipment~ option to the character selection, also because we understand the needs related to balance, but certain ~fixed~ archetypes are not exactly fabulous, and could lead users to abandon some characters for the lack of their best skills in ranked (the problem, of course, does not exist in all the other modes, which ignore the general ranking and let you freely use any modified version). While we're talking about online, it's seriously worth rubbing your hands, because if you leave aside the question of customization Mortal Kombat 11 offers an impressive mass of options. The presence of normal games and lobbies is obvious, of course, but the return of the King of the Hill mode adds some panache, and there are even online battles between artificial intelligences, which allow you to create a team led by the CPU, which the player can adjust the trends. However, the functioning of ranked matches is quite unique: you will not challenge opposing players in series of single matches, but in a ~best of five~, where you will only obtain victory after having prevailed three times (or in case of premature abandonment of the enemy player). It's rare to see such a hardcore ranked mode and the idea tickles us a lot, also because, despite the absence of players linked to the test before the release, the matchmaking seems more than adequate. Killing it, online If, on the other hand, it is the netcode that worries you, mindful of the not rosy situation of the previous Mortal Kombats, we can reassure you with joy. Mortal Kombat 11 online is a fairy tale: very fluid, with almost non-existent latency, a remarkable speed in finding opponents, and very few hiccups. The work done by NetherRealm on this aspect is truly extraordinary, and even indicates the type of connection of the player (whether wi-fi or cable) as well as the actual stability. We still don't know if everything will be as solid at launch as it was in the beta or during our test, of course, but expectations are really good given the performance observed. Now, described like this, Mortal Kombat 11 seems to be the closest to perfection in the genre: a fabulous combination of excellent mechanics, sublime content, great online, and amazing technical sector; yet we are not faced with an absolutely flawless game.
