Behind the sci-fi graphics and the dramatic use of shots, users were surprised to find themselves faced with a good game, fun and exciting, as well as convincing in online multiplayer. The fourth chapter was made to wait longer than normally happens for a normal EA sports series, therefore it is reasonable to expect various evolutions to the contents and the game structure, in addition to the steps forward from a technical point of view, a sector in which the game is already it shone. And evolutions have undoubtedly taken place: honed and cleaned up, the game appears even more beautiful to look at, but it is above all in the depth of the contents offered and in the quantity of options available that this new chapter evolves the series towards a new qualitative level. Following the program common to all EA Sports sports simulations (from FIFA to NHL, to name two) Fight Night Round 4 offers, alongside the usual multiplayer or the occasional ~fast~ clash, also an accurate single player experience, characterized by different managerial and managerial elements, as well as obviously from actual matches. It is therefore possible to follow the entire career of a boxer taking care of every detail: from the initial appearance, to training, from category changes to tournaments in which to participate, accepting contracts and (possibly) increasingly important meetings. In this way, it is possible to evolve and modify the statistics of your fighter, making him grow and strengthen and allowing us to immerse ourselves fully within that classic epic path that we have all had in our heads since Rocky. The boxer thus created can then obviously be used in online battles, adding a multiplayer dimension to the game world created by EA. The eyes of the Tiger There aren't many boxing simulations, at least based on a tendentially realistic reproduction of the sport: the particular rhythm of the fights, the tactics underlying the approach with the opponent and the relative scarcity of solutions for the attack and defense make the boxing perhaps less naturally reproducible in game, at least if you try to follow the canons established for the fight video game, while keeping the spirit of the sport intact. The path taken by EA is not that of the fighting game in the form of boxing, where the latter bends to the logic of the genre, but instead tends to faithfully reproduce the atmosphere and dynamics typical of this sport: more than spectacular moves and rhythms fast, here the timing chosen for the attack and defense is rewarded, the strategic choice of the part of the body to hit and the careful management of one's fighter's resources, divided here into health, stamina (physical power) and ability to defend oneself from attacks. Even if perhaps something more could have been done to force the players into an even more tactical approach (often hitting furiously is rewarded more than one would expect from a simulation of this type), absolute control over one's boxer in order to obtain good results with a certain continuity. This fourth chapter is based on an entirely new control system, which entrusts all the shots to the movements of the right analog stick, assisted by pressing the triggers, backbones and the other analog for defense and dodging, while the normal keys are dedicated to ~forbidden blows~ or to the ~embrace~ of the opponent. The system allows for a wide range of solutions, permitting a series of differentiated strokes divided in parallel between the right and left arm, but all this also makes it more difficult to fully master the techniques, given the need to perform very precise movements with the sticks. An in-depth preparation becomes necessary to master all the various techniques available with knowledge, which on the other hand does justice to the vast background built for the single player mode, where it is possible to train and make our fighter grow to the fullest. In the heart of the action, the game fully captures the spirit of boxing: two giants facing each other, punching, blocking and dodging in a ring. No escape route or ranged attack, everything is played on intuition and immediate reaction, trying to undermine the opposing defense and attack right where it hurts most, up to the bell. Between rounds EA ha particular mini-game has been inserted: in fact, it is possible to invest some points conquered during the fight to cure the boxer according to the three parameters that indicate his state of health. A particular mention must be made for the quality of the online game, practically free of latency problems, at least in most cases, demonstrating the great work that the EA teams continue to put into the code purely dedicated to online multiplayer. From the gym to the Staples Centre The new Canadian development team responsible for Fight Night Round 4 has managed to get perfectly in tune with the new EA sports productions: here too, all efforts are made, as well as offering a satisfying gaming experience, also to bring down the player fully in the dimension of sport. You breathe the air of boxing, starting from the somewhat patched-up gym where we will take our first steps in the ring, to get to the international arenas, where the great boxing show is reproduced with all its surrounding elements, including lights, audience into a frenzy, enthusiastic commentary and pompous presentations of the fighters. However, the road to success is long, as demonstrated by the game's in-depth single player career: here it is possible to choose a real-life boxer (from a huge roster of 48 characters, including real legends such as Ali and Tyson) or create one one from scratch, by accessing the typical editor and distributing ~experience points~ (which can also be accumulated during game progression) in the various statistics that characterize the athlete, in a similar way to what happens in other EA sports simulations. The meetings in the ring alternate with long training sessions, aimed at accumulating the aforementioned experience points, which it is possible to have the CPU simulate entirely or carry out in first person, through some mini-games. These, although functional in varying the gaming experience, and in some cases useful for metabolizing some gaming techniques, often prove to be quite frustrating, so much so that the automatic attribution of bonuses is preferred for less patient players. With the usual care of EA Sports, Fight Night Round 4 also allows you to manage the progression of our character in the world of boxing in an almost total way, while calculating a huge number of statistics and variables that create a convincing background around our aspiring champion . The career then rises to a new level of vitality with the inclusion of the Online World Championship, a mode that projects our fighter into a global multiplayer context, allowing us to face matches against other players while remaining within the characteristic structure of the Legacy. Xbox 360 goals As per tradition, Fight Night Round 4 offers 1000 points to collect for gamerscore, divided into 33 unlockable achievements. The latter are achieved both by advancing in the single mode (the Legacy) and by playing online in multiplayer, obtaining particular results and obviously winning the matches, with the richest prizes reserved for the conquest of the various belts, the completion of the career and the victory against the most popular opponents in CPU fights. Like a direct in the face In this fourth chapter, the feature that basically made the previous Fight Night print in the minds of the players remains: the impressive graphics sector. This is a game for which the overused word ~photorealism~ can be spent on closer inspection: also thanks to the necessary compromises given by the subject in question, which does not allow excessive graphic flourishes or profound variations on the theme, what we see on the screen is the closest to reality we have seen in modern video games. The wrestlers are colossal and perfectly defined, made up of an enormous number of polygons and covered by textures that border on perfection, in the reproduction of the skin, which progressively smoothes out during matches due to sweat, while the faces become more and more tried under the incessant blows. A great effort has been made to try to make the animations as fluid and realistic as possible, which together with the excellent management of contacts between the models keeps the risk of making the characters appear as simple mechanical puppets at a distance: launching a blow involves several reactions on the screen depending on whether this hits normally, crashes into the opponent's gloves, crosses with a corresponding blow from the opposite side or strikes the other completely by surprise. Each of these different situations is illustrated through different animations, which tie in perfectly with each other. To further emphasize the drama and exaltationand the clash then contribute to the movements of the camera and the particular angles used for the shots, as well as the occasional slow motion that seal the most critical moments of the match. Everything is properly accompanied by the soundtrack: apart from the usual plethora of licensed tracks, obviously based above all on the hip hop genre, it is the scene noises and the excellent commentary (in English, in the tested version) that accompany the staged action is perfect, and to contribute to the identification with what happens on the screen. On the other hand, the care placed in the technical sector is also simply reflected in the graphics of the menus and the surrounding elements (such as the graphics of the scenarios), which combine to flawlessly reproduce boxing in a polygonal format.", "date": "2009-07-09", "grade": "9.0"}
