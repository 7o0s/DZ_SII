After all, if an idea works, why not use it? Just create a special background, a story that acts as a glue, shamelessly Japanese little monsters, two kids to encourage the identification of the little ones, mix all this and shoot into space: et voil, Spectrobes. Which, mind you, aren't bad: on the contrary, the Disney franchise was a success in the West and the first episode for Nintendo DS, released in 2007, sold more than well. So after a sequel on the same laptop, it was worth taking the plunge and jumping on the Wii bandwagon. Step longer than the leg? Evolution! The transition from DS to Wii has greatly benefited the series, which now sports a remarkable 3D engine. As in the episodes for the portable console, even in Spectrobes: The Origins most of the settings are vast open areas, the greater computing power of the Wii has thus allowed the Genki developers to create obviously more detailed and suggestive locations, exhibiting wide-ranging alien panoramas, often assisted by various ambient sound effects and well-chosen music. The graphics engine does not present particular uncertainties during the exploratory phases, absurdly the indoor settings are the more anonymous ones, in which the camera, generally quite precise, tends to give some visual problems. As for the frequent fights, the enthusiasm is held back by common slowdowns that can be found especially in the presence of multiple enemies, above all the addition on the field of an adult Spectrobe and his pyrotechnic special shots definitely weighs down the graphics engine. The fluidity that characterizes the real-time clashes is therefore a little less, but not so tragically as to prevent a relaxed use of the game: the clashes remain quite spectacular thanks to the frenzy of the action and the variety of the creatures involved. If the Krawl enemies already differ a lot from each other, the Spectrobes are really many and their imaginative and colorful design makes each new specimen a pleasant discovery. The design is a cross between Pokmon and Digimon, mostly resembling the latter in menacing and battling adult forms. The remaining character design leaves something to be desired: the two protagonists Rallen and Jeena are decidedly anonymous, typical Japanese-style teenagers, but fortunately their polygonal models are well made and animated. Two for one A rather original feature of Spectrobes: Origins is the ~plug'n'play~ mode for two players. Essentially during a fight a second user can activate another Wiimote and take complete control of the Spectrobe on the field. It's a shame that the camera keeps following the first player, cutting out the Spectrobe, and then the second user, should he get too far away. Split-screen, this stranger... From stone to grill The rather original idea that characterizes the series concerns the acquisition of the Spectrobes: these little monsters are in fact obtained from the fossils that can be searched for and recovered during our space wanderings. The acquisition of a new Spectrobe is almost a game within the game: it is necessary to clean the fossil from the rough rock that encloses it by mimicking various tools via the Wiimote, the player's speed and precision determine the creature's statistics. The new Spectrobe will be a puppy, a sort of incubator that will allow us to raise him by offering him various objects as food and during the growth phase it will even be possible to photograph him. And then, of course, take it into battle. It should be noted that the Spectrobes are not only good at beating up other aliens: the peculiar abilities of the different types of Spectrobes expand our exploratory possibilities in a gradual process which, however, forces the player to carefully choose the right Spectrobes to take to fun. The fights involve the player directly: Rallen and Jeena have access to a considerable variety of weapons which more or less also changes the fighting style. During the clashes, therefore, the player can attack, dodge enemies and move freely around the battlefield but, at the same time, can shake the Wiimote to give orders to the Spectrobe on the field. By pressing a key it is possible to indicate the target while by pressing another button the Spectrobe can be replaced with another; by mastering these simple basic commands it is therefore possible to produce more or less complex combinations of attacks, culminating ineffective special attacks, executable by positioning and moving the controllers in a funny but rather original way. In the end, the battles in Spectrobes: The Origins cover most of the adventure, which is not particularly long, and around the middle it becomes necessary to train our creatures continuously to keep them up to date with the growing power of the enemies: luckily the battle system aforementioned is quite fun, even if plagued by intrusive technical problems such as a camera that is not always accurate and a rather incomplete artificial intelligence of Spectrobes and enemies.", "date": "2009-10-28", "grade": "7.5"}
