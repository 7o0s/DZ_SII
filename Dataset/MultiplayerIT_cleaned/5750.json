However, with Kung Fu Panda: Final Clash of Legendary Legends, the DreamWorks license changes style and, instead of arriving on the shelves with a tie-in in which to relive the adventures of the film, offers us a fighting game that closely follows the mechanics of Super Smash Bros. Really very close actually. But maybe not enough. Here comes Kung Fu Panda: Final Showdown of the Legendary Legends: who will be the most mythical of the legends? There is no price for mythicalness... From the first start, Kung Fu Panda: Final Clash of Legendary Legends does nothing to hide its derivation from Super Smash Bros. The combat system is in fact totally borrowed from the series created by Masahiro Sakurai: types of attacks, loots, parries ball. Even the Mythic attack is a clear take on the Final Smash. As in the Nintendo brawler, you fight in more or less dynamic scenarios, with the aim of throwing your opponents out of the game screen. By alternating the standard attacks with a fair number of special ones, which on PlayStation 4 are managed with the triangle and the right analog stick, the percentage of health points of the fighters is lowered, which in this way become less resistant to blows and can be thrown away with greater ease. This is the first small difference compared to Super Smash Bros., where by default the damage bar must be filled up to more than one hundred percent to obtain the same effect. Similarly, the management of the Mythic attack is also different, since in this case a personal indicator must be filled for each fighter before being able to perform the special move. Nothing totally original but, considering the fact that you can even activate the ability to jump using the left analog stick, the attempt to deviate from the reference model in some small things is still appreciable. However, it must be said that the guys from Vicious Cycle have managed to (re) create a fun combat system, perhaps less frenetic and less technical than that of Smash, but quite solid and diversified. You can count all the historical heroes of the series, including master Shifu, three of the five cyclones (Mantis and Viper are relegated to the role of supporters due to their size), well-known Kung Fu masters such as the old man Oogway, historical villains, such as Tai Lung and Lord Shen, and new characters coming directly from the new film (Mei Mei for example). There is also Po of course. The moves of the twenty available characters (plus Li Shan and Master Chicken, downloadable for free) are as absurd as they are effective: the roster thus manages to make challenges with friends always exciting, especially locally, where you can measure yourself in different ways, in teams or in free-for-all matches in which a maximum of four players can take part. There are eight different types of clashes: classics such as timed matches and/or matches with a predefined number of lives are joined by novelties such as the King of Kung Fu, Master of Inner Peace, Eat as much as you can and Summit of Kung Fu (translation approximate of English Kung Fu Hill). The first two are a sort of hot potato, where you have to hold onto a crown for as long as possible while everyone else tries to get it back with punches. In particular, Master of Inner Peace differs from King of Kung Fu because you cannot hit your opponents while in possession of the precious object. Eat as much as you can instead requires you to collect the ravioli dropped by your opponents after each blow suffered: you start with one hundred ravioli each and victory obviously goes to whoever has the most when the time limit expires. Finally, Vetta del Kung Fu is a sort of ~king of the hill~ mode, where the player who manages to stay alone for the longest time within a circumference that delimits the area of influence of a flag wins. Playstation 4 trophies Kung Fu Panda Showdown of Legendary Legends has 25 trophies, four of which require you to play online. The objectives are all quite simple, but reaching platinum is by no means a walk in the park: the ~Master Panda~ gold trophy requires thousands of experience points and, with the servers practically empty, the undertaking becomes almost impossible if you don't have at least one friend willing to sacrifice himself for the cause. In this case, get ready to spend many hours of your time: in fact, a minimum of 625 victories are required to reach the rank of Master Panda. And not even for the attractiveness! What, however,I am not convinced about Kung Fu Panda: Showdown of the legendary legends is the amount of offline content. In fact, if we exclude a few evenings with friends, the package offered by Little Orbit is really poor: a tournament mode that can be tackled at five difficulty levels, a training mode and one of the worst structured tutorials in the history of video games. Indeed, each basic aspect is explained in separate sections, which cannot be accessed in sequence and which require you to go through loading times that take up more time than you spend in the ring to learn challenging moves such as jumping or two-dimensional movement . When it comes to attacks, however, we carefully avoid explaining the alternative commands to be managed with the right stick. In short, learning in the field is certainly the best solution. This is why the Tournament of Legends, the only pastime dedicated to solitary players, comes in handy: introduced by a short scene in computer graphics that hurriedly explains the reason for the tournament, in fact the competition ends up being a long training session to try out new characters. In fact, the ten clashes follow predefined modalities, leaving out of the lot Vetta del Kung Fu and Master of Inner Peace, and move, based on the character and the type of clash, through the twelve available scenarios (but, if we exclude the purely aesthetics, they could very well have been half, if not less). Even the final boss is, so to speak, personalized, while all other matches are random. However, there are no great reasons to try each fighter: the game does not offer any unlockable content, since even the biographies of the characters and the credits are visible from the beginning. The artificial intelligence is then deficient from various points of view, it is afflicted by various glitches (such as the impossibility of descending from certain ledges) and, although it is difficult when in numerical superiority, not even on ~legend~ difficulty is it able to be an opponent valid. Probably for this reason online there is total desolation: endless matchmaking, accompanied by the excellent soundtrack, more often end up in frustration dances than in real kung fu matches. There is talk of waiting times around ten minutes, if you are lucky. This is followed by a strictly 1-on-1 match, also afflicted by obvious latency problems. And it's really a shame because Little Orbit, despite the many localization problems, evident right from the game page in the Italian store, had in its hands a very well-finished visual title, generally fluid and a license that seems to have been created specifically to be transposed into a fighting game.", "date": "2016-01-27", "grade": "5.7"}
