{"name": "Pillowfight", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pillowfight.html", "text": "Passed off as a new trend to keep fit by the usual not very reliable ~news~, mostly seen on TV during some women's wrestling matches, pillowfighting (~pillowfight~, in fact) is nothing more than a low-grade entertainment caliber, designed more than anything else to show the generous curves of the ~wrestlers~. The new product developed by Capybara Games certainly draws on the sexy component of this ~discipline~, however placing it in a decidedly serious and technical context, made up of many variables, timing and special moves. You would never have guessed it, huh? The main game mode of Pillowfight is the career, and it allows you to play the role of an attractive female fighter in her climb to success in a series of matches of increasing difficulty. The action takes place in the best of three rounds, in which you will have to hit the opponent using only the pillow and alternating high and low blows, as well as dodges and parries. Our character can be enhanced as we proceed, with the availability of new pillows (different in attack, defense and special shot potential) or simply with a change of costume. In practice, Pillowfight is extremely intuitive and immediate, given that it is possible to perform all the actions using only the joystick of the mobile phone: by pressing up, you fire a high blow, by pressing forward, a low blow, while down is used to parry (attention: you still lose some energy) and behind to dodge. In addition to the energy bar, we will have to pay attention to two other indicators on the screen: a ~breath~ bar, which empties when we waste energy on attacks that are parried or dodged, and a special move bar, which once full it allows us to produce ourselves (by pressing the FIRE button) in a very powerful attack. This particular fighting game does not only offer the career mode, on the contrary it allows us to try our hand at quick encounters, in a training session, in a survival mode or in an ~outside the ring~ mode, in which rather than tearing the opponent to pieces we will have to push her out of the square with our attack combinations. But what about the technical realization of the game? Well, it's really good: the wrestlers are all very beautiful girls, as was to be expected. What is surprising is that they are really well designed and boast a quantity and quality of animation well above the average mobile products.
