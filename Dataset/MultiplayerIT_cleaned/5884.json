Since its inception (we are talking about the distant 1999) the series has been in the hands of Camelot, a small but talented Japanese software house. It's not that this is the first ~sequel~, but it's certainly the first to be so similar to the previous chapter. And let's point out another anomaly, as long as it makes sense to call it that, and that is that those bases we talked about were introduced right on the portable console. This fact cannot leave us indifferent, and before going into detail about the latest Camelot work, it is natural to elaborate a simple reflection: if for the main episodes of Zelda or Super Mario the hypothesized Nintendo Fusion can present both pros and cons , for everything else it's just the right move to make. Portable and home gaming have never been so close, and titles never so expensive to make: sharing software for Nintendo is no longer a hypothesis, but a necessity. To avoid duplication (like the last two Mario Tennis), but above all to save time to devote to other - and more numerous - games. Nintendo Fusion, we remind the forgetful, is the rumored name of the next platform of the Japanese company, since before the word ~NX~ was revealed. Nomenclature aside, it should be both a fixed and portable console or, alternatively (more credible for us), an ecosystem of platforms capable of sharing the same software. Well, now let's talk about Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash, a game that could have been much more beautiful than it actually is. Three years after the portable episode Mario Tennis returns: a waste of potential, unfortunately Topspin and backspin Let's start our analysis by talking about the positive aspects of the game, starting from the control system, reactive and precise as can be expected from such a production. We were also particularly struck by the rendering of the ball, the reproduction of the various shots and the interaction between these two elements: it was already good in the Nintendo 3DS episode, here it has been further refined. The shots, although exaggerated in the trajectories and in the insertion of colored trails, follow the real ones: the topspin, with the rotation from top to bottom and the deep rebound, the backspin, with the opposite effect and with a short rebound, and the shot flat, unique without rotation but capable of generating greater speed. To these add drop shot and lob, to tell the truth not implemented as well or modular as the previous ones listed, and you will have the complete picture of the available actions. The volleys could be improved, not as effective as in reality (and all too simple to implement), but in general we really can't complain: the shots are really well done and ~exaggerated~ to the right point, and even the timing has a worthy importance, given that it is necessary to load the shot well before impacting the ball. We will return to this discussion, but as mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph, we will now continue to talk about the merits of this game: the characters are well differentiated, both in terms of strokes and movements. The discussion is very similar to the one made on strokes: they take up the characteristics of real tennis players, but they take them to the extreme a bit. Boo for example is based on cunning, a skilled Dolgopolov dedicated to unpredictable and spectacular shots, generates unrealistic but absolutely credible and understandable parabolic trajectories. Mario is usually the complete athlete, the one suitable for those who love classic tennis (and Roger Federer): clean and pure strokes, with the ability to adapt to any opponent. The only drawback in this area, also inherited from the Nintendo 3DS, is the definition of ~defensive~: in reality, defensive characters protect nothing but the network, so they are the ones who, even if guided by the CPU, attack the most ( see Waluigi, who proposes repeating serve & volley). Toad is a little Agassi, very fast with his feet and with a robust two-handed backhand: yes, a two-handed backhand represented in a big way, and here we come to the last great quality, namely the aspect of the game. The graphics are truly admirable, above all thanks to the cleanliness of the image, the lighting system and the beautiful animations, which are not only harmonious but, as mentioned for the strokes, credible when compared to ~real~ tennis. Haunted circles Now you may think that Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash is a must-have game, and we really wish it were; because the qualities just described reside in the most essential and important area, as well as the most difficult to shape, i.e. in the interaction and in the control system. But, ahemhey, the merits of the work actually end there, and that's a real shame. The first flaw to report, a game design choice that we really can't approve of, is the ease with which ~hit~ shots are obtained. We have said that timing is important, but in reality it must be added to the position with respect to the ball: a factor that, in the last two Mario Tennis games, has been totally neglected. The character adjusts his position by himself until he covers the ideal one, moving autonomously (if necessary) for about a third of the field. A really exaggerated ease of execution, with two harmful consequences. The first, of course, is that fenced shots practically do not exist: they are very rare and, when they do happen, the cause is not clear. The second is that, to vary these games full of perfect shots, super shots have been introduced, colored circles to reach and from which to launch even more powerful shots. A questionable choice that transforms clashes between two skilled players into ~reach the circle~, a dynamic further compromised by the randomness of these bewitched platforms: excluding the purple circles under the net, which appear once the opponent is cornered, the others are disconnected from the progress of the game, making it unpredictable (and understandable). And Wimbledon? If the number of characters is acceptable - including those to be unlocked, you get to sixteen - as well as their variety, an area in which the game amazes in the negative is represented by the few available modes. In this field it is truly the poorest episode of Camelot ever made. Here too the intention of approaching the casual public is clear, including those who don't like tennis: for the first time, in fact, the game betrays its original sport, relegating it to a sedentary mode. No tournaments, no cups. The main single player mode is a sort of climb to success in which you have to face opponents in sequence, rivals who get stronger and stronger: but you don't really play tennis. Because, in addition to the already mentioned magic circles, there are mushrooms that make you giant and that mark the rhythm of the games: as specified above, the game becomes a sort of ~pick up the mushroom, reach the circle~, in which the timing and placement matter too little. Not only that: in this mode the match is a tie-break, or rather a mini-game in which whoever reaches seven points first wins. Another type of encouraged game is hit and run, a game organized on the fly, an exhibition in both single and double, alone or in multiplayer, which also contemplates both mushrooms and circles. Speaking of multiplayer, we really have to praise (for once!) the GamePad: finally, dividing yourself between the controller and the television, there is the possibility of always playing while observing your tennis player's back. The only mini game included is a dribble with a giant ball to be done with the CPU, fun, but really too little to be satisfied. Finally, classic tennis, stuck in a corner of the main menu, where you can finally also remove the magic circles (and the ultra smashes, the dunks with super jump): however, playing like this, despite being a purer experience, highlights the flaw we raised earlier, namely the excessive ease with which the ball is perfectly centered. The fields - like the rest of the characters - are well made and differentiated, both traditional and caricatured ones. The possibility of using and training amiibo has also been included, similar to Super Smash Bros.: they could prove useful for completing the game in single player, given that the CPU, at maximum difficulty, is almost unbeatable. It is even frustrating, given that he often ~cheats~ by moving well in advance. It remains only to talk about the online, which unfortunately has not improved compared to the Nintendo 3DS: it is still spartan. It goes quite smoothly once you find a competitor - the game tends to prefer geographically close opponents - but the choice not to support the friends list is regrettable, effectively making each encounter random.", "date": "2015-11-18", "grade": "6.8"}
