{"name": "UEFA 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/uefa-2002.html", "text": "What are you saying?? All this madness to arrive at the following conclusion: if you have the chance to do better than a dominant title in a certain genre, then do it .. otherwise forget it and jump on something else. Is this the consideration that, after playing it, I should ideally address the team that created Uefa 2002? NO..but first things first.. The latest effort by Take 2 Interactive deals specifically with what is now the only European football competition at Club level that manages to arouse the interest of the masses. The game in question is therefore limited to the Champions League, and as you can imagine this is undoubtedly a risky choice. It must be admitted, however, that the Champions League in this game has really been explored down to the smallest detail in terms of possibilities and variety of game ; in addition to the normal Champions League updated to the last season and very precise in the details and data of the players, teams, stadiums, etc., there are several alternative modes .. for example it is possible to step into the shoes of valiant champions of the past, or better than players from teams that have won the trophy in the past marking an era (Milan in '90, Juve in '98, Grande Real, and so on). The options are really many and not even the most fussy of fans will be able to laugh about the longevity of the game and the options offered. I must admit that, even if it is not the first time that something like this has been proposed, scoring with Van Basten and brushing an assist with Rivera is something that always gives me a certain satisfaction. Also from the point of view of strength calibration, it seems to me that a good job has been done, although players and teams from such different eras can be evaluated from a footballing point of view. Penalty is, when referee blows his whistle Let's go back to a quote from Uncle Vuja to mention a nagging problem in football games of a certain level.. the severity of the referee. To arrive at productions that are ever closer to Simulation and less and less to Arcade, this is a factor to be taken into careful consideration. Generally, in almost all the games of the latest generation, the severity of the referee can be set by options, but if I have to be honest, he almost never caught me for ~reliability~..often increasing the severity of our jacket -green-black yes it had the opposite effect. In UEFA this does not happen. The arbiter ACTUALLY changes depending on the settings and I have to say that it turns out to be quite satisfactory. To tell the truth, Uefa does not shine for the number of options and various setting possibilities. Those that are there, however, seem well calibrated and fully perform their task .. but surely, could have been done better. The now inevitable Editing section of the players and teams is present, which perhaps does not present the possibilities offered by the latest Fifa, but this too works properly, with the possibility of changing the name and characteristics of the players, in addition to the team and other factors. Where Uefa definitely disappoints is in the section dedicated to training, now inevitable in all games of this type. In fact, it's like playing a quick friendly game against 1 opponent + the goalkeeper, to practice the game controls. The absence of options and choices in general is a really bad blow for this section and for the game in general, especially if you are part of that class of maniacs who spend hours perfecting every detail. To the assault my brave! If you are thinking that the title is exaggerated, remember that football ~symbolizes the defense of the dearest loved ones from the assaults of enemies, to whom offenses are returned verbatim~. With this sborone quote stolen from the great Gianni Brera, we begin to talk about more serious things, specifically, about what is the true soul of the game.. the game with all its aspects. Let's start with those strictly related to the game; first of all it must be said that I liked the general layout of UEFA, very similar to that of the Fifa series and therefore rather tested. In general, however, UEFA demonstrates that it does not have many flaws attributable to similar football productions on store shelves; it's not exaggerated, in the sense that you will never see a bicycle kick goal from midfield (if you exclude the goalkeeper's clearance, often so comical that scoring on the rebound is usually child's play); the animations are well done and the movements are quite natural, almost never exceeding in circus numbers. All this coIt definitely helps to increase the feeling of realism of the game, especially taking into account that they are all teams that are quite similar in values and goals are hardly seen. The game itself is quite exciting anyway and the longevity in the tournament formulas has helped me play this title a lot. From a graphic point of view, Uefa is not a title that will go down in history from this point of view, but we really can't complain. Everything is made with good attention to detail (perhaps except for the faces of the players, which are not always too realistic) and the whole game environment is visually decidedly pleasant. Playing a lot, I've never found relevant flaws from this point of view, nor pixels that magically appeared somewhere on the field... Same speech from the sound point of view, pleasant and almost never invasive, as often happens with other titles. The effects are of good quality and intelligently ~placed~ in the game system. The classic conclusion.. Uefa is not the game that will keep you glued to the screen for weeks; Uefa is not the game that changed the standards of games of this genre; Uefa is not an absolute masterpiece.. but it is certainly an excellently made game, with good attention to detail and intelligence, without proposing anything too innovative but proposing the best or almost the best in many situations. If you are a fan of the Italian opium of the people, Uefa is certainly the title for you and you will be able not to get bored for a long time, especially if you are already tested by the Fifa series. Otherwise, if football is not that thing that makes you lose sleep, UEFA does not offer anything particularly different from the usual, and therefore perhaps you would do better to look elsewhere. But the game is worth it...and if the ball doesn't make you nauseous...or you want to make up for the disappointments of your favorite team, the 2002 UEFA Champions League is a must-play, without any doubt... Introduction In every videogame genre, as indeed in every field of life, it is known that when you do something that must (attempt to) excel you have to deal with your opponents, even better if in the planning phase. This probably applies above all to niche sectors, but considering all genres as such, seen from the point of view of the hard core that follows them and not from the casual players, one could say that in order to ~clear~ the market, or at least to make sense in terms of the market, to a production of a certain thickness, something highly innovative or revolutionary must be brought. Let's take an example.. Anglo-Saxon-designed managerial games, considered the cousins of classic football games, come out on average about ten a year, and almost all of a good level. However, none of these manages to establish itself in the slightest, if we exclude the PcCalcio series, which however has very different methods of distribution and production (essentially, it costs much less). This happens, as it is easy to understand, because the interest (and hours of play) of fans of the genre are almost entirely dedicated to Championship Manager (or Scudetto), a cult which, albeit slowly, has gained a community that btw still pales in comparison to the masses of Northern European countries...", "date": "2002-03-15", "grade": null}
