{"name": "Colin McRae 2005: ritorna il mito", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/colin-mcrae-2005-ritorna-il-mito.html", "text": "the legendary Subaru this is what is meant by blur effect Colin vs Flatout: 0/5 - 1 The engine that manages the damage is always the same but still amazing for how it regulates the loss or wear of the components: scrapes, blows, pieces that leave until they are completely destroyed, driving imprudently you risk finding yourself without doors or worse without a wheel, making an ordeal the next path. What leaves us perplexed is the physics of the objects: how is it possible that by hitting a stone post (of those with a reflector) it flies away on first impact while the one immediately after remains immovable, devastating the front of the car? Meh! Even road cartels have the same problem: they fly lightly or remain implanted. Ok we didn't hope for the Havoc but after trying Flatout (where each object moves according to realistic physics) these things make us turn up our noses a bit, considering that a collision causes you to lose precious seconds sometimes even jamming the vehicle. The advice is to avoid anything, on pain of wasting time with consequent frustration (which occurs quite a lot). ...cars made very well and equipped with reflections, dirt, quality textures, all on low resolution scenarios. the lighthouses are there; lit for beauty here is what is meant by low resolution The snow falls As far as graphics are concerned, we are faced with the by now outdated engine of the previous game (which in the end is the evolution of that of Colin 3!) partly retouched for the occasion. So machines made well and equipped with reflections, dirt, quality textures, all on low resolution scenarios. Again we find the introduction of a blur effect that blurs objects in the distance giving the screen a television image appearance. If in replays it performs well in the game on the move, it becomes more of a gimmick to try to hide the poor realization of the scenarios, full of objects poor in polygons and consequently ~sharp~ areas (such as curves on asphalt). The most serious damage is that the graphic cleaning is affected even at the highest resolutions (with antialiasing and anisotropic filter), the motion blur then jumps out even in case of shocks temporarily blurring the image; one could easily do without it. Still, it's still a decent show, but pretty much identical to last year's game. Also this time we don't race at night and the car headlights illuminate absolutely nothing! (in rainy and dark scenarios the lighting would certainly not have hurt). The particle effects are good as always, with the nice addition of the leaves that fall from the trees when you bump into them; we also (finally) find the inclusion of two more views (five in total) that allow you to choose the view that best suits you. ~Fifth right, up hill...~ In the audio sector we are at excellent levels, as Colin 04 already was, the use of the EAX Advanced HD is perfect and every noise is in its place. The sounds related to the type of terrain are also beautiful, from gravel to asphalt, each one appropriate to the environment. The co-drivers are the real ones for each team and the advice always comes at the right time and doesn't prove annoying. The addition of new cars also refers to the sound, powerful and diversified for each vehicle. If you have a Soundblaster Audigy 2 and a 5.1 system you will have an incredible sound experience! raindrops on me... the car selection screen Internet, LAN or Split screen? Multiplayer offers us various possibilities, using Gamespy for online games you will enjoy excellent playability thanks to the ghost cars (derived from Colin 04) which eliminate all damage updates; in fact you will see your opponents as a transparent shadow, so no collisions and possibility to play decently even with a 56k modem. The LAN allows you to challenge eight pilots while a welcome novelty is the introduction of the split screen up to four players (!) simultaneously on the same PC. All this does not weigh much on the processor compared to the single game and if you have more joypads and three friends, fun is guaranteed! Well done! Obviously, here too you will not have any accidents with your opponents and the aim is to reach the finish line before the others. [C] the excellent spit screen the legendary Mini Cooper [/C] Comment Colin McRae 2005 arrives ahead of its time unfortunately revealing a simple updated version in the fleet and tracks (although some things know already seen) and offering the split screen to four players. It would have been better if Codemasters had taken more time to improve the learning curve and the graphics engine (dating back to version 3) because so the expensea would be justified if the game were sold as a data disk at an affordable price. The frustration that can arise makes it against the fans of arcade games. For those approaching the series for the first time, the purchase is recommended provided they expect a hard mess while Colin fans who already have the previous version consider whether to pay for this updated edition, which is certainly not the revolution that everyone they expected. Pros: Many cars and tracks Guaranteed longevity Split screen in four Cons: Difficult learning curve Fluctuating physics Graphics of the environments can be improved Second to none The good Colin reaches the fifth appointment with the saga that has established itself as a yardstick in rally simulations, but this time it does so with a revised copy of the previous edition, raising doubts about the ability of Codemasters to renew itself after only a few months. From the outset we immediately notice the similarities between the two titles, also the same in the menus: in addition to the championship mode (in which you will play the anonymous driver) we find the career (in which you will have to face a whole series of competitions) and the challenges, where you race against time or other opponents. Passing certain tests involves unlocking new cars, which are divided into different categories: ranging from the classic 4WD through 4x4, off-road, group B, historical models (including the legendary Mini!), etc. for a truly remarkable set of cars. In addition, the upgrades are still present, i.e. special accessories (such as improved tires or brakes) that are obtained by facing special races. There are eight routes for each country (in total we have nine states so 72 tracks!) even if some look like modified versions of the old ones (especially in Japan). Unfortunately Codemasters has left the difficulty curve unchanged from the past game, so for newbies it means a lot of sweat to shed to master the car decently on courses that prove to be really treacherous at times: a boulder or the entry into a ditch is enough to compromising race times. The initial frustration level is high but over time you start having fun; the advice is to start with a docile car like the Peugeot 206 and then move on to something more powerful.", "date": "2004-12-07", "grade": null}
