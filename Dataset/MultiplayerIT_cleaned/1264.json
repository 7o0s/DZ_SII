{"name": "La recensione di Perimeter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-recensione-di-perimeter.html", "text": "The perimeter and the area This is more or less the story behind Perimeter (I know it's not true but did you feel like reading the usual fairy tale of human emigrants and angry aliens?) which, for the uninitiated, is a strategic time real equipped with some decidedly original characteristics. Once the game has started, you are immediately faced with very different problems compared to the canons of the genre. Firstly there is only one resource to manage which is ~extracted~ simply by building energy nodes (called ~Energy~). Secondly, the classic scheme is not respected: collect resources, build buildings, generate troops and attack. Indeed, often the situation is completely reversed with the need to immediately put up substantial defenses that allow the construction of key infrastructures to be protected. The third novelty is terraforming which deserves a separate discussion. In Perimeter you find yourself visiting wild planets controlled by aliens. The land will not always be favorable to colonization and therefore you will have to work to fix the situation by making everything more friendly. The question is resolved, at the level of gameplay, with the need to ~draw~ the area of the zones in which our units must operate the territorial transformations. Obviously the realization of the latter is not immediate and the work done can be slowed down, blocked or overturned in the event that the opponents take over. Terraforming is the central element of the game since obtaining additional building land allows you to build new energy nodes so as to have more resources available. The nodes will not, however, only serve this. Thanks to them, in the case of lack or scarcity of defenses of another nature, we could put up an energy shield that will protect the entire perimeter (hence the name of the game) created by the network generated precisely by the nodes built and put in contact between They. The shield is impenetrable even if it costs a lot in terms of energy so as to make its intensive use not recommended, or at least, making it more useful to act on limited areas and more at risk of attack. Three is the perfect number Another substantial change is the management of the army. We will not have the ability to create all units immediately. Indeed, we will basically have only three troops who will be able to evolve, thanks to the use of nanotechnologies, into more advanced ones and able to get by in different situations. Despite having all the technological advances available that make it possible to create any troop, there is actually no standard army composition rule that makes it effective in all circumstances. On the contrary, depending on the objectives, teams made specifically to address the immanent needs will have to be preferred. This requires the player to be able to understand the difficulties that are about to fall upon us before starting to build random units following a principle of mere power. Furthermore, we will only be able to create a handful of teams to send against enemies or to use to defend certain areas. Thus, in case we have to attack locations protected by the sea we will certainly have to opt for flying units while, in case we have to defend a key location we will have to opt for a greater number of troops with weapons of greater range even if with limited resistance. To help us there will be the classic defensive constructions that will prove essential in some circumstances. Gameplay The typical mission of Perimeter is: we have arrived in a hostile area, let's build as many nodes as possible and defend ourselves from the enemies. Said like this, it seems easy but as soon as you start playing you realize that the challenge is really high and frenzy is the feeling that reigns during the games: the enemies immediately attack en masse, putting anyone who wanted to try more classic tactics in difficulty and calm. The problems multiply relentlessly, depriving the player of the opportunity to catch his breath. Structures are built with an eye always kept on the small map at the bottom right of the screen, so as not to miss yet another attack. In Perimeter every mistake is heavily sanctioned. The lack of timeliness or the loss of a key energy node makes it impossible to counter the enemies who assault and destroy everything without any pause or mercy. Sometimes it feels like playing a puzzle game. Elements are positioned in the maps trying to understand the optimal way of doing it thought in advance by the developers. An interpretative run-up rather than a free action that allows you to obtain certain fruits. Paradoxically, the maps with the poorest design and the most stripped of details arethose that allow the player to express himself to the fullest. This is perhaps Perimeter's biggest limitation: the perception of the distance between us and the game, between the possibilities we would like to experience and the reality that binds us to schemes that allow only a few digressions. The condemnation seems to come from the name: from the awareness of being faced with something new which, precisely because it is new, does not dare to go beyond its basic concept. There is almost the terror of leaving the player the possibility of wandering ... as if a misunderstanding of intentions is feared. The way of discretion Aliens always attack en masse. Graphically we are on excellent levels. The maps are very well done and the fractals are well suited to the style of play. There are no too extensive schemes as could happen in a Spellforce, but everything is functional to the action which is placed, as already mentioned, on a decidedly different level from all the other real-time strategy games. If we really want to find some flaws in the graphics, these can be found in the not very beautiful models of our armies and enemies which are a little poor in details and lack customization. Of course, this allows many troops to coexist on the screen at the same time without producing any slowdowns, let's not forget that. The special effects are very good: starting from the energy field to the terrain modeling. Everything happens in such a fluid way (I'm not talking about framerate) that you almost don't notice the changes made until you observe them in detail. This discretion is not only pleasant but allows us to applaud the ability of the developers (KD Labs) who didn't try to insert effects everywhere, saturating the screen with little lights as if it were always New Year's Eve (all references to other RTSs are purely random). Comment We are undoubtedly faced with an experimental title that deserves to be considered especially by those who are looking for something truly new. Too bad for some rather marked defects that can annoy less savvy players and those used to greater freedom. If the developers had worked for a greater balance of the gameplay we will probably now be talking about a masterpiece. However, one cannot even speak of a wasted opportunity. Indeed, it is an excellent starting point to be able to renew a genre watered down in many of its parts and stale in others. In short, a good product that must be understood to be truly appreciated. Pros: Original concept Rather articulated in its various parts Terraforming is really well developed Cons Leaves little freedom for intervention Some missions are too schematic At times excessively frenetic The friends of Maria de Filippi That beast no longer has a home... who knows whose fault it is. We all know how certain living beings are made. They exploit the environment around them until they bring it to collapse. When they have sucked all the suckable things they say: ~ops, how we were careless and naughty, we destroyed our beautiful world... too bad~... unfortunately these shady figures realize that they have ruined everything when they already have the technologies available to emigrate to other habitable planets. This is how they say to each other, after the previous nice little speech: ~why not leave this disgusting.. beautiful planet to its ruin... destiny to go somewhere else with our new spaceships, branded by the seventh Armani clone?~. Since few people are interested in being punished for the wrong done, our nice world-killers find themselves emigrating into the cosmos and reaching a nice universe made up of psychospheres, so called because they manage to enter the subconscious of humans by showing them random episodes of broadcasts of Maria de Philippi. The situation soon became dramatic with people attempting suicide at the umpteenth appearance of Tina in their heads but suddenly the transmissions ceased to torment human beings. Their place was taken by terrible monsters. And everyone said to each other: ~better to be devoured by giant ants than to see Maria dancing again~. Unfortunately some fans of the blonde presenter rose up and decided to go against their companions to avenge the honor of their goddess. Thus the human race divided and began a three front war that we now have to go and get our hands on.", "date": "2004-06-30", "grade": null}
