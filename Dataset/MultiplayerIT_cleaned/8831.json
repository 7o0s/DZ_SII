{"name": "L'unico insetto buono...", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/97146-bug-princess-lunico-insetto-buono.html", "text": "Tested version: iPhone and iPadThe danmaku shooter has always been a rather niche sub-genre in the West, either due to the crazy, often frustrating level of difficulty, or because it was born and proliferates above all within the reserved panorama of soft doujins and hall arcade. From the Touhou series to Ibara, these are names unknown to most European players, but this hasn't stopped a hard core of enthusiasts from recovering and appreciating them, while in recent years some publishing teams and labels have begun to offer some of the more attractive stocks also in western markets. On the App Store (and not only) to act as a herald of this trend there is a consolidated company in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo. With its excellent mobile ports, Cave has been churning out what are now some of the best shooters for iOS over the last couple of years, introducing even newcomers to the genre to titles like Dodonpachi and Espgaluda II. The latest arrival is none other than the original Mushihimesama, born on the arcade in 2004 and re-proposed today with the name, certainly more digestible outside Japan, of Bug Princess. ...it's a dead bug Like Cave's other titles, Bug Princess is also accompanied by a story that tries to give a minimum of context to the action. However, the adventures of the beautiful Reco and the magical insects she will meet during the journey are left to a series of summaries accessible from the main menu, which only justify the extermination of bugs in which you will take part shortly thereafter. Those who have played at least one of the Japanese team's shoot 'em ups already know what to expect: Bug Princess is a vertically scrolling shooter in which you dodge a disproportionate amount of bullets and make your way through a huge horde of enemies, collecting power- up to boost their attack and use smart bombs to save their skin when things start to get really bad. At the beginning of each game it is possible to choose one of the three classic types of fire, which differ in the range and the damage caused: obviously the more dispersive and broader one's attack is, the less damage will be inflicted on each opponent hit . The same goes for the small allied insects that can be collected and arranged in formation to cover a wider range of fire or to concentrate all projectiles in a single point; the action is made even more frenetic as the more enemies are hit, the more the score multiplier increases, an idea that pushes the player to switch from one opponent to another without ever stalling. Each of the levels ends with an epic and gigantic boss to defeat, and this is where the developers had fun creating the most absurd and sadistic bullet patterns, which you can slip into with surgical precision to avoid being hit. In this case, despite the excellent work done by Cave in adapting the touchscreen controls, the small size of the iPhone and iPod Touch make themselves felt a lot, especially since a part of the screen is always blocked by the player's finger. The problem disappears completely if you play on the iPad, and the fact that Bug Princess is Cave's first shoot 'em up to be released in the Universal version will undoubtedly please those who own both devices. The various difficulty levels and the three game modes with which it is possible to tackle the campaign deserve a separate discussion: if the Original option allows novices to approach the genre in a not excessively traumatic way, the Maniac and Ultra modes offer more aggressive enemies and extremely complex bullet patterns, especially if you decide to play on the higher difficulty levels. The player is still given the choice to carefully customize their experience, increasing the challenge rate without making the game too frustrating. Finally, as far as the audiovisual component is concerned, there is little doubt that the settings and stylistic choices of Mushihimesama surpass the more traditional ones of Dodonpachi and Espgaluda in originality, despite the fact that in past years they are especially noticeable on the large iPad screen: as always the rain of bullets transforms every match into an incessant fireworks display without any slowdown, but it is in the swarming of opposing insects, in the exploration of the immense magical forests and in the absurdity of the end-of-level bosses that Bug Princess places itself a step above to the others.
