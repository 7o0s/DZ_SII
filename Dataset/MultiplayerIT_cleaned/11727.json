During the fights on the strategic map, it may happen that the game assigns you secondary objectives, obviously optional: if you accept them, you will have to work to complete the most varied quests, such as saving a princess, repelling an invading horde or conquering a certain territory. In case you are successful, the rewards can be very attractive: they range from an alliance with a tribe, up to a substantial bonus in terms of resources, passing through a certain number of free units; in the event, however, that you fail, be prepared to be overwhelmed by a large invasion of enemies or to lose precious research points, essential for progressing in the Ages. Nice intuition, but it doesn't break the monotony of the game enough. Empire Earth 3 is available for PC. Further cuts Not happy with the simplification of resource management, Empire Earth can boast further cuts: the number of Ages, for example, has been drastically reduced to five (Ancient, Medieval, Colonial, Modern and Future) which, added to the simplicity in accumulating resources, will allow you to advance quickly towards the most advanced, quickly making fun of your digital opponents. In the same way, the number of civilizations have been reduced: from the tens of the previous title, we have passed to only three, namely the Western, Middle Eastern and Eastern Civilizations (a true tribute to the imagination). The differences, at least on paper, are decidedly relevant: while the Western Civilization can boast more technologically advanced and expensive units, coincidentally the Eastern one (does anyone think of the Chinese of C&C?) focuses on quantity rather than quality. We almost forgot: the Middle Eastern civilization, always with a view to looking for something innovative, is an exact union between the two geographical extremities. simplicity, therefore, wherever you turn this third chapter; unfortunately it borders on banality, and too soon on boredom. Further cuts Reducing the number of playable factions to just three has not, however, been balanced by the large variety of units available: in addition to sharing several, each side will be able to field unique units, but these are easily counted on the fingertips and not they are never clearly distinguished from their counterparts; moreover, having removed the limit of recruitable units has only made life easier for those who prefer, as a game strategy, that of barricading themselves behind solid defenses and safely amassing their army, and then launching a swift rush against the enemy: valid strategy in multiplayer, but which in the single campaign only makes life too simple for us and which quickly leads us to abandon any attempt to develop a tactic or strategy. Simplicity wherever you turn this third chapter; unfortunately it borders on banality and too soon boredom. Global domination Comment Unfortunately, the Mad Dog title disappoints in many respects: once the main game mode has been started and having reached the last Era available, boredom will assail you very quickly and you will not have any incentive to start a new game with a faction from scratch different. Empire Earth 3 is a simple title, not to mention superficial, and may perhaps appeal to those who have never tried an RTS, but we do not feel like recommending its purchase nor to hardcore gamers, who would be able to dominate the world in a few turns, nor to the casual player, who can dedicate his few minutes of play towards more entertaining horizons. We all trust in a fourth chapter. Pros Suitable for novice gamers Simple Cons Oversimplified Heavy graphics engine Disappoints fans of the series Simplicity We all agree that simplicity is not a negative element in a video game: immediacy, a learning curve that is as rational as possible and ease of command are certainly excellent strengths; on the other hand, if the developers aim to oversimplify, what could have been a strength quickly becomes an insurmountable negative element. In Empire Earth 3 exactly this happened: with the aim of simplifying, we fell into trivializing the gameplay, making the gaming experience particularly boring and lacking in incentives after a few hours. The simplification process saw the number of resources fall first: it will be enough for you to accumulate anonymous Raw Materials, exploring the game map in search of the appropriate quarries, and the evergreen Gold, simply by building markets scattered around the map, which they will take care of automatically generating a certain amount of gold metal, by sending carsre at your City Centre. So forget about placing carpentry shops near woods, checking farms for food production and looking for stone quarries: two unique resources, easily accumulated and without any need to interact with the surrounding scenery. Obviously, all this leads to an enormous reduction in the level of difficulty: the developers, by excessively facilitating the accumulation of resources, will allow you to dominate quickly against the (however lacking) artificial intelligence, immediately making you deploy a large number of units and allowing you to resort to the now abused Tank Rush technique, which consists in amassing an ever-increasing number of units and then sending them all together to the slaughterhouse, regardless of any bonuses or penalties, strengths and weaknesses that characterize them. Your game, both the first and all those that follow, will consist of a few simple steps: build a village center, accumulate an exaggerated amount of resources in a matter of minutes and start churning out soldier after soldier, to then launch them into the attack . The computer, on the other hand, does not seem to react to your actions, and will limit itself to leaving you calm to grow and become strong without nuisances, only to then defend itself from your attacks: it must be said that, given the peace in which you will be able to develop your settlement, generally your first strike will also be the one to close the game, quickly bringing you to the victory screen. PC - System Requirements Empire Earth 3, while not showing particularly exciting graphics, deploys a decidedly heavy engine: setting all the options to the maximum, the framerate settles on 10-15 FPS, enough to play an RTS of this mold, but which still leave room to slow animations and movement delays. Lowering the detail and resolution gains a few frames. Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 4 1.7 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: 128 MB, compatible with Shader Model 2.0 Disk Space: 6.5 GB Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium 4 3.2 GHz or AMD 3400+ RAM: 1 GB Video Card : 256 MB, compatible with Shader Model 3.0 Disk Space: 6.0 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core Duo E6700 at 2.7 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: GeForce 8800 GTX Operating System: Windows Vista Home Premium It must be a trend, but hopefully quickly passing: we are referring to the bad habit that developers have taken in recent months, that of taking a brand and removing all the elements that made it famous. What did Empire Earth series players like? Probably the high number of Ages, the different skillfully characterized factions and a decidedly exhilarating level of challenge. What remains of the old school in the third chapter? Little. Or nothing.", "date": "2007-12-17", "grade": null}
