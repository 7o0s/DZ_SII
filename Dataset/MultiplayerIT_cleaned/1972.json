{"name": "Armored Core 2: Another Age", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/armored-core-2-another-age_a.html", "text": "Right from the beginning you will have the possibility to access the section that allows you to modify your robot in all respects, and I am not just saying so. In fact, all kinds of parts will be available that can improve the destructive power, as well as the agility of the mech: from the weapon for the right and left arms, to the legs, to the thrusters and even to the head. Obviously the lighter and more resistant the piece is, the higher its cost will be, and believe me, you really need a lot of money to assemble a competitive and fun vehicle to use. The presence of a logo and color editor is nice, but not too innovative, given that it was already on display in the first title for our black box. Still on the subject of modifications, I warn you about the difficulty of the game: it is really difficult, and only with a shrewd expense for the parts, in search of the best compromise to create a real homicidal machine (or rather robicide!), will it be possible to continue in the missions that will be gradually more difficult. These will be unlocked as the four ~open~ ones are completed immediately after the first one, which can be labeled as a kind of briefing. This is in fact the easiest and shortest mission of the entire game. A small (up to a certain point) note of demerit goes to the control system that does not allow easy use of your robot. The flaw of the other game has remained practically unchanged, namely the great difficulty to rotate the mech. I understand that you are driving a car weighing several tons and I don't even ask that you have a control like that of Devil May Cry, but this affects the whole gameplay. A quicker response would have been much more welcome. On the other hand, the automatic aim option is very convenient, which allows you to easily extricate yourself even in very hectic situations. Compared to the previous title, this Another Age has made very little progress from a purely aesthetic point of view, resulting not in step with the times. In fact, even the backdrops that were really dull even in the previous Armored Core, have maintained their ~ugliness~!! At the time, the graphics were already lower than in Z.o.E., imagine today with the imminent release of the second episode of the successful Konami series .... we're just not there. It would be the case that From Software looked around and understood that perhaps it was better to develop a new graphics engine that is more current in terms of graphic complexity. For heaven's sake, I certainly don't want to say that the game is poorly programmed or anything, in fact the models are well done anyway and the effects of the weapons and the explosions are not bad, I'm just saying that if I had found this game two years ago on the shelves of my trusted shopkeeper I would have taken him into consideration, while now..I'm looking for better. Ultimately I could tell you that if you already have AC2 and you liked it a lot, you can take a look at it, otherwise look around and maybe wait for the much more promising Z.o.E. 2 or better would be the third Armored Core! Pros: Possibility to process the mechs Longevity guaranteed by the i.Link Graphic effects Cons: High cost of the pieces Difficulty in rotating the mech Excessive difficulty Followed, or rather, remake of the now ancient but always excellent Armored Core 2 for PS2, this Another Age reproduces its predecessor a little too faithfully, in all respects. Also in this case, in fact, they will take on the role of a mercenary from the small circle of the Ravens, unscrupulous men in constant search of new missions to complete. But let's start with the presentation. I was honestly disappointed, and not a little, by the initial movie because what appears to the player's eyes is a simple and not very engaging sequence of CG scenes that doesn't excite one bit. Not all presentations are enthralling and intriguing to the point of being a pleasure to watch them, but this one doesn't even make you understand much of the product you are about to play. The only clear thing is that there is a mech that destroys all the other robots by itself without batting an eye.mah! And the mention of missions, of the fact that you impersonate a mercenary and that with the money you earn you can customize your vehicle, where are they? And let's not talk about the music, highly subdued and not very engaging. Arrived at the initial screen, it is nice to see that among the options the possibility of playing in two via i.Link cable has been maintained, thus avoiding the annoying split-screen option (still present), which, for heaven's sake, allows you to play in two or more people (sometimes), but that ruins even the best games (see, for me, Gran Turismo ), since it loses depth, speed and graphic detail.", "date": "2002-10-19", "grade": null}
