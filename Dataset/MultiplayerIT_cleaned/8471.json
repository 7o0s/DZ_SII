Whatever the reason for this delay, the small Argentinian team specializing in the production of titles for the various Nintendo Digital Delivery stores is finally giving us on the other side of the Atlantic the opportunity to improvise tattoo artists with big dreams, first apprentices, but with the possibility, sooner or later, of opening our own shop. The madness of the woman The one that gives the title to this paragraph is a song by Elii in which it is maliciously implied how much the fairer sex is the victim of at least two serious forms of mental imbalance: ~that need for shoes that doesn't want to listen to reason~ and ~the mental discomfort of injecting ink with needles~. Far be it from us to bow to such a sinister clich: they are very common imbalances even among boys. Or maybe they aren't even imbalances, simply passions. Madness or not, they are two big businesses, so, while waiting for the next shoe factory simulator, how about immersing ourselves in a real simulation of the professional life of a tattoo artist? Oh yes, because Art of Ink does not focus only on the creation of the tattoo (a rather obvious idea on a console like the DS, but it seems that no one had thought of it before Sabarasa ...), but also on more peripheral aspects and which we could define, using the term in a very broad sense, ~managerial~. The Career mode is the heart of the game: this provides for the choice between three tattoo artists, each with different characteristics of Charisma, Attention, Skill and Approval, and only by completing the rather long careers of all three characters will it be possible say you have completed the game 100%. At the beginning your character is a simple apprentice in the workshop of an already established artist, who accompanies you in your first steps when the first customer arrives, which is moreover a caricature of a classic Italian who emigrated from the other side of the ocean. If we were serious people we might even get offended, but since we're not, we focus on the gameplay and find out how, before starting work, we have to make ourselves ~accepted~ by the customer and bombard him with questions about his story, his work and on his family to find out which, among those we have available, the most suitable tattoo for him: if we find it within three attempts, he will offer us a higher tip than due when the job is finished, otherwise he will explicitly inform us of his wish. At the beginning it is easy to find out which design is right, the clues that the customer gives us are so large and our catalog is so limited; slowly, however, the customers' responses will become more and more cryptic, and the choice of models available to them ever wider, and this will become a real challenge within a challenge supported among other things by dialogues that are perhaps a little too verbose but very full of humour. After a series of satisfied customers, you will become the owner of your own parlor: the relationship with the customer will not change, but managing a shop means having access to new designs, new tools (needles of different thicknesses for more precise tattoos, for example, but also a series of colored inks and dressings to be used in case of error) and also having to take care of the furnishings, a non-secondary choice as it directly influences the attractiveness of the shop and, conversely, the characteristics of the character. A tattoo is forever All very nice, interesting and stimulating, but, obviously, the core of the title, its main mechanics, always remains the actual operation of the tattoo. This takes place in the most obvious way: on the lower screen, the dotted model of the chosen design is represented on the customer's skin, which you must trace, however, not before having activated the needle with the L and/or R buttons. stylus on the touch screen without pressing anything, however, you will massage the customer's skin: this gives you the opportunity both to eliminate excess ink and to soothe the pain. Yes, because each client has a different pain threshold, and a bar that represents it which fills up more and more during the operation, and even more when you inject ink outside the suggested model; your task is to prevent it from filling up completely, in which case the customer's pain threshold will lower until he decides to leave in the throes of suffering and anger. The bar is emptied simply not by operating, but in maera faster when precisely massage the client's skin, especially when later on you will have various medicines available. Each model is divided into sectors, quite easily recognizable, and the perfect success or otherwise of each of them affects the customer's satisfaction: at the end of each tattoo, the customer will pay you according to the aforementioned satisfaction, the time spent, your precision , without forgetting the question of the choice of the design that we talked about earlier. It is undeniable how the drawing and massage mechanics are successful: intuitive (even if pushing the back while drawing can be a little uncomfortable), sensitive and precise, which is not surprising given its simplicity and the naturalness with which lends itself to the characteristics of the DSi/3DS. Despite its success and all the variations on the theme we have talked about, however, one cannot fail to notice a certain repetitiveness: after all, throughout the course of the game, which, we repeat, is not even short (even less if we include the presence of a Free Mode), all you do is draw, draw and draw, for a rather long time for each tattoo. However, the attempt made by the team to spice things up a bit cannot be denied: in addition to the ~surrounding~ elements already mentioned, we must remember the presence during the career of some ~bosses~, very demanding customers to be satisfied strictly within a time limit, and a now classic system of objectives and trophies. In short, there is repetitiveness and it may not be digested by everyone, but those who do it will find a well thought-out structure, a long and calibrated challenge, and also a technical department not to be underestimated. Few graphic and sound assets, but very pleasant, the drawings with a pleasant and very colorful style (the characters vaguely recall the character design of the Ace Attorney series) and the rock music, with frequent guitar playing, which are well suited to the atmosphere of a tattoo parlour.", "date": "2012-06-27", "grade": "7.5"}
