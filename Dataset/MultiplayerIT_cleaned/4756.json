{"name": "Miitopia: i Mii in versione RPG", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/186490-miitopia-miitopia-i-mii-in-versione-rpg.html", "text": "Since their first appearance on Wii, back in 2006, Miis have represented our social alter-ego for the main Nintendo platforms and have ~made us protagonists~ of the very famous Wii Sports, Wii Party, Wii Music or, more recently, Nintendo Land for Wii U; however, it is with Tomodachi Life for Nintendo 3DS that our Mii characters have found their best expression by ~ruling~ (actually the interactions are very simple and limited) an island populated entirely by Miis ready to simulate their work and family life topped off with typical Nintendo humor. Miitopia continues from here, transporting your favorite Miis (even directly from Tomodachi Life, if it is installed on Nintendo 3DS) within a game with a typical JRPG structure, complete with classes, leveling up, equipment and fights at shifts, which does not fail to keep intact that basic humor and that naive light-heartedness of the Miis by immersing them in a plot bordering on the absurd. Arriving for Nintendo 3DS and for the newborn New Nintendo 2DS, with which it shares the release date, Miitopia begins its narrative with the arrival of the Duke of Evil (to whom you can give, like any other ~non-player Mii~, the name and assign the appearance of one of your Mii at will) in the village on duty where, with his ~prankster wickedness~, he steals the faces of almost all the inhabitants, letting them wander around without the possibility of speaking or seeing and, while they are being torn away , the stolen smileys all become sad. Guess who will have the burden of saving them and returning them to their rightful owner? Of course to your Mii who happened to visit this village for the first time, just as the villain arrived! A very classy mii During the very first minutes of the game, the unfolding of events causes our protagonist Mii to be chosen by the deity who gives him the power of one class among the six initially available: four of them, the warrior, the wizard, the priest and the thief, are quite classic and come from the fantasy world while the remaining two, the singer and the cook, correspond respectively to the bard, who can inflict damage and can boost the group with his songs, and to a melee fighter armed with pans and healing abilities with foods. As the game progresses, six more classes will become available, some of them really crazy: the scientist, the panzer, the princess, the imp, the flower (you read right, a flower!) and even the cat! The values that characterize the characters are very basic and each Mii has finished health points which will be out of action, magic points which are used to cast spells and four values which increase as the level progresses. The latter are the attack, which serves to do more damage, the defense, which allows you to suffer less, the magic, which increases the magical damage, and the speed, which allows you to act before an enemy since Miitopia makes use of a turn-based combat. Don't think that's the end of it: each of these classes has its own unique fighting style, special abilities, weapons and clothes (there are dozens of items and one more absurd than the other); moreover, although you don't have a game with complicated systems for ~building characters~, when you level up Miitopia has a very nice and original system of interaction between the Miis in your group that increase mutual affinity. The particular functioning of this system of interactions is very simple and it all takes place inside the numerous inns that are found during the game and which are, we will see later, the obligatory passages for our group of heroic Miis: although the group that enters in action is made up of four characters, one of which is always yours, you will get to have 10, while the inn will act as a tool both for selecting group members and for placing characters in pairs in the various rooms so that the their chemistry/friendship levels up giving rise to new special abilities that a certain pair will use in combat. In any case, all Miis have a special relationship with each other Mii and you can move them around the rooms of the inn as you like to see what happens between them (they can fight, be jealous but also care for each other or get gifts). During the exploration phases, a pattern on the Nintendo 3DS top screen will always remind us how strong the bond is between the four active Miis and, in a sense, the strongest possible party of four can be determined by the combination of the single level of each of the members added to the value of the bondand of these four with each other. The inns are also very important because it is precisely here that it is possible to increase the common characteristics of the Miis through the food that is found during the game and which is of various kinds and rarities: not all the Miis will like the same foods and, consequently, they they will benefit more or less depending on the culinary specialty. In the inn you can also change the equipment of the Mii, not through the classic seller but by donating gold coins to the Mii eager to improve who will buy the strongest possible object at that given moment (generally corresponds to level advancements). Country you go Mii you find The adventure of your Miis starts from the village of Verdalboria but unfolds through ten different areas, each with its unique points of interest in which you will be able to interact with the many non-player characters you will meet and of which, if you want, as mentioned in the beginning, you can change its appearance and name at will. Each map of these zones is divided into highlights by exploring which the Miis of the party will start walking, exchanging funny jokes and randomly encountering groups of wandering monsters to face with the classic turn-based structure. You will be able to fight automatically as a spectator with all the Miis, including yours, who will choose their attacks and the only possible intervention will be the one that will allow you to use the pepper pots, special objects that are used to heal, restore magic points, give extra attack or additional defense to your Miis and even to resurrect (these special items are given as you progress in the game by the deity who helps you). By selecting manual combat, however, you will only choose the actions of your main character and the rest of the group will continue to fight independently, also activating those special attacks discovered after increasing the interaction value with another Mii in the party. In fact, the clashes are never too complicated except for those of the bosses who can present difficulties if you face them with characters of too low a level, in any case, if your Mii is in danger and you don't have any healing peppers, you can put it in a safe area, called Salvarea, so as not to take damage and waiting for it to receive healing from the rest of the group members, thus returning to action. The different zones offer a certain variety of settings: there are snow-capped mountains, desert, elf lands, volcanic lands and futuristic islands in the clouds and, by exploring the various points of interest on the maps, you will come across, in addition to wandering monsters, chests within which it is possible to find coins, food and even unique objects to equip one of your Miis. In order to level up all the characters in your group present in the inn, it will be possible to visit the points of interest of the various areas as many times as you want, thus continuing to face monsters. In every point of interest that you explore there will always be at least one inn since, as mentioned, most of the interactions take place inside it, where you can also use the games room, a special place where you can try two mini games, namely Roulette and Rock, paper, scissors, with which it is possible to win the most varied prizes and to play with which game coupons are necessary, special tickets that can be found in the chests or received daily through a special quiz that Miitopia offers (actually is a questionnaire with which you let Nintendo know what you think of the Miis offered by the game but that is not mandatory, to do so you need to keep the SpotPass active). The 3D effect It works well without annoying and makes some effects of the Mii's special moves even more spectacular. Music, Master! Graphically, Miitopia has the typical style of the Mii world and both the settings and the enemies and the non-player Miis are rendered really well, they will make you smile more than once, especially when you ~surgically~ replace their faces with those of your friends' Miis. The effects of the spells, the dozens of absurd combinations of skills between the various Miis during the fight are made with care and never run the risk of being too repetitive precisely because they change according to the value of the relationship between the Miis (a value that also changes when help each other in combat). A separate discussion should be spent on the music sector because a really great job has been done: over 200 musical tracks with different themes for the characters, for the places, for the situations with many of them that recall famous pieces. To give you some examples, the Theme of the Duke of Evil is a variation of ~O fortuna~ from Carl Orff's Carmina Burana and the King's Theme recalls a famous aria from Mozart's ~The Magic Flute~, while the Three Fairies Ensemble is a tribute to Celtic music. All the music tracks discovered, such as the weapons, clothes, food and wandering monsters encountered, can be consulted in the encyclopedia from which you can also modify, as we said, all the non-player Miis: from the game log you can also see all the scenes interlude and even all the battles you've played! To make the game even longer, there are over 250 medals to be obtained, for example by defeating a certain number of monsters, obtaining different types of food or equipment or by rescuing a certain number of inhabitants; there are really a lot of them. Do you think that's all? You are wrong, there is no shortage of support for amiibo which give access both to their costume to be used on your Miis, in the case of the most famous figurines such as Mario, Peach, Yoshi, etc., and to special objects such as bananas, candies and game coupons. in the case of any other amiibo: to use them you will have to take them to the ~Nintendo Fan~ Mii present in each area and always dressed differently.", "date": "2017-07-27", "grade": "7.8"}
