There are practically no more cinematic tributes dedicated to these creatures, just as video games have seen dozens of titles dedicated to zombies over the course of their history, the most famous of which belong to series such as Resident Evil and Left 4 Dead. If unvarnished action had been the master so far, the German guys from Headup Studios tried to change the cards a bit, always staging hungry zombies but this time giving rise to a kind of time-based strategy real, in full Commandos style but with decidedly horror hues. Indeed, within Trapped Dead we find ourselves having to control a group of people towards their journey that recalls (but only from the point of view of the setting) that of the protagonists of Left 4 Dead and/or of the comic-TV series mentioned in the introductory hat: it all begins with two friends, Mike and Gerald, who stop at a petrol station desperately looking for fuel for the car: however, they soon end up getting to know the ravenous creatures eager for fresh meat. From this point on, the Trapped Dead plot develops through what we could define as a classic of the genre, including the ~trip~ to the hospital to go and find a doctor who can cure one of the initial protagonists bitten by the zombie on duty. To act as a glue between the various missions to be accomplished and what happens in the latter, we find interlude scenes made in a comic style - another point in common with The Walking Dead - in a way that we can certainly define as successful both from the point of view from an exquisitely stylistic point of view, both from that of the narration. Zombiandos The first missions of Trapped Dead serve to introduce the player to the game mechanics, quite simple: WASD keys and central mouse button to manage the camera (including zoom), plus the other two to move and attack respectively with the left button and the right one. The ~advanced~ commands see the possibility of multiple selection for your group or any enemies to attack, reloading the weapon with the R key (the characters do not do it automatically, and it is good to keep this in mind) and pausing to issue orders with the spacebar. Since we are talking about weapons, also in this case we are faced with all the things that are part of the classic of this genre, starting from the ubiquitous baseball bat passing to firearms of various types: an original element instead it consists of the possibility of trapping zombies, setting them some trap, in order to avoid direct confrontation by removing even more than one of them at the same time through interaction with the surrounding environment. An example is also offered to us during the tutorial, where by pressing a switch in the car workshop, a vehicle can be dropped on the head of an undead positioned right under the elevator. Soon you also learn to take advantage of any flammable objects, such as fire extinguishers, thanks to which you can generate lethal explosions. In any case, it is necessary to pay attention to the noise generated since this inevitably ends up attracting other zombies, creatures whose senses are notoriously acute: therefore also watch out for any bleeding, duly signaled by the game, which could cause the undead to flock thanks to the smell of blood even if you move silently like a ninja. Not all zombies succeed with the hole Everything listed so far is certainly nice and interesting on a theoretical level, just as Trapped Dead is unquestionably a unique game of its kind: the sore points, however, come from the real ~juice~, made up of (few) highs and (too many) lows . If on the one hand the zombies prove to be quite intelligent and attentive with their senses, on the other we find a level of challenge that strategy lovers will find rather low: zombies are notoriously slow, all right, but as we all know they know also be lethal. In the effort of Headup, in most cases the player has all the right to choose with due calm what kind of strategy to adopt even against large groups of enemies, who soon end up successfully attracting aside by facing them one at a time. In short, there is a lack of that sense of oppression mixed with impotence dictated by the presence of hordes of enemies, which is also classic of this genre. But what's even worse about Trapped Dead is the complete lack of bite (forgive the pun), that something that can push us to scour whereerase a certain area by risking the skin of the protagonists to get a reward. In fact, we soon realize that the game only pushes us to complete the level as quickly as possible, therefore without directing us towards secondary objectives or simply increasing our score: at the end of the level, a summary of what has been done is simply offered, without personal highscores or other systems of comparison of results, to which to cling to have an iota of desire to repeat the various chapters. To all this, combine a movement management for the protagonists that can certainly be reviewed, which pushes them to literally bump into each other even in cases where there would be room to move forward without problems, which in the most agitated phases becomes a real drama . It has also happened to notice (not always, fortunately) a certain delay in the commands especially while trying to interrupt an action already assigned. Between comics and reality From a technical point of view, Trapped Dead looks quite good, without making your eyes and ears widen in amazement. The environments have been created with the right detail by the developers, as well as the graphic elements in general, even those of the enemies, are quite varied: if you want to make a criticism, it is perhaps the polygonal models of the living and the undead that are a bit under tone than the rest. The various interlude sequences, as already mentioned, are presented in the form of an animated comic, giving an excellent impression of Headup's abilities also in a future perspective. The sound also deserves the same, which above all thanks to the famous wails and whispers of the zombies seasoned with various effects, manages to create the right atmosphere, also thanks to the good dubbing. On balance it is clear that the developers have studied the entire genre enough, and indeed we can safely say that it is a title created by zombie movie lovers for zombie movie lovers.", "date": "2011-03-28", "grade": "6.5"}
