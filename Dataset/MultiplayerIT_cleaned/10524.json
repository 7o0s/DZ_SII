While in fact the new generation consoles battle to the sound of polygons, also introducing the element of ~rewind~ in the classic gameplay of the series, on the Nintendo console we are witnessing a sort of revival of the 90s made up of toy-looking cars, almost devoid of textures, which compete in scenarios bare and which in some cases adopt antediluvian graphic solutions (just look at the small trees on the roadside, made with two ~slices~ of two-dimensional foliage arranged in a cross). Our drifts often end up crashing into immovable stones or twigs, which contrast with completely intangible bushes and cacti that leap out of the way when they make contact with the car's bodywork. The message is clear enough: it's better to stay within the boundaries of the track, because the slightest idea of a little trip through the meadows will be punished with a brutal collision. When this doesn't happen, however, the game takes care of getting back on track with the classic ~fade to white~ that also characterized the first DiRT. The graphics of Colin McRae: DiRT 2 certainly appear essential, if we want to define it that way, and that would also be fine if the lack of detail, the low polygonal count and the horrible ~sparks~ that originate from the contact between two cars ensured a fluid, fast and without uncertainties frame rate. Well no: the only four cars on the track and the total lack of moving elements in the background (spectators or whatever) are managed by the graphics engine in a convincing way only within the simplest scenarios. However, a collision or a change in the background is enough for the situation to fall between jerks and slowdowns. And if the game's graphics don't catch the eye, certainly the sound doesn't ~leap to the ear~. Try dragging a shoe across the dirt: this is the sound effect that accompanies sand drifts in DiRT 2. And you know your best love performance on an old creaky mattress? Well, that's the suspension sound effect after a bump. Unfortunately, things don't improve thanks to the ~signed~ soundtrack, poor in every respect. Guidance system The options screen erroneously suggests that the game does not offer any alternative to control via the Wii-mote, while fortunately the reality is very different: we can opt for the classic motion detection (possibly inserting the Wii-mote into an adapter steering wheel), use the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combo or plug in the Classic Controller. The quality of the driving system changes radically depending on the configuration, and in this case it rewards the more ~classic~ choice of the joypad. Indeed, driving with the Wii-mote proves to be a cumbersome and frustrating experience: the wheels of the car seem to immediately follow our directives, but in reality there is a certain delay from when we tilt the controller to when the car turns, which ends up to cause big problems especially when we have to countersteer (which, being a rally game, means ~always~). Let's say that driving using the Wii-mote is a great way to understand how the game handles collisions (badly, for the record), as well as to evaluate the deformation of the bodywork that follows each impact. Using the Classic Controller the situation improves substantially, the control becomes precise and it is possible to manage the car without particular problems. It's a pity that some road surfaces, even if sandy, don't make drifting easier, also due to the way the brakes react to our inputs. By pulling the handbrake when cornering, for example, most of the time the car doesn't lose the rear end and the maneuver ends up penalizing us rather than the other way around. Driving aids, then, affect only marginally, changing very little the cards on the table. Challenge friends Unfortunately DiRT 2 does not offer the possibility of playing online, but the multiplayer modes present allow as many as four players to challenge each other simultaneously via split screen. The graphics do not seem to suffer too much from the multiple display of the track, and indeed the scrolling of the track appears almost faster than normal. Too bad only for the drops in the frame rate, which in any case also characterize the single game. On the track Colin McRae: DiRT 2 offers single and multiplayer modes, the latter however only available locally for up to four players in split screen. The ~world tour~ represents the fulcro of the game, and consists of four levels in turn divided into four tournaments, each formed by a variable number of races. Each tournament won allows us to unlock a new car, which goes to add to those initially available and which are often offered to us as an alternative choice to the ~fixed~ ones for certain tracks. There are a total of nine tracks on which you compete, variations excluded, and each of them is distinguished by the combinations concerning the road surface: asphalt is opposed to dirt, sand to ice, and so on. The ~arcade~ mode gives us the possibility to participate in single races, championships and time trials, and represents an ideal choice for enriching the game experience, which in truth would have seemed rather sacrificed in the ~world tour~ alone, also considering the degree of difficulty far from exaggerated. The ~challenges~ complete the picture, i.e. five different skill tests for four experience levels, in which we are asked to perform various stunts (jumps, drifts) or to maintain a fast drive to overcome checkpoints or races in which the slower competitor is gradually eliminated.", "date": "2009-09-17", "grade": "6.0"}
