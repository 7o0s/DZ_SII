{"name": "Un salto pi in alto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/88476-jump-out-un-salto-piu-in-alto.html", "text": "Jump Out! is one of those puzzles that are discovered by chance and have the ability to keep you glued to the iPhone for hours, effectively mixing elements of skill with others of reasoning and strategy. Season it all with extremely nice graphics, and technically well done: you'll have an original and fun title that can't be missing from the collection of any Cut The Rope or Angry Birds lover. Thanks to fast and fun matches, Jump Out! is an excellent casual title, which manages to offer a good level of difficulty and to keep you busy for several hours, without ever getting tired. Oh, poor little fellow! The premise of Jump Out! are very simple: you have to help poor, tender, innocent insects to gain freedom by throwing them into a ~hole~, present in every game scheme. The insects in question, however, are practically balls: they do not move in any way, and all they do is cling motionless to the knobs that rotate. To save them, therefore, the player will have to do everything: the insects will have to be thrown, carefully calibrating the shots. By touching an insect it will be possible to direct it, to make it jump away from the knob on which it rotates, regulating the direction and intensity of the shot. All this also thanks to a dashed trajectory, which will help the player understand what he is doing. As in any puzzle title, there will be difficulties: we have air currents, falling sugars, moving slabs, bouncing bumps, very intricate forced paths through wooden planks, and every kind of sadistic obstacle that can come to mind to a developer to make the gaming life of gamers as challenging as possible! One of the most interesting aspects of Jump Out! it is given by the presence of significant elements of skill, required to complete the game. It's not just a matter of reasoning: in Jump Out! you will have to think, yes, but it will be essential to do it quickly, especially as you progress with the levels... otherwise you will have to say goodbye to your poor little bugs. Go-go elasticity Jump Out! it is by no means a simple game: completing all the levels perfectly is a feat that could occupy a fair number of hours, even for a shrewd player. Also for this reason, the game cleverly introduces a notable flexibility in the game objectives: to complete a scheme and unlock the next one, you just need to save even just one insect. But if you are a completionist the undertaking will be much harder. Not only will you want to bring all the cute little creatures to freedom at all costs... you will probably also want to collect the three stars scattered along the road, obviously placed in hallucinatory places, and the undertaking will be even more complex. Even the levels available, about sixty arranged in two different worlds (The cardboard box and the computer) are very varied in their conception: some are all based on speed, others require above all precision, still others require a specific strategy. In short, with Jump Out! you will really have something for all tastes: the greatest value of the game is to guarantee a somewhat fun experience for all gamers. It's just a pity that it is in no way possible to skip the levels: although the difficulty is fairly calibrated, it happens to get stuck on a specific scheme, and it's a drama, because in that case all you can do is replay the schemes passed to looking for some kind of inspiration! Another small flaw WAS the number of levels: initially there were 60, a respectable number, of course, but with such an engaging game there was a risk of finishing them immediately, and it was very concrete. Thankfully the latest update brings us a new set, and hopefully more will come in the future. The tested version is 1.5.1 Price: 0.79 App Store links", "date": "2011-05-13", "grade": "8.0"}
