The terrible Aragami are still out there, among the rubble of what were once great metropolises, but the Fenrir organization must now also take into consideration a mysterious red rain, the bearer of deadly diseases. It is precisely to investigate this phenomenon that the Blood team is formed, of which our God Eater is a part: elite warriors capable of using new generation equipment, in this case God Arc equipped with new characteristics, to deal with any situation . Once a character has been created, we will witness the first painful grafting of the device (which is biologically linked to its owner) and we will have to grapple with some introductory missions under the orders of Captain Julius Visconti; after which it will be up to us to discover the many facets of an experience which, as a good action survival a la Monster Hunter, focuses heavily on the number of missions and monsters, on the customization of weapons (especially firearms) and on the possibility of playing cooperative multiplayer (functional but sometimes not very stable, an update would be needed), so as to face some extra challenges together with a perhaps close-knit and expert team, obtaining valuable rewards to be used in crafting. God Eater 2: Rage Burst is a solid and long-lasting action survival, albeit dated in some ways A god feat The plot of God Eater 2: Rage Burst makes extensive use of typically Japanese narrative devices, telling us the story of some characters in particular through sets of exclusive missions that are unlocked after the first few hours of the campaign. Unfortunately, the use of stereotypes by the developers prevents this aspect of the experience from being highlighted compared to many other productions characterized by the same tones, but lovers of the genre will have no problem becoming attached to Ciel and his difficulties in relating to the next, to the very positive Nana and her improbable battle outfit, to the awkward Romeo and the brave Captain Julius. It's really a shame that their stories are told through poorly acted English dialogues, without the possibility of switching to Japanese audio. The self-propelled fortress of the Blood unit and other places, further on, function as a hub for the missions: by turning to a (sexy) operator we will be able to select our objective between the levels belonging to the story and the extra ones, choose any companions and leave. The complexity of the stages increases gradually, presenting a greater number of Aragami and putting us in difficult situations, in which attacking a monster can simultaneously expose us to the blows of another, but the scenarios are completely excluded from this factor, which are unfortunately always the same, desolate, banal, devoid of the slightest degree of interactivity and at the same time full of invisible walls that delimit the margins of generally small maps: the price to pay for a production originally born on PSP and PlayStation Vita, which on the occasion of the transition to PC and home console has obviously not been able to undergo structural changes. An extra not to be underestimated By purchasing God Eater 2: Rage Burst we will have the possibility to download God Eater: Resurrection for free, the remaster of the first episode of the series. This is a very valuable extra, considering the number of hours necessary to complete this type of game and the importance of an introductory chapter to deal with for a less edgy first impact with the franchise. This factor must undoubtedly be taken into account when evaluating the purchase. The spirit of the hunter God Eater is Bandai Namco's answer to Monster Hunter, so it is clear how the game refers to the mechanics of the Capcom blockbuster, especially as regards the combat system. The God Arc, the weapon we are equipped with, can take on three different forms (sword, rifle or shield) and release its bestial nature when we hold down the heavy attack key for a long time, literally biting the enemy to inflict extra damage. and collect items for crafting. There are the traditional combos, the possibility of making lateral shots (a maneuver that we much prefer to the parry, during battles) and even activating spectacular specials that must be loaded gradually, with a view to a skill tree with a clear and solid sense of progression. To eliminate the strongest Aragami it is necessary to memorize their movement patterns, therefore take advantage of the moments of vulnerability to hit them in the ~sensitive~ points, destroying their armor in the long run and persevering funtil the battle is won. Shooting can be a valid tactic, but only if our companions take care of distracting the monster at close range and if we can recover the dark energy that powers the cannon. Running headlong into a fight and ignoring defensive maneuvers will result in a waste of time and medkits, so be careful. Using the credits earned in battle it is possible to buy different God Arcs, but each element must be carefully evaluated: larger swords or thrusting weapons require long attack times and do not go well with fast and elusive opponents, for example, while on the firearms front, you can opt for rifles that fire small shots in bursts or cannons with an explosive charge. In this context, the fine adjustments are wasted, given that after a few hours we will be able to access an editor for customizing the projectiles that allows you to really do everything, determining the impact force, the curvature of the trajectory, the implications for the explosion , incendiary or freezing effects and much more. It is a pity that you find yourself practically alone in tackling this arduous path, since the game does not go beyond the basic tutorials and experimenting with weapons and solutions takes quite a bit of time, beyond orienting yourself inside an interface that could have been decidedly friendlier. It therefore happens to give up this rich substrate in favor of more instinctive approaches: the fact that they lead to the same results is a limitation that the gameplay of God Eater 2: Rage Burst has to deal with. The technical aspect The sound sector represents the weakest element in the technical offer of the game, even if for different reasons. We have already talked about the dialogues in English: poorly recited, with odiously set voices, they manage to make you lose enthusiasm in the face of events that are not very original, in widely stereotyped situations. The musical accompaniment, on the other hand, is very valid, with orchestral pieces with great potential: it is a pity that some of them are repeated so many times that they become boring and that the direction does not exploit them in the best way to emphasize certain narrative moments. On PC there are very few graphic adjustments, as could be expected from a production of this kind, but at 1080p and with all effects at their maximum, the title of Shift splashes at sixty frames per second without ever the slightest uncertainty. However, it is not thanks to who knows what optimization efforts, but to a polygonal modeling that pays tribute to the origins of the project, as mentioned, born on PSP and PlayStation Vita three years ago: the design of the characters is valid, although sometimes out of place in its being so ~Japanese~, but one has the feeling of being faced with an older generation product in terms of textures and effects, while the animations seemed valid to us. The controls are reactive, whether you use the controller (perfectly supported and sincerely recommended) or the mouse / keyboard combination, although in the latter case the greater shooting precision is accompanied by a cumbersomeness of the movements which manifests itself above all during situations more confused.", "date": "2016-09-05", "grade": "7.5"}
