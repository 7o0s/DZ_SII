{"name": "The Warriors - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-warriors-recensione.html", "text": "The little big warriors of the little big night Let's first start with a quick recap for anyone who has never heard of The Warriors, both as a video game and as a film. While the film narrates the vicissitudes of a criminal gang unjustly accused of the murder of a gang leader in New York in 1979, the Rockstar product goes further, investigating the vicissitudes of the group of criminals in the three months prior to the events, and revealing several backstory to the past of individual characters. All within a decidedly rich and also rather original game structure, which combines the prevailing fisticuffs with stealth and tactical elements, as well as a plethora of amusements such as thefts, muggings, graffiti and so on, each managed through a special minigame. In any case, since this is a PSP conversion, there are two things that are immediately interesting to know about The Warriors, or if it is capable of holding up to the comparison with the original for PlayStation2 and Xbox from a technical point of view and of the control system. Without too many words, it can be said that Rockstar has earned the sufficiency without too much effort: in short, The Warriors is a decidedly good port, even if perhaps something more could have been done. The Warriors is a decidedly good port, even if perhaps something more could have been done The little big warriors of the little big night Graphically, the most immediately visible downgrades on PSP concern the polygon count of characters and settings (made more crude in order to keep all their details) and the frame rate, which shows the side to quite frequent slowdowns in the most agitated phases. Not only that, the virtual camera - thanks to the absence of a second analog stick to be able to better manage it - is here much less friendly, often preventing a comfortable framing of the action. Despite this, the work done by Rockstar on PSP is still remarkable, considering the vastness of the scenarios and the large amount of elements always present on the screen: a note of merit also for the uploads, much less long and invasive than one might have expected. Little to say about the sound, but only because it is unchanged from the excellent quality of the original, thanks to the music by Barry de Vorzon and a truly stellar dubbing. The situation is good - albeit with some inevitable flaws - also on the front of the control system: the second stick and two more keys are missing only in the management of the camera and in that of the orders to be given to one's companions (Select key ), objectively inconvenient to use on the go. Slow (vio) pace Being a port, The Warriors on PSP does not present any notable changes in terms of pure and simple gameplay. The game brings with it some characteristic traits of other famous Rockstar productions such as Manhunt and GTA, while maintaining an absolutely strong and well-defined personality. Taking on the role of the different members of the gang, the user finds himself completing various missions in a linear sequence, even if each leaves a certain level of discretion to the player, allowing him to choose a more stealth or brawling approach or whether to complete it or not the various sub-quests made available (the completion of which usually gives access to various bonuses and extras). The heart of the experience is however represented by the fights, extremely enjoyable not so much thanks to a particular depth of the same, but rather for their brutal spectacularity and for the very large number of characters who are usually involved in them. The heart of the experience is represented by the extremely enjoyable fights Slow (vio) pace And it certainly doesn't hurt that the product - it's already exciting - features a very well-finished storyline, embellished with high-level cutscenes that will certainly make fans of the original film happy. Long-lived at the right point, The Warriors also offers a commendable amount of extras, perhaps not enough to keep the user's attention high even after the end credits but which at least demonstrates the good will of the developers in this regard. In addition to an ad hoc section that allows one or two players to lead their hands freely and face various mini-games (along the lines of the usual capture the flag, king of the hill and so on) the Rockstar title offers an interesting co- operational for two users and finally a real gem called Armies of the Night: this is a real scrolling fighting game in the Double Dragon or Final Fight style, complete with energy indicators of the enemies and all the trappings of the case, a real and own joy fornostalgics and more. Comment The Warriors is a good level porting, but it is always a porting: thus leaving aside disquisitions about the ~ethical~ value of the Rockstar operation, the fact remains that on PSP the title does not offer anything serious that could tickle the interest of those who had already played it in its original incarnation. Of course, The Warriors on the Sony handheld sports a remarkable technical sector, a control system up to par and some valuable extras, but this is not enough to make this version better than the previous ones. For all PSP users who have never tried it, however, The Warriors remains a highly recommended purchase. Pros High quality conversion Excellent gameplay Exciting storyline and faithful to the film Cons No innovations compared to the original Control system and cameras not flawless Frame rate inconsistent On the occasion of its original release on Xbox and PlayStation 2, The Warriors proved to be able to be appreciated by audiences and critics thanks to a peculiar fusion of tie-in and scrolling beat'em up capable of bringing out the best of both worlds. wait: therefore the Rockstar production was simultaneously an exciting fighting game and a faithful reproduction of the cult film from which it was taken, not limiting itself to slavishly following part of the plot but rather deepening and expanding it in many ways. Now, following a trend that hasn't failed to make some people turn up their noses, The Warriors has been ported to the PSP. Will it be worth it?", "date": "2007-03-09", "grade": null}
