In the game just mentioned you can identify as many flaws as you like, but narratively and visually she has, in our opinion, left something to posterity. In the review of The Cruel King and the Great Hero we explain how much and how the latter is the spiritual heir of The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince, while trying to raise the bar in all aspects of production. Once again we found in our hands an original, hybrid work, halfway between the charm of the illustrated book and the RPG with turn-based combat. The icing on the cake, once again everything has been rigorously drawn by hand. The story: Yuu and the dragon's redemption The Cruel King and the Great Hero: Yuu walking through the forest Legend has it that several years ago the Hero defeated the King of Demons, the great dragon: after cutting off one of his horns, the one that granted him immense powers, however, he decided to spare his life. Indeed, the hero remained at the side of the wounded dragon until his complete recovery, while a special bond was born and consolidated between the two, an unexpected friendship destined to last even after death. In fact, some time later the hero died - we can't tell you more - but first he asked the dragon to take care of his only daughter, Yuu. The former king of demons willingly accepted, also because this gesture would finally represent his definitive redemption for the evils committed in the past. Little Yuu, a girl, today considers the dragon her adoptive father, knowing full well that her real parent was a great hero who went down in history. The dragon himself, every night, before going to bed, tells her of the hero's deeds... and wonders, but without worry, if one day Yuu will have to be the warrior predestined to put an end to her life once and for all. all. In which case, he has decided to accept his fate with serenity. The story of The Cruel King and the Great Hero focuses on the deeds of little Yuu, walking around a fantasy world in which she tries to do her best to help every creature in difficulty, regardless of its origin or any dangers. His journey towards maturity is faced day by day, in a simple, slow, effective way, exactly as it would happen in a real ~enhanced~ illustrated book for children. The narration is also cyclical, think of the moments related to the evening and rest, when Yuu and the dragon say good night to each other after the second has told the first the good night story. The plot is short, never pretentious, effective: a little fairy tale in which the pleasantness of the narration itself counts more than the twists and turns. The Cruel King and the Great Hero is the polar opposite of excitement, in almost every aspect. Gameplay: An RPG suitable for everyone One of the areas in The Cruel King and the Great Hero - a cave On the gameplay side, The Cruel King and the Great Hero is a turn-based RPG with very simple mechanics to learn and master. Initially the player controls only Yuu, but gradually the party will expand as you meet new friends. Regardless of this, the clashes take place according to the dynamics that you can well imagine: an action is chosen for each available hero (physical attack, release of a specific skill, defense or use of an item in the inventory), performed immediately afterwards automatically. Enemies usually respond to incoming attacks, but sometimes - if their speed is high - they can even precede them. Depth is certainly not the main value of the production, to the point that a very large number of battles can be won simply by performing repeated physical attacks; instead it is important, yes, to keep an eye on the life points of Yuu and company, to occasionally intervene with the administration of healing objects. After a certain number of battles, the level of the protagonist and her friends increases. By doing so, the character's base parameters also increase accordingly (and all health points are restored for the occasion). The Cruel King and the Great Hero's random encounters can be reduced by running Each game area, characterized by a certain biome, has a precise number of enemy species. Once you reach a higher experience level than wildlife, Yuu unlocks the ability to run in that particular area: doing so will automatically decrease the chance of random encounters appearing. Of tanFrom time to time it is also possible to find pieces of equipment, which try to vary the situation a bit by guaranteeing additional parameters (interesting bonuses such as resistance and speed). However, this does not solve the basic problem - which for some may not even be a problem at all - or rather the general ~simplicity~ of the whole adventure.", "date": "2022-03-07", "grade": "7.5"}
