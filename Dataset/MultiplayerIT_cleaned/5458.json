The genuine amazement for the announcements at the conferences, the excitement of seeing a piece of gameplay for the first time, the exciting discovery of new information on the most anticipated titles have given way to leaks of all kinds that allow us to get to the big event already ~prepared~ for what we will see on stage, partially taking away the charm of the event. This is especially true for the most talked about triple A titles, given that some more limited productions still manage to remain undercover: this is the case of Trials of the Blood Dragon, a spin-off of the famous franchise developed by RedLynx which was not only unveiled to the world during the Ubisoft conference, but was released on digital stores within minutes of the announcement. Animated by great interest in this literally explosive mix, we got on the bike and returned to the future of thirty years ago. Trials of the Blood Dragon is a spin off that tries to innovate the famous franchise without succeeding Blood Brothers The idea of Trials of the Blood Dragon derives from that of another famous spin-off: let's talk about the stand-alone campaign for Far Cry 3 entitled Blood Dragon, which saw us take on the role of the cyber soldier Rex ~Power~ Colt engaged to save the world from a potentially fatal nuclear conflict. The spearhead of the experience was not so much in the gameplay almost identical to that of the main chapter but rather in the continuous homage to pop culture and the imagery of the 80s, to the references to films and TV series that have indelibly marked that decade and the following ones: excessive, colorful, cyberpunk, chaotic are just a few adjectives to describe this crazy shooter capable of carving out legions of fans who have clamored for its return. A little over three years later, Blood Dragon returns to the scene with all its charisma, but declined in a drastically different genre. In Trials of the Blood Dragon we will find ourselves coming to terms with the future as we imagined it thirty years ago, but this time the protagonists will be a boy and a girl, Roxanne and Slayter, the children of the legendary Rex ~Power~ Colt , that twelve years after the Second Vietnam War fought by their father they will have to take the field for the Fourth Vietnam War and once again save freedom and the whole world. As expected, the plot is exaggerated, told by short animated sequences between one level and another and set in the most disparate places in which the United States of America are committed to bringing peace. From the aforementioned Vietnamese war we move on to a Miami governed by drug traffickers in a clear tribute to Hot Line Miami, but there is no shortage of space missions against an army of insectoid aliens, the battle to the death against a group of five lethal assassin ninjas protagonists of a children's show, a trip to Mars to eradicate communism and the search for the Holy Grail kept in an infernal temple. In short, lots of irons in the fire and many different settings for the thirty levels that make up the main campaign, the only mode for a title that eliminates multiplayer and concentrates the playful offer on the repetition of individual ~trials~ in search of time and score improve. It took us no more than three hours to finish it on a first pass, but if you aim for the fateful ~A +~ for each test, many more game sessions will await you. The problem is that, pad in hand, you may like the spin-off developed by RedLynx less than you expect. Playstation 4 trophies Trials of the Blood Dragon allows you to add 21 trophies to your showcase, 2 of which are bronze, 11 silver and 7 gold, as well as the ever-present platinum. On the first pass we collected just over half of them, but to have them all you need to sweat seven shirts, starting with getting an ~A +~ rating in all levels of the main story. Rhythm issue The arrival of Blood Dragon on the shores of Trials gave the development team the right push to experiment with new avenues in terms of gameplay, allowing the franchise to detach itself from traditional mechanics and welcome some innovations that on paper would also have been interesting. The presence of two protagonists - Roxanne is intelligent and has a BMX as opposed to Slayter, more adventurous with his motorcycle - has allowed to give a certain variety between one level and another, with physics as always the master in the represent the real element of challenge of each scenario. Here it emergesthe purest soul, but also more traditional than Trials. Hovering in the air by carefully controlling the pilot's center of gravity, managing the accelerator and brake sparingly, hurling headlong down very steep ramps to perform spectacular frontflips and backflips return an experience that is absolutely familiar to fans of the series which is expanded by the introduction of sections in the which we will find ourselves aboard a tank or thrown headlong on the rails of an abandoned mine in full Indian Jones style. The addition of the grappling hook to be used in some levels gives further variety and forces you to think quickly about swing, inertia and jump distance to overcome the wider chasms and avoid crashing on the ground. However, when Trials of the Blood Dragon abandons its superfine physics model to make way for new mechanics, the spell is broken and one falls into mediocrity. For the first time, the vehicles were accompanied by platform sections to be tackled on foot and others in which you take up a machine gun to make your way through the enemies, but both did not convince us. In the first case, the pace of the game is mainly affected, which drops drastically, while in the second one ends up paying more attention to the trajectory of the bullets rather than that of our motorcycle, sacrificing the taste of driving for a dull burst of machine guns that seems out of place . Likewise, the jetpack sections suffer from weightlessness, leading to frustration very easily. Let me be clear, we are not fundamentalists who regardless criticize any introduction that deviates the gameplay of Trials from the original one, but frankly the addition of such poorly refined mechanics that damage the spectacularity and flow of the action has left us with a bad taste in mouth. On the other hand, nothing to say about the technical sector and the 80s style which proves to be absolutely successful, both as regards the vast graphics dominated by bright colors and for the electronic soundtrack.", "date": "2016-06-20", "grade": "6.8"}
