{"name": "Bee Movie Game - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bee-movie-game-recensione.html", "text": "Dreamworks' new computer graphics work arrives on time for the Christmas holidays, or almost, accompanied by the usual, vast marketing operation including a plethora of different versions of the Bee Movie in a video game, offered on almost all videogame platforms currently on the market. The subject is one that everyone agrees on, making this film a perfect candidate for the choice of film to see with the family: the promising bee Barry B. Benson, who has just graduated from school, embarks on a journey outside the hive, where he meets the beautiful Vanessa and also discovers a terrible secret. In fact, outside the safe confines of the bees' community home, human beings maneuver the poor insects by taking their honey. The gray life of a worker bee that Barry seemed to have to undergo therefore becomes an adventure, in the attempt of the protagonist to stop the theft of honey by humans once and for all. In short, the canvas seems to be typical of the enterprising insect that becomes the savior of the homeland (or of the hive), siding against some great threat interpreted in this case precisely by human beings (and here the educational-ecological element comes into play, which never hurts). The video game is substantially based on the plot of the film, retracing it in an interactive version within the (few) settings of the film and inserting the typical elements necessary to try to build a sort of adventure on it, which in most cases ends in the simplest demand and deliver or collect items quests. Ultimately, Bee Movie Game, on Nitrendo DS, presents itself as the typical commercial operation aimed at exploiting the appeal of the film on the videogame market, without adding substance and quality to the experience of the cinematographic film through the new medium, as would be desirable for every tie-ins. The hard life of the bee The game is structured as an action-adventure in which we take control of Berry, with a shot from above. We find ourselves exploring vast environments that serve as levels (New Hive City, Central Park, Grocery Store, and The Honey Farm), carrying out various tasks that are assigned to us by the characters who populate these places. It must be said that the levels are few, and it is possible to easily finish the game in less than 5 hours, the first negative point of the title in question. The other major problem is the repetitiveness of the action: clearly we are dealing with a game designed for a very young audience, but even among products of this kind it is possible to expect a slightly more complex game structure. Bee Movie Game is limited to making us flutter around the levels, talk to the characters and fulfill the various wishes, which basically involve, in most cases, the collection of objects and the transport of these to the person concerned. Just look at the radar located on the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS: a green dot represents the objective, and all you have to do is reach it. On the way, there are also enemies to avoid or fight, and rare bosses that trigger particular battles, based on the completion of particular mini-games to be played entirely on the touch screen. The latter events are quite entertaining, but they are infrequent, while simple encounters with enemies really don't represent anything particularly exciting. The strong point of the game is the breadth of the levels and their realization: Bee Movie therefore finds its maximum expression in the exploratory phase. Berry is controlled through the directional pad, while the keys are used for interaction (talking to the characters or hitting objects to release pollen), flying and combat. The design with which the levels are structured often forces you to change the level of height from the ground, in order to discover passages that are invisible at first sight and reach new locations, or thus managing to shelter from the elements or further dangers. Nib and sting Bee Movie is a classic example of lack of integration in the use of the touch screen within the game, at least from a contextual point of view. The sections that take advantage of the second screen and the tactile capabilities of the console are in fact present, but are inserted as an external element with respect to the actual action, which happens in many similar productions. The interaction with the stylus is in fact limited to the mini-games that dot the game, which are integrated in a rather forced way in the game action but which can at least act as an interesting diversion from the otherwise monotonous procedure of searching and recovering objects which represents the basic dynamics. These alternate gameplay snippets are used pTo increase Berry's stats, modifying his fundamental skills and making him stronger against dangers. It is basically a few variations, mostly consisting of tests of reflexes and timing, where you find yourself pressing keys or dragging objects on the lower screen, while a non-interactive animation usually appears on the upper screen illustrating what is happening to our insect-like hero. These interludes are also found in the rare boss fights, where the same mini-games recur with minimal variations, and on which the battle is practically centered, thus creating a common thread between the training phases and the fundamental tests to which Berry is subjected. Miniature hero The real strong point of Bee Movie Game, in this version for Nintendo DS, is the technical realization. The graphics of the game are immediately positive, with vast scenarios, rich in elements and colors and with an excellent use of 3D with a perspective effect, capable of giving the right impression of framing the world from above. Dealing with a bee, all the elements of the scenario obviously appear oversized, making the settings particularly fascinating, and in line with the cartoonish look that pervades the whole game. However, the objects that make up the background are fixed, you can rarely interact with them, and only if you try to get some pollen (which evidently is hidden in whatever surrounds us). In any case, the graphics are well cared for, and the ability to switch from one level to another of ground clearance makes the scenarios even more complex and intricate. Even the animations are of excellent quality: both the movements of Berry and those of the supporting characters and enemies (although there are very few that characterize the latter) are fluid and convincing, as in general the movement of the camera, which helps to make the well the action and surrounding scenery. Unsatisfying, however, since it is a game based on a computer graphic cartoon, is the attention paid to the ~extraludic~ elements: presentations, cutscenes, dialogues and narrative parts are represented only by static screens and a few sentences written on the screen, while it would have been decidedly more pleasant to be able to see some more spectacular animation, in order to immerse the player in the action in a more engaging way. The audio accompaniment consists mainly of clips from the film's soundtrack, and little else, since the dialogues are not spoken and the sound effects are not distinguished by any particular element. Comment Bee Movie Game is clearly a product aimed at extremely young audiences, but the inadequacy of the gameplay cannot be justified with this single explanation. It is a pity that the game action is so monotonous and devoid of interesting ideas, since the care instilled in the creation of the graphics sector could have made this title much more engaging. Instead, we end up with a sketch of an adventure that can be concluded in a handful of hours and which does not offer any particularly funny starting points, in the continuous repetition of the same actions to be performed (dialogue, research, return). The mini-games that can be played on the touch screen are an interesting diversion, but they are few and poorly inserted into the game action, a strange thing, however, given the capabilities achieved by the Vicarious Visions in development on the Nintendo DS. Ultimately, the impression remains of a game perhaps concluded with excessive haste, which if it had proposed greater longevity and variety in the action would certainly have stood out among the competition, also by virtue of truly remarkable 3D graphics.Pro Good realization technique Pleasant setting Nice ~scalar~ structure of the levels Cons Repetitive and boring in brief Too short Poor integration of the touch screen", "date": "2007-12-20", "grade": null}
