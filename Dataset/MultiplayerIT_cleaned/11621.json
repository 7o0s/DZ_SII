{"name": "Donkey Kong: Jet Race - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/donkey-kong-jet-race-recensione.html", "text": "After closing this first year of the Wii's life, the time has finally come to look back and evaluate what the latest addition to Nintendo has been able to bring to the market. At a quick and approximate glance, the library of titles has thus been divided over the course of the months: original titles largely based on established franchises (Nintendo and otherwise), porting of titles released some time ago on other consoles and re-equipped with new controls, and finally titles initially planned for Cubo only to be diverted to Wii following continuous delays. The latter category, in addition to counting the excellent Super Paper Mario among its ranks, also presents what should have closed the trio of games on Cube dedicated to Donkey Kong, and now based on the renowned konga - the controller-bongos. The story goes that the developers have drifted the project for Cubo, a mario kart-style racer based on the use of these particular controllers, to adapt it to the ambitions of the new console. The result? Unfortunately for Donkey, a game that takes the glories of Rare even further away. Donkey Kong Jet Race gives a nod to Mario Kart, but fails to do so As mentioned a few lines above, the concept on which Donkey Kong Jet Race is based is very simple: the characters who gravitate around the universe of the ape are equipped with a belt with double konga propulsion, and engaged in crazy races that wink to Mario Kart (without, however, it must be specified immediately, succeeding even in the slightest part), where the petrol to run is supplied by the arms of the players who shake the wiimote and nunchuk as quickly as possible. Given the particularity of the commands, the player is given the opportunity to follow an exhaustive tutorial held by Cranky, Donkey's grandfather (most remember him on a rocking chair intent on listening to a gramophone in the first donkey kong country), in where movements useful for successfully completing the races are explained step by step. The concept is very simple: by moving the wiimote and nunchuk up and down alternately, you pick up speed, once the maximum is reached the player's only concern is to turn right (waving only the wiimote), left (vice versa using the nunchuk ) or jump (by moving both appendages up) to avoid obstacles and enemies and collect bananas and bonuses. While the former are to be collected in order to 'collect' turbo boosts that can be activated via the nunchuck stick, the latter are divided into personal and attack bonuses, where if the former mainly serve to increase the collected banana counter, the latter put their character an attack weapon and therefore a convenient opportunity for overtaking. Hand-propelled monkeys Once the flight lessons are over, five possible ways open to the player to start the gaming experience: single player, multiplayer, timed race, practice and, last but not least, the challenges. The single player does not deviate an inch from what is normal in racers of this kind: it is possible to participate in four classes of races divided according to difficulty, each of which is in turn composed of a series of championships in all and in all respects similar to those of mario kart, both as regards the high-sounding names of the races and for the structure of the settings. Snow-capped mountains, caves, jungles, sunny bays, shortcuts, the ability to use mine carts and re-encounter old friends like the swordfish and rhino of the first DKC, all hazily reminiscent of the now twenty-year history of donkey kong without ever being able to leave its mark, mainly due to too dated graphics, perhaps even for the cube alone. If in the developers' project this new incarnation of Donkey Kong had to definitively consecrate the bongos as a controller suitable for any type of game (donkey konga was a musical game, jungle blast a bizarre platform), the use of the pair wiimote and nunchuk does highlight all the shortcomings of the game itself. The bad game controls - kilometers away from the precision experienced in games like Zelda or Mario - prove to be inaccurate and unreliable (it happens more than once to move to accelerate and instead get a jump), often hindering the flow of the races. However, it is the multiplayer races that are the real thorns in the side of the game, being describable with one word: boring. The multiplayer experience should represent the backbone of such a game, but the poor management of the controls combined with a disastrous realization of the bonuses to be collected in the race, make the challenge between friendsdecide in favor of the person who has the most luck in avoiding the obstacles in the three laps foreseen by the event. The list of modes ends with the classic time attack, practice and challenges, in which the player is offered a series of missions to complete which can range from collecting a certain number of bananas, up to to complete a certain route with a pre-established technique. If from a graphic point of view, as previously mentioned, the game aims to retrace all the settings of the Donkey Kong universe, it cannot be said that the experiment has been successful: the tracks are often and willingly repetitive and poorly characterized, with just a couple of hallmarks to differentiate a jungle from a bay by the sea. The character design has no better luck than the settings: the review and the alleged rejuvenation of some of the most famous characters in the series represent pejorative and clarifying interventions of the few ideas in the hands of the developers. The sound side of the game does not enjoy a better reputation, with the now historic songs related to the ape buried under a layer of very unmemorable false-modern tunes. Nintendo's ape is facing yet another evolutionary crossroads: sticking to the bongos and rethinking the series from scratch as Rare did in the days of super NES, or continue on the theme and presumably arrive at media extinction. The big problem is that Donkey Kong Jet Race is an approximate game, based on the multiplayer concept but at the same time deeply boring, born to be played with bongos and adapted to wii controllers precluding - in an inexplicable way - any possibility of using the controllers percussion. There is a lot to work on, because at this point there is very little left to save.
