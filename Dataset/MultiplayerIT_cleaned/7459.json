No, not to buy one (unless there is some exclusive of interest to you, of course), but because the release of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One decisively moves the bar of what has always been (and always will be , for obvious market reasons) the reference platform for the development of multi-platform video games. Let's try to explain ourselves better: until the day before yesterday we were able to enjoy enhanced versions in the Windows environment, in terms of resolution and frame rate, of games that however were born with the aim of exploiting a seven-year-old hardware, precisely that of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. As if to say that you can also put the engine of a Porsche 911 inside a 1986 Fiat Panda: it will be much faster but will still have the look of a Panda. The transition to the new generation of consoles, all built around an x86 architecture, makes the work of developers substantially easier, who don't have to ~hold back~ and can therefore push the technical sector of their titles to the maximum, scaling it if necessary . This is especially true in the case of the AnvilNext engine, which drives new Assassin's Creed episodes. The Ubisoft engine, derived from Havok, in fact allows you to replace the assets at will, for example by mounting different versions of the same texture depending on the platform on which the software must run. And so Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag stands as an excellent spot for gaming on PC, showing us an unprecedented definition for the scenarios, a higher frame rate and advanced effects compared to what is also available on PlayStation 4 and, let's suppose, Xbox One. Feline shot ~With great powers come great responsibilities~, someone once said, and so the Windows edition of Black Flag brings extraordinary technical quality to the table, which however is not free at all and must be paid for separately. Don't worry: the price of the game is always the same, traditionally lower than the console counterpart, but it is clear that owners of a mid-range configuration will have to consider upgrading their equipment, especially if they want to view the splendid landscapes of Nassau, Havana and Kingston in the splendor of a 4K screen, or if they want to ~settle~ for 1080p but with all effects maxed out and a frame rate of 60fps or higher. Some statements made yesterday by the game producer, Sylvain Trottier, had honestly displeased us in the face of the greater hardware demands of the new episode of the series, but in these days of testing we had to change our minds about certain aspects of the production. A direct comparison with Assassin's Creed III would be unfair, firstly because the quality of materials and surfaces in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is visibly superior, and just take a look at the roofs of the houses, the fabrics, the faces of the characters during the cutscenes (all in real time, with very few exceptions) and the extraordinary realization of the sea to realize it; secondly because the conspicuous drops in frame rate from which the previous chapter suffered did not depend on the weight of the graphics, but on clear optimization problems which were then resolved through the release of patches. It's true: with the same configuration and settings there are almost ten frames per second of difference between the two games, and also there is a finishing work yet to be verified in terms of CPU exploitation (it seems that Black Flag does not use multicore processors adequately), however the feeling is of being - now really - in the presence of a ~next gen~ version of the Ubisoft title. Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag arrives on PC with an incredibly beautiful ~next gen~ version In detail The graphic adjustments present in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag for PC are more numerous than in the past, allowing you to scale the experience in various ways and obtain unprecedented results in certain areas. What the hell did you do to your face? The game supports practically all the antialiasing technologies available: from FXAA, ideal in terms of impact on performance for those who own an older generation NVIDIA video card, to the recent TXAA, very effective in eliminating ladders. A lot of work has also been done on the shadows, which in addition to the traditional three quality levels (low, medium, high) boast three more in ~soft shadow~ mode, i.e. with a truly realistic and convincing edge blending, even more so when related to the excellent day-night cycle and tropical settings, full of trees that clearly project theown shadow on the sand. Remaining in the context of lighting, an option has been included to adjust the quality of the crepuscular rays, which acts during low light situations, making some scenes in the moonlight or when the sun filters through the clouds more evocative, especially if we are in the open sea. Speaking of the sea, the rendering of water in Black Flag is absolutely stunning, probably the best ever seen in a video game, perhaps even better than Battlefield 4 and Grand Theft Auto V. Not only does the surface look splendid, but it is enriched by an enormous amount of reflections and truly spectacular storms, complete with waterspouts and volumetric fog. I shaved with the double blade. The care taken by Ubisoft in the creation of the sea is not surprising, given that practically half of the campaign takes place there. As far as the mainland is concerned, the settings benefit in particular from the implementation of HBAO+, an advanced ambient occlusion technology that clearly improves the quality of the textures and stands out in particular in the rendering of the tiles on the roofs of the houses, never so ~full-bodied~ , but also in the ornaments of the buildings and in the vegetation, truly splendid and defined. On the test configuration, the impact of all these effects was obviously felt, and with v-sync off (fortunately we didn't notice any tearing), the resolution set to 1080p and all settings maxed out we got a frame rate variable from 28 to 30 frames per second, with quite noticeable drops (22-24 fps) during the opening sequences. An uninspiring result in terms of fluidity, as already mentioned, but net of a still deficient optimization, considering that far more performing PCs than the one we used scored just 5 fps more in the same conditions. In short, Black Flag is visually splendid, so much so that we stopped to think what it would be like to be able to return to the locations of Florence and Venice with this visual quality, but it is also an ongoing construction site and future updates released by Ubisoft (and NVIDIA) will necessarily have to do something in this sense. And then oh well, there's the game The writer is a fan of Assassin's Creed of the first hour, one of those who did not welcome (understatement) the new course of the Ubisoft series and the renunciation of a certain type of setting in favor of a greater response from the American public . Let's be clear: he is telling us the story of the Kenway family, how he is dealing with an interesting theme such as that of the pirates of the Caribbean, even if perhaps it would have been appropriate to use an unnumbered title to do so (~Assassin's Creed: Black Flag~ was more that good); and it is certainly pleasing that the authors have sought relatively fresh narrative cues, focusing as per tradition on real figures and real events to embroider the traditional story that sees the Assassins as opposed to the Templars. However, if there were already holes in the plot in Assassin's Creed III, here there are real chasms that are difficult to ignore, all the more so given the importance that history has always had for this franchise. Edward is not an Assassin and there is some character evolution during the campaign, however he learns to use the hidden blade and to take the leap of faith in an ~innate~ way, so to speak, without a word of explanation. Even justifying in this way the hurriedness of the introductory phase, it is completely unlikely that a man like him, with the principles of a pirate, suddenly adopts the conduct of the Order and even sets about carrying out assassinations on commission without no one has ever ~titled~ it. Chasms, we said, which fortunately are compensated by a side dish, even narrative, of great substance and depth. The sandbox setting is used as usual to send us to recover chests, treasure maps, songs for the crew (this feature is very nice), Animus fragments for the modern subplot (let's call it that), diving missions and even aquatic hunting. Speaking of water, as mentioned practically half of the campaign develops at sea, aboard our brig, and this is probably the best part of the game, given that the naval battles have been improved in various respects and represent the only element challenge of experience. The combat system is in fact always the same, the enemies wait their turn to strike and the introduction of guns is of little use, given the trend. It's incredible how Ubisoft hasn't been able to improve such an important component of the experience, yet it would have been enoughsimply copying what Rocksteady did with the various Batmans, deputing stealth eliminations the possibility of killing enemies with a single treacherous shot. The question of weapons also weighs: as usual, using one sword rather than another does not change the final result except from an aesthetic point of view, and here too an enhancement is urgently needed, perhaps with the introduction of maneuvers linked to each individual tool , however, with a view to a global review of the combat system.", "date": "2013-11-22", "grade": "9.3"}
