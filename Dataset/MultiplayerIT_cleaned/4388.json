Let's try not to think about the Konami executives for a moment and let's put ourselves in the shoes of the developers, game designers, directors and producers who are still in force at the Japanese company, and who obviously didn't rejoice at the news of the farewell of what they probably considered a mentor. Kojima's influence on the videogame medium is unquestionable, and we like to think that, faced with the commercial need to exploit the Metal Gear name for a new production, the development team has rolled up their sleeves and prepared to face a battle far from easy, as far as we see perhaps even impossible to win: the one against preconceptions. We were the first to approach Metal Gear Survive with skepticism, mentally underlining all those aspects of the game that seemed to take a mediocre drift, especially on the narrative front, and coming to the conclusion that as soon as the project moved away from the original tracks it risked derailment. Yet this train went ahead anyway, even with its rickety carriages, and led us on a journey that lasted almost thirty hours, between campaign and cooperative multiplayer sessions, leaving us with a fairly clear message: you've come this far, but the adventure has just begun. Electrified clean slate As explained in the story of our first hours with the game, Metal Gear Survive is a survival-based spin-off that starts from the Ground Zeroes ending to build on it a story of dimensional rifts, mysterious creatures and nameless heroes. Our character, to be created using a special editor (but his appearance will always remain editable, if desired), is one of the many soldiers who fell during the battle that concluded the prologue of The Phantom Pain, but has an ability that distinguishes him from all the others: he was infected with some sort of virus that allowed him to survive. This talent makes him the ideal candidate to travel into the wormhole that connects our world to that of Dis, a parallel dimension that some special units, the Corps of Charon, were trying to probe in order to understand its secrets. However, the group has been decimated and someone needs to go and find out what happened, so the scientist in charge of the project, who responds to the pseudonym of ~Goodluck~, decides to project us into this alternative and menacing world. In fact, the Wanderers move among the desert lands of Dis, pathetic creatures, once men, blind but able to perceive the vibrations around them and to attack them with unheard-of ferocity. Once we arrive at our destination we will come across one of the survivors of the previous expedition, Reeve, and together with him we will establish a base camp next to the remains of the Mother Base, which ended up well before us in the portal. There we will have to follow the instructions of Virgil AT-9, an artificial intelligence who will coordinate our actions and guide us through the recovery of important memory cards, with the ultimate goal of restoring the wormhole and returning home. But will it really be that simple? Survive Whatever you do in Metal Gear Survive, it is not possible to ignore the hunger and thirst indicators of the protagonist: these are needs that we will have to satisfy continuously, otherwise there will be a substantial decline in performance, symptoms such as blurred vision, a drastic drop in health and finally death, followed in this case by a return to base camp or by restoring the last save. Initially we will have to be content with drinking dirty water and chewing on plants, but with the creation of a bonfire we will begin to be able to purify water and cook the meat of hunted animals, in a growth path that will lead us to a certain point to develop centers for the collection and purification of rainwater, vegetable plantations and small farms. At the same time, the development of workbenches dedicated to the creation and enhancement of weapons, accessories, clothing and medicines will proceed, and perhaps of a shelter in which to rest in order to recover from any injuries or ailments, allowing a few hours to pass and waking up done evening. The expeditions within the map are used to obtain resources and Kuban energy, extracted from the corpses of the Wanderers, but also to reactivate teleportation devices which subsequently allow to quickly reach various points of the large sandbox created for the occasion: a setting desert, as mentioned, which at a certain point gives way to ~dust~, an area completely covered by a poisonous mist, which in many ways recalls the ~upside down~ of Stranger Things. Once we enter the powder, we will have to use an oxygen tank to be able to breathe and we will get tired sooner during the race, which means that our exploratory ambitions will be limited and we will have to pay attention to the objectives we set ourselves, because often the farther we go and more effort we will make to return. Our GPS device does not work when we are in the dust, unless we are very close to the objective previously marked on the map, and this means that sometimes we will wander around for quite some time, perhaps facing some combat, to then realize that you have come full circle and are back to square one. Refilling oxygen is possible, but you need Kuban energy: when you're done with it, you'll have to quickly find enemies to extract it from or you'll be in serious trouble. Speaking of enemies, Metal Gear Survive adopts a combat system that draws heavily on the action survival tradition, using a ~tank~ style movement approach also in order to make the fight more complex and the outcome more uncertain. The Walkers are slow and blind, it's true, but they know how to surprise with treacherous movements and, especially during the early stages of the campaign, inflict huge damage. In short, they must not be underestimated, which is why in many cases it is advisable to proceed low and silently, get behind them and eliminate them with a single blow of the dagger right there, in the red crystal that emerges where once there was a head. The mission There are basically two types of missions that we will be dealing with in Metal Gear Survive: recovery ones and tower defense-style ones. In the first case you have to reach an area of the map in search of a memory card or another survivor, the latter to then be assigned to a task so that the base camp can grow and develop new buildings, new supply systems and new defenses. It is therefore a question of going and returning, but the scenario can reserve unpleasant surprises, especially when entering the Dust. In the case of the tower defense sections, however, it is necessary to activate electronic excavators that work on the wormhole and defend them from the attack of hordes of enemies. The direction of arrival of the Wanderers is indicated by some arrows, so we will be able to place barriers along the path useful for slowing them down and/or damaging them, as well as providing us with the possibility of hitting them with a spear while they are on the other side of a metal mesh. The further you go, the more complex these activities become, so much so that in the vicinity of the ~finale~ you will really have to think strategically to be able to make it. We first introduced the combat system, which as mentioned is characterized by limited mobility of the character and more or less fast attack times depending on the equipped weapon. There are machetes, sticks, demolition clubs and spears, with a view to an arsenal that becomes gradually richer and which also includes bows or pistols, rifles, machine guns, Molotov cocktails or grenades, decoys and so on. However, our enormous equipment also includes the aforementioned metal or wooden fences, simple or with spikes, which we can project in front of the character thanks to a sophisticated reverse Fulton system, which activates a small portal from which the objects emerge. Getting in tune with these mechanisms will make the difference between living and dying, in the world of Metal Gear Survive, and in the same way the growth of the character will count a lot, which can be achieved through the use of Kuban energy. Leveling up allows you to unlock a new skill and therefore gain strength, health or resistance, or obtain special maneuvers: the lateral swerve during combat, the enhanced lunge, more articulated combos, attacks from above and so on . Every extra move you get represents a small step towards victory. Lots of stuff There's a reason why many action survival games are so successful, and it probably has to do with human nature itself. The satisfaction of looting and dropping, the irrepressible collection of more or less precious objects and materials aimed at the construction of new and more powerful equipment, which proceeds in parallel with the growth of our avatar, transmits a sensation that the brain receives and interprets in the best possible way of ways, through a sense of accomplishment. From this point of view, the work of the Metal Gear Survive developers has something scholastic: without prejudice to the solid foundations of Ground Zeroes and the FOX Engine, with a large reuse of assets already seen in Kojima's latest production, the structure game introduces graduallyall the elements that one would expect to find, even going so far as to facet them in ways that initially (and even later, in truth) appear even excessive. Did you get a cut or food poisoning? Well, there is no universal medikit that will make you feel better, but bandages, poultices, hemostatic remedies, pills for dysentery and more: if you don't have the right material, you won't be able to cure yourself. In purely numerical terms, the loot that we will find around Dite is enormous and complex, but we must not make the mistake of thinking that the authors have limited themselves to seeing what works these days in the videogame market and introducing it without thinking too much about it . In reality, every progress we make has a precise meaning and fits perfectly into the gameplay, allowing us to improve a little but not enough to turn our expeditions into a health walk. In the same way, the repetitiveness of the situations that leads us to the second part of the campaign at a certain point takes a completely different path, and so suddenly the single type of enemy we were used to is joined by various others: the damned Seekers, capable of making great leaps and attacking unexpectedly; the Mortars, extremely resistant and capable of firing bursts or explosive spheres; the Creepers, hideous spiders that attack in large groups; or even the enemies who hide underground only to then pop out suddenly, not to mention the Tanks, the Detonators and their huge-headed cousins. The Metal Gear Survive experience literally transforms after the first ten hours, and does it again after twenty hours, as you ~complete~ the campaign and unlock new missions and four different character classes, each with specific specializations. We didn't expect these numbers and this substance, even more so if we consider that both elements are declined from the point of view of the single player and not of an extended cooperative. The multiplayer The multiplayer sector of Metal Gear Survive appears to be largely like a missed opportunity, although even this aspect of the game ~matures~ after a few hours and actually presents more complex and exciting situations. At present, a single mode is available in a handful of settings, with three possible difficulty levels that change the number of enemies, their resistance and of course the rewards that we will be able to obtain in case of victory. Here too we are dealing with a tower defense section to be carried out in four, and it is very interesting to note how at first we limit ourselves to defending the excavator without exposing ourselves, while with the growth of the characters and the increase in the degree of challenge the experience turns into something else. The collection of extra materials with a view to secondary objectives between one horde and another, for example, but also and above all the advance on enemies so that they can be blocked halfway, creating barriers and using wide-range attacks, such as grenades or napalm Molotov cocktails, to thin out their ranks before they get one step away from the device we have the task of defending. We know that a new co-op mode will arrive in March, so we expect a boost on the variety front, but it is interesting to note how the rewards and energy accumulated in multiplayer can then be transported into the single-player experience to pursue growth in the moment which for some reason we got stuck in front of a too difficult mission. In short, it seems that even this aspect has not been inserted by chance, preparing users for a sort of ~grinding corner~ where they can develop their character in order to lighten the tasks of the campaign. Maybe even too much, actually. Playstation 4 trophies Most of Metal Gear Solid's over fifty trophies are hidden away, and of course there's a reason behind it. In short, the pleasure of discovery extends to the achievement side of the Konami title, which rewards players when they take their first steps in terms of construction, learning skills, hunting, combat and missions. There are of course Trophies related to quantitative issues and related to specialization with the various weapon categories. In short, there is no shortage of variety. Kojima touch We opened the review by saying that the influence of Hideo Kojima is present in a surprising way within a product like Metal Gear Survive, which on paper should have taken a completely different path. The Master's narrative style is reprized during the introductory stages of the story, as well as", "date": "2018-02-26", "grade": "8.0"}
