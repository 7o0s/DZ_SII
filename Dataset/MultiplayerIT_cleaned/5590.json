After the publication of Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate and some conversions for PlayStation Vita - including Injustice and the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection - the Austin team has unveiled ReCore to the world, a promising action adventure that still remains wrapped in an aura of mystery after being officially presented during last year's E3. Today, however, we are going to talk about the second project that has kept the guys from Armature busy in recent months. Born from the idea of combining in a single solution the frenzy and immediacy of classic space action shooters with an online architecture based on strategy and team play, Dead Star offers exciting group battles within generated space arenas in a procedural way and puts the emphasis on an interesting system of progression of bases and ships. After going through a beta testing period, the game was launched on Steam and PSN on April 5th and is currently part of the Instant Gaming Collection aimed at PlayStation Plus subscribers. So let's see the central features of this new online experience, to understand if the idea of joining two components which at first sight are so distant from each other has proved to be a good solution. Dead Star is a constant struggle for territorial supremacy Conquering the outposts Dead Star is set on the edge of known space, in a system that is on the brink of collapse. Among the ruins of an ancient battlefield, a multitude of prisoners are forced to experience their imprisonment in a very particular way, under the control of an artificial intelligence that does not allow anyone to leave the area. Divided between the opposing factions of the Scavenger and the Mechanics, these subjects are busy fighting each other to recover the few still functioning warp engines, hidden among the debris of the old space flagships. Only thanks to these technological wrecks is it possible to concoct an effective escape plan. Each game map is randomly generated and consists of a variable number of hexagonal sectors, in the center of which an outpost is positioned. In the main mode, based on five against five or ten against ten matches and called Conquest, you have the task of obtaining strategic control of the area through two alternative solutions. In the event that it is possible to dominate the match, it is possible to access the Decisive Victory, i.e. the control of all the sectors adjacent to the enemy base. Achieving this objective allows you to unlock the protective shields of the main base and, through a well-organized raid, you can pursue the direct destruction of the outpost. Conversely, if the match is more balanced, the Strategic Victory criterion can be used: once the maximum amount of points foreseen for the match has been reached, a defensive cannon will automatically disintegrate the enemy base and end hostilities . The different final outcome reverberates on the extent of the rewards received at the end of each match, since an effective division of tasks and the collaboration of all team members is needed to be able to successfully creep up to the last enemy bulwark. After gaining access to a warp drive you can enter the second game mode, called Escape. In this case your team is tasked with escorting a flagship and, to succeed in the enterprise, it is necessary to successfully go through a series of other games in progress. Each member of the group is assigned to a defensive turret and will have to resist the incursions of other players, until the decisive warp to freedom. The interesting thing is that, during these raids in ranked matches, the other players are alerted to the anomalous presence, being able to decide to ignore the fugitives and continue undisturbed in their battle or join forces with the enemy for the sole purpose of destroying the ship before it succeeds to leave. The incentive to attack intruders is obviously determined by the presence of rare rewards, which can speed up the evolution of one's equipment. Playstation 4 trophies There are 48 Dead Star Trophies, divided between 36 bronze, 8 silver, 3 gold and platinum. Most of the objectives concern the progression of your pilot level, the amount of enemies killed and the execution of tactical actions. Group strategy Dead Star shines for cooperative actions, but also fora strategic approach that embraces both the choice of spacecraft and the activities to be performed in the field. In the matchmaking screen there is a slot, called Loadout, through which it is possible to load three ships, preferably belonging to each of the three available classes. The Scout category is useful in the early stages of the game, when the most important activity is the occupation of the greatest amount of bases and the reduction of the enemy in the minority, while the Raiders are fundamental in the operations of upgrading the outposts by collecting minerals from meteorites. Conversely, the category of Frigates is more suitable for raids on outposts already conquered by the opposing faction, thanks to a high firepower and the use of shields which also allow allies to be regenerated. It is clear that, given the nature of the meetings, the ability to make correct and well-timed decisions is second only to the need to remain as cohesive as possible with the rest of one's group: only through organization is it possible to dominate the scene, and it is above all for this reason that Dead Star remains recommended for those who intend to play in the company of their friends while also supporting themselves with headphones. The enhancement system is particularly ramified, going to reverberate both in the interval phases between one match and another and in the live match. Each ship available in the Hangar has five slots related to its attack and defense characteristics. In addition to the core there is a primary attack system, a secondary weapon - usually based on guided missile attacks or laser beams - various categories of shield and care for allies and finally a variety of stealth functions that allow you to hide for fleeting periods or to move quickly and evade multiple attacks. Each of these five slots can be upgraded by hoarding a series of components and in doing so you can level up your ships, allowing the player to enter the game with an increasingly performing vehicle. Thanks to the upgrades, the margins of evolution during the clashes are reduced, making the player more competitive from the very first stages of the game. However, the elimination of enemy ships, the mining and the occupation of outposts is still necessary to increase one's offensive and defensive solidity, through a progression method that can be set to automatic or manual parameters.", "date": "2016-04-08", "grade": "8.0"}
