{"name": "L'isola risorta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/168976-dead-island-definitive-collection-lisola-risorta.html", "text": "Perhaps also to buffer the prolonged wait for Dead Island 2, which among other things does not seem to be doing well given the new rumors of an alleged cancellation, Deep Silver has launched the now usual remaster operation also for its tropical horror series, churning out this Dead Island: Definitive Edition for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is a collection containing the first Dead Island, the sequel Dead Island: Riptide and an additional bonus game entitled Dead Island: Retro Revenge which presents a completely different concept being a sort of themed endless runner, the only fresh and innovative element of the whole package. The reworking operation carried out on the two titles is commendable, although it almost exclusively involves the technical aspect of the Chrome graphics engine, probably also acting as a ~gym~ to prepare the way for the construction of the real new chapter, but despite the remaster being now a habit it is still difficult to passively accept the revival of the same titles of the last generation three years after the launch of the new consoles and, moreover, at the gates of a possible further hardware evolution that could already be revealed in the coming months. From a conceptual point of view we would certainly have preferred, at this point, to be faced with Dead Island 2, the new chapter announced at E3 in 2014 and subsequently dispersed in an odyssey of problems and changes of hands, which led finally on the desks of Sumo Digital after Yager was ~relieved of her duties~. The situation will have prompted Deep Silver to think about filling the wait with a remaster, to which someone could slyly object that no doctor has necessarily prescribed a mandatory dose of Dead Island every few years, but the quality of the titles is undeniable and if nothing else the package comes with an affordable price, even more if you buy only one title of the two, digitally. Tropic overdose The two games are structurally identical to the original versions, therefore we refer you to the Dead Island review and the Dead Island: Riptide review for all the specific information and individual evaluations, which remain substantially valid even today, although the technological context is very different , as well as the gaming landscape, with the competition represented by other interpretations of survival horror in the first person in the open world. Ironically, the main rival comes from within, with Techland actually pushing several boundaries of their former series with the new Dying Light, most notably in the version including The Following expansion. There is a particular premise to make: already at the time of the original release of Dead Island: Riptide a certain question of identity arose about the game, which appeared as an evolved and enhanced version of the original, but not so distinct as to seem a real second chapter, even if the amount of content has always amply justified its release as a title in its own right. This impression is even more evident if you are faced with a package that includes both chapters together: in fact, the gaming experience is still very similar between the two titles and also considering that the plot does not really represent a key element of the all would recommend to newbies the simple purchase of only Dead Island: Riptide digitally for  19.90 as amply sufficient to experience the particular tropical nightmare of Techland in the best way. It is a consideration that we feel like making because as a title it can easily stand on its own and the price in this case is also adequate, which perhaps cannot be said of the entire 39.99 euro package which even from a conceptual point of view (the will to re-propose Dead Island to the new audience) is starting to creak a bit, with a second chapter that should be near by now. You return with renewed horror to the old lost tropical paradises of Dead Island Aesthetic renovation The reworking carried out by Techland (other teams responsible for the remaster are not mentioned, apparently) concerns here exclusively the technical sector of both games, having updated the graphic system thanks to the latest version of the Chrome engine. The effects of this refresh are clearly visible between the increase in texture resolution and the application of the new physically-based shading and lighting system, as well as the implementation of HBAO and motion blur. The greatest impact is achieved on the exteriors, already fascinating at the time but even more suggestive in this reworking with the new lighting effects, especially in Riptidewhich already starts from an originally superior base. It can be seen quite well that the whole infrastructure is based on games that have by now several springs on their shoulders, in particular as regards the first Dead Island, but considering that already at the time both titles represented remarkable results, with their large freely explorable settings, this update does some justice to the originals and the tropical paradises are now even more fascinating. The improvement of the textures appears quite evident in the interiors and in the reproduction of the characters even if the announced modification of the polygonal models for the latter does not seem to have produced significant changes in their appearance. We might have expected an attempt to push everything to 60 frames per second, which would have represented a noticeable change in the gaming experience but that hasn't happened, with both titles still running at around 30 frames per second, if not other with a rather stable frame rate. There is some tearing especially in the indoor sections, but the problem could be solved with later patches. In principle, the two Dead Island manage to make a dignified figure in the midst of properly new generation titles but their ~ancient~ origins appear quite clear, especially as regards the first chapter even if it was carried out on it perhaps an even greater job to try to equalize the general graphic level to that of Riptide. Xbox One goals Even the unlockable objectives have remained practically the same as the original chapters, without therefore representing any element of novelty beyond a general relocation of the points to also include the DLCs of the individual chapters in the total calculation of 1000 points for each title present. In principle, the achievements require a certain effort and are linked to cumulative performances rather than to the progression of the story, based on the results achieved in the medium-long term in the exploration of the settings, which is in line with the spirit of the games. New clothes, old substance In short, it cannot be said that this remaster has not been taken with a certain commitment from a technical point of view, the problem if anything is the fact that it does not present any changes in all other areas, with the gameplay and contents remaining exactly the same , except the introduction of the ~Power Fists Power-up~ mod that can be activated from the beginning and the introduction of the unreleased title Dead Island: Retro Revenge. For this reason there is really nothing to add to the comments made at the time on Dead Island and Riptide, because the proposed experience is exactly the same, with its strengths and weaknesses, elements which had already remained all too unchanged in the transition between the first and second chapter. It is remarkable how the open setting still stimulates the free exploration of the environments, with the constant threat of that wonderful and lethal tropical sandbox to always keep us on our toes but also to push us further and further in the discovery of the scenarios, all assisted by a good character progression system, loot and weapon crafting and management, as well as an excellent cooperative multiplayer that further amplifies the gaming experience. On the other hand, the historical defects remain such as the narrative deficiencies, the lack of variety and depth of the quests and a certain chaos that dominates in the first-person melee battles. Nothing new, in fact, these being the strengths and weaknesses of the original titles already examined in the original reviews, as well as the individual evaluations of both games can still be valid, given that the technical aspect is compensated by the adaptation work made for these remasters. The new introduction in terms of content is therefore represented by Dead Island: Retro Revenge, but it is very little. It is a nice 2D arcade, represented with a strongly retro graphic style, which mixes the classic elements of the scrolling fighting game with those of the endless runner. In the role of a metalhead looking for his kidnapped kitten, we find ourselves running continuously (with the forced scrolling of the screen) along three predefined lanes and eliminating the various zombie aberrations that appear in front of us with various attacks and devastating combos, trying to reach the end of each level. Nice and funny, Retro Revenge represents just an extra able to offer a bizarre variation on the theme but in itself it does not have a significant weight as an added value for the Collection.", "date": "2016-05-31", "grade": "6.5"}
