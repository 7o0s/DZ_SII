{"name": "Space Channel Five - Part 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/space-channel-five-part-2.html", "text": "Music in power The guys at Uga - the Sega department behind Space Channel 5 and Rez - are now known for their experimentation with the possibilities of video game sound interaction, and for integrating the musical aspect into the deep and constitutive dynamics of the gameplay. Space Channel 5 Part II, like its predecessor, refers to this conception that sees the dominant audio: it is specifically about going to the rhythm. The game, similar to other music games such as Parappa the Rapper, is a great dance and music show in which pressing the buttons corresponding to those necessary to complete the proposed rhythm allows you to go ahead in the game, becoming part of the musical process itself. Here, however, the game offers music and texts that the player must repeat in rhythm, to the immediately following musical turn, with the directions of the pad and some keys. In the concrete development of the game we will therefore witness, for example, the bad guy who is subjugating the hostages forcing them to dance to his rhythm (had we already used the word ~psychedelia~?), and we will have to be able to replicate his rhythm to save the aforementioned hostages. The bad guy, for example, will sing on a base, accompanying himself with the dance, the words ~UP, UP, CHU~: on the turn we will have to press, of course at the right moment of the rhythm, the UP direction of the pad twice and the X button corresponding to CHU (a Japanese corruption of the verb shoot). So this is how we will play Ulala, the mythical presenter-savior of the world who fights to save the galaxy from the evil Rythm Rougues together with her fellow dancers of Space Channel 5, the coolest radio station in the galaxy. Even if everything, said in words, may seem very limited and even stupid, Space Channel 5 Part 2 actually works wonders: not only the rhythms that underlie the gameplay are high-level compositional music, varied, captivating and masterfully accorded to the captivating visual proposal, but they manage to easily make you forget the fact that in the game you ~just~ have to go to the rhythm. Being able to follow the musical development without making too many mistakes and having to start the level all over again is not only fun and challenging but also develops a great functional pleasure of the ability to learn to go better and better in rhythm and the pleasure that derives from witness such a well-crafted audiovisual show. Music in power We are certainly not at the levels of Rez, where the Uga designers had given their best by generating, with the same MPEG SofDec and ADX ~grammar~, an example of sound interactivity with few precedents in the history of video games: in REZ, in fact, we had to CREATE the rhythms, here only FOLLOW them. Nevertheless Space Channel 5, despite the initial impressions of the typical passing or prejudiced gamer, is by no means a stupid game. On the contrary, it is pure fun, fun applied to the ability to follow a musical rhythm. In short, the play value really exists, much more than it might seem at first glance: the very limited interaction and the audiovisual show that it puts on if correctly performed are fun enough to make up for the limited depth of the gameplay or the environment of game. This is reduced to a minimum, because you will only have to go to the rhythm of the music with the appropriate buttons and follow the events: yet it is solid enough to entertain you a lot, above all thanks to the quality of the aesthetic proposal, captivating and well structured both from a graphic point of view and - obviously - sound - which from what, so to speak, direction and composition. Significantly, for all intents and purposes, you just WANT to do nothing but hit the beat and see what happens. The presence in the credits of that Fujita, famous manga designer, within AM2's motion capture staff, the existence of a person responsible for storyboards only, the jumble of more or less famous composers from the Sega, Uga and external teams with the official credit of Michael Jackson as (sic) Space Michael, are a beautiful testament to the fact that, from an entertainment standpoint, Space Channel 5 Part II is by no means just any game. Artistic Value VS Technical Performance Imagine a mixture of Bond-movies, Austin Powers, electrofunk grooves a-la-Beck and Michael Jackson-esque scenic ballets from the good old days of Thriller (but with the face of Dangerous) and add a nice massive dose of typically seventies psychedelic space-dance : you will have an idea of the kind of sound and visual show that Space Channel Five part II asks you to participate in. The same gategonista, the beautiful Ulala (a name that says it all), seems a mix between the Jane Fonda of Barbarella and a space hippie manga-girl straight out of a Japanese karaoke commercial. In fact, our protagonist tries to save the world by making reportages to the rhythm of a dance, with which she surpasses the bad guys on duty in skill and avoids their blows before blasting them with her ray gun. Not to mention the other characters: a sort of mix between the Beck hair and the frenzied face of the legendary Sweet Transvestite from The Rocky Horror Pictures Show; alien Morons (English speakers will note the irony) who host newscasts chronically interrupted by villains; more or less skimpy intergalactic sheriffs specializing in percussion; rival conductors rocking; Michael Jackson himself  here Space Michael  complete with moonwalks, yells, anti-gravity lean, small-voiced sentences and ambiguous moves; Singing Galactic Mayors; Final bosses announcing revenge the following week, punctual as an unwelcome schedule; and so on, with sporadic appearances of ska djs in leotards, astronauts in neo-Japanese space suits, fat men in tutus, rich people with chains, buxom hostesses, singing combat mechas (well, yes) in various Pacmanian shapes and much more . A nice space hippie delirium - humorous and very self-deprecating - of values of cosmic universality and galactic entertainment, excellently orchestrated: execute the combinations at the right rhythm and your hostage-saving galactic peace groove will be scenographically added to that of the already saved characters that make up the little picture, with beautiful movements in a strange mixture between the realistic and the absurd. In fact, the movements of the characters are as absurd (how can a buxom polygonal stewardess move, made up of too few polygons, who works in an orbiting station of a future where the law is music?) as, at times, realistic, due to the discrete effect achieved in motion capture and particularly evident in the main characters. Artistic Value VS Technical Performance Unfortunately, however, the beautiful aesthetics of the many characters and the beautiful dance movements are applied to simplistic polygonal models, poorly cared for and decidedly blocky in certain situations. The few polygons, and especially those of the too, too simple secondary characters, penalize the overall aesthetic judgment. It seems that Uga hasn't actually changed or even updated the polygonal engine of the first episode released for the Dreamcast. Too bad, because a greater complexity of the models and environments (for which the polygons that PS2 has to move are not few but not even many) would have enhanced the more psychedelic textures and beautiful animations that Space Channel Five can boast, and which are undoubtedly condemned to a visual performance below its potential. But after all, the technical aspect of the graphic rendering is not at all fundamental in this game, given that the artistic rendering is sufficiently psychedelic: you will see the colors and the absurd faces of the characters, the way they move and not how similar they are to characters real. And the interlude scenes in fmv are discreetly integrated into the logic of the story, exceptions made for somewhat boring uploads. The whole graphic aspect - from a technical point of view - is in fact developed just enough to let you fully enter the rhythm of the music and the sound interaction that is the fulcrum of Space Channel Five. It's the beautiful swinging London-style groove pieces with which you'll have to keep up with the rhythm that make the game what it is: a great interactive show, in which you'll participate to make the musical lines even more enjoyable by avoiding being out of tune with the incorrect pressing of the buttons . In fact, be careful to listen and ~play~ the tunes (especially the main one and the one with Jacko's guest vocals) more than once: you'll start humming them for hours with no escape. How much re-play value? At this point the most consistent question of a game like Space Channel Five part II is precisely: ~how long will it be left to play?~. The answer is not simple and depends on personal attitudes. The game is divided into five main levels, for which a percentage of success is assigned depending on the errors, rescues and the pace maintained, but also features the classic score attack mode through which to unlock the bonuses of the moment, in this case represented by the profiles of the very flippated characters, by the costumes and extra items of the sexy Ulala and by a special mode in which it is possible to replay the levels with the presence of sec elements and charactersnew waves; but there is also a two-player mode in which one player controls only the keys and one only the directions, specifically designed to blame the other for mistakes. These are quite classic expedients to lengthen longevity, but they work: if you are taken by the pace of the game, in fact, leaving a level with a low percentage or an extra still to be blocked will gnaw you a lot and will push you to continue in the rhythmic torture . However, it is also true that the levels are very few, and that all the unlockable extras could be too poor an incentive compared to the repetitiveness of the levels for the non-enthusiast player. In conclusion... Space Channel 5 Part II is a faithful replica - perhaps a little too much - of the very original prequel for the Dreamcast, on whose almost identical formula it builds a new chapter with a slightly more developed replay value thanks to the progressively unlockable extras. The fact that the fulcrum of the game is not so much the interaction that takes place in it but the audiovisual spectacle that follows could lead us, surprisingly, to overturn the typical admonition of the type ~if you have the prequel, avoid it, it's too similar~. In fact, if you have the first chapter for the Dreamcast, it is highly probable that you will absolutely want to continue playing the adventures of the beautiful Ulala and that you will not mind playing the same way to see and feel new psychedelic delirium. If, on the other hand, a musical game is enough for you, or if you have a passion for games with more developed interaction environments than pressing buttons to the rhythm, well then the purchase is recommended only subject to previous trial, unless you are crazy about the psycho-space-Swinging London style. However, anyone who has never tried Space Channel 5 is warmly invited to do so: it is in fact surprising how such a simple - and perhaps simplistic - game manages so much to enthrall for the ~simple~ but perhaps only important factor of fun and rhythm. Staaaaaay. tuned. Pros: Simple but addictive music-oriented gameplay Spectacular space-funk aesthetic characterization High-quality and overwhelming music A cast of demented characters and Jacko's guest vocals 2 Players cooperative mode perfect for blaming the defeat on the other Cons: Too much polygonal engine blocky Very short to complete unless you find all the extras Too similar to the prequel: Mizuguchi had us used to innovation Space Channel 5 landed on the Dreamcast in 1999 as a psychedelic spaceship, with a very original conception that was integrated into one of the most varied soft libraries - the Dreamcast, in fact - in the history of consoles. Tezuya Mizuguchi, creator of the award-winning Rez and head of Uga (formerly AM9) and frequenter of Tokyo's hottest dance clubs, was an integral part of Sega's innovative spirit of the time. Now it's 2003, Sega no longer makes consoles and Space Channel 5 was never a hit on the Dreamcast. Yet not only has this highly original game already been ported to PS2, it now comes with a sequel to the Sony monolith - definitely a good sign of the exposure titles in this genre are starting to get, as Space Channel 5 Part II, like its predecessor, is certainly too funny and original a title to be appreciated by the average or passing gamer, and perhaps too shallow to become a must for the hardcore gamer. Yet it is so original and funny, as well as graced with a practically unparalleled dose of humor, that it can undoubtedly be considered an important title for every soft library, enjoyable and theoretically recommended to everyone... albeit with some reservations.", "date": "2003-02-13", "grade": null}
