{"name": "Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/valkyrie-profile-2-silmeria-recensione.html", "text": "From Lenneth to Silmeria, passing of the baton In the first episode of the series, the protagonist was Lenneth, Odin's Valkyria, and her task was simple: to lead the souls of the most powerful heroes and warriors to Valhalla, to fight the eternal war of the gods. In that game, the stories of these heroes, their vicissitudes, which were intertwined with a decidedly sinister plot, constituted the plot. But a century earlier, in this new adventure which is actually a prequel, the star is Lenneth's sister, Silmeria: rebelling against the will of Odin, the Valkyria has been confined in the body of a mortal woman, Alicia, princess of the kingdom of Dipan. The latter, poor thing, begins to live with the conscience of the goddess, even ending up talking to her, which makes her appear decidedly crazy: the incredulous and upset king of Dipan, consequently, imprisons his daughter in a distant castle and he has her passed off as dead. At this point, if Alicia already has a big problem to solve, considering that according to Silmeria a catastrophe is about to hit her kingdom, the Valkyria herself has a much bigger one: Hrist, another divine sister, who now gives her the hunt to eliminate her, since Silmeria should not have awakened from Odin's spell. And therefore, Alicia and Silmeria will have to work together in the same body to escape from Hrist, save Dipan and their own skin. But things are bound to get much more complicated... A decidedly well thought out but also questionable element is the emphasis placed on the so-called ~itemization~ Arise, my Einherjar! To accompany Alicia in her adventure, there will be a rather varied cast: in addition to the human beings who will join her cause (among which the heroes who will be the deceased protagonists in Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth stand out, such as Lezard Valeth and Arngrim), through the powers of Silmeria the princess will be able to resort to the help of the Einherjar, or the spirits of deceased wizards and warriors and with whom the Valkyria can come into contact, finding around weapons or objects that belonged to them. Basically, the specter joins the group and can be used in battles as an official member of the group, earning experience points and leveling up: however, having reached a certain level, the Einherjar can be freed, obtaining in exchange a weapon or a item qualitatively proportional to the level reached by the Einherjar himself, who we can later meet in mortal guise, reincarnated, around the world. Although original and intriguing, this mechanism suffers from a distinctly ~logical~ problem, which makes the use of these Einherjar as active members of Alicia's company rather disheartening: their history is limited to a few lines in the appropriate menu, and their presence is totally irrelevant for the purposes of the plot, which focuses on the ~alive~ supporting actors, limiting the simple pleasure of playing as these ghosts. Nonetheless, the large amount of Einherjar to recruit (sometimes exclusive compared to others) offers a consistent variety when assembling the party that will face the battles, which in turn are exquisitely strategic, despite the action imprint that characterizes them: when Alicia will come into contact with an enemy while exploring the various hostile locations, a battlefield will quickly load where the party, consisting of up to four characters, will have to face various enemies. The first novelty of what appears to be a conceptually classic battle-system is the presence of a ~leader~ in the enemy group, once killed the battle will end whether other opponents are alive or not. Consequently, moving in the battlefield already requires considerable reflexes, especially when the group is divided to surround the enemies, perhaps to hit them from behind: using the various commands it is possible to dash forward, change the leader of the group, and obviously attack; when the real fight begins we will be able to unleash the blows of our group on the enemy by pressing the keys that correspond to the individual members: a certain amount of blows in some cases will activate pyrotechnic special attacks, always if the weapons allow it. In fact, an element that is decidedly well thought out but also questionable is the emphasis placed on the so-called ~itemization~ of Valkyrie Profile 2: each piece of equipment is in fact characterized by symbols, and by equipping a character with the right objects and symbols it is possible to unlock skills, active or passive, which will influence their performance in combat. These skills, however, will not be permanent until you have earned enough Skill Points, fighting, to learn them once and for all: therefore a system ensues that often forcesenges the player to continuously collect Skill Points and experience points for each new member of the group, in order to make him suitable for reincarnation or simply to align him with the rest of the group. However ingenious and decidedly excellent on paper, the idea therefore has the flaw of making itself repetitive in the long run, proposing itself as a necessary interval between one dungeon and another: a pity, given that the various labyrinths maintain the platform-like setting of the original, with simple but ingenious puzzles based on Alicia's ability to switch places with monsters after having ~frozen~ them, visible in the form of ghosts and avoidable. Valkyrie Profile and PlayStation 2 Square Enix has recently been able to exploit the power of PlayStation 2 in an incredible way, developing in its last year of life some of the most technically sophisticated titles ever seen, such as Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy XII. Valkyrie Profile 2 is yet another demonstration of the ability of the Square Enix graphics, who have managed to create locations that are simply stunning from a visual point of view, so rich in detail and color that they seem absolutely real. In these spectacular environments the polygonal models of the various characters move, almost identical in real-time to their counterparts used in the non-interactive cutscenes, which in fact exploit the same game engine: they too, in fact, show a very high level of detail, which it concerns not only the facial expressions, but also the physical and decorative characteristics of their clothes or their weapons, for example. The result is a graphically impressive game, perhaps only undermined by its concept itself, which does not allow all-round exploration of the environments or rotation of the camera: this choice in a certain sense tends to reduce its spectacularity, which returns to the fore in the fights , where it is possible to move freely and fight enemies (varied and very well animated), creating amazing battles full of special effects and pyrotechnic magic, which occasionally lead to brief drops in the frame rate. The excellent visual sector is accompanied by a respectable soundtrack, created by Motoi Sakuraba, synonymous with a guarantee in the field of video games: while not reaching the level of his other productions such as some episodes of the Tales series, the music of Valkyrie Profile 2 they are excellently orchestrated and perfectly in line with the atmosphere of the adventure. Instead, it shows the ups and downs of the voice acting, with some decidedly mediocre actors and others simply making the dubbed characters come alive. The defect of Valkyrie Profile 2 is simply that of following a trend that has lately been making too much progress in the RPG genre: that of ~farming~. Recently, far too many RPGs require grueling and repetitive play sessions dedicated to collecting experience points to level up or obtain new skills, or even to recover the materials necessary to build new objects. These elements, although integrated into the playful structure, simply tend to lengthen the broth, especially when the narrative proves to be unsatisfactory. The latter is not the case with Valkyrie Profile 2, whose plot reserves numerous twists and turns and can be followed with pleasure, between one fight and another necessary to unlock new weapons or reincarnate some Einherjar. Technically excellent, Valkyrie Profile 2 is a worthy sequel/prequel to the original for PSOne and PSP, definitely recommended for anyone looking for an RPG that is different from the usual, suggestive and far from simple or banal, playfully and narratively speaking. Pros Great graphics Deep and fun gameplay Well developed storyline Cons Sometimes too difficult Sometimes repetitive One of the less famous titles for casual gamers and well known to fans of the JRPG genre peeked out on the shelves dedicated to PlayStation between 1999 and 2000, both in Japan and in America, made by Enix well before it merged with Squaresoft : we are naturally talking about Valkyrie Profile, a decidedly original game that received a lot of acclaim from critics and the public. In particular, the winning idea of structuring the very classic exploration sections in the way of a platform was striking, while everything else (party management and both playful and narrative progression in primis) was strongly characterized, giving the Enix title a gear in addition that distinguished it from the chaos of production belonging to the same genre that was making its way in that period, in the wake of the pioneering success of Final Fantasy VII. Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria is the son of those ideas and heir to a style that has been missing for years. Follows the trend, Silmeria, in quantor despite the ~2~ in the title it is actually a prequel to that Valkyrie Profile which has even been re-released for the PSP as Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth. But the passing of the years, the so-called water under the bridge, and the merger between the two RPG softco in the renewed Square Enix, how has it influenced the almost perfect concept of that spectacular adventure?", "date": "2007-09-10", "grade": null}
