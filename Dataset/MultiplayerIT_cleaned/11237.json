Strong Bad's Cool Game For Attractive People - Episode One: Homestar Ruiner - take a breath now  is therefore the first of five episodes programmed and based on the famous, in English-speaking countries, Homestar Runner series available on the web in the form of episodes or via some initiatives via email. The series tells the story of a funny set of improbable characters grappling with the parodic version of many themes, from strictly current events to clichs in the age of information technology and technology. The protagonist of the video game events is Strong Bad, a Mexican wrestler with a grumpy character but often hilarious attitudes who, specifically in this first encounter, will have to be able to get the better of him in a mad race at the limit of the credible. Nothing new under the sun... fortunately! As already for Sam & Max, this series also draws heavily on the tradition of graphic adventures, without trying to innovate practically anything but trying to mix the atmosphere guaranteed by the license to the rhythms imposed by the genre, focusing on the dialogues and the sagacity of the situations rather than on the conception of puzzles. Therefore, if there is no lack of settings and characters in which and with which to hypothetically get lost in search of solutions, most of the few hours of play offered will be spent without doubts and with the only prospect of discovering what narrative implications the plot has in store . In principle and for the avoidance of doubt, the work done on the screenplay managed to guarantee the two points that most of all seemed to row against the success of the title outside the American borders: the cultural references, more or less refined, are generally understandable and above all, the link with the web episodes is strong but not decisive, on the contrary encouraging one to inquire and to deepen one's knowledge of the protagonists. The point-and-click structure does not require any introduction and will allow experts and novices to feel at ease after a few moments, laying the foundations for a rather smooth difficulty curve; the points of interaction with the settings are numerous and always well highlighted, while the menus and the game interface are streamlined and never steal the scene from the actual action. The arcade-inspired mini-game is also inevitable, now a trademark or almost for TellTale, which specifically manifests itself in the form of a 2D fighting game capable of entertaining despite the slender structure. The experience as a whole is more than worthy and it will be difficult to be disappointed by what is proposed, even if the spark to make the leap in quality seems to be missing, that quid that makes certain situations unforgettable and certain scenes worth living again. In the Wii version - also available only via download - some small additions have been made, such as the ability to send photos to your friends. Minimal chic or just minimal? Graphically, this first episode immediately shows the will to keep the technical-artistic work as tangent as possible to that of the original series: with the exception of the use of three dimensions instead of the only two of the Flash cartoons, the whole of characters and settings perfectly follows what many fans already know, with few primary colors and models made from a few extremely essential lines. The first impact is at least unsettling but in the long run the road traveled proves to be successful, captivating in its effectiveness and charm. The music sector and the voices are good, with the usual problem already present in Sam & Max - and solved only when the packaged ones come out - which requires a good ability to juggle the jargon English language, perhaps with the help of the always much appreciated subtitles. Comment Fun and sagacious, short but cheap, Homestar Ruiner is a product that deserves to be bought even if you are not a fan of the original series and provided you don't dislike graphic adventures. That said, the masterpieces remain others and the magic of certain TellTale productions does not manifest itself as it would have been legitimate to expect, partially leaving a bad taste in the mouth; the next releases are around the corner and there is room for improvement, fingers crossed.
