{"name": "Project Eden", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-eden_a.html", "text": "An unpromising future Project Eden, as you might guess by yourself, is a game set in the future. A future that sees the planet earth one step away from collapse, as overpopulation has reached unsustainable levels and it has been practically mandatory to build life in a...vertical way. The air has been ~divided~ into various levels thanks to special structures, and in each of them there is an urban area. You can therefore imagine that, while the higher levels were considered a sort of paradise, the degradation and darkness increased as you proceeded downwards. The short presentation brings all these concepts together and, like a sort of poem composed of images, shows them to you, leaving you to do the ~paraphrase~. The game puts you in the role of four U.P.A. (Urban Protection Agency) who have the task of investigating following an accident that occurred in the Real Meat factory, a real ~meat factory~, in which a team of maintenance technicians have disappeared. For the members, the assignment to this task is very strange, and they already think they will be home in time for dinner. It is easily imaginable that this will not be the case. The Project Eden adventure develops precisely downwards, in fact the protagonists will have to descend to the most superficial levels of the planet, discovering a dramatic world, where people live without great hopes of life, between crime, but above all without rights. As the depth increases, some interesting details of the Eden Project will be revealed to you. Let's do this: I talk, you fix, you... As we have already said above, the characters that will be under your control in Project Eden will be four. Carter: he is the real leader of the U.P.A. team, he is the only one authorized to interrogate suspects and witnesses and has level access superior to access her intelligence terminals.Minoho: The only female on the team. She is the computer expert, knows perfectly how to use or break into a terminal system and is able to connect remotely to some tools. Andr: he is the team's engineer, or the one who takes care of the repairs. If something is damaged, Andr is the best expert around.Amber: Amber is a woman, contrary to what her appearance might suggest. At the age of 19, following a serious accident, Amber chose to acquire a cyborg body, instead of being surgically reconstructed. It has special equipment that is capable of operating in noxious or hostile environments, so it has the very useful feature of being able to pass through gases, flames and high voltage electricity. In addition to your players though, there is another element that must be taken into strong consideration: mission control. Captained by a retired agent, he represents, together with Carter, the intelligence of the team. He will tell us what are the objectives to be carried out, and will keep us updated by sending us interesting e-mails containing very useful material for the adventure, such as information, photos or videos (who knows how many mbits per second they transmit from the U.P.A. :D). In the game you will immediately understand how to make the most of the skills of each member of your team and you will soon also understand the style in which the adventure has been structured. However, there are still many concepts that need to be clarified. You have been asked to think in Euros...now do it in Energy. In Project Eden, forget about ~lives~, bullets or medkits. None of this. In the future to which you will have to get used to, the members of your team have the ability to transform themselves into energy as soon as their vital functions are equal to those of a vegetable (dead), to then completely regenerate in one of the ~base~ points of the U.P.A. available scattered throughout the levels. This means that the lives available to you will be infinite. The same thing goes for weapons (strictly automatic), as you will always need energy to recharge them through batteries (the typical ammunition boxes) or through the regeneration point itself. And here the question arises: why give a player the possibility of never dying? Effectively this choice goes beyond the typical standard of this genre of games, but as the developers themselves have declared, Project Eden's intention was to continue the adventure without interruption, trying to get the player to continue without worrying about keeping check the health of the character. An admirable choice, but what a cohowever, it is spot on with the rest of the product. In Project Eden you decide how to move your group. Having the command of one character at a time, depending on the need, you can decide whether or not to let the other three team members follow you via a button on your joypad, as long as they are in its proximity. Handy if you have to go alone to perform a certain action or if, in the vicinity of enemies, you choose the company of friends. Another mechanism on which you need to practice is that of the HUD, the game interface. Initially it is far from intuitive, obviously excluding the typical health and energy bar of the weapon, easily understood. I strongly advise you to take a leap to the controls menu before catapulting yourself into the game, as it is necessary to understand exactly the function of each single key. After the initial ~trauma~, you get used to it and you no longer notice it, don't worry. If we talk about Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is necessary to distinguish it into two categories: that of uncontrolled protagonists and that of enemies. I found the latter quite limited, as the only thing they can do ~well~ is shoot accurately. Otherwise they move in a not very intelligent way (a little AI is a big nonsense, but...) and very often they will be an easy target for you. That of our travel companions is slightly higher than that of the antagonists, just enough to give you a hand in a moment of difficulty. The excuse of not really being an action can be valid for some small aspects, but aren't we exaggerating? The arsenal Being a more puzzle solving game, shooting was considered a secondary element. It is probably for this reason (here we go again) that the Core has made available a scarce number of weapons. PULSE RIFLE It is the weapon supplied to members of the U.P.A. at the start of the game. Primary Fire: classic, rapid, repeating shot; Secondary fire: by holding down the fire key, the weapon charges and, when released, fires a shot that does more damage;ION BOMB It's our grenade. Long live progress. Primary Fire: Bomb explodes on contact with an object; Secondary Fire: The thrown bomb does not explode immediately, but as soon as an enemy approaches it.MISSILE LAUNCHER Primary Fire: Fires a single missile; Secondary Fire: By holding down the fire button, you can select up to four targets for the missiles to follow, in homing mode; DISC LAUNCHER launches an explosive disc. Primary Fire: So it simply throws a disc that explodes on contact; Secondary fire: in this way, however, a laser sight is activated which shows the trajectory of the pucks and how they will rebound; ASSIMILATOR is a tool that allows you to recover energy from your opponents. Primary Fire: Absorbs energy from opponents and sends it to the player's weapons. If the weapon's energy is full, then it goes to recharge the energy cells in the inventory; Secondary Fire: In this case, energy is fired at the enemy to damage them. The beam can be split up to three branches, in case there are multiple enemies;TIME DISPERSION Primary Fire: Thanks to this mode, it is like reliving our much loved movie ~The Matrix~ Secondary Fire: the weapon will not hit a single target but it will slow down a small area around where the shell explodes;SENTINEL By activating this weapon, you can create and place anywhere you like an automatic turret that will shoot at any enemy that comes within its range (especially useful in multiplayer mode)ROVER Small command vehicle , very similar to a miniature tank, which can be relied upon to reach places with very narrow passages. MOBILE CAMERA A true jewel of technology. Through a small engine this tiny camera manages to fly, replacing you as a lookout. It will be very useful for discovering enemies hidden in the corners; remember to act with caution, or they will notice your presence. Beautiful Eden After analyzing the gameplay of the game, let's move on to a very important part. The graphics. Right from the start Project Eden presents itself with a technically well-made movie and continues with an engine that, although it cannot compete with more recent titles, is very respectable. The levels, thanks to the characteristic storyline, are rarely similar to each other, and proceeding with the adventure (in a vertical way, I remind you) we will notice how terrible it is on the lowest floorsssi of the planet. The Core maps have also worked unquestionably on the play of light, which together with the good textures create a perfect atmosphere considering the story we find ourselves in front of. For those who don't speak English, know that Project Eden was entirely translated into our language. In my opinion, the localization is at good levels, considering the disasters that have been made in recent years with other titles, even more awaited. I know a friend who doesn't take them if the games aren't in the original language, how can I not agree with him... The multiplayer Multiplayer is definitely the most disappointing part, although the number of variants are good. But quantity is often not quality. If you love Quake 3, Unreal Tournament or Half-Life style shooters... I don't think this title is for you. In fact, Project Eden, especially in multiplayer, is a VERY slow game, and consequently, not very frenetic. Some modes are interesting, there are some nice ideas, but really not fun, especially if there are few of you. It really could have been done much better. Conclusion Ultimately, what is this Project Eden like? The ~Tomb Raider~ resume didn't seem to have helped Core Design much to convince most of the community, but the game, all in all, seemed pretty good to me. The guys have managed to create a rather characteristic atmosphere, a simple but intriguing storyline, and to create a game that overall.... ~gets you~. But we certainly cannot say that it is a masterpiece of perfection. Defects or deficiencies are there in any case. The graphics aren't the best, the weapons are few, the fact of not being able to jump is quite frustrating. The most negative aspect of this game is that you are bound to a single path, an obligatory road to follow in order to continue the adventure. There are no alternative roads or objectives that one can carry out before another. Multiplayer is contradictory. If you are looking for a pure action game, where the gun can accompany you at every step, you are completely wrong with the title. If, on the other hand, the adventures/puzzles are at home, the storyline inspires you, Project Eden can be a fun game that will keep you busy for a fair amount of time. Core Design tries to change After the award-winning and multi-selling Tomb Raider series, Core Design finds the courage to change and offer the public a completely new product, Project Eden. In fact, with Projet Eden the shapely curves of the heroine, in the recent film played by Angelina Jolie, are set aside, giving more space to strategy and some puzzles that make the game a mixture of action, adventure and puzzle. One of the most relevant features is the fact of being able to command four players, each with its own fundamental characteristics that will allow you to complete the game. But let's find out together what the Core programmers managed to do.", "date": "2002-02-18", "grade": null}
