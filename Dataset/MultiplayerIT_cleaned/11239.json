{"name": "Assassin's Creed HD", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/assassins-creed-hd_a.html", "text": "Assassin's Creed has divided critics and audiences like few video games in recent years: on the one hand there are those who consider the Ubisoft product an absolute masterpiece, on the other those who criticize its excessive repetitiveness. On one thing, however, many agree: the game guarantees a freedom of movement never seen before, with the protagonist capable of moving within huge, densely populated cities and climbing any building with his bare hands. Furthermore, the ~acrobatic racing~ sessions on the roofs are absolutely spectacular... and the story behind the story is told in an original way, thanks to flashbacks (which actually constitute the playable part) flanked by dialogues and thick sequences. It is clear that the ~next gen~ connotation of Assassin's Creed, its freedom of action, could not be transported into a portable environment, and at the same time we wanted to offer players a simpler and more linear product in terms of plot. In this sense, Gameloft has done a good job overall, both on Nintendo DS and on Java-compatible mobile phones: in the first case it has created a three-dimensional adventure full of ~tests of skill~ reminiscent of the original Prince of Persia, in the second case it effectively drew on the current trend of 2D action games. Now, after a few months, even owners of smartphones with a Symbian operating system will be able to enjoy the adventures of Altair in a three-dimensional scenario, thanks to what appears to all effects and purposes to be a conversion of what was seen on the Nintendo DS. Indeed, in this HD version of Assassin's Creed we will abandon the effective two-dimensional structure of Altair's Chronicles in favor of a completely 3D approach, characterized by very detailed polygonal graphics. Our assassin is once again on a mission on behalf of Al Mualim, with the aim of recovering a sacred relic that could change the tide of the conflict between the Crusaders and the Saracens. During his journey, however, he will have to face a series of unforeseen situations, which will see him confront various enemies to help his companions in difficulty. We will be able to move Altair using the joystick of the mobile phone, whose functions, in this case, cannot be emulated by the numeric keyboard: the various buttons will be used to interact with the environment, jump, slash and parry the blows of the opponents. The combat system tries to emulate what was seen on consoles and PCs, unfortunately with poor results: given the absolute imprecision of the counterattack, we will end up launching attacks without any strategy, taking advantage of the general stupidity of the enemies. Even the combo system, which is activated by alternating the light attack with the heavy one, struggles to produce appreciable results, which can make the action of the clashes more engaging and interesting. Things look much better as regards the movement phases, with Altair who scales the walls without problems, moves stealthily to deceive the guards and makes jumps precise to the millimeter. In some cases, we will find ourselves having to force the enemies to provide us with information, or to secretly steal objects from them: in both cases, minigames identical to those seen on the Nintendo DS will start, regulated by the rhythm game mechanics to make up for the lack of stylus and touch screen. Being a product developed for Symbian, Assassin's Creed HD boasts graphics and sound that are decidedly superior to the average of mobile video games. The polygonal models are the same seen on DS, with a mediocre level of detail and a too simple structure, but with good animations. The scenarios are excellent, in every respect, and the scrolling is always smooth, except when there are too many characters on the screen. The sound sector boasts a fairly effective mix of music and effects, which accompanies the action on the screen in the best way. PRO Technically excellent Good number of internships Exploration phases rendered well AGAINST ...while the fights leave something to be desired It is the same game seen on the Nintendo DS Uninvolving, unfunny", "date": "2008-08-26", "grade": "S.V."}
