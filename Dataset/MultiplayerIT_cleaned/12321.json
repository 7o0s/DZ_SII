A huge title, the one developed by the now defunct Palcom and published by Konami. At the time Turtles was raging - The coin op, a scrolling fighting game that was simply extraordinary success in the hall. And let's not hide the fact that before the latter was released for the NES, the version of the turtles we're talking about in this article left us a little disappointed. How much foolishness. Once we turned on the little Nintendo, as we affectionately called it, we realized our folly. In fact, we were faced with a curious title, structurally very original for the time: Teenage Mutant Ninja Hero Turtles was an action adventure that alternated the exploratory phases of the map of the level we were facing, framed from a bird's eye view, with real and just 2d platformer when we ventured into the interiors of constructions or buildings. In these locations we looked for objects useful for our survival or for the recovery of our vital energy (such as the now legendary pizza so adored by the popular ninja reptiles), or better yet, missiles to be mounted on the Turtles small van, which allowed us to break down barricades that hindered the our passage. If some of you vaguely remember this game, you certainly haven't forgotten the remarkable difficulty rate on which it was calibrated: one of the most complicated titles ever released on the NES, Turtles was equipped with an extremely detailed and studied level design, so much so that it made one curse the player on more than one occasion (the unforgettable sections of the sewers, very narrow platforms, jumps that had to be precise to the millimeter, and maybe even some enemies that could hit us while we were in the air if our reflexes weren't up to par, forcing us to fall into the water and start all over again!). The most striking thing was an enviable game variety, even for today's times. We started by saving April in the first world, then dedicating ourselves to the defusing of some bombs placed under a river dam, in an all-water level, until we reached a phase with a typically stealth aftertaste, when we infiltrated stealthily, at night, in the heart of the Foot Clan. A blast. What is it today. A product that certainly maintains undoubted structural qualities, the level design still remains an interesting aspect that stimulates us to continue to the end. Much shorter because easier to deal with, that's for sure. We are no longer kids and the difference immediately catches the eye. But it is not a defect, on the contrary, it involuntarily file an aspect that was relatively heavy for the time, also thanks to the ~saving~ of the roms that we load on the Wii which allows us, if we decide to return to the main dashboard, to start again from the same point when we reload the game. Instead, what the weight of the years makes us accuse most is the control system: slow and cumbersome in the lateral platform phases, it is even unacceptable for the map with aerial shooting, where the slowness with which we control our turtle is only muddier than the session driving the Turtle Mobile, specialized in getting stuck in the very narrow streets of the city. Pretty annoying. In any case, despite the inevitable signs of aging, Teenage Mutant Ninja Hero Turtles remains one of the best titles currently available on the Virtual Console, a purchase recommended for anyone who wants to take a good dive into the past. An extremely enjoyable dip, we take the liberty of adding. The ninja turtles, the myth of the 90s! Those of us who have not been affected by the pressing fashion that these reptiles had triggered at the time represent a truly isolated case... The Turtles invaded the world of toys, cinema, even swimsuits... without forgetting video games. And in the area that interests us, they also produced great titles. Teenage Mutant Ninja Hero Turtles for NES was one of them, without a doubt.", "date": "2007-05-01", "grade": null}
