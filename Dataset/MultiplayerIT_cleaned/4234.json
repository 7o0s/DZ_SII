We are talking about those games that deliberately adopt a basic ludic grammar: few concepts and repeated in gameplay mechanics that are easy to assimilate, which can become more complicated as the adventure goes on but always remain recognizable. Some decide to disguise the immediacy of the gameplay behind impressive graphics and narrative compartments, others who embrace their simplicity. Maskmaker, the new title developed by Innerspace VR and produced by Vertigo Games (the VR publishing and development branch of the PLAION group) is exactly that, a perfect introductory game to the world of virtual reality. However, be careful not to start off on the wrong foot because simple, understandable and minimalist are by no means synonymous with attributes such as boring and obvious. We tell you more in our review of Maskmaker, tested on Meta Quest 2. The history of the masks Maskmaker takes place somewhere between the real world and an enchanted kingdom Taking up a bit what has already been done with the beautiful A Fisherman's Tale, the Innerspace VR team also decides for Maskmaker to tell a fantastic and dreamlike story. In fact, the plot takes the form of a very delicate fairy tale, which places the figure of the Maskmaker at the center of the narrative. In fact, this craftsman is not like all the other carpenters but he is able to carve magical masks, capable of teleporting the wearer to a magical realm. We arrive at the door of the Maskmaker's shop during one night, witnessing a nasty quarrel between the old shop owner and his apprentice. The door is open and, after solving a small environmental puzzle, we enter the secret part of the shop. From here on we will be guided by different narrative voices, who during the adventure will show us all the different points of view of the story, revealing its secrets. The narrative voice-over is a choice that VR titles adopt as it is perfectly functional to the game action, and at the same time extremely economical for the developer. During the dialogues we will always be intent on doing something else and we will rarely find ourselves still and passive in one point listening. During some flashbacks we will then be able to observe the scene as an invisible spectator, navigating it freely and positioning ourselves wherever we want. These narrative choices, as we said, are also dictated by a certain economy and in this case Innerspace, already strong in a series of devices tested with A Fisherman's Tale, adopts solutions clearly aimed at saving but which never seem so to the player. In concrete terms, the narrative voice avoids having a constantly animated non-player character; in the flashbacks the protagonists of the memory are represented through black silhouettes, to underline the past nature of the event, while the few interlocutors with whom we will speak in person during the adventure all wear a mask, which hides their facial movements. The developer's skill was to integrate all these devices in a coherent way into the game, succeeding in the enterprise, given that during the course of the adventure the narrative style is perfectly consistent with the rest of the game. Another narrative aspect that we appreciated about Maskmaker is the work done on the symbolism of the mask. While on the one hand the story takes the form of a fairy tale, with an epilogue perhaps a little telephonic, the reflection on the material use and metaphorical meaning of the mask is what gives the story some depth. Some of the narrative voices that will follow us are the spirits that live in the magical realm through which the masks lead, called Carnival Spirits. These omniscient figures embody the laws of Carnival, warnings that everyone must follow in order not to get lost behind the mask they wear. Loving yourself without giving in to vanity, being self-aware so as not to forget who we are and being open and tolerant so as not to isolate ourselves, forgetting about those who live next to us. Everyone is allowed to wear a mask from time to time, pretend for a moment to be different from who we are, but we must never forget that the mask always demands a price and that, worn for too long, it can become a lie. Mechanics and gameplay Exploring and creating new masks, these are the steps of the Maskmaker gameplay As mentioned in the previous paragraph, in Maskmaker the game action takes place in two different places: the laboratory and the enchanted realm. The realm consists of three different maps, each divided into two different biomes, one introductoryand an advanced one. First we will visit the beach, the snowy peaks and the swamp to move on, after a very important narrative turning point, to the second half of the game, set in the desert, in the forest and in the mines. The main hub of the adventure, however, is represented by the mask laboratory, in which we will often return to build what we need to travel across the realm. The masks are in fact portals to the enchanted realm: by creating and wearing a mask, we are teleported inside it and the point of teleportation is linked to the design of the mask. In fact, to move around the realm we will take possession of masked puppets, transporting our essence inside these empty shells. The geography of the maps is very fragmented and we are never allowed to freely explore an entire area with a single simulacrum. Each biome is characterized by a specific mechanic At the beginning of the game, for example, we will build our very first mask: wearing it, we will be teleported to a beautiful Caribbean island. After a few steps, however, we will find ourselves in front of a collapsed bridge where, on the other side, an empty simulacrum is watching us. However, this one has a different mask from ours, decorated with shells, which we can observe closely with a telescope, which will become a very important tool throughout the adventure. The goal therefore becomes to find some shells, collect them, go back to the laboratory, build a new mask decorating it like the sketch and wear it. In this way we will abandon our ~old body~ to possess the one beyond the bridge and overcome the obstacle. This is the main game mechanic of Maskmaker, where the point of arrival of each explored area is to reach the tower of the area. To do this, you will therefore need to explore a new area, collect new materials, look around for other puppets, build their masks and proceed like this until you reach the tower. Shortly after the introduction, we will be able to switch from one mask to another within a single zone without having to pass through the laboratory each time. Reduced to the bone, Maskmaker's gameplay seems extremely repetitive and schematic, and in some ways it is, but Innerspace's ability was to make every single biome well characterized by different environmental dynamics, gradually complicating more and more plus the formula. In the first half of the game, in fact, the areas to explore are linear, the puppets usually clearly visible and the designs of the simple masks. After the narrative turning point in mid-adventure, the formula remains unchanged in structure but becomes considerably more complicated in the individual passages that compose it. The materials to collect are more hidden, the levels more intricate and complex to navigate, the puppets are less visible and the design of the masks becomes much more elaborate. That's why in the introduction we said that simple is not synonymous with trivial or boring: Maskmaker explains his rules very well to the player, first creating simple situations with which to become familiar, and then changing gears about halfway through the adventure (which lasts between 5 and 6 hours). All marked by the characterization of the different environments, where each biome adds a small superstructure of mechanics linked to the single area. Graphics and movement In open spaces the level of detail is usually lower We close the Maskmaker review with a dutiful more technical paragraph. We cannot hide behind a mask: the new creature of Innerspace VR does not particularly shine on the graphics front. The models are very simple yet not always sharp in the outlines, furthermore there is a strange absence of shadows which, in some glimpses, makes the panorama a bit flat. A problem that absolutely does not derive from the artistic style adopted, which indeed we have enormously appreciated, but from the quantity of details present, especially in the open spaces of the realm. The laboratory area is in fact small and very accurate, full of details, with well-projected lights and shadows; when the space opens up instead, the level of detail seems to decrease a bit, conveying that flatness of the environments we mentioned earlier. Fortunately, the game world is so suggestive and the use of the color palette so impeccable as to balance this aspect, returning a general visual pleasure. Maskmaker's movement system is perfect for a VR puzzle The latter also persists in the system of movement and navigation of the spaces, in which Maskmaker adopts a double and contemporary solution. Free-roaming games usually ask the player to choose between teleportation and free movement and choicelt is often done for comfort. The teleportation system allows you to move instantly from one point to another without walking, which is a major cause of VR motion sickness. Even the free movement can be mitigated with some graphical tricks, such as the use of vignetting on the edges of the screen, to limit the portion of the peripheral view of the camera. In Maskmaker the player can use both teleportation and vignetted free movement, depending on the analog stick. With the right you use the teleportation while with the left the free movement, of which you can also decide the speed in the game menu, substantially changing how fast we can move by walking. For those who play VR environmental puzzles mainly using teleportation, as in our case, this is a real godsend because often, when approaching a switch or an object to collect, the teleportation is never very precise and there are always those a few centimeters that make the difference, forcing the player into some extra stunts. In this way you can use the teleportation for larger movements and free movement to position yourself perfectly in front of a lever or an object. This is particularly useful during the mask creation phases, where we are often asked to move around the counter to color and decorate them. The various experience customization options and some extra accessibility options are also excellent. Too bad for the lack of localization in Italian: it is not an element that influences our evaluation but it is an aspect that we believe is still important to report to the end user.", "date": "2022-12-24", "grade": "8.0"}
