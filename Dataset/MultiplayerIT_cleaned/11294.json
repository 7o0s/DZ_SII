The mobile gaming market is relatively young, it is making great strides from every point of view and, most importantly, it is open and friendly towards small realities. Relatively few resources are enough to develop Java applications of this type, above all if there is passion and talent to act as a counterpart: examples in this sense are wasted. With the emergence of a standard platform and the communication possibilities offered by the Internet, many companies have also been able to devote themselves to something different from the usual racing game or yet another Tetris clone, arming themselves with imagination and combining the useful and the enjoyable, that is by combining the presence of often mediocre input devices (joystick, numeric keyboard) with extremely immediate gameplay, creating products that are played with a single key. Literally. Flippy's Flying Frenzy, second episode of the Happy Tree Friends series is an excellent example not only for the immediacy discourse, but also for what concerns the basic idea, as original as it is absurd. Do talking and cuddly animals give you a sudden and unwanted rise in blood sugar? Would you like to ~revenge~ in some way? Well, the developers of this title have found a solution to the problem, albeit remaining within the ~virtual~ sphere: violently attacking these little creatures, massacring them in various ways and reducing them to bloody pulp. This is a theme that has already been developed with Spinfun, belonging to the same series: in that case it was a matter of making one of the three ~nice~ characters get on a rotating carousel, then launching it at speed until the little animal was catapulted away , falling apart after crashing into numerous obstacles. Flippy's Flying Frenzy shares the same goal, which is to disintegrate one of those furry and fluffy characters, inflicting him as much pain as possible. This time, however, we will do things big: having secured the small and tender character to a helicopter with a rope, we will have to fly through the forest and control the vehicle in such a way as to make our victim end up on all the ~obstacles~ present, in the in particular blades of various sizes, stones, leghold traps, high voltage cables, flamethrowers, lasers, sharp poles and so on. The control system provides for the use of a single button within an inertial environment: the helicopter proceeds automatically to the right, in the lower part of the screen we are shown where we are on the map, while in the upper part a ~combo~ indicator that numerically translates the ~goodness~ of the damage dealt. The scenario always remains the same, while from stage to stage the amount of traps present increases and their arrangement changes: we will always have to be careful to throw our ~guest~ on the traps, but without touching them with the helicopter or we will end up crashing. The game features simple and effective vector graphics. The only scenario available flows smoothly and convincingly, with many levels of depth. The construction of the helicopter is certainly not spectacular, while the graphics have put too much effort into visually representing the misfortunes of the animal attached to the vehicle, which bleeds profusely and ends up losing pieces along the way. If it weren't such an absurd product, we would have to worry... PRO AGAINST Basic idea certainly original Nice and successful graphics The action is an end in itself Collision detection not always flawless Sound effects give problems on some terminals", "date": "2008-07-17", "grade": "S.V."}
