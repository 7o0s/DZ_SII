It was the Celtics who conquered the top of the federation: whether you want to confirm the story or rewrite it is up to you, but are the tools offered this year by the basketball simulation NBA Live 09 really the right ones to do it? Instinctive shooting For the NBA Live series, the real generation transition took place with version 08, although, however, although it had finally marked a concrete step forward compared to the previous ones, the result was still far from satisfactory. In the 2009 edition, another year has been added to the development: we can therefore only hope that the announced new features will mark a real difference in the game dynamics on the field. First of all, let's talk about Dynamic DNA, a system for managing the statistics and skills of teams and players that modestly aims to redefine the methods of characterization used up to now. In addition to assigning statistics and values to a virtual athlete that correspond to the peculiarities of his real counterpart, the idea behind Dynamic DNA is to characterize his behavior as well as the technical specifications, marking a substantial difference in the quality of the artificial intelligence. The principle is simple: does Dave Allen have a tendency to make three-point shots from left field in his DNA? That's how we'll see him behave in-game. If the real Chris Paul's inclination is to make rapid accelerations and then diagonally cut the area with an unexpected assist, so will we see his virtual equivalent do the same. The system is precisely dynamic, that is, it constantly updates the features from the LIVE 365 online service (essentially, an equivalent of 2K Games' NBA 2K9 Live) depending on how real teams and players are behaving during the current season. While only with long-term use will we really discover how well implemented this innovation is, it's nice to know that our annual sports title, so susceptible to rapid aging in itself, remains fresh and constantly updated. For now, however, we seem to notice a few too many naiveties: the characteristics are constantly made explicit in a strip before the score and always being aware of a player's character tendencies, given the predictability of his behavior, will make him too vulnerable. Also, rarely during games do you spend the time available to read and think about all those statistics. In fact, rather than taking our eyes off the parquet and dedicating ourselves to exaggerated tactics, we find ourselves preferring fast and instinctive maneuvers, in line with the rapid nature of this sport and which give the feeling of building the action from inside the field, not out. Although still to be perfected and limited, and in any case already enjoyable by tactics enthusiasts, the Dynamic DNA reveals the direction chosen by the development team: on the virtual parquet, as on the real one, a team is more than the sum of its statistical values. Among the game modes present this year, some, already encountered previously, have been partially revised and expanded, others are completely new. The training phase turns into the NBA Academy, a real gym to be used to test our shooting and dunking skills and to recall, through the coaches scattered on the field, various preparation sessions. Most of them have the form of small limited-time challenges and, if successfully completed, will allow us to improve the characteristics of the players. The Dynasty mode is back, basically the usual seasonal mode with a moderate management component: training will then be essential for improving the team and depending on the technical cast you decide to hire, the quality of preparation that you will be able to guarantee your players will be conditioned. Amusing interludes are the dunk and three-point shooting competitions, while the Be a Pro mode is just mentioned, in which you will play a single player: do not expect a solid career mode however, unfortunately it is only possible to do it for a single match and something he says we'll find him again in superstar fashion among the reasons to buy the next release. As for rewriting the story we teased you about a few lines ago, you can do this with Live Rewind: play again for a whileReal league game in progress by taking it from the live service and try to modify or confirm the result. Finally, to be noted is the exclusive obtaining of the official rights of FIBA and the increase of the national teams available, which become twenty-four. Several introductions and changes also affect the game mechanics, which are worth discussing in more detail. Attack and Release The first innovation introduced for the offensive phases of the match is the Pick and Roll mechanic. While setting up an action, it will be possible to create a two-player game based on the possibility of being able to simultaneously control a second teammate in addition to our player, simply by pressing L2. Depending on how long you continue to hold it down and how you move, your partner's behavior varies: he can put you in a position to quickly slip out to assist him as soon as he has in turn released himself for a shot from medium distance, block an opponent, and so on. Pick and Roll is the quintessence of the spectacular soul of the game and works really efficiently: giving us the satisfaction of having actively participated in the construction of a perfect harmony between two players, it establishes itself as the first real step forward for the series compared to to the translation between real game and simulation. You will suffer less misunderstandings and expectations that would multiply in leaving your teammates completely in control of the AI and the feeling of making the team run at the right pace will never make you feel deprived of both the responsibility for the defeat and the merit for the victory. since a good movement in attack of the whole team depends above all on you. Having crossed the three-point line and been held in check by the opposing defense, if we want to secure the precious two points we must rely on a multiplicity of movements to be performed in close range. The feints and position changes, to be carried out quickly so as not to make the ball suddenly blow, are effective in disorienting those who oppose us and if well executed under the basket, they often end in success. Different movements performed with the right analogue result in as many manoeuvres, such as turning on ourselves, hinting at feints or pivoting on the support foot by constantly changing position. The execution is extremely intuitive: just imagine that the analog lever with which they are performed is our player seen from above and depending on how we turn it, so the player will behave. However, there is a problem, and it is serious: a sort of automatic compensation often brings the opposing defender back in front of us, despite having skilfully left him in place and overtaken him in speed. To add to this, even if the fast and spectacular actions are the most satisfying, we soon realize how easy it is to get to the basket without making too much use of those virtuosities. Offense fouls seem to not exist, which often leads us to force one's run through the defense without an effective and more complex shot setting and the X button - to dunk when used in the small area - is used to execute a animation that ensures an easy and often convenient foray into the basket. The chances of being able to score with these simple choices are so high that we prefer a concrete opportunity to score rather than trying to shoot after a more elaborate sequence of commands. Of course, perhaps even too concrete, almost as to ruin the quality of the experience. It's still difficult to get to the opponent's basket starting from under your own with only one player, but unfortunately the feeling that the compromise between realism and spectacularity is still badly balanced is very strong. Even the possibility of calling a play that reflects the team's DNA (Signature Playcalling) via the L1 key is so set up that it almost excludes us from the action, and could end up being only rarely used by those who don't feel like sacrificing one's own willingness to enter the show. In fact, colored icons appear on the parquet which literally guide us in executing the scheme, almost as if it were a tutorial. Despite the good functioning and the quality of the deriving actions, the excessive success of the scheme ruins the sensation of earning the point and often our choice of game ends up in favor of a more exciting and realistic improvisation in real time, perhaps linked to the simple waiting for the opponent to discover himself with one doubling too many. Free throws remain entrusted to the classic filling bar which, if stopped at the right point, ensures the point.Championships are won on defense When the opposing point guard enters our half, there is a good chance that you will dive towards him with your corresponding player to boycott his initiative. Approaching and pushing against him, you will have the sensation of ~leaning~ your body to his, adhering to it: this mechanic, called Lockdown Defense, is very useful under the basket and simple to use, but mainly outside the three-point line too often happens of not being able to apply it, finding ourselves slipping away (at times it even seems to cross the opponent) while helplessly we observe our rival conquering precious meters. The attempt to steal the ball, which occurs with the square button, frequently leads to a foul, and although this stimulates the desire to entrust one's own salvation more to a choral defensive maneuver than to our hysterical repeated pressing of the button, it leaves us with the only alternative an asphyxiating pressing that can do little concretely if not delay as much as possible the opposing team's attempt to score. However, if we decide to wait for their shot, we must at least have the certainty of being able to count on a good implementation of the jump, both to block the shot and to collect the rebound. Instead, the jump is slow and excessive, requires some practice before it can be used effectively, and often, mysteriously, fails to regain possession of the ball even after two or three consecutive and well-executed attempts. This series of flaws work together to make us a little helpless in the face of the suspected excessive infallibility of the plays of some of our antagonists, especially the superstars, who when they attack end up scoring too casually, leaving us with the impression that whatever we had attempted would have been useless. The development team's decision to set up the defense on small punitive dynamics is frustrating: too much, too often if we can't immediately physically ~fit~ him without slipping on him, if we can't guess which side he will perform his pirouette on outflanking, we will be punished with the opponent's point while our defense is still moving too slowly. Unfortunately during the defense phase the quality of the gaming experience drops radically, but although it is not particularly exciting, there is a certain cohesion of the parts and everything manages to work without too many pretensions. Graphically it does not differ much from the previous one: it is more than satisfactory, but the detail in the stands disappoints and there is some drop in framerate in the replays. Player animations are very natural and as always some champions have unique ones. The sound sector is very accurate, with a good variety of sound effects, a good commentary and a musical choice in line with the usual practice by EA of securing several names of appreciated artists, from Beck to Busta Rhymes. Don't worry about multiplayer, it's excellent and you'll enjoy it for a long time: this is where the title gives its best. Especially in the 5V5 mode, where we can invite nine friends to control every single player. It works wonders, it also impresses in the long run and there is no lag whatsoever.", "date": "2008-11-17", "grade": "7.5"}
