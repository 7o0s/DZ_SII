Absolutely nothing. In fact, it is by pure chance that they meet or rather collide: Brian Basco is on his way to the doctorate of his dreams at Berkley and, passing through New York, he runs into the beautiful and mysterious Gina, a singer on the run from two bad thugs of the local Mafia, who ends up under the wheels of his down-at-heel car and loses consciousness. Feeling guilty and not at all indifferent to her charms, Brian decides to accompany her immediately to the hospital. Here he will discover that the girl has witnessed the killing of her father, of whom only an old crucifix remains, and that her life is in danger. What to do? Continue to California to devote himself to his doctorate or be carried away by the languid Gina throughout the States, from Chicago to the Arizona desert, and help her discover what lies behind her father's death? The answer seems obvious to me, also because, if our protagonist opted for the first choice, Runaway wouldn't be much of an adventure (with all due respect to those who are sweating a doctorate in physics)! American student + glamorous singer + mobsters = trouble It is Brian himself who tells us all this, through a long and tasty introductory film with a markedly cinematic rhythm and flavor, complete with opening credits and opening credits. After that, we can finally immerse ourselves in the protagonist's shoes: it is at this point, in the hospital room where Gina rests, that I discovered with great satisfaction and a pinch of nostalgia that I was immersed in an old-fashioned point and click adventure . The cartoon-style graphics are a feast for the eyes, colorful and full of details but always clean. Brian is viewed in third person and following the cursor he can freely explore the game scenarios, which often scroll sideways to offer a wider view. The learning curve is almost non-existent: the animated cursor changes shape according to the possibilities of interaction with the area of the screen it passes over, thus suggesting the operations that can be performed with the left mouse button (observe, speak, use/collect) and the the first settings are rather limited, so as not to disorient the player and favor the solution of the initial puzzles. If two actions can be performed on the same object, you switch from one to the other with a simple press of the right button. The inventory and options screen can be accessed at the top of the screen. That's all, nothing more elementary: longtime adventurers will find themselves perfectly at ease with this dry and functional interface, while beginners will discover in it the ideal vehicle to approach the genre. American student + glamorous singer + mobsters = trouble I haven't had a similar experience since the last Monkey Island and in fact in the game itself references to past adventures abound, as well as cinematic clichs. Just like the old LucasArts titles, Runaway has the advantage of never taking itself too seriously, which helps to further appreciate its already very high quality value: a subtle humor pervades not only the dialogues but also the descriptions of the objects and the irresistible characterization of the characters - just think of the bizarre and psychedelic group of drag queens the protagonist runs into in the middle of the desert (not too veiled cinematic homage). Despite being an artistically very accurate title, it does not flaunt particular claims to innovation, nor does it expressly focus on impactful settings or dizzying special effects. The screenplay is certainly not the most original but, thanks to the appreciable narrative techniques adopted and some unexpected twists in the plot, it is engaging just enough to keep the player's interest always alive. American student + glamorous singer + mobsters = trouble In short, we are dealing with the interactive version of one of those disengaged but refreshing American road movies, which we end up watching and appreciating because they can offer a few hours of genuine entertainment, even without claiming to aspire to an Oscar nomination, and because all in all they are well packaged. With its stimulating puzzles, its intriguing atmospheres, its beautiful soundtrack and its unforgettable actors, Runaway is just that: a pure entertainment experience in which all the ingredients, skilfully dosed, contribute to giving us pleasant contents, presented in a dress respectably. That's what I meant, summarieszing the essence of the game in the words ~balance and lightness~. In the footsteps of Guybrush Threepwood... and McGyver Runaway is divided into six chapters, which alternate the actual game with long and exciting cutscenes, in which the protagonist narrates the salient moments of the adventure. The development of the plot is absolutely linear and does not include branches or alternative endings, the puzzles themselves must be solved in a precise order, but this does not seem to weigh much on the pace of the game, which remains pressing for its entire duration. In the footsteps of Guybrush Threepwood... and McGyver The puzzles are mostly focused on the exploration of the scenarios, the dialogues and the combination of objects, although sometimes we will find ourselves breaking into safes or guessing a sequence of sounds to unlock a code. The difficulty is never too high: it is often obvious what we have to do to progress in the adventure but not necessarily how to do it, also because certain puzzles are made particularly difficult by the impossibility of identifying a useful object in the background at first glance. It is imperative to rummage through each setting in detail so as not to leave out important elements but, in this regard, there is a further obstacle to report: many objects are visible and can be examined but cannot be used until a certain moment, or when they become necessary for a particular puzzle or after a particular conversation. This undoubtedly translates into greater realism, but on the other hand imposes an inflexible order in solving puzzles: Brian will refuse to pick up a heavy object unless he really needs it (understandable, except that sooner or later we will have to return to take it!) or he still won't want to take something out of a bag until he knows exactly what to look for and on several occasions can take different objects out of it. In the footsteps of Guybrush Threepwood... and McGyver In general, the puzzles are logical and shouldn't hold back the expert adventurer too much, who will almost always know how to reach the goal by experimenting with the inventory or taking advantage of the precious clues provided by the characters in the game and will complete it in a relatively short time. brief. The difficulty level is well calibrated even for a beginner, if we exclude some somewhat forced association of objects, such as the use of peanut butter to break down a door (playing, you will understand why), but nothing that cannot be remedied with a good guide to the solution of the adventure. Regardless of if and when you get stuck, until then you won't want to leave Runaway without a valid reason: you'll be eager to progress through the story to visit new settings, talk to ever more outlandish characters and enjoy other cinematic cutscenes, also because there are hardly any gets tired of puzzles so varied and well thought out, in their simplicity. 2D or 3D? That is the question... Why not both? At first glance, a casual observer might be fooled by Runaway's cartoony graphics, thinking he's dealing with a classic adventure not only in spirit but also in appearance, while this title offers a happy mix of 2D and 3D graphics, perfectly integrating the three-dimensional models of characters and objects with the two-dimensional hand-drawn backgrounds, in a slightly retro style, with a sort of free interpretation of the Cell Shading technique. The resulting visual effect is particularly original and pleasant, especially when added to the realistic animations and the valuable effects of light and shadow. 2D or 3D? That is the question... The settings are varied and colorful, although never too extensive. When you find yourself exploring several in the same chapter, a map of the area is provided. Also notable is the large gallery of bizarre and beautifully characterized characters. Even the inventory screen is made with irony and attention to detail: the objects in our possession are aligned in the center, which we can examine closely and combine with each other, and an image of the protagonist appears on the right, ready to enlighten us with comments more or less serious: when he carries out particular operations or rummages in a container, he bends down and disappears from the shot but we hear him rummaging around; if we leave the game for a few moments, he punches the edge of the screen to get our attention. Animations, shots and movies are very cinematic and always lightning-fast loading. Usually the quality of the cutscene graphics is higher than that of the normal game phases, but Runaway is the exception to the rule:some of the movies appear slightly blurry and less vivid, which doesn't make them any less enjoyable! 2D or 3D? That is the question... The dubbing and the soundtrack deserve a special mention, both superlatives: a song with English lyrics was specially written for the game, in turn entitled Runaway, intriguing and decidedly difficult to ignore - those who love the sounds of the Cranberries or Heather Nova can't help but appreciate it; the rest of the accompaniment, which ranges from the typical ~elevator music~ to melancholy western motifs, is more discreet but always catchy and up to that of any television series. Heartfelt congratulations also to the Italian voice actors, who offered decidedly inspired interpretations, contributing in a decisive way to the involvement of the player and to the richness of the characterization. Long live point-and-click adventures! I want it to be clear: don't expect to discover the new frontiers of graphic adventure with this title, on the contrary, you will be able to relive the genuineness and fun of the first examples of the genre. Runaway finally proves that the point-and-click adventure is far from dead and that it was just in a vegetative coma. The evolution and hybridization of the genre are certainly welcome and I have no doubt that some experiments in recent years have also pleasantly impressed fans of traditional adventures, but there is none for anyone: despite the risk of being anachronistic , Runaway has everything you need, rhythm, variety, nice puzzles, calibrated difficulty, spot-on settings and characters, funny and never boring dialogues, a long and satisfying ending. Like other old-fashioned adventures, it is certainly not free from defects such as the forced linear development or some puzzles that are a little too cumbersome, but fun is guaranteed. If we also consider the competitive price of 19.90 euros and the fact that the game has practically no competition at the moment, Runaway is an obligatory purchase - especially for those nostalgic for Lucas and Sierra titles! Pros: Maximum playability Original cartoon-style graphics Luxury music and dubbing Ironic and light-hearted tone Cons: Some convoluted puzzles Hunting for hidden objects on the seabed Strict linearity Limited replayability (plague of the genre more than of the game specifically) Graphic adventure, sleeping beauty It is true that the market is often as unpredictable as it is contradictory: the recipe that the Madrid-based Pendulo Studios followed for Runaway is as old as the world of video games and not too far from the one already adopted in 1997 with Hollywood Monster - a simple but addictive, puzzles based on exploration and object association, multiple choice dialogues, simple and intuitive interface - and yet it has once again proved to be foolproof. According to many, this formula has tired and should be outdated by now, but then how do you explain the echo that the game has had among both hard-core adventurers and newcomers to the genre? Not even the publishers had believed it, so much so that Runaway suffered problems and delays in distribution, reaching our country only now, despite having appeared for the first time in 2001! Thus, while adventurers are anxiously awaiting the ~revolution~ of their favorite genre promised by titles such as Broken Sword 3, the most classic of the graphic adventures released in recent times conquers unexpected success first in Spain and then in Germany, Austria and France , spreading like wildfire in the rest of Europe and managing to establish itself for its freshness and originality, despite a rigidly traditional approach. I would say that, beyond the possible commercial and conceptual implications, the miracle of Runaway can be explained in just two words: balance and lightness.", "date": "2003-07-09", "grade": null}
