{"name": "Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/otogi-2-immortal-warriors.html", "text": "True to tradition As in the vast majority of action games on the market, the story that forms the backdrop to the events is not particularly elaborate or original, thus playing a marginal role. In summary, the plot conceived by From Software once again sees the kingdom of men threatened by the offensive of demons, this time allied with each other to launch an attack more powerful than ever. The mysterious priestess Seimei, or the guiding voice of the protagonist of the first episode Raikoh, decides to bring the latter back to life through the sacrifice of his four generals. Thus was born a real anti-demon group composed of Seimei herself, Raikoh, and the generals who became undead warriors: Kontoki, Tsuna, Sadamitsu and Suetake. And this narrative choice actually represents the biggest novelty introduced by Otogi 2 Immortal Warriors, namely the ability to control 6 different characters each with different strengths and weaknesses. The programmers have also decided to include some RPG elements in the development of the protagonists themselves, thus allowing them to increase their physical characteristics - through the outlay of money - or to buy ever more effective equipment or spells. The 6 characters actually present different qualities capable of significantly varying the approach with the missions, even if in reality there are no major problems in achieving the set objectives with any warrior. As for the actual mechanics, those who have already played the first chapter will not struggle to get in tune with what is proposed in this sequel. Otogi 2 is in fact a particularly choreographic action game, which finds its focal points more on action and combat than on exploration. In fact, the vast majority of the time is spent fighting against demons of all shapes and sizes, hovering a few meters from the ground and creating more or less extensive combos. The strategy required, apart from the battles against the bosses, is very minimal, thus moving the needle of the scale markedly towards the furious pressing of the pad keys. Although there are in fact three types of attacks (strong, light and magical) and numerous different combos, in most cases we find ourselves relying mainly on the strong attack, which is also the one capable of giving greater ~aesthetic~ value to the clashes. Whoever breaks pays Among the aspects that made the first Otogi famous, the extreme interactivity with the settings should certainly be mentioned, or rather the possibility of destroying the vast majority of what was placed in front of the protagonist. Obviously the sequel confirmed and strengthened this peculiarity, allowing to shatter practically everything or almost everything: rocks, buildings, houses, walls, and so on and so forth. This is certainly an appreciable factor, but which unfortunately on some occasions also leads to a serious impact on the frame rate. Yes because the Japanese programmers, as regards the graphic aspect of this Otogi 2, perhaps wanted to take the longest step; the settings are in fact splendid, very rich in details and enhanced by a truly evocative artistic direction, but in crowded situations all this abundance is excessive for the graphics engine, which abandons several fps on the street. Nonetheless, this aspect almost never reaches the point of heavily affecting the gameplay, and in this sense the camera is much more annoying which often loses the heart of the action, forcing tedious manual corrections. But beyond this, what really prevents Otogi 2 from reaching the heights of the genre lies in the lack of inspiration of the level design, combined with a marked monotony in the objectives that the game requires to achieve during the missions. In fact, the common denominator almost always remains the suppression of one or more specific demons, or the destruction of an object; much more rarely, the defense of an objective or something similar. A pity, since a greater variety in the gameplay would undoubtedly have increased the value of a game that still unquestionably has positive characteristics. Perhaps it will be for the third episode Comment Otogi 2 is an interesting action game, which improves on what was already good in the first episode, seasoning it all with a top-class graphic component. The effort of From Software, however, as a whole turns out to be an unbalanced product, which relies too much on the spectacularity and on the marked choreographic component of its contents, slightly overshadowing the depth of the gameplay. From this point of view, above all the lack of variety of mechanics offered to the player weighs, a factor that is worthwhilelizza the game in question in the long run. All in all therefore, Otogi 2 is a highly recommended product for lovers of the predecessor; not the same for others, who would do better to try it before venturing into the purchase. Pros: Graphically excellent High interactivity of the settings Immediately enjoyable Cons: Lack of variety in the missions Camera not very reactive Slowdowns in the most crowded situations Although it certainly did not have a particular commercial success, the first Otogi succeeded in the far from simple feat of ~being remembered~. Whether for a truly inspired and particular graphic style, or for an immediate game mechanic, the From Software title published by Sega has nevertheless left a mark in the crowded series of games available for X-Box, so much so as to justify the development of a sequel . Quite simply called Otogi 2 Immortal Warriors, the effort of the Japanese programmers has finally reached European soil, more than a year after its debut in the Rising Sun.", "date": "2005-03-01", "grade": null}
