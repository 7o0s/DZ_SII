{"name": "Ritorno al passato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/85473-dreamcast-collection-ritorno-al-passato.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360Dreamcast Collection is, as can be guessed from the title of the product itself, a collection containing (four) of the most popular video games of the Dreamcast, the unfortunate but very valid SEGA console. Of course, they are not the best ever born and originally released on the platform mentioned, nor those great games that fans expected to find in a similar compilation, such as titles of the caliber of Shenmue, just to name one. But anyhow, they are not ugly and this was the choice of the Japanese company. The Dreamcast Collection package contains the games Sonic Adventure, Crazy Taxi, SEGA Bass Fishing and Space Channel 5: Part 2, adapted, slightly, for the occasion to high definition TV. The graphics sector, perhaps it seems superfluous to underline it, we anticipate it already does not change that much compared to the original if not for the definition that has passed to 720p. While in general the games maintain the basic original characteristics with the addition of goals (Xbox 360 version) and online rankings. So let's see in detail to analyze the four titles included in the compilation. Sonic Adventure We recently dealt with Sonic Adventure by reviewing the version adapted to high definition for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users, previously usable through the respective online services of these platforms. Considered the best of the three-dimensional titles dedicated to the popular blue hedgehog, at least until the recent Sonic Colors for Nintendo Wii, the title is a mere Dreamcast port, with no improvements whatsoever in terms of playability or graphics. The game is in summary as it was conceived over ten years ago, no more and no less, with all its strengths and weaknesses. Just like the other titles enclosed in the Dreamcast Collection. Sonic Adventure is structured as an adventurous platformer divided into different scenarios within which six different storylines take place. Each of them is dedicated to a specific character and is characterized by various levels that change depending, in fact, on the heroes used. Sonic is obviously the main protagonist of the adventure, as well as the one who is used the most in the game. The levels that see him in action are largely focused on his proverbial breathless runs and rings to collect. Only that all this takes place in three-dimensional environments, with some automated sequences to avoid any problems in controlling the character. Then there is the sweet Amy Rose, who with hammer blows must protect her beloved bird from the clutches of Dr. Robotnik, Knuckles, whose primary purpose is to recover the pieces of emerald scattered throughout the levels, E-102 Gamma, a robot that transforms the gaming experience into a kind of shooter and Big the Cat, a big anthropomorphic blue cat with which to face a sort of simplified fishing simulation. To further vary the gameplay there are also some mini games, puzzles, the collection of particular objects to collect points or unlock special prizes and the Chao Garden where you can breed the homonymous creatures. Plus the objectives inserted for the occasion, the DLC and a brand new online option relating to a world ranking where you can record the times of the speed tests performed with our heroes. The picture is completed by 720p graphics (but not wide-screen) and a rather spot-on, if outdated, soundtrack. Crazy Taxis Another title in the compilation is Crazy Taxi, one of the funniest and most light-hearted videogames in the entire gaming universe, released way back in 1999 under the Hitmaker label. The concept behind the product is very simple: driving a taxi, the gamer must wander around a city recreated ad hoc by the SEGA developers, which extends for kilometers with stations, highways full of cars, fountains, shops and crowded sidewalks, looking for customers to bring to one of the destinations they indicate in the shortest possible time. The playing time changes depending on whether you play with the original rules of the coin op version or with the specific ones of the console version. And then receive points, cash rewards and medals for valor in exchange. Many of these rewards are related to the type of driving performed and to the speed: by taking specific shortcuts or entertaining the collected passenger with borderline jumps, drifts and furious highway racing, you can get more money. In addition to customers' handshakes and a better evaluation divided into speedy, normal and slowy, depending on the maximum speed reached during the ride (in the last case the dissatisfied customer will kick the taxi and not pay for the service). For variesre the gameplay, as well as in the Arcade or Original modes, you can also try your hand at some fun missions in which to perform stunts or specific actions other than accompanying customers from point A to point B. This inside of the Crazy Box mode. As far as graphics are concerned, what at the end of the 90s left more or less speechless thanks to the power, for the time, of the Naomi arcade board and later of the Dreamcast, today obviously doesn't surprise that much. The visual adaptation for high definition offers bright colors, greater image sharpness and a good fluidity and stability, but nothing more. While the audio, even without some of the historical songs of the original, has a beautiful soundtrack and decent samplings. From the original release for the arcade and for the Dreamcast, the product also inherits the lack of longevity: once the morphology of the city has been memorized and the mini-games solved, there is not much more to do. Xbox 360 goals 800 player points for 48 achievements are waiting to be earned by the player in this compilation. They are divided into 200 points and 12 prizes per game. To get them you have to do a little bit of everything in the four titles present, from saving specific characters in Space Channel 5: Part 2 to collecting all the emblems in Sonic Adventure, passing through catching some big fish on the hook in SEGA Bass Fishing or attaining the various licenses in Crazy Taxi's Arcade or Original modes. An additional 3 achievements and 50 points can also be made available with the Sonic Adventure DX DLC. SEGA Bass Fishing SEGA Bass Fishing is instead, as can be guessed from the title itself, a fishing game. But as tradition has it for practically all SEGA arcade titles, it is the typical product from a recycled cabinet in a console key, therefore with few game modes and options. The first option available is in fact the classic Practice mode, thanks to which the user can easily devote himself to free fishing without worries of any kind such as scores, the passage of time and any type of element that can exert a certain ~pressure~ on him. him in terms of performance. In short, it seems made on purpose to deepen the knowledge of the gameplay and refine the throwing techniques. On the other hand, the situation for the Arcade mode is different. In this case we have the perfect reproduction of the arcade cabinet, complete with a timer to mark the frenetic pace of the game that characterizes the attempts to hook the gamer's fish, better if large or valuable. Finally, by selecting Tournament, you can play a sort of classified challenge that takes place in ten different places and has the objective of catching as many fish and rays as possible in different scenarios and different natural conditions. Regarding the graphics also in this case we have no real improvements from the adaptation of the video game to 720p. SEGA Bass Fishing presents a visual sector similar to the original, with a bright color palette, few effects and polygons, very colorful writing, menus with huge fonts and a decidedly evident retro air. The same goes for audio: created with a synthesizer, probably the same one used by SEGA in their other products, we have simple and catchy tunes as a background for users' fishing sessions, as well as sound effects and screamed voices in English typically from arcade games to underline the various evolutions. Space Channel 5: Part 2 One of the progenitor series of the musical-dancer genre was SEGA's Space Channel. In the Dreamcast Collection, the Japanese company proposes the second episode of the saga, released in 2002 simultaneously for the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. The concept behind the game is the same as always for the series: saving space from the threat of a group of unusual aliens , in this case called Rhythm Rouges, and free their hostages to dance with the help of Ulala, an interplanetary anchor woman. The game mechanics are therefore quite simple: it is a question of repeating the dancing movements of the extraterrestrials by acting on the directional arrows and on the keys used for shooting and saving the secondary characters that appear on the screen during the game. These are elements that characterize and diversify the product from others of the same kind. Initially the average level of difficulty is quite low and the user is only required to perform single presses or short combinations of the pad buttons, but as the game progresses the difficulty rate rises, engaging the player in sudden movements and long sequences to memorize . Each performance is then monitored by the CPU and through the indexof Share highlights the quality of the performance or not, with hearts that indicate how many errors are still allowed to those who are performing the performance. To then differentiate the otherwise repetitive playful component, the developers have included several bonus sections in which the beautiful Ulala can challenge the reporters of competing TV stations in duels based on musical instruments, such as electric guitar and drums, and fun duels with end-of-level bosses, ranging from giant carnivorous plants to a trio of singing robots, always introduced by hilarious cutscenes. With a visual sector characterized by pastel colors, orange and blue, with a futuristic design but that winks at the 70s and an apt soundtrack, this Space Channel 5: Part 2 appears the other game, together with Sonic, best of the collection.", "date": "2011-03-02", "grade": "6.8"}
