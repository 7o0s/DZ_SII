Ball King is in fact quite similar to the game mentioned above, especially for its ~basketball~ genre combined with a pinch of Angry Birds, to which the development team has added a pleasant personal touch. After the creation of the entertaining Beyond Gravity, Qwiboo takes us in its own way into the world of basketball, putting us in the shoes of a young boy committed to putting the ball in the basket as many times as possible: the limit for our highscore is only the infinite, allowing us to spend half an hour trying to improve our score yet again. Other than NBA All-Star Weekend races: Ball King doesn't let us miss a shot! Three-point shot Ball King consists of two different modes, the first of which is the classic endless: inside, all that matters is the number of balls sent to the basket. To do this, the player has at his disposal a shooting system similar to that of the Angry Birds slingshot: by moving his finger on the screen of the device, it is in fact possible to adjust the power and direction of the launch, counting on a dotted line that draws the initial part of the trajectory. The second type of game, on the other hand, is timed: in 60 seconds it is necessary to make as many baskets as possible, increasing the score by one in case of success, but decreasing it if the ball does not end up in the net. The ~perfect shot~, achieved without touching the metal ring of the basket, offers the possibility of extending the time by a further 3 seconds, thus obtaining a bonus for extending the overall duration of the game, which in any case is destined to end. As you progress in both modes, the developers have given the player the opportunity to collect a series of objects, among which we find the alternative balls that add up to the typical basketball with which you start the game: their variety is quite imaginative, since one goes easily between improbable things such as an egg or a smiley that dispenses smiles, together with clocks, ducks, fruit and so on. Similarly, the initial setting represented by an alley with a police car can be joined by other places, to be unlocked by obtaining points as you play: nothing particularly memorable, but still useful for keeping the interest alive above all in the short term. Even though it's a free-to-play title, Ball King never puts invasive banners in front of the player, instead offering optional video ads for extra points - a particularly commendable decision given what's going on in the free-to-play world. mobile. If desired, it is also possible to purchase additional content, among those unlockable by continuing to play normally. A bit of nostalgia As for the graphic aspect, Ball King has an aspect based on an inspired pixel art, with which Qwiboo has decided to wink at the golden age of 8 and 16 bit systems. The style is in fact deliberately retro, with good attention to detail of the elements that make up the various scenarios that are part of the game. But be careful not to be fooled: beyond a convincing aesthetics, there is also a physics management that proves to be able to do its duty well, as in the case in which you find yourself having to calculate an alternative trajectory to absorb the effect of the wind. Depending on the direction and intensity of the latter, it is in fact necessary to modify the parabola of one's shot to ensure that it centers the basket. The view with zoom on the board is also particularly successful, combined with a slow-motion effect that is activated automatically, when shots are taken at the limit: in fact, the game manages the balancing situation between inside and outside very well, generating with any rebounds on the edges that pinch of pathos which definitely does not hurt. As for the audio, however, Ball King does not have a soundtrack: in fact, it limits itself to accompanying the baskets with applause and screams, followed by other types of sounds that also recall the classic ones of a few videogame generations ago.", "date": "2015-05-27", "grade": "6.8"}
