{"name": "Alpine Racer 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/alpine-racer-3_a.html", "text": "[***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] If you fall off that mountain, you're a thing of the past! Once on the track, the game engine fires all the cartridges available, and if we exclude the graphic ~amenities~ described at the beginning for a moment, one might even be pleasantly surprised. First of all, the excellent fluidity of the scrolling, fast and firmly anchored to 50fps, and the typical Nachian scenographic management of the paths, which continuously feed the visual curiosity, catch the eye. Sudden avalanches, hidden glaciers, airplanes and fireworks combine to ignite the aforementioned cabin feeling, making the Namco title the antithesis of static. It's a pity that the simple coinoppara philosophy sacrifices elements amply glorified in the arcade style of the aforementioned SSX, as well as the various tricks, here reduced to actions performed automatically by the cpu. The woody controls don't help, which include poorly effective braking and an excessively mechanical feeling (athletes often seem to slide on rails). If we then put the aesthetic deficit back on the table, we get a heavy balance. The untouchable fluidity remains the only foothold of a graphics engine that defining crude is pure euphemism, with small characters and modeling far from the levels of excellence found in similar products, and with a general lack of detail. In purely playful terms, the AR3 is fun, being frenetic and fast enough not to tarnish Namco's credibility. However, the times when the house of Pac-Man pushed Sony hardware with its arcade perfects seem far away. But we are optimistic, trusting in a forthcoming flashback. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Comment The reasons for the European publication of a minor title like this AR3 are obscure to us, and with a Tricky SSX far from retirement, we didn't even miss it. But the world is beautiful because it is varied, and perhaps there are those who appreciate it. Space therefore for the Namco ski week, this is roughly the period you will need to exhaust all its resources, but it will certainly cost you less ... Pro + Fast and very smooth + Overall fun + Suitably spectacular circuit handling Cons - Graphically crude - Aliasing & flickering - Italian localization depressing Nostalgic Namco. In Alpine Racer 3 you breathe the homemade air of the cabinet at the bar next door: disengagement, lightness, joyful tunes and exalted speakers. But this time something seems to have gone wrong Hey Do you know that I am the best? But what are we talking about? Of snow, snowboards, a handful of reckless people ready to break their necks for public adoration. SSX Tricky? Definitely no. Rather, a certain Ridge Racer V comes back to mind (just to stay at Namco All right, in that case we don't find snowboards and even less snow, but there are ladders, flickering and dull colors like in the ski arcade in question. They call it first generation syndrome, just now that we thought we were cured of it. Cruel Namco. But the coup de grace comes with the audio. Nothing to complain about the music, typical but pleasant minestrone of dance variations, rather from the diabolical Italian localization, which tries to imitate the radio style of the original commentator, with such devastating results that they would make the best Alvaro Vitali pale. Only that in this case there is very little to re-evaluate! Unspeakable vocal cacophonies persecute the unfortunate video player in the name of the most unbridled sadism, unless they are deactivated (wisely) in due time, or restored to English audio. Let's overlook the expressions of the selectable characters, who even manage to beat the commentator in terms of insanity. Thrill. For the rest we are faced with a package set up in the name of self-conviction (little) and economy (a lot). No option for 60hz (fortunately no black bars), a weak CG intro that makes the glories of Tekken a distant dot, and a championship mode filled with minimal managerial elements that I won't describe (but yes... Win, get the money , buy a faster board and go to the next race). Not much else remains of AR3, apart from the appreciable attempt to add a Slalom mode, which however proves to be somewhat futile due to the flaws in the control system.", "date": "2002-12-24", "grade": null}
