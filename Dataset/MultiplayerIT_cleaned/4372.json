Hearing about magical places and creatures of all kinds stimulated the extraordinary imagination that children have always had, making us imagine fantastic worlds in which to carry out our heroic deeds. Even if we now have a few more years on our shoulders, it's still nice to see that part of what we so strongly desired in our childhood can now materialize before our eyes, thanks to virtual reality. Moss, the Polyarc team's debut title on PlayStation VR, is exactly one of the fairy tales that were read to us while we were between the covers of our bed, a story to be experienced all in direct thanks to the immersion offered by the PlayStation 4 viewer. but above all, as we are about to see, the excellent inspiration of whoever made it. After taking a look at Bravo Team, let's go back to talking about an exclusive for the Sony-branded console and its virtual reality with Moss's review. A mouse for a friend The magical essence of the world of Moss is presented to us even before entering the adventure, starting with a book in hand in a large room that seems to come straight out of Harry Potter. Using the DualShock 4 movement tracking system that we have in our hands, we can browse the tome, thus getting to know the little mouse Quill, the protagonist of the story. The world of Moss is made up of enchanting places and marvelous starry vaults, but also of frightening creatures from underground: one of these, a certain Sarfogg, is responsible for the misfortune that befell the kingdom of mice, now forced to take refuge in the forest to live don't worry. The evil snake-like being killed the king to try to take possession of a relic with extraordinary magical power, which however was lost in the meantime. A bit like Frodo with the Ring, little Quill ends up finding the object by chance, binding thanks to it to a magical entity that populates the world of Moss. From here will start a long journey in search of the missing uncle, who ended up right in the clutches of Sarfogg in the castle now inhabited by the monster. If the little mouse is the protagonist of Moss, we too are no less: that desire to be part of the story described at the beginning is in fact satisfied by Polyarc with the breaking of the fourth wall, allowing the Reader - that is us - not only to browse the pages of the book, but also to become a kind of spirit guide for the little Quill. Our figure accompanies the protagonist throughout the adventure, supporting her in difficult moments but above all using her magical power to resolve situations that would otherwise be inextricable for such a little creature alone. If we move our head and mirror ourselves in a stream, we can even see our character, largely inspired by the No-Face from The Enchanted City. The combination between Reader and Quill works very well, quickly igniting the spark that leads us to take the fate of the little mouse to heart. The little heroine is able to immediately earn our affection, producing tender squeaks and direct references to the Reader: at one point she even invited us to give her a high five. Playstation 4 trophies Moss' goals total thirty-two. To the usual platinum obtainable by conquering all the others, there are six gold, eight silver and seventeen bronze trophies. Most of them can be obtained simply by completing the adventure without particular attention, but there is no lack of elements related to particular actions in combat or to the collectibles present in the game. In case you want to collect everything, then take into account an inevitable second run. The adventure begins Moss' story is told to us in two different ways: when we're not reading the book from the outside, we find ourselves directly accompanying Quill on his journey. It is naturally in this second case that the game dynamics develop, identifiable as a puzzle game accompanied by elementary combat phases. In both cases, Quill and the Reader are forced to work together to move forward: the most recurring case is the one in which with the use of the controller we have to activate mechanisms that are too large or too far away for the little mouse, thus allowing her to advance to the next step until you complete the current setting, to move on to the next one with a black screen transition. Our presence is kingknows tangible from a semi-transparent luminous globe, which can be moved through the movement of the DualShock 4: as already mentioned we can use the controller to pull levers or turn platforms, but also revive Quill when his health conditions start to be critical or take possession of an enemy unit. This last action is useful both in combat and for solving puzzles, typically using opponents as weights to operate mechanisms or to fire shots at levers and other similar objects, which we could not otherwise reach. As we move Quill with the left stick we are therefore often called upon to use the movement of the controller to perform these actions, effectively controlling the two protagonists of the game at the same time. Considering that in a multitasking situation like the one described, our brain ends up being quite busy already, the combat comes in a very simple form: Quill can only perform a series of basic attacks with his sword. The clashes typically take place facing waves of enemies, putting the player in difficulty on very rare occasions in a way that we believe is intentional not to interrupt the narrative flow of Moss. In terms of duration, Polyarc's effort can be completed in just over three hours, with no particular reason to return to work other than to once again admire the extraordinary work done by the team based near Seattle. With open mouth The technical sector of Moss can enjoy an obsessive attention to detail in every single aspect, which reveals Polyarc's intention to create first of all a fairytale world that is able to leave those who visit it enchanted. The fixed view from which we observe Quill moving as the Reader allows us to appreciate all the elements brought to life by the developers, without having motion sickness problems: the only head movements we have to make are those necessary to control the position of the shot of the current setting, within which some secret objects are also often hidden. Thanks to the latter, Polyarc pushes us to admire everything around us, changing perspective by leaning forward to discover initially hidden paths but above all to get as close as possible to little Quill's point of view. From the forest where the mice live to the castle where the epilogue of the story takes place, Moss deserves to be watched and re-watched with all the calm in the world, like a picture book of those that children like so much. From a purely technical point of view, also in this case we are faced with excellent progress for the management of the limitations imposed by the technology of PlayStation VR, in particular thanks to the excellent light effects. Quill's deeds are accompanied by a themed soundtrack that is always present in underlining the various moments of the game, while the dubbing is entirely in English, as are the subtitles available.
