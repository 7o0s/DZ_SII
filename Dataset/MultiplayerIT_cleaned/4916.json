The plot revolves around Blake Langermann, a video operator who takes care of carrying out investigative journalistic services together with his wife Lynn, going from time to time to the crime scene. This time the two are headed by helicopter to the Arizona desert, where the body of a young pregnant woman was found, perhaps the victim of a religious cult. But something goes wrong, one of the engines fails and the aircraft crashes to the ground: when we wake up, as Blake, we only have time to recover the video camera, reach the crash site and discover that Lynn has mysteriously disappeared. They took her away, but who did it and why? It is pitch dark, however the infrared cameras of the camcorder allow us to see houses in the distance, a windmill and the ever-present corn plantations. Someone must know what happened: better hurry and knock on some doors. Or maybe not? Outlast 2 is violent, dark, sick and damn addictive: a very classy survival horror Sheep among the wolves Outlast 2 re-proposes the ~passive~ survival horror dynamics that fans of the series know well: the protagonist of this new, distressing adventure is a normal man, even a little cowardly, who limits himself to witnessing the horror he sees by recording specific sequences and photographing letters and messages, only to flee like hell when someone threatens him. An inevitably frustrating approach because it is easy to imagine how anyone, cornered, possesses the self-preservation instinct necessary to hold a stone or a club to try to defend themselves; but nevertheless necessary in order to instill real fear in the player, the tension of someone who knows that he must watch his steps to avoid alerting the crazy individuals who are chasing him, and who would have no qualms about killing him in the same way as painful as possible. Blake arrives at this conclusion after a few minutes, when he comes across gutted animal carcasses and apparently uninhabited houses, inside which, however, there is evidence of a cult, the one created by the holy man Sullivan Knoth, which pushes people to sacrifice their children in the name of an evil and vengeful god. The figure of Knoth, dashed through notes scattered around the scenarios, appears as crazy as it is disturbing: it is an exalted man who satisfies his basest instincts by raping and killing young women, with an almost supernatural ascendancy over his ~flock~. . In fact, it was his men who kidnapped Lynn, convinced that she is about to give birth to the child of the antichrist, and Blake will have to do everything possible to find her and save her; although at a certain point the question becomes even more thorny, because there are actually two forces in the field and they have opposite but equally sinister objectives. Passion Although the basic structure is the same, the differences between Outlast and Outlast 2 appear evident, in particular as regards the ambitions of this sequel: the campaign, divided into six chapters whose names are inspired by the Bible, requires about ten hours to be completed, therefore on average double compared to the first episode of the series. However, one does not come across a story that is dragged by the hair, on the contrary the management always maintains great lucidity, letting us understand certain things and communicating some uncomfortable truths in an incontrovertible way; in particular those concerning the ~flashbacks~, which lead Blake to confront two different realities: on the one hand the cursed town of Temple Gate, on the other the Catholic school where, many years earlier, he witnessed helpless suicide of a friend. The broader nature of the scenarios partially sacrifices some elements that in the first chapter played a very important role, such as the hiding places in which to take refuge while waiting for the enemies to leave, present but most of the time unused in favor of a less wait-and-see approach . Instead, the unstoppable enemies return, in particular the terrible ~witch~ that we had already seen in the demo, whose entrance on the scene is accompanied by excruciating and otherworldly cries, and whose ~finishers~ towards us are visually very painful. In terms of gameplay, once again there are very few puzzles to solve, with simple devices to be activated after finding a specific component, while we really went so far on the limitationsi of the visual, with a practically perpetual darkness that envelops any area of the map and that puts us in a truly detestable situation when we run out of batteries for the video camera; also because the assassins who preside over the locations demonstrate on more than one occasion that they have eyes that get used to the darkness well, unlike us. The only, albeit important, concession made by the Red Barrels guys in view of the challenge lies in the possibility of picking up the game exactly where we left off before getting killed, so as to at least avoid the frustration of having to repeat entire sequences at each game over. A double-edged sword, however, given that this solution inevitably opens up to trial & error. They don't know what they are doing Blake can run (albeit for short distances), hide, climb certain surfaces, crawl and use bandages to heal his wounds: important skills for surviving in a context like that of Outlast 2, rendered visually in a very practical way thanks to a minimal interface, which lacks the references of a map and which therefore often and willingly leads us to explore territories that are well outside our comfort zone of modern gamers. The video camera, which in some moments will even be taken away from us, acts in this sense as a fundamental tool, in fact the eyes and ears (thanks to the proximity microphone) of the protagonist, busy wandering through fields, churches used as torture, woods, quarries and even rivers. The situations fielded by Red Barrels are quite varied and there seems to be no limit to the cruelty of our antagonists, who will try to make a martyr of us as soon as we give them the opportunity. However, from a structural point of view it is easy to point the finger at the gimmicks used, with the problem of visibility making a progression difficult and tiring which otherwise would be much faster, perhaps even trivial compared to any other stealth title. The mastery of the developers was therefore to skillfully mix all these elements to obtain the tension, the fright, the sick atmosphere and a narrative plot that fully reveals its cards only at the end, when Blake's past and present make the peace, in their own way. Fishers of men Although a title like Outlast 2 doesn't necessarily need excellent quality graphics to achieve its goal, the work done by Red Barrels in this sense appears very good: The engine remains Unreal Engine 3, with all its limitations, but the polygonal models have undergone substantial improvements compared to the debut chapter and there is obviously the whole part relating to the scenarios, which have acquired a greater variety. Of course, some edges reveal the independent nature of the production, but the authors did pay close attention to using the tools at their disposal in the best possible way, avoiding putting themselves in overly complicated situations. The Windows 10 Creator Update, with the introduction of HDR, contributed during our tests to enhance the colors of the game, which however turned out to be a little heavier than expected: on the test configuration, at 4K and with all effects to the maximum, we were unable to obtain the stable 60 frames per second, while at 1440p there was a curious glitch on the colors which, however, we do not know if it depends on the game, on Windows or on the screen we used. Instead, no problem at 1080p, which for this type of experience and its polygonal complexity probably remains the most balanced choice. If an excellent job has been done for the graphics, the same can absolutely be said for the sound, with dialogues in English (subtitled in Italian) that are very well interpreted, intense and convinced, as well as a sound design capable of contributing decisively to the general tension.", "date": "2017-04-24", "grade": "8.5"}
