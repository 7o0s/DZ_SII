To tell the truth, the name is explicit: in the game we find ourselves following the vicissitudes of the ~Capolinea~ caf, appropriately so called because it is located in a border area between life and death, a sort of limbo in which souls can find refreshment for 24 hours, before passing away definitively. Despite the gloomy premise, the story is centered on a very lively group of characters, whose continuously ironic and playful tone considerably dilutes the very dark and metaphysical themes that are dealt with within the various chapters of the story. And it is a story in all respects: it must be kept in mind that Necrobarista is a full-fledged visual novel, entirely focused on narration and practically devoid of any gameplay element. So you are warned: if you are looking for a real ~game~, better look elsewhere. This already represents a significant watershed and places Necrobarista in a niche within the videogame offer, because there is really practically nothing of gameplay in its structure, which classifies it to all intents and purposes as a (little) storytelling experiment. interactive in which we find ourselves exclusively reading the text on the screen. Unlike many other traditional visual novels, the Route 59 title accompanies the written story with a more filmic setting than the standard, with constant changes of shot, panning, moving camera and animations of the characters on the screen, all things that compared to the classic setting of more or less static screens accompanied by kilometers of text makes the experience at least a little more dynamic and engaging. We note a considerable effort on the part of the Australian team in trying to make the experience of this title truly unique, deviating somewhat from the stereotypes of visual novels, even if the playful ideas are just hinted at in a sketchy interaction . What emerges with great force is above all the strange atmosphere that pervades the caf that is the protagonist of the story and the characterization of its cast of characters: these are the elements on which the whole ~game~ experience largely relies, which could not be enough to make it fully stand out. The bar at the end of the world In an anonymous and squalid alley in Melbourne is the Capolinea, an apparently standard caf, with an intellectual and slightly trendy look, which has the particularity of representing a channel linking life and death. Here the souls of those who are about to definitively pass to the afterlife can spend one last day suspended between the earthly dimension and the metaphysical one, trying to solve the last existential problems, think about their past life or even gamble in the basement and try your luck by betting your last few hours. To manage the bar we find the owner Maddy in the company of Chay, affable immortal necromancer and the young Ashley, who make up a sort of dysfunctional pseudo-family suspended in a strange limbo, dealing with deceased customers and a debt of hours with the Council of the Death that makes it more and more difficult to run business properly. This is because Maddy and the others tend to take their customers' issues too much to heart, so much so that they get embroiled in situations that are not suited to the rigorous role of watershed between one dimension and another that the Death Council would like for the bar, as it emerges also from the story of Kishan, a new customer who died recently at the beginning of the game. The story of Necrobarista mainly deals with the events that emerge from the arrival of Kishan, exploding in a few minutes a series of problems concerning the Terminus and the bizarre circus of characters that revolve around it. Everything is told through a large amount of text and without any dubbing, but with a remarkable care in staging and directing that strongly recall the anime style. On the other hand, according to the developers of Route 59 themselves, Necrobarista was born from the desire to pay homage to classic series such as Cowboy Bebob, FLCL and Gurren Lagann, which according to the authors have somewhat got lost in the mists of new Japanese animated productions. Indeed, the references in particular to the first of the three series are quite evident in the characterization of the characters and in the rhythm of the narration, even if the tone and the dreamlike and almost Kafkaesque atmospheres manage to crcreate a truly special alchemy. It is not the first time that topics of this caliber have been treated by narrative games and we have seen excellent results emerge in recent years too, in rather different forms. Admittedly, Necrobarista stays quite a distance from the impact of widespread storytelling seen in What Remains of Edith Finch, or the dialogue brilliance of Oxenfree and Afterparty, to make any comparisons in the realm of life-and-death tales. However, it stands out thanks to its initial idea and some moments in which the anime characterization is perfectly associated with the absurd but also profound situations of the story. Animated story Given the premises, it makes little sense to complain about the lack of gameplay, but it must be said that Necrobarista severely limits any interaction on the part of the player, even by the standards of visual novels or in any case of videogame stories, which have recently found particularly advanced and peculiar expressions especially in sub-genre called walking simulators. In this case we find ourselves taking a step back, returning to the rigorously preset text, which can simply be scrolled by pressing a key without any ability to modify it. The only truly interactive moments are limited to the possibility of moving around the bar reproduced in 3D before starting a new chapter in the story, a moment in which we can activate additional memories if a sufficient number of objectives have been achieved. The latter are obtained by touching the right keywords at the end of the various chapters, thus demonstrating that you have followed the story by paying particular attention to the yellow colored terms to touch to open further insights, an expedient that appears a bit rough to insert some playful elements in the structure, even with respect to the refinement to which the title points. However, these are side elements for what is in all respects a written story, supported by a well-crafted graphic characterization that always recalls the anime through a particular use of stylized 3D in cel-shading and which also achieves very interesting, with fascinating choices such as direction and technical realization, although there is a certain variation in quality between the more advanced devices and the less performing ones. The musical accompaniment is also of a high standard, which relies on a soundtrack composed by Kevin Penkin perfectly capable of underlining the strange atmospheres of the setting and the changes of pace of the story. From a writing point of view, Necrobarista alternates between very good things and less convincing ones. The characters have different facets even if they often react like specks in the search for irony, necessary to dilute the tones of an otherwise rather dark story but which does not always produce excellent results: many dialogues force a little too much on pseudo-Japanese humour, or in some cases the moments that would like to be more philosophical and reflective seem to remain on the surface without going deep into the issues addressed. It could also be a translation problem (the game is in fact miraculously translated completely into Italian), but the writing often loses its optimal rhythm, between cumbersome moments and others that are all too diluted in only sketchy side elements or superfluous frivolities and it's a shame, given the excellent built atmosphere and the very interesting basic idea, which emerges in some truly memorable situations during the story.", "date": "2020-07-23", "grade": "7.0"}
