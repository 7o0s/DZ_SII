Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out a single cent. When the kingdom in which he lives is suddenly attacked by mysterious hordes of evil mutants, the knight Roland doesn't think twice: he jumps on the back of his faithful dragon and sets off on a mission to counter the advance of the enemy, trying to understand what triggered this tremendous threat. During the adventure he will be able to count not only on the magical support of the young cleric Charlotte, but also on other companions who will gradually join the group, starting with the wizard Alphonse and the shrewd thief Bright Moon. Told through nice dialogues in English, the plot of Fantasy Adventure does not deviate from the traditional canons of Japanese RPGs, however there are many differences between the Userjoy title and classic-style productions such as the various Zenonias, starting with the structure and passing through the gameplay. In fact, the latter uses the typical RTS mechanics, practically eliminating the exploratory phases and any random fights in favor of a real-time approach very similar to the one seen in the recent Ghostbusters tie-in. During each mission, party characters are spread out across the stage, while enemies arrive from various corners of the screen in waves to attack them. Our warriors automatically strike the closest target, but it is possible to direct their actions in two ways: by drawing a line that goes from the character to his target or by touching first one and then the other. A figure like that of Charlotte, who cannot defend herself but only heal her allies, must naturally be safeguarded and moved away from the fray, while Roland and the others can target the most difficult creatures together to eliminate them quickly, in a sequence of combos and spectacular special moves, the functioning of which is regulated by the inevitable cooldown. The Amazing World of Paul Fantasy Adventure boasts very pleasant graphics, with polygonal models characterized by a beautiful design and fluid animations, which move within two-dimensional scenarios full of colors even if without any interactable elements beyond some boxes to destroy. The campaign consists of sixty increasingly complex levels, in which it soon becomes essential to plan one's actions and make some important choices, also and above all between one mission and another. Using the coins earned on the field, it is in fact possible to upgrade the characters' weapons, make their armor more resistant and buy extra items such as rings and magical clothes, capable of influencing speed and offensive capacity, as in any self-respecting RPG. When the allies become many, it is also necessary to proceed with the composition of the party on the basis of our needs and the approach to the game, but also keeping in mind the characteristics of the opponents we are going to face. Any chaos generated by the presence of different characters in a relatively small portion of the screen is mitigated by the precision of the touch controls, which are particularly reactive, but this is clearly not enough to effectively compensate for one of the limitations of this production: the intrinsic repetitiveness of the action. However, it is surprising that a game of this quality, almost completely free of IAPs (coins can be purchased, of course, but those earned in battle are generally enough to continue), is distributed free of charge on the App Store. It may be that in the more advanced stages things become more complicated for those who want to enjoy the experience without putting their hands on their wallets, but we are talking literally hours before this happens.", "date": "2013-02-23", "grade": "7.6"}
