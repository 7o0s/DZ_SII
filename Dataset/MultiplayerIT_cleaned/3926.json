{"name": "SEGA Mega Drive Classics", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/SEGA-Mega-Drive-Classics-recensione-switch.html", "text": "Retro gaming seems to live strong and vibrant in 2018. After the incredible success of the Nintendo editions of Mini NES and Mini SNES, the sparkling return of Crash and Spyro and the landing on the shelves of Playstation Classic, gamers seem to have rediscovered the pleasure to savor the great classics, both in their remastered versions and in updated and revised versions to keep up with the times. SEGA Mega Drive Classics then tries to place itself in the middle, proposing a large group of highly appreciable titles and at the same time inserting filters and methods to make some productions that are still struggling to be fresh today more usable. Deciding the quality of a collection of this type only from the quantity and genre of games included is substantially impossible for a reviewer, given that the tastes of individual buyers must direct the final verdict. In short, if Altered Beast hadn't convinced you at the time of its launch, it certainly won't do it today, and if Sonic really can't stand it because you see him as Mario's eternal rival, it would still be useless to praise the work done on this specific collection. . So let's try to distance ourselves from personal tastes for individual video games and give an opinion on the work itself, on the variety offered and on the new features. A collection from another era Also on Nintendo Switch, as it had already been for the other versions, your spartan 90s bedroom will welcome you, an impractical HUB to select the game modes, choose the cartridge to insert in the virtual Mega Drive, listen to the soundtracks and take a look at the many filters available to enhance and smooth out the rough edges of the pixels. There really is something for all tastes, starting from the obvious possibility of playing with perfect replicas of your favorite titles or sweetening them with a bilinear pixel resizing, using the algorithm created by Eric Johnston for Lucas Arts or even exploiting HQ4X or the gorgeous XBR which itself smooths out sharp edges and adjusts aliasing providing a smoother version of the old blockbuster heroes we grew up with. And playing in this way, perhaps taking advantage of the 16:9 ratio and the scan lines, is sublime especially if we think that in portability Nintendo Switch is simply perfect in keeping your memories intact. You can run at breakneck speed with Sonic and Sonic II, or play with the hilarious Sonic Pinball. Shooting in space with the second chapter of Space Harrier or fighting with white weapons and bare hands in the Golden Ax and Streets of Rage trilogies or racking your brain with Columns and Columns 3. The package offered is therefore well varied and able to satisfy the needs of most gamers. In short, there are some of the greatest classics of the 16-bit era of the Mega Drive but there are also some rather rare pearls to be found in these mega collections, such as Alien Soldier, Light Crusader, Gunstar Heroes or the Phantasy Star series, rpg by sure value that deserve to be played by fans of the genre. Then the serious absences are causing a sensation (some dictated by mere licensing issues) but a real collection cannot be defined as such without Out Run and the wonderful Disney games, with the Lion King, Hercules and Aladdin loudly screaming revenge for not being able to enter the package of these 53 titles. The lack of Ecco the Dolphin or Road Rash is also surprising given the importance these titles have had in the past, especially when compared to some games inserted in their place: in short, there is still to wait for the definitive collection. Unlike the other versions for home hardware, playing with Switch in portable mode brings the console closer to the old Game Gear and looking at the catalog, even the comparison with the Game Tigers wouldn't be so bizarre. To add a little freshness there is an interesting feature thanks to which you can accelerate the game speed or rewind for a few seconds to avoid a stupid death or being forced to redo the level for the umpteenth time due to a jump hard missed. Solution that we appreciate and that could help completionists who, even here, will be able to pursue some dedicated achievements made inexplicably only for some titles and not for the entire collection. There are also leaderboards and also the possibility of joining multiplayer games, perhaps superfluous given the difficulty with which matchmaking works and the bad net code.", "date": "2018-11-28", "grade": "7.5"}
