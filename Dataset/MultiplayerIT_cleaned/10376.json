On the occasion of the long-awaited release of Assassin's Creed II, Ubisoft tries again, however, entrusting the development of this second spin-off to Griptonite Games: let's say right away that the result doesn't really make you cry out for a miracle but it is still a step forward... The little creed of a little killer Naturally also the protagonist of Assassin's Creed II: Discovery is Ezio Auditore and a large part of the adventure is set in our peninsula: Ezio, who from the beginning clarifies how his ultimate goal is revenge against Rodrigo Borgia for killing of his family, he will have to carry out missions on behalf of the thieves guild and its customers who are intertwined with the search for the Apple of Eden and the political plots that poisoned Italy in those years. The plot of Discovery is totally stand-alone and adds very little to the narrative arc proposed by the version for the major consoles, instead it tries to deepen the character of Ezio and his behavior but he does it in a rather clumsy way through decidedly trivial dialogues and a rather vague plot. In reality, the story turns out to be more of a pretext to offer the player a series of stages to be tackled in sequence by making use of Ezio's main skills: the murderous technique and the ability to hide. In this sense, Assassin's Creed II: Discovery succeeds where Altair's Chronicles completely failed: while radically changing the nature of the game, it maintains the distinctive features of the series as crucial, without distorting it too much in the transition to the portable format. The problem is that it does so rather frustratingly. Ezio Auditore and the secret rings Nothing to say about the level design, definitely inspired: while abandoning free-roaming and instead embracing the typical side-scrolling of the most common two-dimensional platformers, the developers of Griptonite Games have managed to make the various levels quite complex and intricate between platforms, alleys blinds and walls to climb. The stages always offer multiple paths and from this point of view you can't complain about the variety, moreover the locations are completely polygonal and, consequently, while maintaining a fixed side view, the illusion of a large 3D world is quite convincing . Ezio darts from one point to another almost like Sonic the hedgehog, leaping acrobatically between rooftops and showing off really fluid animations: the care taken in the realization of Ezio far exceeds that placed in the modeling of his enemies and the scenarios, which have in common a remarkable poverty of details. The missions in which we will embark essentially require to reach a certain destination avoiding as much as possible being discovered by the guards on the way: they can be avoided by taking advantage of the canonical barrels or carts full of hay in which to hide to wait for them to turn their backs on us before deliver a single lethal attack. In the unfortunate event that you are discovered, you have two options: fight or flight. The combat system reproduces the clashes of the console version in a rather elementary way: Ezio can attack, parry and counterattack... that's all. In reality, combat should be a last resort in Assassin's Creed II: Discovery, as at the end of a stage you are rewarded more for guards avoided than for those you defeat. The rank that is assigned to us based on our performance is practically the optional challenge of the game which, being rather short, encourages the user to replay the levels to get the maximum score, find some hidden objects and tear up all the Wanted posters ( in which, however, you can replace Ezio's face with a photo of your own if you own a Nintendo DSi). Unfortunately, the clumsy attempt to bring the mechanics of Assassin's Creed II back to the Nintendo DS by reducing them to the format of a cartridge has its problems: mainly, the game turns out to be extremely repetitive. Most of the time you proceed in ~stealth~ mode to try to locate enemies, wait for them to turn around and kill them in an instant by triggering a bloody three-dimensional animation; the fights are extremely simple and repetitive due to the few skills available and the entire game-design is reduced to running and jumping back and forth without caring too much about the opponents, guided by bizarre luminous rings that show us the way forward.
