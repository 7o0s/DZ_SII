{"name": "Il filo che ci unisce", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/163149-unravel-il-filo-che-ci-unisce.html", "text": "~No man is an island~ is a popular passage from a poem by John Donne, the meaning of which refers to the connections that every human being establishes in the course of his existence with other people, and to the importance that each of us has to inside altogether. Unravel finds its foundation precisely by telling of the bonds of love and affection in the context of a family, through the happy, bitter or melancholy memories of an elderly lady with more road behind her than the one in front. An original theme, developed by the Swedish Coldwood Interactive team: a name unknown to most, despite the fact that it is a studio that has been in business since 2003 with a curriculum of rather modest titles, mostly sports-themed related to disciplines such as alpine skiing , snowmobile racing and more recently with a focus on Sony's motion sensors (The Fight - Lights Out and Move Fitness for PlayStation 3). Unravel is therefore to all intents and purposes the first real test case with a work capable of gaining the attention of the general public, moreover with the important involvement of Electronic Arts in the role of publisher. Unravel is a beautiful game, graphically splendid, which however lacks the spark of the great masterpieces Memories and ties Unravel is a physics-based platform adventure starring Yarny, a puppet made entirely of red string. A symbolism aimed at underlining precisely those bonds mentioned above, which are ideally crossed by the creature along a total of a dozen levels. They are accessed through the central area, which is nothing but part of the old lady's home: a couple of rooms to be precise, in the living area, between a table, a stove and a piano. A house like many others, with classic furnishings, where frames find space between shelves and desks, each of them with a photograph that represents an important moment lived in the past. Yarny can then enter those images, to then be transported into those same settings. From this point of view, Unravel certainly does not lack variety: if the first level takes place in the garden outside the house, in spring, with the vibrant beauty of northern European nature, you can then find yourself in the middle of swamps, mountains, landfills and so on, perhaps no longer in the warm warmth of April but in the downpour of a gloomy and disturbing night, or in the candid and aseptic charm of a snowy winter. If it is true that, at first glance, the Coldwood Interactive title may recall a masterpiece of the genre such as Limbo, it doesn't take much to realize how Unravel intends to offer greater dynamism and a superior frenzy in its game rhythm, which knows how to alternate sudden accelerations in moments of excited action (perhaps clinging to a kite at the mercy of the wind or aboard a log like a sled on the snow) alongside heavy braking with more elaborate puzzles that require greater reflection. Yarny is also endowed with a unique characteristic, namely the ability to use the very thread of which it is composed as a kind of lasso to cling to certain suitably marked objects. If the most banal function of all this is climbing towards otherwise inaccessible areas, descending from excessive heights or swinging like a new Tarzan from one hold to another, equally important is the use of the wire to pull elements such as levers or branches, creating a further and precious level of interaction with the environment. In addition, the protagonist can also tie two nearby objects or holds, perhaps to create trampolines, useful for extending the amplitude of the jumps, or even to create walkways through which to transport key elements from one place to another. The last aspect to consider is the fact that Yarny, in his journey through the levels, is forced to leave behind him a ~trace~ of thread which, as from a skein, is in fact taken from his own body. In practice, this means that the character has limited ~autonomy~ before finding himself in the condition of a skeleton unable to take even one more step. The solution to the problem are balls, strategically placed within the settings: their collection, practically obligatory, allows both to restore the amount of thread available to Yarny, and to act as a checkpoint. It is an intelligent and stimulating game design idea, but unfortunately partially spoiled by a non-optimal implementation: there are really rare occasions in which the lack of thread represents a real problem, and throughout the course of the adventure we it has only happened a handful of times that we have to retrace our steps forrecover some of the precious fiber and rethink the path to follow in order to continue. Playstation 4 trophies Unravel has a total of 24 trophies: 10 bronze, 8 silver, 7 gold and obviously the inevitable, highly coveted platinum. You go from completing content to particular skill challenges, such as running an entire level without ever dying. For platinum it is required to collect all previous ones. Jumps and puzzles A concept, that of not fully exploited potential, which in reality we find ourselves reflecting on on other occasions when playing Unravel. The title of Coldwood Interactive has been repeatedly compared to Limbo as regards the game model, but unfortunately in the fundamental component of the level design we certainly cannot find the same quality that made Playdead's seminal effort shine. In fact, having overcome the curiosity and enthusiasm of the first lines, one inevitably finds oneself facing a scenario destined to repeat itself constantly, with only rare variations. In essence, the main problem is that each level presents an all too linear development, in which situations that require the same solution are excessively repeated. Specifically, the binomial ~create a trampoline / move an object from here to there possibly making a ramp of wire~ is proposed with such a frequency as to make the practice almost mechanical, very rarely applied to actually stimulating situations. A trivialization of the progression that is interrupted only once or twice for each stage, in the face of the presence of more complex puzzles that actually require a much welcome greater effort capable of interrupting the player's mental torpor. It is on these occasions that Unravel shows its best, and although there is some ingenuity and a fluctuating quality of the puzzles. The general impression, however, is that the EA production finds in the dualism between its platform component and the puzzle component more of a limit than a real advantage: in fact, the first is not brilliant enough to involve, the second too rarefied and inconstant to leave a mark time to sum up. Even the control system does not help to adequately support the more dynamic passages, due to a certain sponginess and a poor reactivity and reliability, which can weigh especially when you have to move quickly from one hold to another. But if Unravel has managed to generate all this interest since its presentation during the last E3 it is basically thanks to the graphics component, which undoubtedly represents the most valuable element of the entire package. The attention to detail and care in the modeling of each element that makes up the micro world of Yarny is nothing short of remarkable: transported into the perspective of a twenty-centimeter puppet, you find yourself rediscovering nature from a different point of view , where a bench represents a huge obstacle, or a pond must be overcome using apples as an improvised walkway, or where crabs and moles are fearsome monsters from which it is better to stay away. If Pikmin comes to mind thinking about all this, know that you are certainly not the only ones. The extraordinary beauty of the ~normality~ of the environment inspired by northern Sweden permeates the whole adventure with a particular charm, fully expressed both in an artistic and technical key. And if initially light and colors seem to dominate, later melancholy and gray also find space, in a remarkable variety of situations. The game was developed using Sony's PhyreEngine, the one also used in Flower and Journey, which has been updated and developed since its launch in 2008, proving to be perfectly suitable also for adequately exploiting current-gen platforms. Unravel can be beautiful, beautiful, like when a snowstorm whitens Yarny's bright red in a realistic way, or when the water ripples and reacts credibly to stresses. All at 1080p and 60 frames per second fixed and stable. Our only perplexity is linked to the choice of adopting a very shallow depth of field, which in practice makes all the elements of the seabed just further away from the plane on which the action develops out of focus. The sound component, on the other hand, is less convincing: Yarny does not speak or make any noise, a fully understandable stylistic choice, but in general even the sound effects of the game world are set aside, rather leaving the center of the scene to the musical accompaniment. The latter is composed of perfectly themed instrumental pieces, which however tend to repeat themselves excessively to the point of potentially annoyingire the player. Finally, as regards longevity, 5-6 hours are sufficient to complete all the levels, then leaving the collection of hidden buttons as the only replayability factor.", "date": "2016-02-08", "grade": "8.0"}
