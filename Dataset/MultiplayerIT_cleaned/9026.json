However, the excellent results obtained do not seem to have made the publisher-developer duo go crazy, who, on the contrary, eager to confirm themselves again this year, spared no efforts during the development phase of the 2012 edition. The start of the challenge NBA 2K12, we say it right away, although not revolutionary under any aspect in particular, still improves the playability of its predecessor, expanding some aspects in order to further increase the value of an offer that wants to be richer in content than ever and able to make users relive the beauty of this sport in its entirety. The beating heart of the production is, as always, the Association mode, which this year is enriched with new functions and extended to the network in order to allow users to play, among other things, an entire season online with all 30 NBA teams managed by as many human players. As tradition dictates for this mode, the gamer is called upon to play the role of General Manager in a team chosen from those available in the large roster, managing it both from an administrative and technical point of view. Organizing your staff by choosing coaches, athletes and talent scouts to unleash around the USA in search of budding young champions, establishing the weekly rhythm of training, negotiating contracts, renewals and transfers taking into account the salary cap imposed by the federation, these are just some of the aspects that you need to take care of to better control your team. Of course, there is also an accurate section dedicated to the market, with further simplified management and menus, with immediate transfers, dynamic participation and an easy-to-use Find Exchanges function. In addition to what has just been described, the user can obviously also dedicate himself to the technical management of the starting quintet with the personalized creation of schemes, strategies and the ~physical~ guidance of his men during the match. My Player and the NBA Greats Another top mode of the entire production has always been the one called My Player, which returns again this year with its classic game structure, but this time with the addition of an interesting variant, the one called Create A Legend. In essence, as always, you can decide to create your own basketball alter-ego from scratch, starting from a freshman schowcase at Madison Square Garden up to the Draft, to then guide him along his climb to the top of the NBA championship. Or, alternatively, you can impersonate an athlete already known on the US basketball stage to try to make him the brightest star in the league. Great NBA Champions The substantial difference between the two options is that with the second you obviously skip the most tiring part of training and statistical evolution starting from low values, as the real player already has his basic skills by himself (in any mode you can assign up to five custom offensive plays or keep the ones they already have). In both cases, however, every action, every gesture on and off the field made by the athlete generates consequences that positively or negatively affect his career thanks to a sort of RPG-style system within the session. This takes into account a series of statistics related to relationships with the team's management, with teammates, with the public, with the press (through interviews) and even with the sponsors for the player's individual growth. In addition to the two modes mentioned above, the games included in the Great NBA Champions are added to tempt fans. As you will recall, certainly one of the most interesting novelties of the last edition of the Visual Concepts game was the brand new mode called Michael Jordan. In it the gamer could take part in a whole series of situations related to the entire career of the great phenomenon of world basketball, through a series of challenges and situations divided in turn into four distinct sessions. Well, in this 2012 edition the developers have expanded the offer, offering players fifteen of the most significant events related to the activities of as many stars of the past. In addition to the revived Jordan, it is therefore FrIt is possible to relive the exploits of Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving, Magic Johnson and many other great athletes as protagonists, in a handful of decisive matches for them. And when we talk about reliving, we mean it fully since every little detail is reproposed to the user in a very credible way: the final between the Lakers and Celtics of '64, for example, is played in black and white, as is the one between the Knicks and Lakers of '72 with a vintage television-style effect (faded colors, disturbed image) inside stadiums that reproduce those of the time and with the rules, as well as the players, including the look, obviously adapted to the context. By winning these classic challenges, the thirty plus teams involved, and their respective athletes, are unlocked. The filter gives a view similar to 80s TV Playstation 3 trophies There are fifty-one Trophies available in NBA 2K12, distributed in both single player and multiplayer modes. They are distributed as follows: 40 of Bronze, 6 of Silver, 3 of Gold and 1 of Platinum Most of the prizes are obtained with the progression in the Association mode, but there are also those that can be conquered in matches on the web, perhaps by climbing the rankings in Association mode on the internet until you win the championship, or by completing the 15 NBA Great Champions challenges or by being chosen in the 1st round of the NBA draft in My player. The match Once on the field, between the cheerleaders' dances and the director's breaks on the audience and players, complete with themed music, you get to the heart of the actual game. As soon as the game begins, in fact, the work done by the developers to smooth out the defects of the past edition immediately catches the eye, starting with the commands. In fact, these have undergone a slight restyling in order to streamline the control system and make it more accessible to everyone, so the latter is now based on a reduced number of keys and on a certain simplification in the mechanics, with almost every action governed by the right analog stick. Even in the defensive phase, where it is possible to use the aforementioned lever not only to stretch the arms but also to push the opponent. However, we must not misunderstand what has just been described: greater accessibility to the commands does not necessarily mean a simplification of the gameplay, which is always rather complex in its evolution. Proof of this is that paradoxically now there is greater control over the movements of the legs and arms of the athletes, more credible management of the ball as an element detached from the player himself and in general the feeling that what happens on the parquet is absolutely determined by the gamer. It's time to invent some plays In general, however, of refinements and improvements made to the gameplay, sometimes imperceptible immediately, there are many others. In particular, a lot of attention has been paid to the variety of game strategies and to the artificial intelligence of teammates and opponents, with the former being particularly accurate and realistic as never before in their management, in calling schemes or in changing points. dynamic game during matches, and with the seconds that thanks to the dozens of parameters that characterize them act and think in a logical and constructive way, even in positioning. Apart from a few small drools in the defensive phase on the outsides. The same goes for the coaches, capable now more than ever of knowing how to ~read~ the matches and of trying to change the course accordingly by modifying the tactics and the men at their disposal. NBA 2K12 offers, at times, a slightly more strategic style of play thanks to the further enhancement of team play, with more balance between offensive and defensive actions, a certain attention to the standing game which now integrates more choice regarding the executable actions, and the physicality. The search for physical contact, the propensity for possession of the ball, the commitment made until the end are just some of the key elements that characterize the work of the various teams. Each game consequently has its own story, because as in reality there are several factors that influence the course of events. Take a look online To train and learn each new command or movement there is the Training Camp, a specific session of the game dedicated to training. The particularity of this option is linked to the fact that the various tests to undergo, quite hard and which do not concede anything to errors, otherwise you have to start over from the beginning, are based on the specific encounter between current champions and past athletes, complete with one-on-one final challenge. Let's take a quick example: the great Michael Jordan teaches the new playerBesiktas player, Deron Williams, some of his moves and at the end of the training phase he plays against them. A break before the resumption of the match And before going to conclude by talking about the technical part, let's take a look at NBA 2K12 online. In reality it is a component that is always present in the game, so much so that registration is mandatory immediately after loading the game. This can be quite annoying in these phases, as it takes away a good half hour between data, login, password and all the rest. In our opinion, it would have been better to leave certain duties to a second phase of the game. In any case, once your account is activated for free, the player has a personal profile that is updated based on the goals achieved in the game, is displayed in the official forums, on the game homepage and can count on access to various functions, such as 2K Share, useful for sharing your creations with the whole community, always having news and statistics from the real world and the current NBA season at your fingertips when the lockdown ends, and a new feature that connects the product to the official website and major social networks. Furthermore, as mentioned at the beginning of the article, he can play in championships, an entire season as Manager/player in the Association and matches of all kinds. Speaking of the latter, we have had the opportunity to play a few games on the servers dedicated to the game, and we can say that they are more numerous and better performing than the already good ones of the past year. Like on tv From an aesthetic point of view, NBA 2K12 does not seem to revolutionize the cosmetics of the series too much, in the sense that in this edition we do not see a substantial leap forward or clear differences compared to what was already appreciated last year, which was not bad by the way . Mostly it is in fact finishing touches, touch-ups here and there, which can be seen above all on the faces of the athletes, even more detailed and similar to their real counterparts, on their tattoos and even in details such as their hair or the copious perspiration flowing from their foreheads . The models are then drawn and animated quite well, and like the physics of the clashes and the ball, these are the elements that have been subject to major changes. The graphics have undergone a few tweaks, but good ones In fact, the movements were not simply recorded in motion capture as was the case in the past, but they involved several different shots, from time to time, depending on the position and physiognomy of who was involved in the ~capture~ work. It is not for nothing that many of the athletes have custom animations, unique strokes and movements. The sphere itself is independently simulated, so it reacts as you would expect it to in any situation. Even if there are still some flaws, in principle there is nothing to complain about. As if to further underline the realism of the production, Visual Concepts has worked closely with realities such as the TNT Sports network to create more televised introductions to matches both from a point of view of camera movements and overlays and from that of animation outline: there is information that appears on the screen identical to that of a real television production of the NBA, statistics and cameras more adherent to cable broadcasts. The atmosphere surrounding the game event itself is also beautiful, on the field, where a lively audience that changes during the game interacts with what is happening on the parquet, specific introductory scenes for the playoffs and finals and much more. All seasoned with an excellent level audio sector that can count on sound effects, music, announcements and various slogans sampled directly from the various American arenas, and the usual and complete beautiful commentary in English, which this year sees the addition to the voices historians of the commentators also that of Steve Kerr, former player, general manager and commentator of the old NBA Live. It should be highlighted the fact that during the games of the NBA Great Champions mode the sound is disturbed and with tones similar to what one would have watching a television broadcast from the past. Finally, the soundtrack is excellent, characterized mainly, as per tradition, by Rap and Hip Hop tunes.", "date": "2011-10-12", "grade": "9.5"}
