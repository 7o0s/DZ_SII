{"name": "Warhammer: Mark of Chaos - Battle March - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-mark-of-chaos-battle-march-recensione.html", "text": "It has now been a year since the arrival of Warhammer: Mark of Chaos, a real-time strategy set in the warlike universe of Games Workshop. The title has been able to carve out a certain group of admirers thanks to the charisma of the setting in all its splendor, and to an interesting gameplay. Battle March is the first expansion for Namco's strategy, which now also arrives for Xbox 360, including the base game (essential for the PC version). The events narrated in this episode see humans cornered against the powerful armies of Chaos, but from the east a fearsome new army made up of an alliance of Orcs and Goblins advances dangerously, tragically undermining the balance of the conflict and making the situation even more uncertain. However, a mysterious faction works in the shadows, intending to favor the advance of the orcs for reasons that will be revealed during the missions. There is no peace in Warhammer The new campaign puts the player initially in command of two orc heroes, such as a warrior and a powerful shaman, engaged in a sequence of very varied and challenging missions. Unlike other strategic ones, the collection of resources and the production of units is completely missing here, even if during some missions it will be possible to aggregate new teams of warriors, but these are completely scripted events. Also it is not allowed to save during the missions, but only at the completion of each one. The impossibility of being able to save forces the player to carefully consider every single move, above all by opting for medium-high degrees of difficulty. Fortunately, the title offers a certain depth of gameplay and allows you to manage not only the formations, but also the speed of movement, morale and skills of the heroes, which in the most frantic battles assume crucial importance in the economy of the clashes. The practical camera management (completely free), allows you to always enjoy the best view. The gameplay provides for the control of entire squads of units, making the management of troops in battle more streamlined and practical, especially on Xbox 360. In addition to the standard troops, there are the inevitable heroes, who accumulate experience and level up during battles. battles, thus accessing ever more powerful abilities. The survival of the hero represents a fundamental aspect especially during the campaign, given that in case of premature death it will be necessary to restart the mission. The mechanics of the clashes is based on the classic stone-scissors-paper, with lethal units against others, but very disadvantageous against still others. To tell the truth, the infantry units generally appear as the most versatile ones, capable of adapting to almost all enemies, even if in the most agitated battles, their effectiveness decreases due to the impossibility of making all the units fight during the clashes. Spectacular battles The best approach during the many missions involves identifying enemy forces, sending armored units forward, supporting them with archers and wizards to inflict damage safely. The presence of other types of units such as siege, flying or cavalry units makes the battles decidedly varied and profound, also given that sending your own troops into disarray is a tactic that does not pay off in the long run, given that finding yourself with a small number of units, can compromise the final stages of a mission or even the entire campaign. At the end of each mission, it will be possible to pop into the camp, in order to swell the ranks of your troops, acquire equipment for the heroes and upgrade weapons and armor. To do this it is necessary to use gold, which can be found during missions and as a bonus upon completing them. In all cases, even playing on the lowest of the three difficulty levels, you never have enough resources to do everything you want, forcing the player to make choices. In all cases, starting the next mission, you can only take a limited number of troops with you. Respectable longevity Longevity in Battle March settles on rather high values, given the presence of a good number of mini-campaigns, composed on average of 5-6 missions. Apart from some particular cases, these are all sequential and prevent, for example, attacking one outpost first rather than another. Those who have the Xbox 360 version, in addition to the unpublished campaign, will also be able to benefit from those of Mark of Chaos, for a respectable final number of hours. In addition to the campaigns, it is possible to play classic custom battles and of course play contro other real-life users both on LAN and online. The possibility of being able to choose between 9 different sides (but not totally different from each other), guarantees rather varied battles. All the charm of the Warhammer universe Although a year has passed since the release of the first episode, the graphics of Battle March are decidedly current both on PC and on consoles, thanks above all to an optimization of the game engine, which at its inception appeared a bit jerky even on powerful machines. In addition to the mere graphic quality, the game is distinguished by an atmosphere and detail capable of making the happiness of strategy and miniatures enthusiasts. The outlines of the settings as well as the characters appear deliberately blurred and this gives the game a particular charm. Bringing the camera closer then, you can admire well-made units and equally well-characterized in terms of clothing and style. Only by admiring the battles from a very close distance is it possible to fully enjoy the beauty of the battles, which appear bloody at the right point, with different units and excellent animations. The special effects relating to the heroes' powers also look good, with shock waves and distortion that are really nice to see. A small note should be made to the loading times, which on the test configuration well exceed one minute. The audio is another rather successful aspect, with well-characterized voices (subtitled in Italian) and well-finished dialogues. Comment Warhammer: Battle March is an excellent expansion for Mark of Chaos, which while not introducing significant innovations, however guarantees an original and at the same time streamlined game structure, capable of satisfying those who have already dabbled with the base game in one fell swoop , and Xbox 360 users, who will take home both episodes. The graphics and the charisma of the title are also excellent, penalized by loading times that are sometimes too invasive.
