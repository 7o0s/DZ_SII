{"name": "Super Meat Boy Forever", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-meat-boy-forever-recensione.html", "text": "Ten years ago we enthusiastically reviewed Super Meat Boy, an indie video game that made history for having almost reached perfection between level and game design (not reaching it simply because, we know, said perfection does not exist): satisfied to have found ourselves in front of one of the most complete and well-finished spokesmen of the independent panorama, we could only betray the same expectation in front of Super Meat Boy Forever. Since its announcement, the sequel developed by Team Meat has brought with it all the expectations that its predecessor has grown and matured over the years and, after playing it, we can confirm once again that we are in a well-crafted job. brutally difficult experience? We can tick it off the list. A sought-after artistic direction? This is there too. Content that goes beyond the story, providing hours of entertainment? What questions, they could not miss. An experience that follows the crazy, hilarious and fun odyssey of ten years ago? Well, this is where the first differences emerge, if not the more substantial ones that make it a sequel and at the same time a new territory in which to experiment. As a platformer, here we are catapulted into an endless runner made up of procedurally generated levels, whose fragments are taken from a deposit of a hundred pieces to then be stitched together in a game where replayability is king. A convincing solution? Find out in our Super Meat Boy Forever review. The story: looking for Nugget Team Meat has geared up as far as the story is concerned, in this sequel: we wander around the sixty minutes of footage which, put together, tell the new misadventure of Meat Boy and his girlfriend Bandage Girl, ready to face any danger in order to save his little son Nugget - kidnapped by Dr. Fetus, who doesn't want to leave our heroes alone. Obviously the plot is not the core of the game, which focuses on many other aspects to make it its strengths, but there is no denying how much it works in its absurdity. In its simplicity, the narrative opens up to unexpected twists and turns that, precisely because of their weirdness, manage to hit the mark: they never take themselves seriously and it is this lightness that makes everything absolutely enjoyable. There are also several special looks towards the video game cults, this more in the gameplay phases, which make Super Meat Boy Forever a continuous - but never too heavy - tribute to the past. The gameplay: more frantic and procedural We have to admit it, the idea of an endless runner game didn't see us entirely in favor already at the time because it betrayed, quite clearly, the initial mobile nature of the title. Tested by hand it managed to convey a sense of genuine fun and a level of challenge that will still please hardcore gamers, however this change of course has left us with the feeling that Super Meat Boy Forever has deprived itself of some aspects without being able to fully fill its gaps. In the previous chapter, each screen was essentially a well-crafted and wonderfully inflexible death trap, to the point of making each death one more incentive to demonstrate our prowess. The urgency, after ten years, to revolutionize but not entirely respect to the original formula is an approach that although we understand - after all, the panorama has evolved and enriched also thanks to SMB - we have not been able to fully embrace: it is no longer a question of ingenuity, not only, but above all of reflexes and a frantic trial and error that often ends in frustration over the six hours or so it takes to complete the main story. This is if you are not aiming for 100%, otherwise the time could double without major problems. The same commands have been simplified and reduced and only two, to which we will rely to overcome spikes, rotating blades, lasers, in short, any obstacle between us and the little Nugget. An experience in which to dive straightaway, which in any case does not skimp on the difficulty and the need that have always been the pillars of Super Meat Boy: in the specific case, however, not having full control of the character often pushes towards a commitment based more on timing and on memory, rather than on actual skill - with rather deleterious effects on the overall difficulty, particularly during some boss fights. These are situations that require perfect execution down to the last pixel for it to be successful, resulting in finding yourself redoing a piece over and over and over again. Let me be clear, it is not the live, die and repeat that frightens us, but the fact that we have to submit to certain defeats for a will superior to ours.As written above, while understanding and in a certain sense appreciating the will to want to detach itself from the previous game, the direction taken by Super Meat Boy Forever deprives it in some ways of that charm that distinguished it ten years ago. In spite of very well structured bosses, which represent the culmination of a relentless and helpless gameplay, or a general staging superior to SMB... we simply lack learning to know the levels one by one, perfecting our times after getting familiar with the evil mind of developers and improve ourselves without any outside pressure. Not only that, in our opinion, the procedural levels deprive the game of that compelling quality and replayability that distinguished the 2010 game. Or rather, it is a different concept of replayability, which aims above all to offer different experiences from time to time rather than on the same levels, in the constant search for the best way out. Infinite lives and a high number of checkpoints, necessary in a game that is partly out of our control, also make it more accessible - something that may not appeal to most players hardcore. To close, the PC version is undoubtedly well optimized and has no bugs or glitches of any kind, but we could not help but notice a slight delay in command input during the most agitated phases: a problem that will be resolved very soon via patch, which you need to be aware of though.", "date": "2020-12-26", "grade": "8.0"}
