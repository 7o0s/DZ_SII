Gungriffon is a first person shooter. Gungriffon is a combat mech simulator. Gungriffon is also a game with strategic elements. A mix rarely seen in the world of video games, excluding the dear old Capcom ~Tekki~ which in some ways could resemble him (except that he needed a mammoth controller). This fourth chapter of Gungriffon is developed as usual by GameArts (historic Japanese team already author of the Lunar and Grandia series), but this time published by Tecmo. ~Blaze~ was a good chapter for Gungriffon. A great game that subdued Armored Core 2 in every aspect except longevity. It went almost unnoticed by the general public on PlayStation2. Perhaps this is one of the reasons that prompted the Japanese software house to focus on the Xbox market, which software sales are proceeding very well, where there is also less internal competition between the outgoing titles. Gungriffon is a combat mech simulator. Gungriffon is also a game with strategic elements The Mechs are back to do damage! The game view is subjective, the screen of our TV represents neither more nor less the cockpit of the Mech we are driving. Available weapons, radar, energy, damage. Everything is displayed simultaneously on screen, in a way that is very reminiscent of Samus Aran's view of Metroid on GameCube, and for this reason every aspect of our Robot is constantly monitored. You switch weapons on the fly by pressing the left trigger, and shoot with the right one. Gungriffon is practically a first-person shooter, with some differences. The jump does not exist, but you can however take flight with a certain time limit in order to stay in the air. An indicator placed at the bottom indicates when and how much the Mech's turbines can be exploited to fly and stay in flight. As in the best games of the genre on consoles, the movement is delegated to the left analog, while the right one is intended for the rotation of the view. Using and coordinating both at the same time it will be possible to perform lateral strafes, circle enemy Robots while we take them with missiles in the face, or take quick glances in a stealthy way beyond hills and mountains, where the enemy lurks silently. 32-bit generation.. Gungriffon Allied Strike has the same game mechanics as the first chapter that appeared almost ten years ago now. Mission structure. This time there are 13, against the 6 of the old chapter for PlayStation2. Evidently the criticisms have come and been heard. There are two difficulty levels: easy and normal. The problem is that the difficulty of the missions has not been balanced well at all, and we will soon be faced with semi-impossible levels, only to finish others in five minutes. Moreover, the progress in the story does not offer any sort of powerup, incentive, selectable weapon unlocked more. The only thing we could use is another Mech model, even if unfortunately not ~different~ in terms of characteristics, but only in terms of aesthetics. In short, too little. The game can even last 7-8 hours due to some really difficult, not to say frustrating, passages. The best of Gungriffon Allied Strike lies in those missions where it is necessary to escort a transport truck, or where an allied base has to be defended. When playing defense, there is no shortage of satisfaction. Mech friends will be close to us to give us support against the enemy. The primary weapons are the cannon and the machine gun (with bullets of various diameters), the secondary ones are the laser or infrared research ATMs and the cluster RGPs, useful for bombing while we are in flight. The choice of the type of weapons takes place after the briefing, just before starting the game. The best of Gungriffon Allied Strike lies in those missions where it is necessary to act as an escort 32-bit generation.. Online play, included in this chapter, is perhaps the biggest incentive to play Gungriffon Allied Strike. It is possible to participate in sessions of 8 players in Deathmatch, or to do the whole ~Campaign~ mode cooperatively, with a friend, just like it was done with Halo 2, but over the network. During Live sessions it is normal to come across numerous frame rate drops, which added to those caused by the graphics engine, certainly do not offer the player a good show. The game view, already in itself not at all deep, undergoes a further shortening of the horizon. In short, this feature could and should have been treated better. Another sore point of this game dates back to the technical implementation. If, as previously mentioned, the game mechanics remain those of the past, even the aesthetic care is like thisbland enough to make Allied Strike feel like a first generation title. There are several graphic defects, ranging from poorly defined textures, to low polygon count, from the short visual horizon, to drops in frame rate even in very calm situations, passing through the animations of the uncertain Machs (beautiful, however, those of the Spiders ) up to the aforementioned problems while playing online. However, the well-chosen chromatic choices and the numerous effects inserted such as the particle ones of the explosions and the ground that flies when we move, make the game pleasant at times even if it is technically backward. The sound is very good, with very punchy effects such as machine guns, engines, flight, explosions and footsteps as enemies approach. Comment The solid and navigated gameplay is always that of Gungriffon and lovers will certainly appreciate it. This new chapter brings with it several defects, however, starting with the poor graphic cosmetics that on a machine like Xbox it is legitimate and proper not to expect nowadays. The advantage of finally having a satisfactory longevity is also undermined by the poor balance of the difficulty that goes from frustrating to child's play, in rigorous order scattered among the 13 levels, without inducing the player to want to continue due to the lack of any incentive or endgame bonus. Finally, the online game is a lot of fun, but it puts a strain on the graphics engine code written for this Allied Strike. Every problem already seen in the single game is thus amplified by the game on the net, nullifying part of the advantages it brings. The foundations for a great game were all there, and for the most part they have been betrayed, both for fans of the series and for everyone else. Pros: Much longer than its predecessors It's always nice to be inside an armored Mach Cons: Creepy technical realization... Badly exploited online game No incentives, bonuses or extras to unlock Preparing to judge a game that has entered our hearts for years is difficult. It changes the perspective from which we look at it, and through which we make our criticisms. Those who were lucky enough to love and play the first two chapters of Gungriffon on Sega Saturn will certainly see this brand new Xbox chapter with a different eye. Passing through the ~Blaze~ of PlayStation2, which has certainly not gone down in gaming history, we have finally arrived at Allied Strike for the Microsoft console, which brings with it several new features and modes that could undoubtedly make every fan of the genre happy .
