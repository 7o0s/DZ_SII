{"name": "Spider-Man 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spider-man-3-recensione-3.html", "text": "A front page hero This version of Spider-Man 3 also follows the plot of the film, but is not limited to it, introducing other additional themes and strands, taken directly from the comic. As in the versions for other consoles, the story completely includes the events of the film, having as pivotal points the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane, the new Goblin, the Sandman and above all Venom, but this does not exclude the presence of additional missions that they expand the story by giving it more breadth, and above all by justifying a necessary lengthening of the duration of the game, compared to the film. In all we find about 20 missions to carry out, plus another 40 minor challenges and tests to complete: it doesn't take much, to tell the truth, to conclude the main storyline of the game, which can be completed in about 6 or 7 hours, but the various additional modes and minor challenges can be used as a good incentive to resume the game anyway, once it's over. The structure of this version is fundamentally different from the others, but the same organization remains, as regards the selection of objectives: obviously, it would have been difficult to insert the GTA-style sandbox structure, which characterizes the homonymous games for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, in the Nintendo DS cartridge, but somehow we find here the same free approach to the various missions of the other editions. A stylized map of Manhattan allows you to move between the districts of the famous island of New York, and within these it is possible to freely roam the streets or follow the marked objectives. In the pivotal moments of the plot, the narration takes place through semi-static images, such as pages of the Daily Bugle that scroll on the screens illustrating the various scenes, while the spoken dialogues report roughly the same exchanges that characterize the film. A game with touch What amazes about this Vicarious Visions title is the extensive use of the touch screen, which becomes a fundamental element of the gameplay. Thinking about it, it is not easy to find an action game on Nintendo DS that manages to exploit the tactile capabilities of the console to these levels, outside of titles specifically designed according to the feature or Touch! Generations games. Unexpectedly, Spider-Man 3, while remaining extremely faithful to the dictates of the scrolling fighting game-platformer, manages not only to introduce the touch screen element well, but rather to make it fundamental in the structure of the game, an integration that is rarely found between games of the genre on the Nintendo DS. The protagonist of the story is obviously the Spider-Man, engaged in various missions on the streets of Manhattan or within vast structures. The action is framed in the upper screen of the console, with a particular 3D display with a mostly aesthetic function, given that the structure is solidly 2D. The main dynamic is that of the scrolling fighting game, with various additional implementations (rescuing hostages, achieving particular objectives), and platform-style developments given by the character's abilities, which can jump, climb walls, throw cobwebs and vault with them for the city. What amazes about this Vicarious Visions title is the extensive use of the touch screen, which becomes a fundamental element of the gameplay A game with touch The only keys to use are those dedicated to movement (the directional cross for right-handed, the four buttons for left-handed), everything else is entrusted to the touch screen: there are an impressive number of different moves that the protagonist can perform, and all are done through stylus movements on the lower screen. By rubbing the nib in different directions, with various angles and curvatures, Spider-Man performs all the moves of the supplied repertoire: low and high punches, kicks of various kinds, grabs, throws and throws, all executable in sequence to form devastating combos. In other situations, depending on the context, other types of movement are required, such as a quick vertical ~cut~ to load people in danger on the shoulders to be brought to safety, or similar. With the points accumulated from the performances during the game, numerous additional moves can be purchased which increase the already vast repertoire of skills of the protagonist. Of course, the control system is not perfect, there can often be a discrepancy between the move we want to make and what is actually performed on the screen, due to imperfections in the detection of the touch screen, or to errors by the user himself, who in the sessions more excited may tend to rub the stylus frantically on the screen, but the system in generalit works for her, and it's quite gratifying. We then note a certain effort on the part of the developers in trying to make the fights challenging, forcing the player to change moves with a certain frequency: the enemies are divided into various types, some are immune to certain attacks (armed ones manage to wriggle free from gripping the web, for example) which determines the need to vary the attack and defense patterns and the strategies for approaching the enemy. The boss fights occasionally vary the normal course of action with obviously more difficult fights, which require particular techniques to be discovered. During the missions, indicators indicate the presence of threats and objectives to be achieved, while a bar at the top indicates the level of ~danger~ that characterizes the situation: when it reaches the maximum, the mission has failed. Two and a half sizes The particular 3D graphic representation, which forms the background to the purely 2D structure of the game, is a choice that is not only functional, but also aesthetically apt. The polygonal models of the characters make complex animations possible more easily, and in fact both the protagonist and the supporting actors clearly benefit from it. Spider-Man, in particular, has numerous different moves, and a general look particularly in line with that of the original comic. The backgrounds appear quite complex and detailed, and it's a pleasure to see the (pre-set) rotations of the scenario as our hero whirls among the skyscrapers of Manhattan, while everything flows in a fluid continuum without uncertainties. Certainly, this is not exactly the peak achieved so far in a Nintendo DS title, in hindsight the whole graphic style is not particularly inspired, but the overall effect, in motion, is undoubtedly convincing. The audio sector has a somewhat incomprehensible musical soundtrack: a sort of collection of techno rock litanies more annoying than anything else, occasionally interrupted by fragments of the original soundtrack of the film. In general, the musical accompaniment is perhaps the weak point as regards the technical realization of the product. The sound effects are normal, while a special mention should be made to the abundant amount of dialogues and sentences sampled within the game: the cutscenes are in fact entirely spoken, and the protagonist, keeping faith with his original characterization, comments more often than not advancing through the levels with a few jokes or catchphrases, voiced directly by the actor Tobey Maguire, giving liveliness to the action. Comment Spider-Man 3 for Nintendo DS turns out to be probably the best version of all the video game adaptations for the consoles on the market. While remaining faithful to the classic scrolling fighting game structure, this Vicarious Visions product stands out not only from the other versions of the same game, but within the entire offer for the Nintendo portable, thanks to the excellent integration of the touch screen, on which the whole game comes together. Of course, it is not without flaws: the interface, while being very gratifying in the absolute intuitiveness that characterizes it, is sometimes imprecise, and tends to lose effectiveness in the most agitated phases. The structure does not add anything new to that of a classic scrolling fighting-platformer, with the limitations that this genre implies (repetitiveness first of all) and the whole game is very short, with the story mode that can be completed in less than 7 hours, and the additional options, such as the multiplayer ones (feasible only with multiple game cartridges), which represent only a faint stimulus to resume the game. However, it remains a decidedly enjoyable title, by virtue of a good technical realization, and above all of the pleasant sensation of fully controlling Spider-Man with quick and light touches of the stylus. A nice application of the potential of the Nintendo DS touch screen. Pros: Excellent tactile interface Good technical realization Playable and immediate Cons: Very short Rather repetitive Soundtrack bordering on annoying As befits a real media event, the third episode of the Spider-Man films hit the gaming industry with a plethora of different editions of the inevitable tie-in, actually collecting modest average results, even if not disastrous as often happens. The Nintendo DS version of the new adventures of the human arachnid was entrusted by Activision to Vicarious Visions, the team already responsible for the decent previous episode for the Nintendo portable. One might have expected a simple game put together a little at approxrlona, given on the one hand the technical limitations of the console (compared to what home machines are capable of, of course), and on the other hand the appealing power that a franchise like the one linked to Stan Lee's creature easily has on the public. Instead, this Spider-Man 3 for Nintendo DS turns out to be an interesting and fun game: even without reaching particular qualitative heights, perhaps, the best video game adaptation (making the necessary relationships with the different potential of the machines) of this third film chapter of Spider-Man.", "date": "2007-06-12", "grade": null}
