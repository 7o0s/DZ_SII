Since its inception, the Tecmo series has in fact stood out for its anything but tender approach to the action game genre, such as to force the player to memorize combos and defense techniques or to resign himself to a repeated game over. Team Ninja, in the person of the former leader Tomonobu Itagaki, has never made a secret of wanting to make a game that was characterized as much by the quality of the gameplay as by the difficulty of the same. All without overshadowing the technical realization, rather dedicating their efforts always and in any case in the direction of the most powerful gaming system available. It is from this point of view that the release of Ninja Gaiden Sigma for PlayStation 3 should be seen, a remake of Ninja Gaiden Black for Xbox which on the Sony console was able to enjoy remarkable technical improvements (including 1080p support) as well as various additions of value. If redesigning a game to make it jump from one generation of consoles to another takes on a clear meaning, the same ends up being lost when the transition takes place between technologically similar systems such as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with the latter now seeing precisely the release of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2. My ninja friend The queen of major demons, Elizbet, orders the Black Spider ninja to annihilate the Hayabusa clan and to take possession of the Statue of the Demon, a magical object that can allow the resurrection of the Archdemon. To stop this from happening, busty CIA agent Sonia seeks the help of the legendary Ryu Hayabusa. When he finds it, however, it seems too late: the forces of evil have made the first move, the greater demons have conquered several large cities and their power appears boundless. Ryu must therefore defeat his enemies starting from Japan and follow their tracks around the known world ... and beyond. At his disposal he has the sacred sword of the Hayabusa clan, as well as a series of very powerful weapons that will gradually become part of his arsenal. Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, in this sense, adds to the weapons already seen in the Xbox 360 version the very powerful Enma Fang, a two-handed broadsword that dwarfs even the Eclipse Scythe (i.e. the giant scythe that is obtained after defeating the powerful Volf ) and which makes boss fights much easier, given the damage that this terrifying instrument of death can do (especially when fully upgraded). For those who have played and finished Ninja Gaiden 2 on the Microsoft console, the difference is really substantial; even if it seems that this is not the only element of the gameplay to have undergone a ~filing~ to make the game more accessible. In fact, the first thing you notice about this remake are not any changes to the difficulty level, nor the sixth bra sported by all the female characters, but the lack of blood. Characteristic element of the series, the red liquid has been replaced by anonymous purplish scents that come out of our victims when we hit them, as well as completely eliminated from all the interlude sequences, in which Ryu's sharp blades seem to hit the huge bosses neither more nor unless as bludgeoning weapons. Luckily the mutilations are still in place: depending on the blow struck, we will see our adversaries lose their arms and legs and then behave accordingly, perhaps attempting extreme kamikaze attacks. At this juncture, we can perform a ~fatality~ by pressing the Triangle button, which on PS3 corresponds to a heavy attack: our character performs a violent execution which in an instant takes away the enemy on duty, whatever his tonnage. It's funny that the blood still has its original color when it smears Ryu's sword... Defeat the tyrant you will know... Even if Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is in some ways easier than the original Xbox 360 version, that doesn't mean that slicing evil ninjas and demons has become a piece of cake. Venturing into the stages and facing the various waves of opponents without knowing the basics of the combat system leads nowhere, so you have to pay close attention to the parry and evasive maneuvers, trying to hit enemies when they are vulnerable and taking advantage of every opportunity to place executions, so as to decrease the number total of the threats that surround us. Ryu's shurikens in this remake have become infinite, but there was a clear skimming in this regard and now it is only possible to use the tinormal bit (there were two additional shuriken types on the Xbox). The machine gun has also been eliminated in favor of a really powerful and effective cannon, which fires incendiary shells. The bow is also available in this version. As far as the aiming system is concerned, a clear simplification has been made which in some cases, unfortunately, is a harbinger of some problems: in the original Ninja Gaiden 2 it was necessary to aim manually, here just press the L2 backbone for our character to ~hook~ the closest target. However, since the view management hasn't been improved in any way (it often represents the ~extra enemy~ you have to deal with), there are situations in which, due to small bugs, hitting enemies becomes really difficult and frustrating (see the rainforest stage). There has been a further simplification regarding the game structure itself, i.e. the complete elimination of the difficult ~challenges~ that it was possible to face in some areas of the locations, as well as the removal of the ~keys~ needed to explore certain sections, which can now be accessed after defeating nearby ninjas. Finally, it is no longer possible to consult the map of the level to understand where to go: just press a backbone to be shown the direction in which we must move. Teamwork Among the novelties of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 there are undoubtedly the additional stages in which we control three different female characters: Momiji, Rachel and Ayane. Momiji is a charming priestess who is involved in the clash with the Black Spider clan after the kidnapping of a boy belonging to the Hayabusa clan: equipped with a powerful halberd and a bow, she can stand up to any opponent. Rachel is an old acquaintance of the series, she also has a very effective long weapon (a sort of cross between a spear and a hammer) as well as a machine gun for ranged attacks. Finally, Ayane is the pink-haired ninja who so often coerced the apprehensive Ryu to participate in the Dead or Alive tournaments. This is probably the least powerful but most agile extra character, with his daggers and explosive throwing knives. The missions that have the three girls as protagonists are set in locations we have already seen but modified for the occasion (for example we will visit Venice in the evening instead of during the day), appear shorter than the missions with Ryu and more oriented towards a challenge ~survival~ type, given the large number of opponents we will have to deal with, including bosses. Completing these extra levels then allows us to use Momiji, Rachel and Ayane also in cooperative missions, a mode that is unlocked after completing the first stage and allows us to play a level chosen from those available in the company of a second player human recruited online (or of the simple CPU). Unfortunately it is not possible to play the entire story mode in cooperative mode, and the same levels assigned to this type of experience are nothing more than fragments of the original ones, filled with enemies but with very little progression. Finally, it must be said that unlike Ninja Gaiden 2 for Xbox 360, after finishing the game we will not be able to start it all over again with the weapons and upgrades already unlocked, perhaps at a higher difficulty level, but we will have to be satisfied with replaying the levels individually. Playstation 3 trophies There are fifty-one trophies that can be obtained by playing Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2. A large part of them can be unlocked simply by learning the various secret techniques as soon as we learn their execution, after which there are those that must be conquered by eliminating a certain number of enemies (usually a thousand) through the use of a single weapon. The most valuable trophies, as usual, are obtained by successfully completing all missions and obtaining all other trophies. Technical realization The technical differences between Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 and the original Xbox 360 version of the game aren't striking, but they are there. Firstly, on the Sony console the game runs at real 720p (instead of 576p) and a fairly stable 60 fps, even if this translates into an unfortunately very marked ~tearing~ effect, especially in the stages characterized by light tones. The textures certainly appear more defined, and this is evident in particular during the interlude sequences. Color management, in general, looks better. Finally, some huge and really nice to see bosses have been added, such as the Statue of Liberty (yes), while others are been canceled altogether (see the giant worm that had to be dealt with about halfway through the game). The dialogues are subtitled in Italian and can be listened to inEnglish or Japanese. Both the sound effects and the music are excellent, the latter definitely spot on to underline the most agitated and spectacular phases. Online management, on the other hand, appears subdued: there is no great control over the game or the selection of one's partner, but at least we have not experienced problems related to lag.", "date": "2009-10-12", "grade": "8.4"}
