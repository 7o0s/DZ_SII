In reality, this game that went almost unnoticed - we only kept track of it in PC Magazine's Underground column - which could suggest a cross between The Sims and Cooking Mama, is much deeper than its author wants us to believe. In fact, if we are talking about a simulator, then the object of his interest is the real life of ordinary people, in particular those who have to struggle every day to eat, pay the rent, provide for their children and defeat the reasons for depression in ambush. You might think that these lives are rare compared to those of those who are doing quite well overall, and it is natural to think so: those who struggle to live have no time for human contact, or find it difficult to establish. They are almost invisible people. And Cart Life talks about this, about the fact that beyond the goods that are missing and the money that doesn't add up, each of the three protagonists has a desperate need to relate, not to be alone. At this point it is legitimate to ask whether it is worth playing a video game when perhaps one would just like to get distracted, experience some exciting adventure and test his skills. Question that is not easy to answer, even if we try. In the meantime, let's say that Cart Life is intense and engaging. If there's a video game where you really suffer and fight for your hero, this is it. Commander Shepard, Ezio Auditore, Agent 47: who would ever suffer for them? They are part of a myth, they have transcended the human dimension. They don't have to shave or work hard to buy a sandwich. Just as the Greek gods can damn themselves as much as they like, they are destined for immortality. However, things are different for Andrus, Melanie and Vinny. If you don't believe us, follow us and you will experience Melanie's first day in Georgetown with us. Every day the same day Melanie has just moved into her sister Rebecca's house, taking her eleven-year-old daughter Laura with her. It's a temporary arrangement. In fact, Melanie is in the middle of a divorce case and has yet to find an accommodation. Also, if you don't want to lose custody of your daughter, it would be best if you present some tangible proof that you can keep it at the first hearing with the judge. Our story with Melanie begins at night, at Rebecca's house. We confide that we want to open a kiosk. We only have two thousand dollars in our pockets, but that should be enough to start with and then, at worst, we can always pawn our watch and wedding ring, even if we want to be optimistic for now and not go that far. We go down to the kitchen and have a night snack, then a shower and bed, because tomorrow we have to get busy. Before dawn we are already out. Let's look at the city map a bit, there are many places to visit. Georgetown is a credible and diverse center. We try to do some shopping and decide to walk to save money. Alternatively we could take the bus or the taxi, but it's still five in the morning, there's no rush. Luckily we are not alone, someone is already on the road like us. We chat in the supermarket and buy some milk, sugar, an espresso machine, plastic cups and headache pills. In fact, since we got up a terrible migraine has been tormenting us, better take care of it. We pay for everything and suffer a little for the money spent, but we have to take into account the initial investment. Cheer up. Now we need a license to open the business. This time we take the bus, only in the wrong neighborhood. We ask for information, the town hall is elsewhere. Holy patience, okay. Off again by bus and here we are at the counter. You need the number, of course. It comes out on the 19th. We are at 12, but the gentleman before us has gone away so we come forward. Nothing, we have to wait. We might as well walk around and have a word, but we're too hungry and can't talk. What will we do in the town hall? We run to gobble some chips in a pub and here we are again at the counter. Number 17. The cell phone rings, it's time to pick up Laura from school. Damnation! Come on, just two numbers and we're gone. It finally comes out on the 19th, God be praised. We are about to open our mouth when the clerk informs us that the door closes. No, come on, is this a joke? We take a deep breath and run to the school, this time by taxi (5 dollars burnt) but it's too late, there's no one left. We go home by bus with dark circles under our eyes, exhausted. Rebecca lectures us on the fact that we are degenerate parents who forget about their children. Where can Laura be? We decide to call and the teacher tells usice that her father came by to get her. In fact, here he is punctual at the door. All kind and thoughtful, with that little smile of superiority. How much we would like to punch him. It goes without saying that our daughter hates us and the fact that even the next day we forget to take her to school only makes it worse, but she will understand, mom is full of fruit. Finally, however, we get the license for the kiosk, we buy a second-hand one, running out of all the money we have, and we show up for the first hearing with the judge. Our ex-husband, with his feigned availability, is obnoxious. There would be another punch in the face. The judge is sympathetic but wants to think first of Laura, who will be staying with her father for now, waiting to see the receipts for the business we are about to open. Hearing adjourned to Monday. At least we've been licensed for a decent neighborhood, so we set to work confidently. We will take Laura back with us and everything will be fine. Here is the first customer. Oops. We forgot to buy coffee. Live to work or work to live? Cart Life leaves us as unprepared as its protagonists. We just arrived in the city and we don't know anything. But this is not frustrating, on the contrary, it makes us feel even closer to our characters. Andrus is a Ukrainian immigrant who lives alone with his cat, Mr. Glembovski, in a pet-free motel. The feline is his only friend and with the limited English he speaks it is difficult for him to communicate. Andrus sells newspapers, while Vinny cooks bagels. Each has its own story, its problems, and its business. But all three characters have nightmares at night and suffer from isolation. The strength of Cart Life is the verisimilitude of its world. There are tons of people to talk to and ask about others. This creates a network of fleeting relationships that are our lifeline. And even romantic occasions happen, albeit difficult and melancholy. Hofmeier is very good at not falling into the trap of melodrama, thanks also to dry and concrete dialogues. Take for example the case of Andrus. When customers are nice to him, he has few words to express his emotions. And therefore he seems grumpy, distant. Have you ever thought the same about someone who doesn't speak Italian well? Maybe he's not hasty, he just doesn't know how to communicate. For example, Andrus translates poems on the train from Ukrainian into English for practice. Who would say that about a lonely man living in a seedy motel. At this point, however, it is also good to talk about the game mechanics, which we have left for last because they are not the reason why you could love Cart Life. Beyond the complex organization of time and money, the bulk of the action happens at work. We need to set prices and stock up on useful goods and maybe, if things go well, improve our workplace. Andrus has to unpack the newspapers and arrange them, Melanie prepares and serves the drinks and Vinny experiments with recipes to sell his bagels. When a customer asks us something we have to play timed games, for example typing without errors the sentence that appears in front of us, such as ~milk is the best drink in the world~ (unfortunately the game is in English and the typos they multiply). Finally we have to count the change and give it to the customer. And other similar mini games that change according to the character. All before the customer gets impatient and leaves. The frenzy and repetitiveness of these operations make good the kind of work our heroes do. But it is above all the graphic style of Cart Life that supports the narrative. The characters are beautifully rendered, with just a few pixels in just the right place, and their actions, from brushing their teeth to sitting at the bus stop, speak to our hearts much better than a hi-res filmed sequence. There's little to do, it's called artistic talent and Hofmeier has it in spades. The only thing he hasn't dealt with is electronic music. Songs adapted to the situation and able by themselves to evoke the atmosphere and keep the rhythm of the daily battle for life. But this is not all. There is still so much to discover: Cart Life contains three existences to be revealed (two in the free version of the game), each with its own nuances and poetry. Three noble lives, no doubt. Now it's up to you to decide if you are interested in knowing their story or if you want to move on.", "date": "2013-04-22", "grade": "8.0"}
