Right from the start, the game confirms its technical and artistic: we are talking about the most recent episodes of the franchise, after all, and the developers have taken the opportunity to focus even more on spectacularity. This is demonstrated by the incredible introductory sequence of Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, among those with the greatest visual impact in recent years, which sees Madara and Harashima collide in the mountains with blows of gigantic spiritual projections. Using extraordinarily effective solutions, far more striking than to those seen in the anime, the experience throws us into the folds of the Fourth Ninja World War, revealing the origins of the conflict that consumes the world created by Masashi Kishimoto and its more recent implications, which examine the last narrative arc and its incredible protagonists, and then leave room for the main menu of the package. Mode The start screen of Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 - Road to Boruto is extremely clear and simple, and also orders the contents from a chronological point of view, warning us if we want to access a mode that brings back characters and events subsequent to those we could have seen. We therefore start from the Story, with its classic branches and crossroads that allow you to explore specific narrative aspects, exciting flashbacks and frenetic and engaging fights, interspersed with sequences based on the frames of the cartoon but characterized by a resolution lower than the ideal one, which it marks a marked drop from the in-game action. Then we have the Adventure mode, which takes place immediately after the manga closes and brings into play a structure already used in the past, made up of exploration and interaction as well as, in this case, sequences that recall past events, allowing us to relive some of the clashes most important that have been seen in Naruto Shippuden. The tasks to be completed are very simple and there are indicators so as not to lose sight of the objective on duty, so in the end we are talking about a mere expedient to lengthen the experience with some extra missions, but which certainly proves to be pleasant for fans of the Ninja of the Leaf. The third weight content is The Legend of Boruto, the campaign introduced with the expansion that projects us several years into the future, at the end of a long period of peace which, however, is about to be abruptly interrupted. This time, however, it will not be the usual Naruto to put things right, but another character, much younger but no less determined. Also in this case the authors have drawn on the formula of the adventure mode, asking us to explore some settings and get in touch with specific characters to give life to new, spectacular fights. The package is completed by the Online Battle, the competitive multiplayer mode which requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to be able to face other users from all over the world; and from the Free Clash, which contains a rich range of possible stipulations: a Versus for two players locally, which however requires the use of a second controller (even this time it is not possible to use two Joy-Con to challenge each other), and a series of variants: Tournament, Survival, Championship, Training and a section dedicated to customization. Gameplay Strengthened by some interesting innovations compared to the previous episodes of the series, concerning for example the use of support characters in the context of clashes, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 confirms itself as a frenetic and spectacular brawler, which places immediacy at the first place and manages to create exchanges of great visual impact. The basic system is the one we know well by now, characterized by an essential control system and a certain degree of repetitiveness of the maneuvers, which rely on the use of the chakra and some simple combinations to channel attacks, as well as on the use of the body replacement technique to escape them, creating the necessary spaces for a possible counterattack. The problems emerge clearly where the game is asked for greater complexity, given that the clashes do not go beyond the mechanics just illustrated. When then the enemies on schermo are several, everything becomes chaotic and the degree of difficulty loosens conspicuously to prevent the shortcomings of the design from triggering episodes of frustration. In short, the title of CyberConnect2 has some great moments, but the management of distances (especially when certain opponents take advantage of it, systematically evading our attempts to approach) and various other aspects of the battles have not aged very well. Similarly, the Adventure mode confirms all its limitations due to the simplistic structure and a yield, even technical, below expectations. The Nintendo Switch version If Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Trilogy had frankly disappointed on a technical level due to so many more or less showy uncertainties, hardly justifiable due to the age of the games included in the package, with Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 - Road to Boruto the the developers have created a slap-stick port. The clashes in fact run at 30 frames per second without dips even in the most exaggerated situations, exactly like the PS4 and Xbox One versions, while you notice some impromptu blunders only (and inexplicably) in the Adventure mode, in the 'scope of exploratory phases that also see the presence of not very beautiful pop-ups for characters and shaders. The matter of portability is different: despite the lower resolution, there are annoying stutters that we hope will be resolved with an update. As already mentioned, even this time it is not possible to use the two Joy-Con to control as many fighters within the Versus mode, and it is clearly a pity given the incredible abundance of a roster never so full-bodied, which includes as many as one hundred and twenty-four different ninjas. The aforementioned portability, in any case, stands as a feature of great value and it is a pleasure to carry the experience with you, even if you have to stay within the walls of your home due to current restrictions. The audio sector accompanies the audio very effectively. action on the screen, thanks to a valuable soundtrack, full of engaging songs, and a dubbing in Japanese (absolutely preferable to that in English), subtitled in Italian, which as usual does not disappoint in terms of intensity and conviction of the interpretation .", "date": "2020-04-24", "grade": "8.0"}
