{"name": "I Moschettieri", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/i-moschettieri.html", "text": "Together with Athos, Portos and Aramis in the role of D'Artagnan we will find ourselves foiling all the plots of the evil Cardinal. The game develops through 15 levels, quite varied and focused on a good dose of action. We will face horse fights, fights with swords with the men of the royal guard and different schemes devoted to exploration, we will tour the prisons and different corners of pre-revolutionary Paris. The fights are always enough fun even if they have been too simplified and are resolved in a few elementary fencing hits. During the clashes we will be able to choose the type of attack to be carried out, the type of defense, and we will also be able to change weapons, passing from our beloved sword to a devastating pistol but with very limited shots. The levels were actually built taking inspiration from modern platformers, with platforms and obstacles to overcome, they are resolved in a ~jump-kill-advance~ certainly not exciting. Horse racing has done better for the developers, during these races we will not only have to face Richelieu's ~henchmen~, but also overcome obstacles in our path such as forest trees or fences. During all levels we will be able to collect items of various kinds, such as energy or other bonuses, certainly also the exploratory phase has been treated in a more than discreet way, for example we will have to recover jewels or other incriminating objects to save the King and Queen. The controls are quite functional even if during our road test we found ourselves more comfortable with the keyboard cross than the joystick of the Nokia N70, especially for jumps during the exploratory phases. The 15 levels that make up the game are decidedly varied and from a technical point of view made with a certain care, the scenarios are quite well defined, with many details in evidence and even the animations of the characters, although particularly simple, are sufficiently valid and manage in their purpose more than discreetly.
