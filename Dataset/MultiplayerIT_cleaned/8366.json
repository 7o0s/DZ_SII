Really, it's not exactly the ideal game to show off the technical capabilities of your new tablet or smartphone. Despite this, New Star Soccer is a product that every football lover should at least try, with the very serious risk of never being able to get away from it... The cat is in the bag Behind the New Star Games label there is, as often happens in the world of indie video games, only one person; in this specific case it is Simon Read, an English boy who about 10 years ago made up his mind to create the football game he would have liked to play for the PC; since then New Star Soccer has reached the fifth chapter on computers, Simon Read has left his job to devote himself entirely to the project, and sales have reached such numbers as to allow him (if he wanted to) to buy a Ferrari. In reality, instead of running with a custom-built car, the good Simon preferred to reinvest the money in his game, which in the smartphone version quickly achieved a resounding success. In a nutshell, New Star Soccer puts you in the shoes of a very young sixteen-year-old footballer, at the beginning of his career as an aspiring professional; signed by a minor team, the goal is to get noticed through performances on the field until reaching the big international stages. The title is basically divided into two parts, the one relating to the actual game and the managerial and organizational one; the latter is destined to occupy most of the user's time, with a whole series of aspects to take into account. The fundamental ones are the energy and money available, through which it is possible to improve one's skills in various ways (speed, technique, shooting, passing and so on), personal relationships with the coach, fans, teammates, possible girlfriend and sponsor, and lifestyle by purchasing objects, means of transport and housing. There is also the ability to make the alter ego stronger through targeted training, but always paying attention to the consumption of resources; the lost energy can eventually be recovered by buying miraculous drinks, while spending money buying special boots can help improve the characteristics on the pitch. But a footballer wouldn't be such without the gambling habit (??), and so here's roulette, blackjack, slot machines and horse racing to bet on; for the latter it is even possible to evaluate an investment with its own stable by purchasing more or less expensive thoroughbreds. We've only sketched out some of the elements of New Star Soccer, but they should be enough to give you an idea of the sense of progression and the variety of content available; you can really waste the hours managing your own capital and engaging in activities and minigames that have little to do with the actual real games. Yet these also exist, and are managed in a rather original way; in practice, a large part of the match is described by simple textual comments on key actions, while from time to time you are transported to the pitch for an important moment such as a corner kick, a goal kick, a important pass or an interception. The only possibility provided is to kick the ball, deciding the force of the blow and the precise point in which to impact the ball, thus determining its trajectory and effect. Despite the indisputable aesthetic ugliness, the simplicity of the routines and the static nature of the players, it is not difficult to be fascinated by the formula studied by Simon Read. There is passion, attention but also irony, as in the hilarious post-match interviews full of the classic platitudes of football professionals. One last note on the chosen sales formula, which allows you to download the game for free on the App Store and play about ten games before choosing whether to proceed with the purchase of the entire game. On Android, however, this possibility is not contemplated, and it is necessary to immediately purchase the complete package for 2.49 euros.", "date": "2012-08-23", "grade": "9.0"}
