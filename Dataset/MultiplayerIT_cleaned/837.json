{"name": "Fable: The Lost Chapters - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fable-the-lost-chapters-recensione.html", "text": "Evocation When Fable came out a year ago for Xbox the disappointment was great. According to the many previews and the words of Molyneux and associates, it had to be a kind of life simulator intertwined with a role-playing game; take a character from infancy and bring them to adulthood by having them experience endless adventures in a huge world full of other characters to interact with. We all know how it went. The Fable game world was small and the management of our hero's ~life~ was limited to some completely negligible actions (such as taking a wife or showing trophies around the tiny cities). What was supposed to be an oak turned out to be a bonsai. Overshadowed by its myth, Fable failed to show itself for its qualities. After all we are talking about an excellent action with some RPG elements and with some very tasty extras that cannot be found elsewhere (such as increasing the age of the character or the betting system). Maybe if you read Fable for what it really is and not what it was supposed to be, you could be a little less critical of it. The torn pages Lionhead tries the PC way (however, an Xbox version will also be released of Fable: The Lost Chapters) and tries to lengthen the stock by adding torn pages to his book of fairy tales, considered by many to be too short at the time of the first release. Don't be impressed by the high-sounding title (The Lost Chapters), little has changed since the Xbox version: a new character will appear in one of the first game sequences to reappear immediately after the end of the main adventure (revealing to be one of the protagonists). It is right after the first final showdown that you will be able to access the new chapters made up of a handful of maps set in a new region. A decent addition that will take us to visit a land wrapped in frost full of new enemies (such as ice trolls) and old acquaintances. In all there will be about four hours of extra play (which never hurts but which are not very many) which, added to the duration of the main adventure (about 12 hours by committing to fully explore the maps) make a good amount of time. The new locations are discreetly conceived and the motivations that will take us to these menacing territories start directly from the end of the main story. We will also find some new legendary weapons (in Fable there are more legendary weapons than normal weapons that is, having found the first legendary weapon, it no longer makes sense to use normal weapons), a couple of extra armor, some new quests and we will be able to meet some old ones again knowledge (learning what happened to some key characters we had lost track of). Additions have also been made to the main adventure. Not much stuff in truth: a handful of quests, a somewhat particular location (I won't reveal it to you because it's a lot of fun to explore and contains a demon door... really pretentious) and... that's it. Everything else has remained the same except for some adjustments in the gameplay. In fact, one wonders if the purchase of this ~special edition~ of Fable is necessary for those who have already finished the Xbox version (decide based on how much you liked it and how much you believe it is essential to try the new features present). Goodies But let's go back to the actual game and take our character back from the Guild of Heroes. Once the main adventure has begun, you will discover that the different locations are very limited in size and can be visited completely in a few minutes. That doesn't mean there aren't enough hidden objects to find (although there could have been more). The most interesting adventure element is certainly represented by the Demon's Doors which will subject the player to different tests of varying difficulty (for example, carrying a certain object or killing some enemies). Behind them there are always very interesting and powerful objects. Another interesting element, which could however have been managed better, is the possibility of betting on one's own missions. To do this, simply select the appropriate option when taking a quest and, when you are on the podium, select what you want to bet on (for example, finishing the quest without taking damage or using weapons). Bets are a discreet but rather useless extra (they are used to accumulate fame and some extra money) that you will soon forget once you discover faster and safer (as well as more fun) ways to accumulate fame and money. Speaking of fame, the other ~extra~ way to accumulate it should be mentioned, that is by showing the trophies collected in the game. The system is very simple; when you get a trophy go to a village, take it out and show it to moreas many people as possible before the timer runs out. Obviously the more people see the trophy, the more your fame will be increased. At first, increasing fame in this way may seem interesting, but as you progress in the game, the uselessness of the thing will become clear since you can increase it simply by doing quests and killing enemies. Probably these features (and others such as the possibility of getting married or buying securities) were thought of differently in the conception phase of Fable, only to be ~reduced~ when the final setting was chosen. As they are they are pleasant extras and nothing more (the fact that they can be completely ignored). Combat system But let's get to the best part of Fable, the combat system. Very simple indeed: you can choose to specialize in magic, hand-to-hand combat or ranged combat, assigning experience points to different characteristics. From the first clashes it is evident how the fights change according to the choices made during the improvement of the character (which always and only takes place in the Guild of Heroes) and how much fun it is to use the different possibilities offered. As the game progresses, the enemies (fairly varied and all well designed) become more and more delicious to face and some advanced battles are really very beautiful and fun. Of course, there are some features and spells that unbalance the situation a little too much (for example the Slow Time spell) when they are strengthened too much, but these are trifles for a combat system that, all in all, is more than good and very simple to master. Good or bad Combat system We just have to talk about the system for determining the alignment of the character which, in reality, is very simple: by performing bad actions (such as breaking barrels, killing innocents or completing quests in an evil way) our character will tend towards evil (assuming a demonic aspect) while remaining on the straight path its aspect will tend towards the angelic (complete with a halo). The alignment will be reflected in the reactions that the non-player characters will have towards us in truth, given the limits of the social interaction system, these ~effects~ will be mostly cosmetic and the unfolding of events will hardly change at all, except than for the ending of the game and for some details. Fable: The Lost Chapter is a good action with RPG elements. Well optimized to run on PC, technically very valid (with colorful graphics, very inspired and full of pleasant special effects) and globally recommended to all those looking for a pleasant and not too demanding game, while presenting elements that make it more profound compared to the average. Those looking for a pure role-playing game can, however, turn away. Pros: Very good technically Excellent combat system The extra chapters are not very long but they are well done Cons: Something more to do would have been nice Some aspects seem more like goodies than real features Who has already tried it on Xbox it does not meet big news The beginning When you enter the world of Fable you are forced to agree on the fact that, right away, it is clear how a general compression of all the elements has been performed. The first minutes of the game, the ones in which you basically choose your orientation, make us take part in a handful of simple quests that can all be solved in two ways (following good or evil). The village we are in, the birthplace of the character (which won't have a name for the whole game), is small but well populated. Too bad that the possible interactions with its inhabitants are decidedly limited. It does not even seem to be faced with an RPG and instead it appears evident that pure action predominates. The initial impressions are confirmed by the tutorial and by entering the actual adventure, and to these are added others that gradually become certainties.", "date": "2005-09-23", "grade": null}
