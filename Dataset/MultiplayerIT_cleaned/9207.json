It was at this time that Snake went from being a niche game to a cult favorite for the growing mass of mobile phone owners, sparking a belief in Nokia that games would play a big role in the mobile scene. It is useless to trace the failure of N-Gage and the success of Apple. We all know how that turned out. However, the fact remains that since then things have changed a lot: despite the countless iterations Snake has never seen a worthy successor after Snake 2, and since it was the avant-garde of the gaming experience on mobile phones it has now been reduced to a simple programming for some little budding developer. Even Snake HD by Mark Overmars, the author of Game Maker, proved to be a very trivial title, but Spilt Milk Studios, with its Hard Lines, thought about bringing a bit of novelty to a gameplay as old as the cuckoo. Who has it longer? To be honest, Hard Lines is not entirely original, but it is placed among those many titles that combine different ideas to create something relatively new. The first of the two sources of inspiration, the one on which the entire game mechanics is based, is the aforementioned Snake: inside some rectangular arenas, the player drives a small snake capable of curving in four directions, in order to eat the 'eggs' that appear in sequence on the screen, gradually stretching and moving so as not to bite its own tail. Everything is proposed with neon graphics that represent the snake as a beam of light and the eggs as small luminous objects. Nothing particularly new or interesting so far, but it's hard to hold back a defiant smile as the first rival snakes appear. In addition to the aforementioned Snake, the other source of inspiration for this little arcade for iPhone and iPod Touch seems to be clearly the original Tron game, and specifically the battles between Lightcycles. The aim is not, or at least it is not only, to beat the opponents on time, but to do it in order to enlarge one's tail and use it as an obstacle for others. Thus continuous chases and unpredictable dynamics are created: increasing one's size is necessary to increase the score and not be overwhelmed by the other snakes, but at the same time it becomes increasingly difficult not to pose a threat to oneself, and the player must constantly understand what is more priority. Eliminate nearby opponents or reach the eggs from the other side of the screen? Too bad only for an artificial intelligence that is not always awake and which often leads the opponents to behave in an absurd way, perhaps avoiding very close eggs or ending up alone in a trap. As unexpected as it is successful is the choice to season the experience with a slight humorous component: often the various snakes will allow themselves some jokes or funny exclamations full of sarcasm, perhaps in an attempt to make you feel guilty for having just surrounded them and led them into an alley blind. There are numerous game modes, each of which presents more or less evident nuances to the basic idea: in Time Attack, for example, our snake has a few seconds to live, and the only way to survive is to quickly eat other eggs , however having to compete with enemies who are often longer and pain in the ass; or, in Pinata, the eggs are hidden inside each snake, and it is thus necessary to chase and eliminate it in order to eat them. There is also a classic solo option, for those who just want to challenge themselves like in the old days, but it should be noted that, underneath, this wide selection of modes masks a fictitious variety in gameplay: the mechanics are always identical and the aim it always remains to earn the most points, while none of the options present is able to bring a real breath of fresh air into the game. With so much attention being paid to competing with AI, we'd love to see a multi-friend multiplayer mode in the coming months. Do you say it will happen? ~We are strongly considering the idea of introducing a multiplayer option soon~, Andrew Smith clearly revealed to us, so we just have to wait impatiently.
