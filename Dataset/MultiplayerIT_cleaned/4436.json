A partnership that seems to be reconfirmed with this new release: between pixel art graphics, chiptune music and immediate gameplay and characterized by a non-invasive free to play formula, Slime Pizza on paper has all those characteristics so dear to both companies and which randomly they appear in practically every product with their brand name. This time, however, we are not dealing with the ~usual~ arcade, but even with an adventure that winks at the metroidvania genre: excessive gambling or a pleasant surprise? The slimy you like Slime Pizza starts from some extremely bizarre premises: the protagonist is a blob engaged in carrying out his job as a delivery boy around the cosmos, whose spaceship is infected by a virus and crashes on an unknown planet. Our boggart (as well as extremely unlikely) hero is therefore forced to set out to recover all the lost slices of pizza and look for a way to get home: so far nothing strange, except that precisely the The player's alter ego is an invertebrate creature basically incapable of doing anything, even moving normally. This affects the control system, closer to that of titles such as Angry Birds than to classic adventures, with the slime that must be moved by swiping your finger on the screen to make it leap in the opposite direction. On this basis, a structure develops which, as we mentioned at the beginning, brings to mind the metroidvania for how each screen represents a room characterized by a puzzle or a skill test to be overcome in order to continue to the next phase. However, the comparison is not entirely apt, given that Slime Pizza completely lacks fundamental elements of the genre such as the enhancement of the protagonist and the retraction of one's steps to exploit the powers recently learned, but it is still the definition that best approaches the formula proposed by Neutronized. Certainly, the developer hasn't skimped on creativity as far as level design is concerned: during his adventure, the blob will find himself going through a variety of different environments, with obstacles and traps to avoid, enemies to escape from and small puzzles to resolve, all with a feeling of pleasure that is maintained for the entire duration of the campaign. And this despite the fact that the protagonist, we repeat, is absolutely incapable of doing anything: in addition to being able to attach himself to any surface and being able to restrict his semi-solid mass to slip into tight spaces, the slime cannot count on any ability other than to incorporate some sensitive items, such as keys to open locked doors. The collection of slices of pizza scattered throughout the screens is not a tinsel good only for those players who aim for 100% completion, but it is an element closely related to the gameplay, given that these are required as a bargaining chip in order to activate the rescue stations that dot the scenery at regular intervals. Although it is free to play, however, Slime Pizza does not take advantage of this mechanic, for example by offering packages of pizza slices in exchange for real money: instead, the only suggested in-app purchase is the one that allows you to remove the advertisements that otherwise pop up from time to time. No small feat in an industry all too prone to sticking its hands in users' pockets...", "date": "2018-02-01", "grade": "8.5"}
