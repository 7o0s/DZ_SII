We are not talking about the one due to design errors or second thoughts in the making, but the deliberate and meditated one, which is placed in front of a work as a founding condition of the same. Let's talk for example of the slowness of Playdead, which took about six years between the release of Limbo and that of Inside, or that of Jonathan Blow, who didn't launch The Witness until he was satisfied with the result. The richness of graphic details is impressive We have not mentioned titles at random, because Owlboy shares a great deal of their production philosophy, whereby the only valid deadline is the satisfaction of the authors with respect to the adherence of the finished product to their vision. It is no coincidence that those mentioned are among the best games released this year. Yes, Owlboy too. D-Pad Studio began developing it way back in 2007, assuming that it would take a long time to see it arrive on the market. At the time, the project was only known among those who frequented the independent PC scene, a scene that was also taking its first steps on consoles (Braid of the aforementioned Blow is from 2008). The reason for the slow development was already clarified then: the pixel art graphics. Mind you: not a pixel art graphics like many others, but the best ever. As some twentieth-century artistic avant-gardes have revealed to us, the creative act is as important as the work itself; a painting by Jackson Pollock cannot be read without knowing its genesis and without understanding what action painting is. Knowing a little of Owlboy's history helps a lot to appreciate it and to understand how crazy and at the same time exceptional the work done by the developers is, who have deliberately chosen to draw every single object of the game pixel by pixel, including animations, imposing limits on color palette to make their work not only perfect from an aesthetic point of view, but also impressive from a strictly formal one. In short, Owlboy is a handcrafted object made with maniacal care, the result of a radical discipline inseparable from the gameplay. We have reviewed Owlboy, a pixel art masterpiece that has literally bewitched us! Find out. Otus' story The protagonist of the adventure is Otus, a dumb owl boy who in the introduction does not show particular talents and is repeatedly scolded by his master, who considers him incompetent. Otus seems to be unable at anything, except in causing disasters, and is humiliated in every way by the inhabitants of the city where he lives, Vellie. Owlboy offers a wide variety of situations throughout its duration Despite this, he also has trusted friends: people who love him and who help him however they can, showing him understanding and affection. After the introduction, which also serves as a tutorial, we take control of Otus and can explore the city of Vellie. Here we learn about some interesting features of the game, made up of large and freely explorable levels, even if not open, with secret areas which can be accessed by acquiring skills and upgrades. In short, apparently it is the classic metroidvania seasoned with Zelda, but also with original ideas that make it unique. The first is certainly the power of flight, which allows Otus to move freely around the map and which characterizes the entire gameplay. The second concerns the nature of the upgrades, linked not so much to objects to collect, but to the friends who are with us. But let's go in order. Otus himself is almost defenseless and, in addition to performing a pirouette, at most he can pick up objects and throw them at enemies or use them in various ways depending on their function. The scenarios alternate internal and external For example, it can catch clouds which, when squeezed, spill jets of water; or he can take caps with which to close the air vents. In short, most of the puzzles in the game are built around this mode of interaction, generally not difficult to solve, but very suitable for the genre and never out of context. In addition to the objects, as already mentioned, Otus can grab his friends, airlifting them. Each friend has characteristics that make him unique and, when he is together with the owl boy, he transforms into a real weapon. For example, one of them, Geddy, shoots with a sort of machine gun and is very slim in size, while another more corpulent, Alphonse, is equipped with a flamethrower shotgun, very slow to reload, but very effective for clearing some areas of shrubbery . Around the maps there are also buried objects that must be unearthed; these can be pots or chests filled with gold, or deThe food to eat to recover energy. The levels are also filled with rings that you need to cross that also yield gold. When you have enough money, you can go to a shop and buy upgrades, such as extra energy, a gun and more. Winning design Owlboy has two winning elements, in addition to the pixel art graphics: the design of the levels and the distribution of game mechanics. The story itself isn't incredibly articulated, but it's effective in its essentiality. Otus is a nice character for whom you develop a strong empathy, especially when you see him mistreated for faults that are not his. Flying makes exploration freer The idea of making him mute fits perfectly, partly because it recalls the Link from The Legend of Zelda and partly because the fact that he cannot speak makes him almost defenseless from the feelings that the other characters have towards him, giving him strength dramatic. Owlboy's is a story of sacrifice and redemption, with well-studied twists of which, obviously, we will not mention. In broad terms we tell you that Otus must save the world from robotic pirates. Put like this it sounds ridiculous, but it's actually told really well. But we talked about level design and mechanics. It is evident that the guys from D-Pad Studio are madly in love with the Nintendo series, The Legend of Zelda and Metroid above all, from which they have learned fundamental lessons: the first is to build all the puzzles in restricted areas, preventing the player has to go back and forth to solve them; the second is to distribute the game mechanics throughout the adventure, always giving us something new to do. In Owlboy you rarely get stuck in a puzzle for more than a few minutes and usually just observe the situation to get to the solution. Some steps are more difficult than others, but there's nothing prohibitive or frustrating about it. Perhaps just the final boss can make life more complicated, but in general the adventure flows very smoothly. The enemies all have characteristics that require different approaches, such as fire dogs that need to be shot in the back, or gnomes that can only be avoided in short stealth sections. Overall we are faced with a well-kept game, which lasts about ten hours, in which nothing has been left to chance. A final applause deserves the soundtrack, composed of sixty-seven tracks that alone deserve the purchase of the deluxe edition. In short, Owlboy took nine years to wait, but it was worth it. Owlboy on consoles Apparently Owlboy will also arrive on consoles. Unfortunately, it is not yet known how much and on which platforms. The announcement should arrive shortly. We will probably see it on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One but, given the genre and the sources of inspiration, we would also see it very well on Nintendo Switch.", "date": "2016-11-05", "grade": "9.2"}
