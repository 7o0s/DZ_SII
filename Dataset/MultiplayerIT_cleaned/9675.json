The Shaun White Skateboarding version of the game for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 tells of an oppressed society that can be liberated thanks to our acrobatic maneuvers, which serve as the spark to ignite the explosion of a newfound common consciousness. On the Nintendo console, a substantially different approach was preferred, oriented towards a younger audience, and so ~The Ministry~ disappears to make way for the evil mayor of a town oppressed by very restrictive laws against those who love to have fun. Shaun and his crew are on their way to visit a friend who lives right there, but when they get there, they realize something isn't quite right. Thanks to their skateboards, however, they have the power to put everything right: within nine different urban districts, they will have to overcome a certain number of challenges to transform the scenario from gray to colorful, sending away the tyrant administrator. Unlike Shaun White Snowboarding, we will not find ourselves playing the role of Shaun (who will move in the background as a non-playable character), but of his four friends: Gordon, robust and determined, particularly skilled in grinds; Zaz, small and agile, very good at lip tricks; Jasmine, anything but a helpless girl, master of grabs; Alex, the second girl of the group, excellent in performing flip tricks. These immediately available characters will be joined by six more throughout the story, bringing the total number to ten. Grinda that passes you Shaun White Skateboarding offers us a story mode and a multiplayer mode, the latter only locally for four players in split-screen, while unfortunately online multiplayer is missing. The story mode sees us select one of the available characters and follow the story of this rowdy group with the aim of bringing back... disorder to the city. As mentioned above, there are nine locations in which we will find ourselves skating, with the possibility of moving freely within the scenario and trying our hand at the numerous challenges available. The latter constitute the fulcrum of the game, and only by successfully completing them all is it possible to access the next area, also unlocking new clothes, skateboards, music and so on. The first challenges have the typical character of tutorials, and in fact they simply see us learn the tricks and perform them a certain number of times. The more advanced missions, on the other hand, involve performing complex maneuvers and completing fairly long routes. In addition to the acrobatic component, the challenges can focus on the simple collection of objects, and in the end they arise as simple minigames. The control system via Balance Board, which had very well impressed in the first title dedicated to Shaun White, unfortunately turns out to be inaccurate and makes it difficult to correctly execute tricks based on weight balance. The classic Wiimote + Nunchuk combination is much better, with the analog stick responsible for moving the character while the gestures of the controller (up, down, sideways or rotating the remote control) allow us to jump and perform a large number of stunts in the air. The responsiveness of the commands is good and the game structure protects us from any ~accidental deaths~ caused by the failure to receive an input, also because it is not really possible to ~die~. The city will be destroyed at dawn In its Wii version, Shaun White Skateboarding takes up only partially what was seen on PS3 and Xbox 360, moreover presenting a simplification of the concept of ~mission structure~, which on the Nintendo console are very linear and without bite. Also the fault of the mediocre level design, with the scenarios of a monstrous flatness, limited in size and completely devoid of moving objects (the city is obviously deserted). Learning tricks is fun at first, even considering the excellent controls via Wii-mote and Nunchuk, but it soon turns into a repetitive practice and an end in itself, which produces no results beyond the unlocking of objects useful for customizing the our skater. It is also a pity that the developers failed to exploit the Balance Board properly, which could have made a difference as it did for Shaun White Snowboarding. The graphics are quite fluid but poor in content, with simple polygonal models and with just discreet animation. The cartoonish style adopted for the occasion has its own reason, too bad its potential has not been exploited. The locations, for example, are ugly to see even when we manage to ~transform~ them by adding a strong touch of color to the scenario. Finally, the game enjoys a discreet dubbing in Italian and a musical accompaniment that is not transcendental but not contemptible either.", "date": "2010-11-05", "grade": "6.0"}
