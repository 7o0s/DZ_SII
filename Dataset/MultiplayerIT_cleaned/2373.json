{"name": "Myth3: The Wolf Age", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/myth3-the-wolf-age.html", "text": "The birth of a legend. Supported by an epic storyline and a gameplay that delighted many players, bored by the usual amass resources / build army scheme, Myth conquered a large part of fans of the genre, creating a community of considerable size around itself. Although in Italy the game didn't earn the same support and acclaim it received in America, it still managed to win the hearts of many players. Needless to say, after a short time, Bungie churned out an even more beautiful sequel, Myth2: Soulblighter: the same fate also for this second chapter, which even saw the Multiplayer community grow, despite not having introduced anything particularly innovative. In the last two years Bungie, bought by Bill Gates and put under contract for the production of some exclusive titles for the Xbox (Halo above all), has sold the rights of the series to a Software House unknown to most, Mumbo Jumbo : After only nine months of development, the third installment, The Wolf Age, arrives on the market. Let's try to understand if the title is able to satisfy both the faithful to the saga, and those who have never approached it ... Episode One? In the same way Episode One was presented to the many Star Wars fans, The Wolf Age is a real Prequel to the saga, as the story tells of events that happened a thousand years before those known in Myth: The Fallen Lords. During the many (25) missions present in this Wolfg Age, we will therefore have the opportunity to know and control most of the characters encountered in the stories that constituted the background of the series: the Soulblighter himself, the main enemy of the second chapter, will be one of the protagonists main characters of the game, even if his name is still that of Dumas and his role that of hero alongside Connacht, future emperor of the lands of Myrgard. If this choice could initially leave the most ardent fans of the series perplexed, it is justified considering the narrative impact that the story, already quite complex in itself, could have had for new players. Once the initial doubts have been set aside, this long step back into the background of the Myth universe will in any case also be appreciated by the faithful: the idea of being able to retrace, and be protagonists, of the events heard in the narrations of the first two episodes, will be able to conquer even the most skeptical players. Episode One? It's not for nothing that I dwelled so much on the ~story~ topic: it represents one of the elements capable of distinguishing Wolf Age (and with it the entire Myth series) from the rest of the RTS group. If you have enjoyed the fantasy universe of Myth, and have been captivated by its narration, you will not struggle to find the same sensations in this third episode as well: if, on the contrary, it is the first time you approach the series, the impression you will receive will be that of suddenly finding yourself in a living world, full of facets and capable of holding your attention for a long time. The succession of missions, each linked to the other and told through a narrative thread absolutely consistent with the unfolding of the same (an example: at a certain point your army will begin to succumb, making a particular alliance necessary: who to send if not your characters most important?), perfectly conveys the idea of being the protagonists of an imaginary story. A brief narration of the events introduces each new mission, whose objectives vary (find a lost crypt, escort a villager, defend a position, destroy a particular passage...) even within the same, in a dynamic way. A small step back: dedicated to those who don't know Myth. The story, the missions... Yes, but what kind of game is Myth: The Wolf Age? The game is a strategy/tactician with a Fantasy setting, in which the player is given command of a limited number of units (from four to about thirty, not more), different in type and characteristics, non-replaceable and therefore paramount importance. Made through a fully polygonal engine (unlike the first two episodes), zoomable and with a free and customizable camera at any time, The Wolf Age perhaps represents, from a graphic point of view, the best that has been seen to date in the genre RTS extension. A fair number of polygons make up the different creatures encountered throughout the game, each covered with some splfine workmanship (not in all cases, however, since sometimes we are also faced with less than mediocre creations), inspired by the same Fantasy mythology that has moved many other titles in the past: Ghoul archers, dwarf bombers, Giants, Spiders huge, Elf Rangers, Enchanting Sorcerers, barbarian warriors, witches and whatever else it is easy to imagine... As mentioned in the introduction, Myth differs from most of the RTS due to the total lack of resource management, which in this case are represented only from the units of their own (small) army, always of rather limited number. Precisely for this reason, the main aspect of the title is the tactical one, as each clash (and they will be really numerous) with the enemy units must be planned through the arrangement of the fighters on the playing field, lined up in some formations freely chosen by the player . A small step back: dedicated to those who don't know Myth. To give you a practical example, very often we are faced with an army made up of five or six enemy archers, located behind a group of Zombies: in this case it is necessary to conquer one of the hills on the map as soon as possible, and place our archers there to take advantage of the height of the ground (which has a heavy influence and cannot be underestimated) and strike from a distance. It must be said that to become familiar with this game system, and in particular with the camera and with the formations, it really takes some time: in this regard it is really a pity that the present Tutorial is really poor, as it only teaches learning some techniques leaving out other important elements. To be honest, it is nothing more than the exact transposition of the same tutorial present in Myth2: Soulblighter, and for this reason it does not include the new units (not that there are many...), the minor novelties and the abilities secondary characters. The advice, in this case, is to arm yourself with patience and start the single game anyway, aware that before you can successfully control the visual and army you will face many defeats. Yes, because the third characteristic that has distinguished the series, and which in this case is proposed again (even if the impression is that the level of commitment required is lower), is the extreme difficulty of the game, capable of offering a particular challenge even to the most experienced players. Fortunately, an option has been implemented for which it is possible to tackle the missions with three different levels of difficulty: I won't hide from you that in some missions, especially those of the second half of the game, I had to bring the level to the lowest notch in order to to continue. For fans of the series it might seem like a small betrayal to include this option, but more than one player in the past years has abandoned one of the two Myths because they clashed with the high level of difficulty: considering this, the Mumbo Jumbos have been able to offer a shortcut even for less experienced players, also guaranteeing them the possibility of being able to continue the game without having to go crazy... But... what's new? Dedicated to fans of the series. If you are among those who have completed the two previous chapters, and perhaps dedicated part of your time to the online game, the question you will be most interested in will probably be the one relating to the innovations introduced by this third chapter. As mentioned, from a graphic point of view an important step forward has been taken, and the result is really very pleasant: with the graphic options set to the maximum, the impression is that of being faced with the best exponent of the genre in this sense (waiting for Empire Earth). In addition to the aforementioned Textures, the new light effects created by the Mumbo Jumbos should be mentioned, capable of giving an absolutely realistic touch to the game's environments: in the interiors of the buildings there are torches which, once lit, produce a dynamic light effect and of shadows even higher than what was glimpsed in Neverwinter Nights. But... what's new? Dedicated to fans of the series. As for the general setting of the game, the game is always the same Myth, and this could disappoint some hopeful players of novelty. Unfortunately, and this must be said, there are no real novelties even in the field of tactics and formations that we will be called upon to master, as even among the enemy creatures (practically the same ones already known in the first two episodes) we are unable to find any particular originality. The same Zombies, the same Ghouls, the Trows, the warlocks (who this time possess a form of gigantic bat) and the other units in themiche, not only are they identical to what has already been seen and known, but they also behave in the same way. As it is easy to understand, and this point deserves a particular reflection, the feeling that the title manages to give to longtime players is exactly the same as in the previous episodes. This detail, combined with the fact that it is precisely the general setting of the title that has remained totally unchanged, makes this third chapter nothing more than a real REMAKE of the game in the eyes of enthusiasts, certainly not an evolution or a revolution. Assuming that no one expected a real revolution in the game system, however we can only register a minimum of discontent for the inability of Mumbo Jumbo programmers to create something original, limiting themselves to inheriting and re-proposing the brilliant concept of game invented by Bungie. Is this good or bad? Does Wolf Age deserve the rejection or the promotion? The reasons for the Myth: conclusions. Myth The Wolf Age passes, in my opinion, the final exam with flying colours. While not proposing, as seen, anything extraordinarily innovative, this third episode graphically, structurally and tactically refines what was proposed in the first two titles. Putting aside a small wave of disappointment for not having been able to take control of new units, or for not having been able to fight completely original enemies (yes, the forest witch is new, but her way of attacking reminds us of sorcerers of the first episodes), I felt ~at home~ again. What I had appreciated and loved in the first two episodes, the interface, the tactical setting, the difficulty of the missions and their variety, the fantasy narration of the story, the graphics and the level of realism of the clashes, is re-proposed refined in this Myth3 . The reasons for the Myth: conclusions. Therefore, the long-standing Mytthians are advised to put aside any hope of renewal and revolution for the fourth episode, approaching this Wolf Age with the certainty of finding the same feeling as the series: don't expect a completely new title, expect Myth2 and 1/2 and you will be extremely happy. To the others, to the players who for some reason have never approached the saga, the invitation is to arm yourself with courage and face the first hours of the game, which will be particularly difficult if not frustrating, as a small investment for the following weeks , as they will be completely absorbed by the world of Myrgard. If, on the other hand, you collided with one of the two previous chapters and you were not attracted to it, turn away because you will only be able to relive the same sensations and your investment will last very few hours. P.S: before concluding, a small reference to the Multiplayer mode, improved and enriched by some new game modes, but supported by slower (Gamespy) and buggy servers than those of Bungie. The birth of a legend. It was the year 1998 when a strategic title quite different from those that appeared previously appeared on the market almost out of nowhere. In a scene where Red Alert clones dominated and proliferated relentlessly, a small Software House, Bungie, proposed a rather particular fantasy RTS, entitled Myth: The Fallen Lords. With a tactical setting completely oriented towards the management of troops during combat, and not the collection of resources, Myth represented a small jewel of originality for the market.", "date": "2001-11-03", "grade": null}
