When you take control of the little dragon, then, you can't help but notice how much the developers have worked to improve the control system: the character responds to commands promptly, and the collision detection problems that plagued the past episodes of the series. The first location is Spyro's village, where it is possible to visit Mr. Moneybags' shop and possibly buy a whole series of objects using the collected gems. The immediate surroundings give access to the other areas of the Kingdom of Dragons, more or less distant but all characterized by the presence of a ~virtual~ sales point of Mr. Moneybags, easily identifiable on the map. Right from the start, the game sets specific goals for you and encourages you to learn particular movement techniques, such as the double jump, the ability to glide or jump on branches. Of course, Spyro's classic skills are not missing: the fiery breath and the charge, albeit alternately, will ensure that you can get rid of all enemies in no time. The character responds to commands promptly, and the collision detection problems that plagued past episodes of the series seem to have disappeared. The new heroes The objective of the game is basically to find all the black gems and destroy them. When an area is cleared of their presence, it changes its morphology by adding bridges or hills that allow you to continue your journey. Reaching new places will also result in meeting characters who will lend you a hand, such as Sergeant Byrd (a penguin equipped with a jetpack) and Blink (a mole with a laser gun). Every time you meet them, you will be able to control them in stages specially created to find dragon eggs or gems of light. It's a nice change in the gameplay, which practically never stays the same but is renewed throughout the adventure with these extra sections and with the addition of new abilities for Spyro. And the enemies are also renewed: the stupid orcs of the early stages give way to reptiles equipped with boomerangs and giant spiders that shoot their web at you, while huge carnivorous plants try to be at the right distance to bite you. As for variety, in short, you really can't complain. The matter of quality is different, however, since enemies tend to always behave in the same way and never represent a serious challenge for Spyro. A challenge which, on the other hand, is expressed in the abrupt passage from small and easily explorable environments to very large areas, connected to each other, which greatly complicate life when one is looking for the last black gems to destroy, given and considering that the map is of no help at this juncture Technical analysis Spyro  A Hero's Tail comes with a graphic design appropriate to the times and up to the best products of the genre for PS2, although the multiplatform nature of the game will not have failed to influence the developers' effort in this regard. The character design, while questionable at times, works well. The animations are always fluid and well done, thanks to a graphics engine that rarely loses strokes and which manages a large number of polygons in the best possible way, as well as a series of excellent special effects. Finally, the locations are full of details and very well done, while denouncing a certain lack of originality (which is normal, unfortunately). The sound sector shines for the presence of an excellent dubbing in Italian, as already written, more than for the quality of the music or the effects: both work in a worthy way, without arousing any particular emotion. In conclusion, the control system has proved to be effective even in the most complex situations. Also thanks to camera management that works much better than in other 3D platformers. Comment If you are looking for a ~holiday~ title, to give to someone or for yourself, Spyro - A Hero's Tail represents an excellent choice. It is a decidedly classic platform, embellished however by numerous variations in the gameplay that always make it fun and by a technical realization that is up to the situation. It is not a milestone of the platform genre, this is not, but it will make you spend several hours in a pleasant way Pros: Technically sound Persextra onaggi Dubbed in Italian Cons: Some dead spots Music and effects not exciting Sometimes boring The Dragon Kingdom finds itself facing a new threat: Red, the dragon who was once part of the order of the elders, has returned to his land to subjugate and reign over it. To succeed in his intent, he procured a large number of black gems and planted them in the territories of the Kingdom, so that their dark power affects not only the appearance but also the vital energy of each place. Once again Spyro will be the hero who has to put things right, occasionally resorting to the help of other characters, each with unique characteristics.", "date": "2005-01-06", "grade": null}
