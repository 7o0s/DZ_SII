{"name": "Dolmen", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dolmen-recensione.html", "text": "If it is true that retracing the steps of those who have successfully preceded us can be a good idea, even more so if we feel we can adopt a different approach, in the same way we need to be aware of our limits and what standards we have achieved so far do not arrive on the market with a poor product. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened to the Brazilian development team Massive Work Studio, which, while drawing on classics of extraordinary value such as Dark Souls and Dead Space, ended up putting together an extremely generic soulslike underneath all the points of view, characterized by a mediocre art direction and an often inconsistent combat system. In this blaze of unnecessarily complicated and ugly interfaces, broken rhythms in favor of grinding and a level design that gets worse instead of improving, is there anything that can be saved? We reveal it to you in the Dolmen review. History Dolmen, the protagonist explores a new scenario Probably the least interesting aspect of Dolmen is the story itself, and in particular the way in which the authors have chosen to tell it: no interlude sequences nor dialogues, just simple text terminals that give the terrible feeling of being faced with a independent production several years old. Too bad, because the gist of the plot has its reason and sees our character, a commander with the most anonymous armor in the universe (but, be careful, you can customize its colors...), face the monsters that raided the planet Revin Prime directly from another dimension. How? Thanks to a mysterious crystal, the Dolmen, of which we will have to collect samples. Structure Dolmen, the protagonist fights with the typical two-handed broadsword of the astronauts In terms of structure, the title of Massive Work Studio is a school soulslike: the campaign, characterized by a duration ranging from twelve to fifteen hours depending on how many times you will run into the game over, is set within three different scenarios, each with the traditional ~watertight compartments~ delimited by the Connection Beacons: devices that allow you to save the game but restore all the enemies already eliminated, apart from the bosses. As expected, it is at these Beacons that it is also possible to use the points and the resources earned up to that moment to improve the character's stats or build new weapons, but the operation does not take place through a simple contextual menu, but by teleporting to the base ship and tediously reaching the devices set up for these functions, including a sort of capsule that mimics the one used in Dead Space to enhance the armor of Isaac Clarke, only much more ugly and spartan. Gameplay Dolmen also allows you to attack enemies with an energy rifle Even with a series of limitations that appear quite clear right from the start, the gameplay is undoubtedly the best aspect of Dolmen. In fact, in the game we will be able to fight both using edged weapons (for example the two-handed broadswords, which, as we know, are never lacking in an astronaut's equipment), alternating fast and heavy blows, regulated by rather long animations which, however, cannot be canceled not even acting on the dodge; both firearms that use the energy of the armor to work. All the tools available are characterized by elemental agents linked to fire, ice and acid, which therefore prove to be more or less effective depending on the class of our enemies. We must also pay attention to the three indicators located at the top left of the screen: health, stamina and the aforementioned energy. The latter can be used to partially restore the first, but it also acts as ~fuel~ for the rifle and can only be recovered by consuming flasks or by killing specific opponents. The system that comes out of this interpretation works quite well, but with the targets hooked it can happen that the camera tends to get in our way, adding further difficulties with respect to the evident woodenness of the movements, to some interpenetration too many (hitting the enemies from behind a shelter? Yes, it can be done, but the opposite also happens) and to a very unsatisfactory yield of impacts, indeed often slippery and inconsistent. The latter, however, seem unable to take the challenge to a higher level, as one might expect; on the contrary, once two or three patterns have been memorized and the character has been strengthened a little, they come down with surprising ease. Technical realization Dolmen, the first boss There are many ways to ~mask~ the technical shortcomings of a low-budget title, but it seems that the developers of Dolmen don't know any of them. There is little to get around it: everything you see on the screen in Dolmen appears extremely generic and uninspired, it really seems that the authors have taken standard assets and inserted them into the game, perhaps with the hope of replacing them later have developed the various mechanics. Too bad it didn't happen. On PS5, the now traditional two graphics modes are available, one at 4K and 30 fps and one with reduced resolution and 60 fps, obviously to be preferred since you don't give up anything in favor of more responsive gameplay and accurate. The interface is very dated and ugly, the animations leave something to be desired, the scenarios are immediately terribly anonymous. And the sound doesn't do better, in fact it is perfectly adequate to everything else.", "date": "2022-05-22", "grade": "5.5"}
