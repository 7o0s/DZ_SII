A brand born, raised and expanded on home consoles; yet, looking back on it, it was precisely the PC user who was privileged with that Prepare to Die Edition which, two months in advance, rewarded an audience with brand new content - the mouse and keyboard - historically and ideologically distant from the universes of the flagships that they had made the franchise great. Without going into the merits of partisan considerations, the timing was at least decent: about 10 months after the launch of Dark Souls on the market, From Software offered new hours of paid gameplay. A steep price, in reality, for a content that we were only able to digest in part: the excellent inspiration of the bosses was confronted with a marked geographical poverty, both in terms of the uniqueness of the environments and the size of the areas, with a time of embarrassing completion when compared in proportion to the majesty and depth of the main quest. Just four months after its release on the market, it is not easy to easily assimilate a trilogy of DLCs proposed by the From that seven months ago promised to include in the retail product all the playful ceiling that the team wanted to express with Dark Souls 2. And with even more serious defects this time, at least for the first part of the triptych. The first DLC of Dark Souls II only partially satisfies: short, anonymous and with bosses widely already seen Jump and spin It must be said that Artorias of the Abyss had a much more elegant access trigger: traveling between the lake of Radiceoscura and the Duke's Archives in search of a passage to Oolacile was a nice business card on a narrative level. The entrance passage to ~The Crown of the Sunken King~ is instead simply located in the room of the post-Putrid Primordial Bonfire, where by magic - after disbursing the money - a new sanctuary appears where before there was dark rock. Certainly not the most pleasant of gimmicks, and certainly quite alienating for those who had already passed there, in that same cave filled with nothing, in some previous playthrough. To set the first of the three summer DLCs, From Software has chosen structures with a clear pre-Columbian matrix: temples, ziggurats, Mayan pyramids. The team drew heavily from history to propose an innovative setting for the saga, at least aesthetically. What most distinguishes this downloadable content is certainly the importance attributed to platforming and level design: the emphasis placed on recreating situations of looking for the ledge or studying the movement of self-propelled platforms is certainly a panacea, able to give a little of that trial & error exploration forgotten in the main story. If we can break a spear for the artistic flair that makes draw distance its strong point, little can be done for the actual playful performance in the long run. Ideally dividing the DLC into two macro-areas, From has opted for a rather claustrophobic and monotonous approach for the first half: many tunnels, small rooms, closed sections, unexpectedly dead ends. To balance a certain lack of inspiration for the indoor part, particularly on the track, the insertion of active environmental puzzles of clear Zeldian inspiration intervenes (shooting tiles to open the door?), unexpected as much as appreciated stimuli to explore each point in depth. But they are not enough to mask freshly caressed good ideas: there is no continuity in the curve, only short peaks in which the pinched and undeveloped idea appears clear as it deserved throughout the DLC. The palette used by From Software is quite shocking: the content is characterized by almost exclusively dark colors (except for a peripheral section) which weigh down and tire in the short term, failing to involve emotionally, as other areas of the primary quest are able to do with great pride. It's okay that it's the territory of the Submerged King, but perhaps, also calculating the duotone of the environments of the Gola Nera that has just passed, a few more colors in addition to black and blue would have been much appreciated. Already seen Approaching the DLC with the right level, it will not be complex to complete it completely in about three hours, bosses excluded. The areas are not large, and once you have operated all the lifts you will notice how much the real extension is actually much smaller than the one initially perceived. Contrary to Artorias of the Abyss, the real problem of this first proposed content are the bosses: we don't know if it was a limited finishing time, or the exhaustion of creative flair, in fact of the three boss fights, two have a ampletaste of dj vu. Nashandra and Kalameet seem to be back in disguise, with attacks from their respective DLC alter egos even mimicking their patterns and elements involved. The only clash with a vague hint of novelty is superfluous with respect to the plot and strongly based on the summoning of ghosts to help in the battle, resulting in a duel built at the table to be managed almost exclusively in the way the developers wanted. The introduction of enemies and traps based on negative statuses is nice but a little too abused along the first half of the DLC, which flows away evenly and too quickly to remain impressed. The second half is much shorter and based on the descent between platforms until you reach the final areas that will conclude the content. From Software has always accustomed us to the best with its flagship saga, for this reason we are convinced that, for completeness, every enthusiast will still play this more or less forced addition to the plot of Vendrick and the crowns. But it is difficult to recommend a rather anonymous expansion overall, with few epic moments, sufficient in content but too short and lightning-fast to justify the price of almost 10. Knowing that between now and September there are still two DLCs planned, the hope is that From will return to giving all those fascinating fantasy elements that have made it unique and not perfumed homework just above the sufficiency, made to stretch the broth in an inconsistent way. Goodbye to the next downloadable content, hoping it welcomes the prestigious legacy in a more appropriate way.", "date": "2014-07-30", "grade": null}
