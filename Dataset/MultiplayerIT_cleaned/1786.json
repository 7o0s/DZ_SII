{"name": "Robotech Battlecry", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/robotech-battlecry_a.html", "text": "Super Dimensional Fortress Macross It all began when an alien spacecraft collided with Earth. The ship crashed on an island called Macross, fortunately without suffering damage to internal structures. The aircraft was over a kilometer long and there was no sign of the crew inside. The technology on board this spaceship was clearly superior to that present on earth, so it was decided to study and restructure it in order to understand its secrets. These studies gave birth to a new technology called Robotech from which new vehicles and weapons were created for the defense of the earth from a possible alien attack. Thus was born the Robotech Defense Force, the spaceship was renamed Super Dimensional Fortress  1, after which the aliens began their invasion This is the short story of what can be defined as an action-shooter game that flawlessly repaints the fantastic Robotech atmosphere. Going into more details, I can happily announce that this game is totally based on the animated series. In fact, the characters and vehicles are precise and identical to those of the series. This can only make all the fans happy, but that's not all do you happen to remember Macross VFX-1 and 2 for Psx or Macross M3 for Dreamcast? If the answer is yes, you will also remember how disappointing and unplayable they were. Very well, forget them completely because this new title has been done in a great way, certainly there are flaws (and there are many too), but they are only marginal and do not affect playability and fun excessively. R.B. it is basically, as I said before, a totally arcade action game. All you have to do is shoot, shoot, dodge, shoot, shoot, transform, ?transform? Exactly, you will be the pilots of a Veritech (ie a Valkyrie for those who have seen the cartoon) which for the uninitiated is a kind of transformable plane. You will therefore be able to change shape according to the needs of the missions and particular situations or simply because you are better off piloting a certain type of vehicle. In all, there are three transformations: Bi-Robot -a simple bipedal robot-, Fighter -a plane for aerial battles- and Guardian -practically a cross between robot and fighter-. Each of these forms has a certain type of armament available, which is basically based on a laser cannon and missiles (the difference lies in the type of fire or in the range and power of the missiles). Furthermore, each transformation has a special ability: the Bi-robot has the ability to use the laser cannon in sniper mode, the Guardian can load objects onto itself, the Fighter has anti-missile decoys; these skills are essential to completing certain missions, so the choice of transformation proves to be a matter of life and death. Now let's move on to the actual game to see if it deserves the purchase or not. Everything is divided into missions (there are about forty of them) and between one and the other there are interludes that will serve to narrate the continuation of the plot (which, even being rather trivial, is very suitable for the type of game). Each mission, which is divided into two main genres: open air battles and closed land battles (which differ significantly from each other in terms of gameplay structure), has its own objective , which can vary from the simple destruction of alien spacecraft to rescue operations, from the escort of allied vehicles to the defense of urban sectors; in the end, however, the main purpose is only to shoot and destroy, and this is where the fun comes: it's bloody fun! The game action is tremendously frenetic, you will have to shoot, transform, launch dozens of missiles, dodge enemy attacks, destroy swarms of missiles that the enemy has sent at you, all this in an extremely short amount of time. The brain will be of no use to you except to concentrate on the use of the keys of your joypad which will practically all be used and to put on a minimum of strategy that will serve to survive; for the rest you will have to rely exclusively on your instinct! The control system is perfect, the aiming system is flawless, the playability is of a high level, fun is guaranteed, frustration is not a prerogative of this game, in short, an excellent job has been done. There is also the possibility of playing a two-player game in splitscreen, to tell the truth it is not the best of life since the graphics engine suffers a significant slowdown, but it is still playable. However, this mode lacks an important prerogative of the single game: frenzy. FromTherefore, whether there is or is not is not a relevant fact. Anime or Videogame? You will surely notice from the photos that the graphic style of the game has a cartoonish look, and indeed it is. For the graphics, the Cel Shading technique was used which gives the game that cartoon feel (even if everything is totally 3d) and I would say that for a title that was taken from an anime, a better technique could not have been chosen . The animations are beautiful, especially those of Veritech, the movements are very similar to those of the cartoon, a real treat for fans! And that's not all, you know the gray trails of missiles? Well, they have been redone perfectly! Even the explosions are cartoony and very well done. Perhaps more could have been done with regard to the environments, in fact they are small and a bit sparse (although to tell the truth, the fact that they seem a bit poor in detail depends more on the use of the cel shade). Also, very strange thing, as far as buildings are concerned, not all of them can be destroyed, you will happen to shoot at a building that will collapse after a few shots, while shooting at the one next to it will not happen anything and will remain perfectly intact (and honestly I don't understand why of such a thing, although buildings are useful for cover from enemy fire). There are several defects in the environment and they are essentially due to a limited freedom of movement, for example in missions in urban centers you will not be able to rise above a certain height, or in open-air missions you will not be able to reach the earth's surface or other areas since the backdrops are designed. To be clearer, I'll give you a more detailed example: in a space mission in which you will be attacked by hundreds of alien motherships, in the end the area in which you can move will be very limited. There is a 2d background where the fleet is drawn and then the 3d environment, in which you will move, where there are only a couple of spaceships like the ones in the background, so you can never reach the area drawn in 2d. As far as the terrestrial environment is concerned, it is totally in 3d, and in addition to the height limitation there are no other defects. For the purposes of the game these small problems are rather marginal, since in any case the enemies you will have to deal with will still be many and when you are in the middle of the battle you will not notice them at all, after all it is a shooter and not a simulation; however, this does not mean that you will feel somewhat limited. Totally changing the subject, the soundtrack is completely taken from the animated series and is very engaging, the sound effects are nothing extremely particular, but they do their job well and are well done. The voices should also be the original ones of the American dubbers, so they are in English, but fortunately there are subtitles in Italian. Final comment My final judgment can only be positive, this is definitely the best Robotech game ever created, it's a must for all fans of R. and shooters. Personally speaking, this title has literally bewitched me, it has become a difficult task to part with it. The flaws are there and they make themselves felt, such as the aforementioned problem of the environments (also present in ZOE), the monotony of the mission objectives (but let's face it, in which game are the missions not monotonous?) and then well I think that's all. The missions are many and will keep you busy for a long time, plus the difficulty is calibrated very well so finishing it won't be easy. I repeat: if you love shooters and the world of Macross, you mustn't miss it, but even if you're not, I suggest you take a look at it. Pros: Damn fun Great control system Innovative the possibility of transformation Cons: Small and limited environments In the long run monotonous The Battlecry Robotechwho among you doesn't know this name? I'm damn sure you're reading this review because you too are passionate about the mythical world of Robotech. For those who don't know what it is, I'm going to give a brief explanation: Robotech, the western name of Macross, is the title of a very famous animation series, as well as a Japanese manga. The setting refers a bit to that of Gundam: spaceships, robots, super-technological vehicles will be a routine. For fans of robots and sci-fi settings this is the perfect world. Now let's see in depth what this has to offer usgame, in addition to what its name can make us remember.", "date": "2003-01-29", "grade": null}
