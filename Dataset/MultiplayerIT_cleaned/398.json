{"name": "Dr.Sudoku", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/drsudoku.html", "text": "The simple rules of Sudoku. Before talking about the game itself, let's do a brief introduction on the very simple rules, just to let you understand what kind of puzzle it is. Sudoku is played on a grid of nine squares, which are themselves divided into nine cells. Depending on the level of difficulty, at the beginning we will find a different amount of numbers already entered: it will be our task to be able to fill all the empty boxes until everything is filled. How to figure out which numbers are to be matched? There are only two rules. The first says that a number cannot be placed more than once in a row, horizontally or vertically. The second one says instead that it cannot be written more than once even within one of the nine ~squares~. Playing sudoku mainly means understanding where a figure should be placed without making a mistake. Initially it is possible that the game ~comes back~ even by making mistakes, continuing instead we will find ourselves having to make corrections on those mistakes made previously, forcing us to retrace our steps and start over until we find the right combination. In the first levels it will happen rarely, since the numbers initially present on the screen are numerous. But in the advanced levels the ~plausibly~ correct answers will be many, even if not all of them will then allow us to continue. In these cases a little foresight will be necessary on the part of the player, exactly as happens when calculating moves in chess. The summer catchphrase: modalities and options. Dr.Sudoku is developed by the Japanese Success and published in the West thanks to GameStreet and Digital Bros. Strangely, the game is not localized even if we can count on the instruction booklet completely in Italian, if anything were needed. The difficulty levels are numerous: twenty, each of which contains fifty schemes for a total of 1000 puzzles to solve, not bad in terms of the price - quantity ratio when compared with any puzzle magazine on newsstands or bookstores. There are two game modes, the first is the classic one, the second is called ~Original Mode~ and sees us as protagonists in creating new sudoku puzzles to solve. We start with a completely empty grid and then begin to fill it with numbers, even proceeding at random. On the right we can count on the ~solve automatically~ option to check if our puzzle can actually be completed. After a few thousandths of a second the CPU will give its response: resolvable or not solvable. It will therefore be up to us to make the necessary changes. These works can be saved, tackled, interrupted and resumed at a later time, at our convenience. As well as every match of the classic mode. Better on paper or on the GameBoy? The control system, as can be easily understood, is not exactly perfect for a game like sudoku. To insert a figure we must move the cursor over the desired box, press the ~A~ key and then choose which number to insert from a table that will appear on one side of the graph. A bit cumbersome and slow, for sure. The comparison can be made with the excellent sudoku included in Brain Training, much faster and more intuitive as you can write the number directly on the screen without even touching the directional cross. Returning to the version reviewed here, by pressing the right spine we can access the help. In practice, by selecting a number, indications will appear on the screen that show us where it absolutely cannot be entered, leaving the ~probable~ boxes blank. Thus visualizing the situation it will be easier to understand the exact position. The control system, as can be easily understood, is not exactly perfect for a game like sudoku Better on paper or on the GameBoy? The help is such only in the simplest levels, in the advanced stages of the game it will be almost irrelevant as the white boxes will be too many to give us an idea of how to proceed. The difference with sudoku done on paper is palpable as many players write the numbers lightly in pencil, as if it were a note, only to cancel it if the pattern does not come back. On the GBA screen, all this is not possible and if we make a choice, we must necessarily enter it in the box. In Brain Training there was in fact the ~note~ option which consisted of writing a very small number on the top side of the square where it was to be inserted, just as if it were a memo. The graphics are just a nice frame for Dr.Sudoku. The graphic sector is simple and functional. Despite the GameBoy's small screen, the grid and numbers are clearly visible and defined. Obviously from a title likesudoku this is the least important aspect. Definitely less than the audio one: the music in Dr.Sudoku are three, and all of them unsuitable for the game. Too fast, they are very rhythmic and frenetic, with an electropop style that certainly doesn't help concentration and thought. A more relaxing theme would certainly have been more desirable, in any case our advice is to turn off the sound. It is also possible to choose the ~frame~ to place on the game grid, unfortunately there are only three themes, Dr. Sudoku's graphics didn't have to have much imagination. We are not in the presence of a real video game, you will surely have noticed. For this reason judging this title is very difficult. It proves to be a good game for all fans of the famous Japanese puzzle, while for those who don't like the genre it will be boring, as well as for those who hate puzzles in general. The purchase is warmly recommended to every GBA owner who spends a lot of Euros a week to buy sudoku magazines: with the videogame version they will ensure virtually endless fun, all at the price of the cartridge. For those who have already purchased a Nintendo DS, we recommend waiting for the release of the ~Touch~ version. Pros: Simple and addictive gameplay Practically infinite The only version of Sudoku for GBA Cons: Cumbersome controls There is no ~notes~ option Hateful and inappropriate music Sudoku is a kind of crossword puzzle made with numbers, a very simple game with few rules that you learn quickly. In short, the perfect summer pastime: fast, exciting, it can be done anywhere. Perfect for when we're on the beach under an umbrella! Today we talk about the first version to appear on GameBoy Advance: Dr.Sudoku. If you're not afraid to drop a few grains of sand into your favorite portable console and you're a fan of this Japanese puzzle game, this is the summer title for you!", "date": "2006-07-27", "grade": null}
