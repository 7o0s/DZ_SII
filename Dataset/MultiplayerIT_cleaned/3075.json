{"name": "SpongeBob: Sfida al Krusty", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spongebob-sfida-al-krusty-la-recensione.html", "text": "In this review of SpongeBob: Challenge to the Krusty we will talk about a product that certainly does not invent anything new within the mobile panorama: the latest videogame digression of the most famous cartoon sea sponge is in fact a title that refers to the long tradition of Diner Dash and similar, or those games that require the user to put himself at the stove of a kitchen and satisfy customer orders as quickly as possible. Difficult to bring a breath of fresh air into a genre that has been explored far and wide, especially if you then have to take into account the inevitable compromises related to the free to play nature of the application: however, let's see if SpongeBob: Krusty Challenge with his personality he manages to carve out a prominent place in such an inflated sector. From pancakes to Krabby Patties It all starts from Mr. Krabs' irrepressible craving for money, who decides to set up a pancake kiosk right in front of SpongeBob's house to increase his profits, who obviously throws himself headlong into his new job. This is the trivial starting point for a plot that constitutes an impalpable background to the action, peeping out from time to time with textual dialogues between the characters who honestly really leave the time they find. Instead, what works is undoubtedly the game's graphics, which do an excellent job of carbon copying the cartoon style, resulting pleasant in every component, from the design of the characters to that of the individual menu items. However, it is not in the aesthetic sector that SpongeBob's best qualities are found: Challenge to the Krusty, which masters with discrete wisdom those gameplay elements typical of the genre to which it belongs. The mechanics are always the same: the goal of each internship is to fulfill the needs of customers who show up at the counter, preparing them the food they want as quickly as possible to maximize tips and their satisfaction. All is resolved with taps on some elements of the kitchen, for example to put the meat of hamburgers on the grill or to stuff pancakes: the challenge coefficient lies both in the number of diners which gradually becomes higher and higher, and in the their level of patience which gradually runs out, and in the various preparations which require certain times before being available. In short, one could say that SpongeBob: Challenge to the Krusty perfectly embodies the sense of the motto ~the winning team doesn't change~, even if it deserves applause if only for the commitment shown in trying to offer as much content as possible. In addition to the basic stages that make up the main campaign, there are in fact weekly challenges, online rankings, special events plus a whole series of side elements that stimulate the user to often peep in to see what's new: you can unlock characters, clothing items, equipment to improve the efficiency of the kitchen and even furniture components to make the restaurant more pleasant on duty. So many things that add up, but which obviously don't make up for the innate repetitiveness of very basic gameplay mechanics that can get boring in the long run. However, if we consider that the reference target is a rather young age group, we can turn a blind eye to this limit, while the same cannot be said for the massive presence of advertising and microtransactions: the former are frequent and cannot be skipped, while the latter are felt above all in the advanced stages of the campaign, when the upgrades necessary to continue have exorbitant costs compared to the earnings obtainable by playing. However, these are now standard dynamics for free to play products such as SpongeBob: Krusty Challenge, but the advice is always to disable in-app purchases in the settings of your device if you leave the software in the hands of a minor to avoid the risk of finding yourself with unpleasant charges on your credit card...", "date": "2020-05-25", "grade": "7.0"}
