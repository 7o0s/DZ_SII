Something terrible has happened that has forced the inhabitants of the planet we are on to hole up underground. But now the worst seems to have passed and it is possible to bring them back to the surface, rebuilding the lost civilization starting from new principles, which avoid the mistakes of the past. Before We Leave, as we will see in the course of the review, starts from a simple and in its own way intriguing concept: declining the city builder / 4X genre in a pacifist key. Will he have made it? Gameplay Our society will rise again As soon as a game has started, the first thing to do is to ensure that our fellow citizens have water and food, and therefore that they become familiar with the world around them, all to be discovered. After years spent underground they are a bit fearful, but you have to explore if you want to recover the knowledge of the past. Fortunately, there is a rich tutorial to help them, which also sets the objectives to be achieved (construct a certain building, carry out a certain research and so on). After a few minutes of playing, you realize that there are actually no dangers to fear: it's us with our population that needs to grow and prosper, until we can colonize space. The game world is divided into hexes and a building or road can be built on each hex. There are many buildings to be constructed, they increase with technological research (represented by the classic tree of discoveries) and must be positioned in such a way as to get the most out of them in terms of production, both to accelerate growth and to avoid making the citizens unhappy. Between a vegetable garden and a foundry, between an orchard and a library, after almost an hour of play you should be ready to set sail with a colony ship, so as to go in search of another island on which to expand. As already mentioned, the absence of dangers makes the general atmosphere very relaxed, a feeling which also contributes to the graphic style, which is really pleasant and well-finished. However, the economic system is very simplified compared to the canons of the genre, so much so that once an island has reached certain equilibriums, it is almost possible to forget it. Having said that, having reached the second island, we find a disused space rocket. After growing up a little more, adding factories, creating trade routes to exchange raw materials and goods between the islands, building new houses, new fields to cultivate and more wells, it's time to repair the high-tech vehicle to leave for space, so as to expand beyond the borders of our planet of origin and go and discover the reason for the catastrophe that had forced us underground, all without forgetting to combat pollution, which makes our citizens unhappy, and without ignoring scientific development, the only one that can give us access to the most advanced production buildings. In the meantime we can also go to the discovery of new repositories of knowledge from the past (repositories of red and green material), which are unique in allowing us to start new scientific research in libraries. A pacifist city builder... or boring? We are in space Before We Leave yields in the middle distance, when it starts to get stuck on its formula, which creates considerable lengths in the progression and which never offers a real challenge. The desire to create a pacifist city builder without controversial mechanics has led to watering down many of the concepts that underlie the genre, which in itself should have reality as a trace, or should replace it with something equally articulated and credible. Here we just build, with the game asking us to accept loopholes, probably created for ideological issues, without giving us much in terms of an alternative general vision, i.e. the rendering of a model of society that is not only plausible, but also desirable, which is not the known one. Let's take an example: the only way to increase the population of a settlement is to build a school. For what reason? Why can't a settlement with plenty of resources and started production grow in population without a school building? Have you ever been to the poorest parts of the world? Naturally it is a constraint that the developers have imposed, hypothetically acceptable on its own, except that findings of the kind seem to want to compensate for shortcomings, such as the absence of weight of interpersonal relationships between the inhabitants of the islands, which find no representation only in individual happiness, but also in constructible buildings, apart from a couple, which are obtained after a few hours of play (in fact one wonders why to build a meeting place there is a need for technvery advanced technologies, when in fact every form of urbanization, even the most ancient ones, provided for meeting places between people). An advanced building It seems that our survivors only want to eat and produce, possibly in a slightly polluted environment, despite their fact sheets describing the desires and vices of living beings. Of course, knowing that an inhabitant loves the mountains can be interesting, but if this has no weight on the gameplay, the information is an end in itself. Another example is the aforementioned absence of enemies or other obstacles other than the ways in which to build to make the most of the territory. Well, without opponents or disputes, all the more political part of the genre disappears, the one that usually allows you to orient society in the direction chosen by the player. There is only one possible system of government here, which is not even described, but taken for granted. In reality, there is an enemy for our virtual fellow citizens and it manifests itself when settlements are created on other planets: we are talking about the gigantic space whales that have a bad tendency to eat what we have built. Naturally it is not possible to fight them directly, otherwise the pacifist spirit of the game would be lost, but there is a way out to limit or eliminate the damage they can cause: build special infrastructures that attract their attention, distracting it from other buildings. The problem is that the solution is all here: single enemy (more of a nuisance, actually), a single system to deal with it to be repeated without thinking too much about it wherever necessary. Before We Leave quickly becomes repetitive The conclusion is that the games of Before We Leave are all very similar to each other and after finishing a campaign, i.e. after having colonized the space, there is very little left to do or try, because in the next game only the colonizable territories change, which they are procedurally generated, where the actions to be performed to manage growth are identical and must be performed in more or less the same order (apart from some minimal variations made possible by the skimpy technological tree). To improve the picture a little, breaking up the monotony, we take care of the scenarios, which offer small variations on the theme. For example, in one you have to go around space hunting for seeds for crops, while another serves as a prequel to the actual game and makes you understand why the inhabitants took refuge underground. Nice, except that there are only four.", "date": "2021-05-13", "grade": "5.5"}
