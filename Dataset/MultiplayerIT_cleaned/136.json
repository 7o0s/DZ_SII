{"name": "Rainbow Six: Las Vegas", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-las-vegas.html", "text": "Following a consolidated practice, the three-dimensional version for PC has become a two-dimensional title seen from above in three quarters on the mobile phone, every movement and action is managed through the omnipresent pointer that changes in shape and color depending on the context and possible interactivity with the element on which it is placed, therefore on a door you can decide which type of irruption to organize or on an enemy it informs you of the feasibility of the assault. The golden rule that discretion is the best weapon also applies here, as in Splinter Cell, stealthily slaughtering a terrorist instead of coming out with a dangerous hail of bullets will save both the team and the hostage, in many situations at the first sign of suspicious movements, the kidnappers will unceremoniously get rid of the cumbersome burden. Here and there in the corridors, very rarely in truth, you may come across crates containing extra weapons such as grenades and flashbangs, these are not very discreet but which will clear the field in rooms infested with entire groups of this rabble. You will do well to keep an eye out for strange vibrations in panels and manhole covers, the enemy is always lurking... Each mission is divided into key objectives to be solved in succession and to which the sniper mode adds that variety that serves to break the tension of the stealth approach, for the rest it is a matter of infiltrating, defeating and freeing hostages. You can replay the previous missions trying to improve yourself, also because when one of your companions dies it's forever and it's convenient to find one more man. PRO Well shaken mix of strategy and adrenaline Lives up to the mark AGAINST The phone is not a mouse", "date": "2007-01-28", "grade": "S.V."}
