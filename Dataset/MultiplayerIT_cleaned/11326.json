{"name": "Pixudoku", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pixudoku.html", "text": "Pixudoku is in fact the latest addition to the Paper Puzzles series, i.e. a set of mobile titles characterized by a definitely pleasant and original ~pen and paper~ graphic style. The protagonist of this article is obviously no exception, putting on the screen only a background that reproduces a squared paper and a pencil that intervenes to fill in the spaces selected by the user. A simple but effective solution, and in some ways decidedly more pleasant than those adopted by similar products. Apart from the visual aspect, Pixudoku does not differ particularly from the playful structure that we have come to know and appreciate in Picross: the player's task will therefore be to compose a ~hidden~ drawing under a grid of small squares which must be suitably colored according to logic . On each of the lines and files that line the game box there are in fact one or more numbers that indicate how many blocks to score, and the key lies in trying to do it by making as few mistakes as possible. Pixudoku has three difficulty levels, corresponding to as many stage containers: in this case, there are 20 for each, and it is necessary to complete at least half of them to move on to the next step. The developers have also taken care to make the playful experience with Pixudoku particularly accessible, trying to get around the problem of frustration: in this sense the three suggestions available for each level and the possibility of abandoning the puzzle at any time must be interpreted tackling and resuming work at a later stage without losing one's progress. As is evident, Pixudoku has several strings to its bow, being able to count on an appreciable technical realization and valid content from the point of view of gameplay. However, the structure of the individual stages is very important in such a title, which in the Synergenix title does not disappoint: the various designs are quite varied, both in terms of the nature of the objects described and in terms of the structural difficulty of the puzzles, which they never turn out to be impossible while guaranteeing a good level of challenge. The only real criticism that can be moved to Pixudoku concerns the scarce (not to say non-existent) acknowledgments that are given to the user as one proceeds: in fact, there are neither extra materials to unlock nor particular scores to beat, which quite significantly limits the longevity and depth of the product.
