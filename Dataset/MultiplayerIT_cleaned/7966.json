Surely the return of Yukes's inside the wrestling ring will have aroused some interest in several fans. We are in fact talking about the company that created all the licensed wrestling games from 2000 to 2018, but above all the author of the ever more nostalgically mentioned WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain. After 2K decided to develop WWE games in-house, Yuke's turned to AEW, the rival company of the McMahon family which offers weekly television shows now of global interest. So will THQ Nordic have succeeded in bringing a valid alternative to WWE 2K23 to the market? Let's find out in the review of AEW: Fight Forever. Back to the Future AEW: Fight Forever, fights at maximum power Let's start by saying that yes, Yuke's hasn't lost the ability to offer an all-round experience in the world of wrestling. It is undeniable that what had magnetically captured the fans of the discipline many years ago is also present in this AEW: Fight Forever. There won't be the managerial depth of the various Smackdown vs Raw, but you will surely find the fun of the games of the early 2000s. The idea behind this new wrestling title is simple: to offer fans the possibility of having a great variety in their hands of options to choose from. All aimed at creating an experience as close as possible to the players' imagination. From simple 1v1 and 2v2, to the more canonical matches with weapons and cages, passing through the AEW trademarks such as the Casino Battle Royale. As in the TV shows, even in the virtual counterpart there is no shortage of blood and brutality with barbed sticks, explosives, pins and incendiary tables. Also interesting is the possibility of facing mini-games, more arcade than the classic matches that offer hilarious gimmicks to pass the time. From this point of view, there is nothing to say. The transposition is faithful and indeed the entertainment is really tasty and profound. The ability to create hilarious, but also epic moments is all there and depends only on the player. This element is not insignificant, given that over the years it has been at the center of requests from wrestling fans. Therefore, having removed the offline and online experience (private, random and ranked matches), linked to the fun of single matches, to complete the park of modes present there is the possibility of making creations (fighters, arenas, entrances, etc.), a shop to use with in-game currency and the Road to Elite mode, which is the equivalent of the career mode. Playable with either an existing or a created superstar, AEW: Fight Forever's Prince Mode is a reminder of Yuke's past. In fact, we are in a classic climb to success, with our protagonist who will have to take on the role of the freshman under the aegis of the Khan family and will have to fight until he competes for the position of GOAT. Nothing that hasn't already been seen of course, but still an always pleasant way to carry on your choices. The segments in the changing rooms and backstage are back and a whole series of nods to the nostalgics who have made us smile several times, reminding us of the experiences of the early 2000s. A lame gameplay AEW: Fight Forever: a pinfall to the limit Once you leave the menu, the idyll of the nostalgic dive into the past brutally comes to terms with various elements out of focus. The first problem is certainly the visual one: AEW: Fight Forever is certainly not an experience in step with the times. The impression is that of seeing the Jakks puppets fight in the ring. In 2003 these articulated action figures were depopulated among the kids with which to create wrestling matches with friends. Well in AEW: Fight Forever there is constantly the impression of moving large puppets, which also seem to be made of plastic. In short, woodiness and patina make AEW: Fight Forever not the most beautiful game of the generation. To accompany all this there is the surreal choice not to offer complete entries from the athletes, but a reduced version that breaks the magic in our opinion. There is no doubt that wrestler entrances are one of the most iconic elements of the world of wrestling so why miss these moments? With such a large parterre of memorable entries both for music and for movements, this own goal is inexplicable. AEW: Fight Forever: suplexes galore Pad in hand, the game offers an enigmatic experience. The movements are not very fluid and the move park of the wrestlers, although it certainly takes up some of the most iconic shots of the superstars, is very limited. Excellentinteractions with different environmental elements, but the general feeling is that of having a jammed Ferrari. As proof of this, there is a rather cumbersome and not very intuitive key mapping. X/A for grappling, square/X for punches and triangle/Y for kicks, in addition to the two upper backs used for parrying grappling (left) and striking (right). A particular system that goes against the trend of what is done by both rivals and other fight titles. The choice therefore obliges an unusual cumbersomeness, mainly due to the separation between kicks and punches. We would therefore have preferred a vision similar to what was done by 2K with the assignment of light and powerful blows, but we understand that the choice is dictated by the absence of a large number of moves for the wrestlers. As for the roster instead, we are faced with just enough wrestlers. The TV show, in fact, gives the opportunity to see AEW wrestlers fighting with Ring of Honor and New Japan Pro Wrestling. In the video game, however, for a matter of licenses, the external federations will be completely absent and you will have to settle for the AEW ones. We will see what the future holds, or if some DLC will fix the situation or if we will have to wait for a new chapter. At present this is a rather limiting element.", "date": "2023-06-28", "grade": "6.5"}
