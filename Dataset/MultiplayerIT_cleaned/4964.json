But let's not draw hasty conclusions and proceed in order. Set in the Scandinavian woods of the middle of the last century, Troll and I tells the story of the young Otto who, having survived the destruction of his village, is saved by a large troll from the attack of some mysterious creatures, which have escaped from a luminous opening in the ground. The two immediately become friends and set off on a mission that will lead them to clash against very dangerous human enemies, led by a shady figure who wants to capture the creature, and fantastic ones, whose nature we will learn in the advanced stages of the adventure. The presence of two such different protagonists should have already made you understand that the fulcrum of the gameplay is in their collaboration. Too bad that, despite the many interesting ideas, Troll and I does not succeed well in anything it proposes, starting from the narrative side. The good premise is in fact wasted by a writing unable to make the relationship between Otto and the troll at least interesting, who throughout the game seem like two friends by chance united only by their hairstyle. The story itself quickly loses its edge, as you immediately understand where it is going with and fails to exploit even the classic clichs of stories with asymmetrical friendships well. However, if you haven't been discouraged by reading this far, then brace yourself, because there's worse. We played Troll and I: It's Bad, and we're not trolling, read on to find out why So many mechanics if one worked well Troll and I is an ambitious title. This can be understood by the amount of mechanics that compose it. Too bad none of them work well. You start by guiding Otto in a short hunting sequence where you have to catch wild boars. The source of inspiration seems to be the simulators like theHunter, despite some splashes of survival (which will become more evident in the later stages). Otto has to make spears for himself using sticks found around the woods, then he has to examine the tracks left by the wild boars (footprints, excrement) to find them. Finally, without making himself heard, he must get close enough to skewer them. The system itself is quite limited and has several problems, the first of which is the change of the color palette after the identification of the tracks, which paradoxically makes it more difficult to identify the prey, when by logic the opposite should happen (as happens in simulators of hunting). All right, we said to ourselves, it's the first sequence. It's very bland, but perhaps only serves as a prologue. It will improve... In fact, the second and third are much worse. Returning to the village with his prey, Otto finds it engulfed in flames. His mother comes up to him and dissuades him from approaching. Although there are no major obstacles between them and she is seriously risking her life, Otto the lionheart does not say twice and runs away, starting an obstacle course in which you have to press the action key at the right time to pass over or under some fallen trees. Bugs and difficult camera management didn't stop us from succeeding and we arrived at our first fantastic creatures to slay. We killed a few by finally trying the combat system which is basically based on pressing a single key, with a second key needed to parry the blows of the opponents. However, before we became friends with the troll we had to go through another sequence with obstacles to avoid, placed in a particularly punishing way (how many times did we crash on the rocks before we got to the bottom?), and we fought again. So the real couple's adventure began, and the problems multiplied, despite the fact that no wedding was celebrated. Who is the troll? Since a malfunctioning stealth system and combat system weren't enough, the developers decided it was time to make using the troll one of the most frustrating experiences of the year. Basically, the big beast can hit, grab large objects and use some powers, such as healing or a chilling scream that freezes opponents. The problem is that if Otto hadn't already seemed very agile to us, unable as he is to pass through even very wide gaps or to climb rocks that aren't too high (basically he abandoned his mother to the flames despite the fact that there was only a tree to divide themerello), the troll is a real giant pustule with awkward movements, not at all interesting to use. The bad thing is that his presence also worsens some aspects that hadn't already exalted us. Take the combat system: using Otto it is far too limited, but with the troll it becomes really ridiculous, given that one punch is enough for the beast to eliminate most of the creatures and that, in fact, selecting it when you have to fight is always the most convenient choice for most of the adventure. Sometimes you wonder what's the use of hunting around for items to make Otto's most powerful weapons (that's all survival Troll and I has to offer), when there is the troll who can solve situations with more effective and faster. From the point of view of collaboration between the two, the situation does not improve. Basically the artificial intelligence of both is almost nothing. The inactive character only follows the active one if recalled, otherwise he stands still. The troll can take Otto on his shoulders, which is the best solution to move faster, and both fight, with poor results, even when moved by the CPU, but otherwise they are two hopeless stockfishes (here the comparison with Trico and the its plausible and, above all, autonomous behaviors). Getting them to work together, on the other hand, results in a mere matter of figuring out who to use first and who next to solve a given puzzle. Don't expect big headaches, because most of the puzzles require you to reach certain platforms or move certain objects. In short, there is nothing really original to do and it soon becomes clear that the presence of two characters is underexploited. If you haven't figured it out yet, the game system is very rigid indeed. Just think: it becomes even more so when you try the co-op mode. As? Well, you don't cooperate. The puzzles of this mode remain exactly those of the single player mode. This means that they require the alternating use of the two characters, to which entire sections are often dedicated. Alone it doesn't matter, but in cooperative it becomes a torment, because when one character acts, the other can only stand by and do nothing. Beautiful, is not it? It's not the height of excitement, in fact (not even to describe it). Even the fights don't seem designed for cooperation, given that the imbalance of forces between the two characters gives a huge advantage to whoever leads the troll, who can very well take care of doing all the work. The bottom line is that the cooperative mode appears really superfluous and poorly implemented. A few hairs and little more Even from a technical point of view Troll and I is not convincing. If it were sold for a few euros, we would gladly turn a blind eye, but the price is that of a triple A and therefore expectations are very different. The troll is the best thing, with convincing fuzz and a nice face, but the compliments stop there. The rest is a complete disaster: the creatures, human and otherwise, are poorly detailed and badly animated, the scenarios are very poor in style and detail and appear mostly dead. Some of the visual solutions adopted would have disfigured on the consoles of the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 generation, and honestly a certain way of building the settings is no longer conceivable: everything seems terribly artificial. It's not just a question of visual richness, but of the conception of space, which never goes beyond the level with things to do. If we also add that on PC the fluidity is not exceptional and that all versions are plagued by glitches and bugs, as well as problems with the cameras, the masterpiece is served. Even the soundtrack does not go beyond mediocrity, with some catchy songs but no form of enhancement of the sounds: the music is limited to accompanying and the sound effects to be there, so to speak. Probably the development team has taken the classic step that takes the longest of its leg, trying to try their hand at a project that needed far more resources to succeed. As it stands we struggle to find anyone Troll and I might like.", "date": "2017-03-30", "grade": "3.0"}
