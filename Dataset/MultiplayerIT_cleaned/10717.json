While it's not a completely new concept, as it's very similar to the gameplay of EyeToy and Live Vision Camera games, it's a first for a portable console. The most attractive and most appealing title present at the launch of the DSi Shop, the exclusive online store of the new portable from the Kyoto house, is certainly WarioWare Snapped!, the latest exponent of a series of collections of demented minigames that have touched practically all consoles Nintendo from the GBA onwards. Little Wario On this occasion Wario was bothered precisely to demonstrate one of the most substantial innovations of the DSi, or rather the integrated cameras and their application in playful fields; all the mini-games present are in fact linked to the need to perform actions while being filmed by the camera positioned inside the console. Precisely for this reason Snapped! it requires, a decidedly unusual factor for a handheld, to place the handset on a table or in any case on a stable surface without therefore holding it in your hand. Another fundamental requirement, given the limited capabilities of the camera, is to be in a well-lit environment and with a uniform background behind you; a factor that frankly quite irritating, given that more often than not you can find yourself fighting against windmills in the face of the software's inability to recognize the user. For example, in our test, the artificial lighting of a room that was anything but dark was not enough, and only by using the software during the day with sunlight were we able to play. In case you manage to make everything work, you can try your hand at one of the 4 sets of minigames available; as per tradition, these are very short demented and particularly amusing sequences, and in this case it is necessary to interact by blowing, moving the hands in particular ways or the whole body. And so we find ourselves greeting a friend, collecting coins or playing hide and seek with a baby, for a total of 20 mini-games in total; therefore for the first time, a game for a portable console requires an interaction and a physicality that until now we were used to associate with living room titles with EyeToy, Live Vision Camera or the Wii itself. At the end of each ~level~ you are rewarded with a short photo story made up of your own images, adapted in an absolutely hilarious way in different contexts from those in which they were taken. In this sense, it is a real pity that the possibility of saving them in any way is not provided, a factor that clashes with the presence of an SD slot in the console. In general though, WarioWare Snapped! it really offers too little to be considered an official and complete release of the franchise; it takes just a few minutes to see all that the product has to offer, and the incentives to go back to playing soon become few, thus relegating the product to the anything but pleasant circle of tech demos.", "date": "2009-05-21", "grade": "6.2"}
