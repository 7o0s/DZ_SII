The enemy of the Green Army is the Black Army, which must be destroyed before it destroys us again. A bit like happens in Risk. On these simple premises, Super Trench Attack! go from one gag to another without shame. Some jokes make you laugh, others less so, and still others are frankly absurd, but the game doesn't give up, and thanks to this stubbornness in reiterating his style he manages to make us passionate about his world. On the other hand, between one mission and another we spend a lot of time at the base camp, where we can rest in our tent and admire the trinkets collected during the missions, visit shops (which sell very few interesting items) and above all chat with crazy fellow soldiers, which you end up quickly becoming attached to. Interestingly, a certain consistency ties the lunatic protagonists of the Green Army to their enemies. On the other hand, only madmen of the same ilk could dig trenches in the ground to kill each other with rifle shots. Unfortunately for us, we are really the balance of this war. And we have to fight. Super Trench Attack! is a sympathetic comedy that loses its audience as soon as it takes up arms Nothing new on the western front It seems counterintuitive, but it's just when he gets serious that Super Trench Attack! loses its audience. The missions, which are the gist of the game, are also the least successful part. The problem is the naivety of the actions. With the arrow keys we move our soldier, while with the mouse we aim at the enemies. There is almost no challenge, because the opponents just come to meet us. The variety of soldiers is also very limited. The only ones who can put a spoke in our works are those armed with a shield, but it is enough to throw a grenade or shoot them in the feet to get rid of them. The animations and shouts of the soldiers hit are nice but they repeat identically until the end of the game, soon ending up tiring. It is therefore a question of running from point A to point B of the level by shooting everything that comes under fire. If we take the trouble to upgrade the models of the pistol and rifle between missions, which is simple since we earn plenty of money, dying is a rare event. In case we die, however, the game makes us start over immediately from the beginning of the level, saving the progress made up to that moment. Therefore, thanks also to the help of our mute companion, within three hours at the most we will have finished Super Trench Attack!. Without ever a significant change in the game system and above all without ever having enjoyed a moment of tension. One cannot speak of negligence, because the will to keep the interest high is noted, but the efforts are reduced to side elements that are not enough to revive a game system that is too trivial and repetitive. The impression, unfortunately, is that of playing a browser game full of embellishments that should justify its marketing. Too little in front of the flood of excellent titles that crowd the Steam showcase. Flurry of ideas The level structure is another sore point of Super Trench Attack!. Uninspired and linear, it is often repeated in the various missions. Only between one act and another is there a variation on the theme, even if the changes are almost only aesthetic. Yet despite its obvious limitations, Super Trench Attack! it is not to be rejected. The boss fights, for example, each have their own particularity, and also offer a minimum of challenge. Even target shooting with a first person view is a pleasant diversion, which perhaps should have been used more to break up the monotony of the main action. Another point in favor of Super Trench Attack! is the presence of an RPG component, which allows us to assign points to four skills every time we level up. Also in this case the speech made for other aspects of the game is valid: the excessive simplification soon makes the interest in yet another gimmick fired blind in the hope of keeping the player's interest aroused. Yet, precisely because it bombards us relentlessly, Super Trench Attack! scores a few hits. It doesn't happen often, but it's enough to save him from the brink.", "date": "2014-08-08", "grade": "6.0"}
