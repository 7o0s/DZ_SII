{"name": "Emergency Mayhem - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/emergency-mayhem-recensione.html", "text": "Gameplay emergency Although not exactly original, the premises of Emergency Mayhem appear, at least on paper, quite interesting: within the chaotic scenario of Crisis City, a city literally in disarray, the user must get behind the wheel of three different public utility vehicles (a police car, a fire truck and an ambulance) and solve a whole series of emergencies in the shortest possible time. In fact, a countdown stands out inexorably in a corner of the screen, signaling the need to reach one's destination in a hurry and to complete the various objectives in order to extend the time available by a certain number of extra seconds. As is evident, the basic setting is reminiscent of the aforementioned Crazy Taxy, also thanks to the free roaming nature of the Codemasters product and the presence of a large arrow to indicate the direction to follow. Unlike the Sega racing game, however, in Emergency Mayhem you don't just quickly reach a variety of points on the game map, but you need to complete a whole series of minigames that correspond to as many crisis situations that afflict various areas of the city : success in this area leads to the accumulation of points, the reduction of the so-called mayhem meter (which testifies to the level of chaos within the city) and the aforementioned increase in the countdown. Emergency Mayhem's long list of flaws starts right from the minigames Gameplay emergency It's a pity that Emergency Mayhem's -long- list of flaws starts right from the minigames, which may initially appear pleasant but which soon reveal all their shortcomings. To begin with, the mini-games are too little varied, resulting immediately repetitive and literally leading the user to nausea; not only that, these playful fractions are also distinguished by a bad response to the movements of the Remote and by an absolutely unbalanced level of difficulty, to the point of making some tests almost unplayable. From anthology, in this sense, a minigame that requires you to use a magnet to make a nail travel through the digestive system of the unfortunate person on duty: pointing via Remote is in this case so inaccurate as to prevent even the most skilled of players from having success without breaking a sweat. In short, whether it is to put out a fire, defuse a bomb or revive an injured person, Emergency Mayhem miserably fails its purpose. Turbulent past If the name Emergency Mayhem doesn't sound new, there's a very specific reason: the game was officially announced by Acclaim in 2002, only to be frozen by the company's bankruptcy. Temporarily ~resurrected~ by the intervention of THQ who took over the rights and planned its development for Playstation 2 and Xbox, it was canceled shortly after, and was finally taken over by Codemasters who oversaw the exclusive development for Nintendo Wii. May(hem) and then may(hem) Certainly the minigames are not the only problem of Emergency Mayhem, which seems to do everything to make itself detestable. The Codemasters product amazes (negatively) first of all for the poverty of the play offer: everything you do in the game is reduced to wandering around the eight skimpy city districts, completing the aforementioned mini-games and in the meantime undergoing an avalanche of filler-missinis that they only require you to go from point A to point B. A bleak panorama, topped off with bonuses with unclear effects and some totally contradictory choices by the developers: for example, it is not clear why the user is rewarded when he invests pawns, if it is true that his task would be to stem the chaos rather than foment it. Add to the whole a control system that prevents you from driving your vehicle decently and it will become clear how Emergency Mayhem is a seriously inadequate product from a playful point of view. The situation is certainly not facilitated by the technical realization of the product, which does nothing to hide the fact that it was conceived six years ago. Emergency Mayhem seems to go out of its way to make itself loathsome May(hem) and then may(hem) Graphically, Emergency Mayhem would have disfigured even on PlayStation 2, with its laughable load of polygon counts, washed-out textures and characters devoid of details and equipped with woody animations: there is not the slightest hint of care in the cosmetics of the Codemasters product, which can quietly be defined as one of the most visually disappointing titles of the current generation. And yes, even the sound does its duty in sinking Emergency Mayhem, thanks to irritating effects and music that force you to mute the volume after a couple of listens. A section closes this little roundup of horrorsone multiplayer that gets no other result than to extend the suffering to more than one player... Comment Emergency Mayhem is a doubly unfortunate title, both for its stormy production process and for the poor implementation of a series of decidedly good ideas on paper. This translates into a technically primitive and incomplete product from the point of view of gameplay, thanks to an approximate play structure, an extreme underlying repetitiveness and a truly imprecise control system. Practically nothing is saved in Emergency Mayhem, which is why its purchase can only be advised against. Pros Good idea on paper Cons Irritating minigames Gameplay leaks everywhere Technically very poor", "date": "2008-06-13", "grade": null}
