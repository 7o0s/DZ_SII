Nothing more wrong, of course. The game created by Marco Mazzoli, while sharing many of the aesthetic and conceptual choices of the successful Bizzarre Creation title, heavily manages to diversify thanks to completely original mechanics. You play a small droid, catapulted into a rectangular arena continually undermined by waves of enemies to be killed: ~What's new?~, one might ask. Yet it is precisely at this moment that the first and biggest difference emerges: the player will never be able to shoot. The only solution to get rid of stubborn visitors is in fact to draw circles with the wake of your ship, in order to open portals capable of sucking in everything that enters them. This simple idea thus allows you to approach the game in two different ways: you can decide to draw a circle around an enemy, absorbing him instantly, or to predict his trajectory and create a black hole in front of him. With skillful movements it is also possible to create larger portals, capture more opponents at the same time and bring home rich bonuses: however, such maneuvers require greater speed, to the detriment of precision which in the more advanced levels becomes indispensable if you want to survive. Almost perfect alchemy In keeping with the tradition of the genre, the game will get more and more difficult with each new wave, as the attackers will multiply until they cover the entire screen. The lack of boss battles is fortunately partly compensated by a great variety of enemies: some will just wander aimlessly in the arena, others will chase the player or move in formation, still others will try to surround him or hit him with their queue, while evil turrets will try to pulverize it with dangerous laser beams. There are no power-ups, but occasionally enemies may appear that drag an extra life: to conquer it you will need to be very careful and try to capture the opponent without also sucking up his precious burden. From time to time, the continuous waves will be interrupted by some bonus levels, which will allow the player to catch his breath and skyrocket his score. Everything works great, until the perfect alchemy fails in the most excited moments of the game: with the increase of enemies on the screen, it could often happen that you cover some of them with your index finger, thus ending up not having a complete vision of what is happening . A bit like playing Geometry Wars by pasting a huge sticker on the monitor. Fortunately, it is possible to adjust the sensitivity of the movements and allow more experienced players to move more quickly and precisely, although this is not enough to solve the problem: after a handful of levels, managing not to lose all the lives in about twenty seconds will become a real challenge. Visually Spirit reproposes tried and tested stakes: from the black background to the game grid, from the neon graphics to the thousand deformations and particle effects. And yet, the iPhone title manages to live up to the works that inspire it stylistically: everything appears very clean, further enhanced by the splendid music of Christian Bhlke. The only game mode present can be tackled at two different levels of difficulty, while each wave is generated randomly, ensuring that each game is always different from the previous one. Furthermore, to further satisfy those who love to challenge themselves, the author has decided to implement the OpenFeint libraries, which offer global and periodic rankings, friends lists and integration with various social networks.
