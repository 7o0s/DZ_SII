{"name": "ElecHead", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/elechead-recensione.html", "text": "When we think of indie games, we usually think of works created by Western teams. Japan, for many the homeland of video games, does not seem to be a primary source of independent productions, but small intriguing works also emerge from Japanese soil that deserve our attention. An example is ElecHead, a minimal puzzle game that will convince fans of the genre. In the ElecHead review we will explain why. Electricity ElecHead puts us in the shoes of a small robot charged with electricity. The whole Earth is in darkness and our job is to bring back the light. To do that, we have to explore a small but intricate structure. The narrative component is minimal, just a hint to give context to the game world. ElecHead is pure gameplay, in fact, and doesn't waste even a second doing anything else. The game, structured in 2D, is divided into screens, which will require our character (and consequently us) to jump here and there and rack their brains to figure out how to reach the next area. The robot carries an electric charge and if it comes into contact with one of the surfaces, be it a wall, floor or ceiling, it will transmit this charge to the related objects. The electric charge is our ally, as it allows additional platforms to appear and activate elevators, but it is also our enemy, as it activates traps ready to blow us up. In each room of ElecHead it is therefore necessary to understand what to touch and what not, to activate the aids and avoid the dangers. Obviously, while jumping and being in the air we don't activate anything, so we can take advantage of the movements to not interact with the environment. Furthermore, having passed an initial phase of training, we will obtain the ability to throw our head: it is in fact the latter that carries the electric charge with it, therefore, by separating from it, we will be able to activate distant elements, but also to overcome objects that would be activated, eliminating us, if they received the electrical energy contained by it. Be careful, though, because you have 10 seconds to get back to your head. ElecHead uses these few ideas to create a myriad of ingenious levels, which always require a moment of reasoning, without ever becoming too complex or brainy. In total, we needed less than two hours to reach the end credits, but if we wanted we could have searched for the lost collectibles (we found about half of them, on the first go) and in search of an additional secret area, which we admit we haven't really found. Regardless of the precise playing time, ElecHead offers a good number of levels, all of which are very quick to complete. Note that the platform side of the adventure is the least relevant. The game is mostly based on understanding which movements to perform and does not focus on the difficulty of execution, except in very rare occasions (three or four at the most) where it is actually necessary to try to guess the timing. ElecHead is therefore first and foremost a puzzle game and is intended for fans of this genre. Second by second, ElecHead offers us new ideas, which extend what we have learned up to that moment. The exploration is linear, as - in addition to the occasional rooms of collectibles - the direction to follow to go forward with the adventure is always clear for most of the game. There are also teleport points, to aid in the search for collectibles, but there is no map, so it is likely that players who normally struggle to find their way around may ~get lost~ in the maze of rooms on their second go. Technically minimal ElecHead: the character throws his head upwards, in the middle of fireballs The graphics don't help. ElecHead is an indie game with an extremely simple design, but for this repetitive: after a while it seems to be always in the same place. Minimal is probably the most correct term, as there is hardly a single excess element, just a few robotic bodies, of beings similar to our protagonist who have probably perished during our own journey. Exclusive to the latter, every object you see on the screen has a playful purpose: this makes reading the environments very simple and there is never even a second of doubt as to whether a certain visual element is or is not relevant to solving the puzzle. Sonically, the music is repetitive, but not to the point of being unpleasant. They lack real narration, there is no voice acting and every in-game message is expressed through drawings, which overcome any language barrier.", "date": "2021-10-29", "grade": "7.7"}
