{"name": "Un salto all'inferno!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/146343-helldivers-un-salto-allinferno.html", "text": "Helldivers is a real homage to Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers. The cooperative shooter from Arrowhead Game Studios, the creators of Magicka, puts us in the shoes of an infantryman from Super Earth, intent on exporting democracy to every corner of the universe with nuclear bombs, shouting ~the only insect good is a dead bug!~ Just like the film, only the not too veiled militaristic criticism inherent in the film here is the ~motivational~ basis for a complex and rewarding sci-fi shooter with an almost role-playing development of one's alter ego. Classless, but packed with active and passive skills to unlock, extra weapons and attacks to deploy on the battlefield as you level up. Helldivers is an interesting and complex shooter to be played necessarily together with other friends A galaxy to conquer Basically we could play Helldivers even alone, but this eventuality is absolutely to be avoided for several reasons. The level of difficulty is definitely set upwards, even the first missions, those signed with ~walk in the park~ can be almost prohibitive, but above all because some game mechanics can take on punitive aspects, without forgetting that the super repetitive nature, almost at the limit of grinding, some objectives seem to be made to be tackled as a team, giving us well-defined tasks. It's all about conquering the galaxy, planet after planet. Here Arrowhead Games drops the ace. If the procedurally generated missions don't shine for variety, indeed we can say that they don't shine at all, to keep the player's interest alive there is the so-called multiplayer Galactic Campaign. Every time a planet is freed, our enterprise is ~loaded~ into the galactic war map, thus changing the strategic situation in real time. But it's not just us humans who play behind a PlayStation. The enemy will try to fight back, triggering events where we are asked to defend a planet from invasion. These sorts of ~instances~ are particularly useful since they make us earn double the experience compared to simple missions. We can repel the attack or succumb, lose a planet or conquer it, in a sort of continuous galactic push and pull that compensates for the chronic lack of variety in the battles. All played on conquer-defend-active and so on. But how do you export democracy to the most remote corners of the galaxy? The developers have set up a well thought out growth and development system that allows us to indulge ourselves to create the perfect Super Earth soldier. As the level increases, new weapons and research tokens are obtained, useful for adding real perks to our armory and above all to stratagems. Nothing elaborate, such as reduced recoil, armor piercing, range and range of rifles, but all have a significant and rewarding impact on the field. The customization is there and it works and pushes us to play hard to get as many tokens as possible. Despite decidedly repetitive mechanics. Stratagems, the real protagonists of the game, are support actions that can be called into battle by throwing a sort of radio beacon similar to a grenade. We go from orbital bombardments, to the fundamental possibility of reviving teammates, passing through extra ammunition, automatic support turrets or nuclear bombs to destroy insect nests. More than the actual gunplay, indeed decidedly basic conceptually similar to a dual stick shooter, where then the artificial intelligence of the enemies, be they insects or cyborgs, is decidedly underdeveloped, the real secret of victory is what to parachute into battle. Playstation 4 trophies In addition to the Platinum of ~completeness~ Helldivers rewards the player with 31 trophies, ten of bronze, 5 of gold, and the remaining silver. The bronze is decidedly simple, it is obtained simply with the progression, while the silver trophies engage us in much more complex and concerted actions. Among the gold trophies, a ~kill 100,000 enemies~ stands out, far more than the 10,000 it takes to take home a silver. Konami Code I hate you It's just a shame that Arrowhead Game Studios has chosen an all too complicated, almost ~criminal~ way to activate them. That is, hold down L1 and set a sequence of keys with the digital cross, in a sort of real Konami Code with numerous pressures that we must necessarily memorize in order not to be forced to read them during a fight, where then there is no possibility to pause. It is easy to understand that by itself shooting, reading, setting the code and running it isdecidedly inconvenient and no doubt frustrating. In two, three or four players online and locally, however, coordinating and covering each other becomes therefore fundamental and above all very fun. Obviously paying attention to friendly fire, a trademark that has always been the developers, as Magicka teaches us. As if that weren't enough then the game takes its further to make everything even more complex. There is ~active~ reloading of the weapons, we can be killed not only by the more or less involuntary projectiles of our companions, but also by the very precious automatic turrets. Finding ourselves in their line of fire means certain death, but we must not forget that every stratagem that is launched on the battlefield has a generous cooldown time, both for landing on the ground (be careful not to get crushed) and for the next usage. It is therefore understandable how each action must be coordinated to the maximum, without then having time to catch his breath since there is no possibility of going into cover other than throwing ourselves on the ground. Too bad you can't shoot in this position. However, a structure like this also allows lower-level users to participate in missions deemed difficult, a level requirement obviously permitting, perhaps remaining on the sidelines, and acting as ~healers~ and bombing the area. Acting as a team, basically. On a technical level we are faced with a decidedly not very exuberant title, which shows all its limitations of a project developed by a small team, obviously more focused on giving substance to its game than technicalities for their own sake. From this point of view, however, we must certainly mention the good work done on the animations of the protagonists and in differentiating the various types of weapons. At the same time, however, the procedural creation of the planets builds battlefields poor in screen elements, poor in detail and ultimately too similar to each other. We close on a positive note at the multiplayer level. Helldivers (now discounted for PlayStation Plus users) is a Cross Play, Cross Save, Cross Chat and Cross Buy game between all PlayStation platforms: in practice, by buying it once you can play it on all Sony consoles at your disposal. Given the fragmentary and often short-lived nature of the gaming experience (the individual missions on the planets can last even a few minutes) this is a feature, undoubtedly welcome, obviously and above all on the move. Free with PlayStation Plus Helldivers is free this month for PlayStation Plus users. The Sony service, which costs around fifty euros for a twelve-month subscription, offers 24 games a year for PlayStation 4 and, considering PlayStation 3 and Vita as well, the offer rises to about sixty titles. As a side dish, the Japanese giant offers its subscribers services such as cloud saving with 10GB of space, Share Play, PlayStation Plus Bonus and PlayStation Italian League tournaments.", "date": "2015-03-06", "grade": "7.8"}
