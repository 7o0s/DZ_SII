Not that this is a particularly original idea, in the mobile sector the nostalgic element is often played, exploiting the relative structural simplicity of the classics of the past and the eternal charm of pixel graphics to try to build titles suitable for mobile fruition that also shine, reflexively or otherwise, with a certain charisma. In some cases the classic aesthetic is exploited as a simple basis for proposing something truly original, and as an example games such as Bean Dreams or Kero Blaster come to mind, in other cases the nostalgia operation becomes a cornerstone that is a little too cumbersome, so much to transform the whole project into a historical re-enactment for its own sake. Venture Kid tends to lean a little too much on this last aspect, presenting itself as a hodgepodge of ancient suggestions in which it is difficult to find a solid backbone at the base of the game. However, net of some technical and conceptual drawbacks, the FDG Mobile Games GbR game still manages to capture the interest, by virtue of the splendid atmosphere of other times that pervades it and also of the high challenge rate at which subjects players, who in the mobile are perhaps unaccustomed to certain rigidities that can be defined as ~hardcore~. In fact, in Venture Kid you jump and shoot, there is not much else to know, except for an excellent animated presentation, also in perfect 8-bit style, which introduces us to the simple story with a sci-fi flavor with the Venture Kid protagonist grappling with the evil Dr Teklov and his plans for the construction of a mysterious and very powerful secret weapon. Albeit with a few glitches, Venture Kid has the flavor of 8-bit action platformers Jump and shoot Taking into consideration the structure of the game, the most fitting example is that of Mega Man, with the protagonist able to jump and shoot and a series of weapons to acquire capable of amplifying its destructive power. Each level also has its own boss, to remain in the tradition, even if the arrangement of these is purely linear, i.e. it is not possible to select the order in which to tackle the levels as happens in the classic Capcom, instead offering a standard progression at increasing difficulty. The solution adopted for the controls is unfortunately the obligatory one with regard to games with such traditionalist mechanics, i.e. the usual virtual pad on the touch screen, a system that is not exactly enjoyable but if nothing else interpreted in the best way in this case, with a response to the commands immediate and a general fluidity of action favored by the good calculation of the variable amplitude of the jumps and of the inertia. From this point of view, however necessary given the precision required in the movements and the rather high level of difficulty, Venture Kid offers a good experience, which we imagine can only improve with the use of an MFI controller. On the other hand, the calculation of the collisions raises some doubts, which are often not perfectly in line, which emerges in a particular way during the clashes with the bosses, when it is possible to lose a heart for contacts that are not precisely distinguishable. For the rest, the shooter / platform mechanic follows simple and tested tracks, without however offering great level design tips beyond some nice variations on the theme and some really difficult bosses. It is a pity, from this point of view, that a deeper integration has not been foreseen between the construction of the levels and the weapons unlockable in the game, which in this way are simply power-ups with a limited duration capable only of increasing the damage capabilities, but without offering new real gameplay solutions.", "date": "2016-01-25", "grade": "7.5"}
