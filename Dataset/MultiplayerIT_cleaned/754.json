Start a game One of the first things that the FM (and CM) series experts look at, not without a hint of terror in their eyes, is starting a new game: if on the one hand the enormous amount of data made available by the the game database represents an aspect to boast about, on the other it is necessary to find the right number of nations and leagues to enable within your game, without getting carried away by the desire to activate everything that can be activated, on pain of exhausting initial loading waits (even in terms of hours) and long breaks after each continuation. After all, the latest editions have greatly contributed to raising discontent among players, who have complained on several occasions that excessive loading time was one of the main defects of the game: if from the point of view of the developers these times were necessary, it is known but that the end user wants something that doesn't involve being inactive for a long time in front of the monitor. Going to repeat and compare part of the tests carried out on the 2005 edition within our review of a year ago, we were able to obtain the following, pleasant results: - huge database, 4 championships, no additional nation selected - about 7 minutes - huge database, 10 leagues, around 25 additional selected nations - 20 minutes we can see how the loading times have significantly decreased, especially if you go to increase the amount of data to be entered within the game Start a game Considering that the tests were carried out on an Athlon 1700+ with 1Gb of RAM, a machine certainly less powerful than last year's (an Athlon64 3200+ with the same amount of RAM), we can see how loading times have significantly decreased , especially in the event that the amount of data to be entered within the game is increased, something that everyone can appreciate and especially those who do not have a latest generation PC: this obviously does not mean that adding too many additional championships or nations cannot negatively affect the loading time, therefore the rule of common sense applies in the selection phase, adapting above all to the power of your machine, but it is still nice to note that one of the dark sides that FM has had in the past is been improved by the developers. The game environment Once the team has been chosen and the initial loading phase has been tackled with renewed spirit, we find ourselves in the game menu, which at a deceptive first glance does not seem to change one iota compared to that of FM2005. In reality, after a few minutes, the first thing you can appreciate is a summary window relating to our team where all the most useful data are entered and which we would otherwise have to reach with several clicks: results and calendar with a focus on the next match, the competitions in which we participate, the ranking area of the championship in which we participate, some statistics on the players and the team and finally a small report on the team's finances and salaries. Among the game options it is still possible, for nostalgics of the old coinage, to choose to view the costs in lire while it is strongly recommended to choose to have an account on salaries on an annual basis, as we are used to hearing and reading from sports news. The possibility of choosing to rest the players the day after the match has also been eliminated, as well as the choice of the retirement period, within the manager options. The contextual menu, which opens by clicking on a player with the right mouse button in the general window of the team, has been enhanced, offering the possibility of quickly assigning him to a specific training program, setting his transfer status and other choices also present in the 2005 version. The characteristics that describe each player remain the same as they were a year ago, with the addition of height and weight that make the card of each player definitively complete and exhaustive, while a system has been introduced for comparing two different players of colored bars depending on how much better one is than the other, in order to also quantify the level of superiority with a simple glance, which with last year's red and green triangles was notit was possible. In case you don't want to deal too much with numbers even for the players' cards, the possibility of visualizing the qualities of each player through graphs has been introduced. Among the novelties we can also point out the presence of an in-game tutorial, which in the past will have been missed by more or less all novice players: obviously this category will benefit from it, while the more experienced will perhaps be able to appreciate some aspects. To open the guide, all you have to do is press the F1 key at any time and move around in the Windows guide style. There would also be other things to report in relation to the game environment but since they are related to the innovations introduced in the 2006 version of the game, we will address them in the next paragraphs. Among the novelties we can also point out the presence of an ingame tutorial, which in the past will have been missed by more or less all novice players You know that the general rules of all the coaches in the world, more or less always use the same formations, i.e. 4-5-1 or 4-4-2. Instead, I use something different: 5-5-5 After familiarizing yourself with the interface and taking note of the new features introduced, to start winning right away it is essential to spend a lot of time inside the tactics section, in order to find the one that best suits our current of football thinking but above all to the squad at our disposal, a not easy task especially if you are a beginner with all the tactical variations that FM makes available. From this point of view, the most important novelty to report is certainly that concerning the loss of time, which allows the coach to order his team to gain precious seconds on set pieces or by doing the so-called ~melina~: it will not be sportingly correct, but given that it is a simulation of reality and that real football makes extensive use of this practice, this too should be part of the game. Another novelty is represented by the possibility of ordering 2 players to swap roles regularly during the match, a bit like we usually see on TV, for example between the right wing and the left wing, so as not to give reference points to the defense opponent thus confusing her. For each player it is now possible to view which roles he prefers, in order to see, for example, how he prefers to play an attacking midfielder indicated as DSC, who could in theory cover any position between right, left and centre. As the fourth and final new entry, the management of the core of the game has been improved, with more options for the player who finds himself filling this role. As for the rest of the options, they have remained unchanged compared to 2005: it is still possible to set mentality, type of passes, level of pressing, breadth of play, both for the team and instead for each individual player, adapting the directives to the role . The workout After having waited in vain for years and years for the change of the training system, Sports Interactive has finally decided to give its fans what was probably the most requested modification to the game system. What was a diabolical mix of training types and days of the week that almost required a real coaching license to develop a valid and profitable training program for your team's form has been replaced with a much more practical slider system and intuitive than the previous one: the program is now divided into some general sub-categories (so goodbye to bullock, 5vs5 game and so on and so forth) consisting of strength, aerobics, goalkeepers, tactics, ball control, defense, attack, shooting and set pieces. After having waited in vain for years and years for the change of the training system, Sports Interactive has finally decided to give its fans what was probably the most requested modification to the game system The workout Based on the level of the sliders of each of these types of training, we will have a low, medium or high workload, which it will then be possible to balance through an additional bar called own workload (but okay?) and which, if modified, will go to influence all levels of the programs mentioned above: probably everything is more difficult to explain than to do, therefore I invite you to look at the appropriate screenshot on this page. Going to evaluate the choice made by the development team, we can only appreciate the new system, which in fact opens up the possibility for everyone to create a training program without wasting hours and hours trying and retrying the various settings: agree that we are faced with an attempt di extreme simulation, but I don't think I'm the only one who believes that the old system was too messy. The few purists will have to be patient from this point of view, but I don't think it's time to make a drama out of it. The influence of the training system on the form of the players now seems to have a greater impact on this variable, even if for definitive considerations trials and trials should be made using months and months of play: the impression gained is in any case favourable. A small oddity that I happened to notice was the automatic modification of the selection of the position in which to train some players, in a completely wrong way: without having done anything, for example, I ended up with a defender trained as an attacking midfielder resulting in disastrous results. However, this happened only once to never repeat itself again, but it still remained a mystery. [C] The usual squabbles between coaches! The myriad of statistics available during the match It happens very rarely, but during the interval we will also find ourselves praising our players [/C] The transfers Let's start dealing with the market with what, at least for us Italians accustomed to the co-ownership formula, is currently the worst bug that FM2006 carries with it even with the 6.0.1 patch applied: once the co-ownership contract between two teams has expired player, the game will prevent the human coach from making an offer by assigning the player to one of the two clubs at his discretion. Unfortunately this bug, although it is among those already known, has not yet been fixed, we sincerely hope that it will be fixed with the 6.0.2 patch. once the co-ownership contract between two teams concerning a player has expired, the game will prevent the human manager from making an offer by assigning the player to one of the two clubs at his discretion The transfers The entire market works practically the same as FM2005, thus covering the various classic purchase and loan formulas bound to the transfer regulation, practically different for each country, so do not be surprised if you go from one country to another and find yourself lost. Players and clubs show greater intelligence in transfers than a year ago: the former skilfully avoid transfers to clubs that could constitute a mistake in their career, however linking decisions to their character, while the latter avoid reinforcing direct competitors trying not to give them their best pieces. Even the purchases at the end of the contract have been revised in such a way as to prevent taking star players at 0 cost (last year I remember that I took Totti in the second year of Serie A with Genoa, decidedly unrealistic). As far as the exchanges made by the CPU between the various teams are concerned, we are facing a good ferment, which should above all prevent in the long run the aging of the teams that was recorded in previous versions, especially in the stronger ones who kept their players best up to 36-37 years old: there can only be one Maldini every now and then! One of the most important innovations that FM2006 brings with it is the introduction of coaching contracts, which allow the player to choose his own salary and that of his collaborators, but not only: it is in fact possible, starting from a total budget, to choose in the negotiation phase, how to divide this amount between wages and capital available for transfers, in order to meet one's own programmes: if, for example, numerous purchases are expected on a free transfer basis compared to sales paid handsomely, it will be better to ask for more for engagements, while if you intend to snatch the champion of the moment with the sound of greenbacks, the best thing will be to pay more attention to the sum destined for transfers. In addition to this, the coach can include certain clauses in the contract such as the improvement of training facilities, which will bind the club that will not fail to fulfill these obligations. This novelty was also part of the requests from the community of fans of the series, who can therefore be happy with the work done by SIGames. [C] Another match commentary screen Contract of a footballer We lose 1-2 in the 89th minute, we just have to throw ourselves desperately forward [/C] All on the pitch! We have created our tactics, developed the training program and strengthened our team by moving on the market, now we have to put all our efforts to the test by submitting ourselves to the judgment of the green rectangle. Since the eye also wants its part, the 2D engine of the game has been made more realistic, with the addition of panc", "date": "2005-11-16", "grade": null}
