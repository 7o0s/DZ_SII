Burnout 2 was originally released on PlayStation 2 and already at the time the Criterions amazed the gaming environment: the game boasted an above average graphics department, ran at a fixed 60 fps and, rare thing on Ps2, was beautiful displays super-glossy textures featuring a similar Bump Mapping. The transition to Xbox has brought benefits to the game engine, thanks to the power of the hardware the developers have been able to implement very welcome graphic additions. Cube Environment Mapping, car detail more than twice as high as the PS2 version, Anti Aliasing and many other features that have further improved this game. If the technicalities are not your thing, it is right to explain in simple terms what has changed. Overall, the game has improved significantly in all respects, the real-time reflection system has been completely redone, making it much more realistic. The polygons on all the cars in the game have been increased, with a higher detail than the previous version, the jaggies have been completely eradicated thanks to the Anti-Aliasing filter and the lighting effects have been strengthened and improved.

Illegal racing, highly developed cars, crowded cities: these are the ingredients present in Burnout 2, the sequel to the highly acclaimed Burnout, a game that at the time enjoyed considerable success. The main feature of this series is, as just mentioned, the presence of elaborate cars and if in the first Burnout we were left a bit dry-mouthed due to the lack of resources, in this sequel we will be fully satisfied. Everything has been raised to the nth degree, in order to bring the gaming experience to the highest levels. The main title menu by Criterion is made with andextreme care, simple and intuitive to consult, and even the background music is immediately captivating, immediately transporting us into the atmosphere of the game. The main modes available are Championship and Time Attack, in the first you'll face different races spread over various circuits, while in the second you'll try to achieve the fastest lap. A welcome addition to the first chapter is the Crash mode, in which you have to cause general panic through gigantic accidents. This mode is the flagship of the game, launching at more than 250 km/h against cars has never been so fun. At the end of the incident you will receive a medal based on the score obtained, the more cars you involve, the greater your reward will be. Before starting to play, you will be required to take some driving tests, which are essential to fully understand the essence of Burnout 2. At the base of this racing game is the conquest of medals which, based on your finish position, they will differ in gold, silver and bronze. The game mechanics are simple: win a medal to move forward, needless to say that to unlock the extras present it is essential to win the most coveted medal, namely the gold one. Once the driving tests are over, you can finally begin your adventure on the roads, choose your favorite car and go! The Burnout 2 fleet is decidedly varied: it starts from the common compacts to the Japanese super sports cars, it must be said, however, that the game does not enjoy any licence, in fact, you will only find models resembling their real counterparts. The races that you will face in the Criterion racing game can be of two types: either divided into laps, or a sort of endurance, in which you will have to reach a specific goal. Being a real racing game, Burnout 2 knows how to entertain like few other games have been able to do: during your race you will receive bonus points in case of skids, risky overtaking, sections of road covered in the wrong direction and other feasible stunts. These bonuses will fill an energy bar which, once full, will give you the ability to activate the turbo, catapulting your car to very high speeds. So far so good and fun, but there is an element not to be underestimated: city traffic. Your ability will be severely tested, roaming around the city at more than 250 km/h is not easy at all, so you will understand how you will have to work hard to avoid the cars that regularly circulate in the city. At the end of each championship you will have to face a challenge in Pursuit mode. In this part of the game you will take on the role of the policeman, in fact, you will have to chase a pirate car intent on escaping. By destroying it you will get it as a prize and, from that moment, it will make its beautiful presence in your fleet.", "date": "2003-06-04", "grade": null}
