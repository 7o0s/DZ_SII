Unfortunately, Okami belongs to this category of products, a game originally released on PlayStation 2 and later on Wii, created by Clover Studio, one of the very few development teams capable of moving with a certain courage outside the rigid schemes of a market often devoid of original ideas, prematurely dissolved by Capcom in the name of an alleged production reorganization. The product in question is fortunately re-proposed today to the PlayStation 3 public thanks to Capcom and Hexa Drive with the title of Okami HD, in a high definition re-edition thanks to the support for 1080p graphics, the possibility of using PlayStation Move and the adding trophies. But let's try to describe and analyze this game in detail. The plot that is the background to Okami is based on some elements taken from oriental mythology, and therefore enjoys a very particular atmosphere and style, with a plot that unfolds through long text dialogues in English, often seasoned with a certain humor (like when you meet the great warrior Susano) that goes far beyond the thin line of mere connection between events. The protagonist is Amaterasu, divinity of the sun, who descended to earth in the form of a white wolf with the aim of eliminating the perfidious demon Orochi and thus putting an end to his desire to destroy Japan and all its inhabitants. The ~Great Goddess who shines in the skies~ of the Shinto religion will be supported in her long adventure (it can take an average of forty hours to complete the game in full) by Issun, an artist with tiny dimensions that is rather intrusive but also generous with advice and suggestions. Playstation 3 trophies Okami HD offers players 51 Trophies divided as follows: 42 Bronze, 5 Silver, 3 Gold and 1 Platinum. To obtain them you must obviously satisfy the requests of the video game, such as, in the case, defeating the demons Lechku and Nechku, completing the various tomes or various mini-games and learning how to use Inferno. With strokes of the brush The Capcom production presents a game structure not unlike that seen in other adventure-type titles with typically role-playing game elements. In it you must therefore wander within a large world, in this case, as mentioned before, Japan, exploring every possible nook and cranny including the classic dungeons with attached final bosses, without forgetting to complete side quests and solve puzzles more or less simple, eliminating enemies at the same time and when necessary, also using specific objects for the purpose and magical techniques learned along the way. In short, despite being a game with linear progress, the product provides users with a large number of secondary objectives and parallel missions in which to try their hand at living a full and rewarding experience. For all the aforementioned aspects, the game was often compared to Zelda in its time, but in reality the points of contact between the two productions are as many as those of detachment from the Nintendo masterpiece. In this sense, the so-called Celestial Brush plays a very important role, a new and fundamental element for the gameplay of Okami HD. It is a sort of brush through which to interact with what is happening in the universe of the game, using both the analog stick of the pad and the PlayStation Move. With this ~accessory~ it is possible to draw various types of drawings (there are about fifteen to learn, each with its characteristics and functions linked to a specific type of sign) whose usefulness is directly linked to a series of effects which affect both the scenario and the fights. To give a couple of concrete examples, a bridge can be created from nothing over a river by tracing its contours, or natural obstacles can be knocked down by marking the screen with a horizontal line in order to open a path useful for the main character to continue; and again, during one of the many clashes that take place in real time, draw a line on the body of an enemy to help Amaterasu when her ~normal~ attacks that can be performed with the classic commands are not enough. If desired, one of these artistic techniques can be used for other purposes such as obtainingbonuses, perhaps by drawing a bomb to blow up the most fragile rock walls, or by drawing a circle useful for making withered trees flourish again, restoring color and vigor to the area grayed by the presence of Evil. A living picture The Celestial Brush on PlayStation 3 also has the added value of being able to be managed directly by the movements of the Move. A solution, the latter, which works quite well even if there are some slight inaccuracies in the detection of some movements, which however, to be honest, does not affect the gaming experience that much and which cannot be overcome with a some experience. For the rest, to strengthen a game mechanic in itself robust, we then think about the ability to obtain new weapons, main and secondary, additional techniques and experience points to spend to improve the characteristics of the protagonist. In short, the Clover Studio game has a lot of meat on the fire. Visually Okami HD is a feast for the eyes. Characterized by a pictorial style with a fascinating and original trait, clearly inspired by the genre of Japanese artistic printing called Ukiyo-e, the game adopts the cel-shading technique to represent the universe in which the events narrated in it take place. The result is something aesthetically wonderful, with a stroke of the drawing that seems to have been made with strokes of a brush and animation with attention to every detail. The sensation that derives for the gamer is that of being in front of a colored watercolor painting, an interactive, lively and constantly evolving work of art, with colors made more brilliant by the high definition transposition of the product and by the 16:9 . It should also be highlighted that in this edition the graphic filter removed in the Nintendo Wii version has been reintroduced, customizable from the options, which makes everything seem painted on a rough canvas. In short, also from this aspect Okami HD is the demonstration that even in modern times it is not essential to have ultra-pumped engines to leave spectators speechless. As for the sound, the Capcom production presents a pleasant soundtrack, with songs that are certainly spot on to accompany the heroic deeds of Amaterasu. Not least are the effects, from the unusual ones, similar to verses, which replace the speech of the various characters, to those relating to magic, fighting and background ambient noise.", "date": "2012-11-05", "grade": "9.0"}
