Not for a rethinking of the forces in the field, nor for the recognition of the horrors and sufferings generated by the war conflict of 15-18, but because of the invasion of the Chimera, an alien race that has returned to planet Earth after sixty million years to reconquer it and wipe out its current inhabitants. The Chimera settle in Siberia at the beginning of the twentieth century, following the so-called ~Tunguska event~, and organize their forces to then launch a powerful offensive that takes everyone by surprise, starting in 1927. Within twenty years, the aliens conquer the entire Soviet Union and Asia, then create channels to reach the United Kingdom and there they find the strenuous resistance of British and American troops, once again allied against a common threat. Resistance: Burning Skies, however, shows us the US front of the invasion: we are in 1951, and the streets of New York suddenly turn into a battlefield, with ordinary people who find themselves having to flee and hide in an attempt to survive . Not Tom Riley, however: this courageous fireman decides to take the situation head on and, during an intervention that at first seemed routine, he takes up the ordinance ax and makes his way among the Chimera, taking possession of their weapons and killing them. by the hundreds. Riley's first thought is for his wife and daughter, whom he manages to reach after the start of the invasion and send to an emergency camp along with many other displaced civilians, never imagining that his own homeland could betray him , putting in place a series of at least questionable countermeasures to counter the invaders. High expectations Nihilistic Software hasn't so far distinguished itself for having created extraordinary masterpieces: their best production to date is the barely decent Marvel Nemesis: The Rise of Imperfects, while the most recent is the less than brilliant PlayStation Move Heroes. Why did Sony decide to entrust this team with the development of the first ever FPS for PlayStation Vita, moreover an episode of Resistance? Certainly the Japanese house will have had its good reasons, but the fact remains that Resistance: Burning Skies has created a series of expectations on the part of the fans and that these expectations have largely been disappointed, given that in the end the title stands as a terribly ~standard~ chapter for a series that many consider overrated and that only with the third release seems to have found its dimension. We were talking about disappointed expectations: the first undoubtedly concerns the technical sector, characterized by a frame rate that is not in itself exciting, but which above all drops dramatically as soon as a more eventful situation than usual occurs on the screen. The fluidity of the first Resistance on PS3 is a chimera (interesting pun), while in terms of detail and level design the similarities are many. The engine, however, seems to be at ease only when our character moves within indoor scenarios and there are no enemies to fight: a little, considering the much-vaunted programming ease of PlayStation Vita, which he is certainly capable of better performances (will BioShock and Killzone show us?). The worst part are however the polygonal models, closer to those of a PSP than to those of PlayStation 3, and the problem arises in particular when the appearance of the characters is also important for narrative purposes: the most touching scene between Riley and his wife definitely loses her charm if she looks like a man. We also add that during the cutscenes the compression artifacts are very evident. The sound, on the other hand, moves between ups and downs: a very well done dubbing in Italian is accompanied by cinematic orchestral music, capable of underlining the epic nature of certain moments. Too bad that the effects of the most common weapons are however literally unlistenable, with the classic carbine that emits ~slippers~ when we shoot a burst and the other elements of the arsenal that don't do much better. PSVita trophies Resistance: Burning Skies contains a total of twenty-five Trophies. As per tradition, about half of them are obtained by completing ~mandatory~ objectives, therefore the completion of each level and the campaign, the first weapon upgrade, the first multiplayer game and so on. The other Trophies are clearly more difficult to obtain and are based on numbers, such as eliminating 250, 500 and 1000 Chimera, or defeating certain more powerful opponentsnts of the average. Big news Filed the question of form, we come to the substance of Resistance: Burning Skies. Can we speak of disappointed expectations also with regard to the much talked about ~mixed~ control system? Yes and no. The implementation of numerous touch controls alongside the traditional ones undoubtedly represented an opportunity to experiment with new solutions on the Sony portable console, and from this point of view it can be said that the objective has been, all in all, achieved. In fact, during our explorations of the stages we are often called to touch the doors for the character to open them, as well as to interact in various ways with the locations always by acting on the touch screen. The ~rescue~ phases, in which Riley has to carry an injured person on his shoulder and carry him to safety from the flames, like a good firefighter, leave the time they find: too short, simple and obvious. Far more interesting, however, are the possibilities of using the touch screen to throw grenades, to perform a melee attack with the ax and, above all, to activate the secondary function of each weapon. The speech is quite full-bodied and it would be a shame to address it in a nutshell, so let's proceed in order. On the right side of the screen there are three icons: the uppermost one allows us to throw a hedgehog grenade, the intermediate one a standard grenade and the last one to perform a melee attack with the ordinance axe. We can choose whether to base the launch of the grenade on the viewfinder, simply by touching its icon, or to search for precision shooting by dragging the grenade button towards the point in the scenario where we want it to end. During this operation there is a sort of bullet time, so as to give us the necessary time to complete the launch without exposing ourselves too much to enemy fire, but ultimately two quite important limits affect the effectiveness of this solution: the first and most evident concerns the size of the PlayStation Vita screen, which cannot be covered in its entire length using the right thumb and which therefore forces us to use an index finger to make the shot; the second is that, despite the bullet time, the throwing of grenades is too slow when there are many enemies and they target us all together, making it not useless but almost a resource which should make the difference in such situations. Fortunately, things are better with ~conventional~ weapons: the ~touch~ management of the grenade launcher mounted on the classic carbine works well, is precise and doesn't end up making things too easy for us, given the small number of bullets available; the Bullseye tracer, which we can apply to a target simply by touching it, is also good, as is the adhesive charge available with the Sixeye sniper rifle. The well-known force field of the Auger is activated in this case by drawing divergent vectors with your fingers, while similarly a slide is needed to activate the secondary fire on the three new weapons: the powerful Mauler machine gun, the Mule, a shotgun that becomes a crossbow for explosive bolts, and the Hunter, a raygun that can launch a drone that automatically fires at enemies. The Cosmic Cube We did an overview of the weapons, with three new entries with a good personality (apart from the Hunter, objectively anonymous), but Resistance: Burning Skies introduces another novelty concerning their enhancement. In fact, the plot of the game revolves around the so-called ~gray matter~, energy cubes that can be found around the scenarios and used to enhance our arsenal. The operation is started by pressing the Select key and then moving the interface only with the fingers, scrolling through the possibilities until the desired one is selected. The responsiveness of the controls at this juncture is not extraordinary, but above all the impression is that the game, in terms of gameplay, should have made these enhancements more incisive rather than relegating them to a merely accessory role; and in the end getting them or not does not in any way affect our chances of completing the campaign. Campaign that turns out to be quite traditional and in line with the series, with the protagonist fighting first between houses and buildings, and then entering a Chimera base with the aim of inflicting a severe blow on the invaders. No particular twist, no variation on the theme, therefore, for an adventure consisting of only six levels that can be completed in five or six hours. The developers have tried to make life more difficult for us by limiting the amount of ammunition, but on the other hand the large number of weapons (it is possible to carry them all around, without limitations) ends up canceling this accordtitude, and at the ~normal~ degree of difficulty you run into game over very few times (in which case the checkpoints are still abundant). The multiplayer certainly helps to lengthen the duration of the experience, but even in this case something more was expected than six maps and three modes.", "date": "2012-05-29", "grade": "6.8"}
