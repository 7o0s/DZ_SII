{"name": "Forbidden Siren 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forbidden-siren-2_a.html", "text": "Fear and Loathing in Yamijima Set on the spectral island of Yamijima, Forbidden Siren 2 tells the story of a handful of characters who, in different moments and situations, awaken to the sound of a siren completely enveloped in darkness, in a scenario populated by monstrous creatures. This, or little more, is what the user is allowed to know for most of the duration of the SCEI title, who, following in the footsteps of the first, does not (deliberately) do his utmost to illustrate any type of background or explanation: he witnesses simply to an -irregular- succession of events and protagonists that it is only the player's task to pigeonhole in the way he deems appropriate. An incredibly fascinating element, this, which absolutely does not lose its vigor in this sequel, on the contrary: although the developers have in any case made the narrative path a little more ~rational~, Forbidden Siren 2 remains a sensational survival horror from a scenographic point of view. Merit of a masterfully drawn storyline, of cutscenes with an exceptional emotional charge (the facial expressions of the characters are probably the most realistic ever seen) and of a unique gameplay element such as the Sightjack, icing on the cake of a truly Oscar-worthy atmosphere . Forbidden Siren 2 remains a sensational survival horror from a scenic point of view Fear and Loathing in Yamijima This is the power with which all the characters are equipped to ~tune in~ with the enemies around them, literally allowing them to see through their eyes and act accordingly: despite the more massive presence of weapons, in Forbidden Siren 2 the fight remains in fact an extreme solution (also because the enemies do not die, but remain on the ground only temporarily), which definitely leaves room for evasion by advancing crouched and with the flashlight off. Determining the position and movements of the enemies in advance therefore becomes fundamental, but the function of the Sightjack does not end here: a new entry is in fact represented by the ability of some characters to use this power in alternative ways, for example to see in the past or to take advantage of the best perceptions of other creatures (this is the case of a blind man who has to rely on his guide dog). Too bad that the idyllic picture painted so far is irreparably brought down by the problems that already gripped the prequel: so the control and camera system are not up to par here either; the missions appear again all too short and often with very nebulous outlines; finally, the high level of difficulty still leads to falling into the annoying trial and error mechanism. Already elitist due to its tangled narrative structure, Forbidden Siren 2 becomes a title for a truly courageous few - in every sense - in the light of a gameplay so rough and inclement as to prove to be the scariest aspect of the entire SCEI production. Forbidden video games The contrast between the extreme appeal of Forbidden Siren 2 and its almost prohibitive gameplay is made even more strident by the technical realization of the product, perhaps not spectacular in the classic sense of the term but damned effective in hitting the user's emotional side in the hips. In this sense, the lion's share is played by the sound, with music present at the right point and capable of giving extreme drama to the events: a similar discourse for the effects, among which the chilling verses of the monsters stand out. Speaking of dubbing, however, it should be emphasized that it is possible to choose between the English one or the original Japanese one, with the localization reserved for subtitles only: much better this way. Graphically, however, Forbidden Siren 2 denotes a slight evolution compared to what was shown in the first chapter: although it is not the most cosmetically elaborate title available on Playstation 2, it still remains a nice sight whose greatest strengths are represented by the light effects and from the never too praised facial textures of the characters during the cutscenes. The contrast between Forbidden Siren 2's extreme appeal and its almost forbidding gameplay is stark Returning to talk about gameplay, it must be admitted that the SCEI programmers have in any case tried to make the game less difficult, for example by inserting checkpoints during the missions or making the puzzles less incomprehensible (also a consequence of the greater linearity of the stages themselves). Not only that, in addition to the aforementioned new functions of the Sightjack, the play structure was able to enjoy more or less evident new features, including the inclusion of a new type of enemy - the Yamibito - shapeless shadow creatures to be chased away with light of their torch and who keep the well known companythe Shibito zombies. And in addition weapons, dozens and dozens of objects to collect and analyze in the special Archive section and even some means to drive to break the rhythm of the action. All welcome things, but which simply do not solve the problems of Forbidden Siren 2, which ultimately proves to be - like the prequel already - a title with a perverse fun factor, in which satisfaction is not generated by the gameplay itself, but from the progressive recomposition before the user's eyes of the complex narrative puzzle artfully composed by the developers. Comment Forbidden Siren 2 is perhaps not the sequel that was expected following the constructive criticism received from the first episode. Nourished and made better in its already considerable strengths - namely the atmosphere, the scenario, the storyline and the Sightjack - Forbidden Siren 2 was not however sufficiently filed in terms of gameplay, where instead several corrections were felt necessary. Apart from a few side elements, therefore, the SCEI title always remains a difficult, hard and even a little woody and frustrating game in the long run. In short, anyone interested in attending one of the most convincing modern horror adventures must however take into account the prospects of a gameplay that is not exactly idyllic. Pros Complicated and compelling storyline Amazing atmosphere Good graphics and great sound Cons Difficult and frustrating gameplay Questionable control system and cameras All in all marginal innovations In some ways, the first Forbidden Siren, released in 2003, was one of the most original and conceptually challenging video games of recent times: survival horror along the lines of Silent Hill characterized by fragments of stories of different characters that intersected in the same settings but in different temporal phases and with an irregular order, the SCEI title advanced very refined stylistic and playful solutions, however failing to offer a sufficiently accessible gaming experience. Evidently aware of this limitation, the developers of Forbidden Siren 2 have therefore tried to make their product less angular, while maintaining the peculiar ~confusional horror~ atmosphere unchanged: let's see how it went...", "date": "2006-07-20", "grade": null}
