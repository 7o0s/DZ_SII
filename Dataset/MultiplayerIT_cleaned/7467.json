{"name": "Freuds Bones", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/freuds-bones-recensione.html", "text": "It was November 4, 1899 when the first edition of The Interpretation of Dreams was published, the book credited with founding psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud's was one of the fundamental works not only of his era, but also of human history, born after a long elaboration made up of studies, conversations with other great intellectuals of his time and decisive events such as ~the dream of injection to Irma~ and the death of the father. We are talking about a person with a complex thought who has elaborated a new science with which he has influenced all of humanity, with a force whose drive we still feel today, so much so that the first question we felt compelled to answer in the review of Freud's Bones is about the way the game approaches such a difficult subject. How much Freud is in Freud's bones? In Freud's bones In Freud's Bones you read a lot Crafting a point-and-click adventure that attempts to psychoanalyze the father of psychoanalysis while taking the player into the processes he used to treat his patients seems like a tall order to even describe. Fortunately Axel Fox, the Italian developer who created the game, has carried out specialized studies on the subject, which she therefore masters more than well, as indeed she demonstrates throughout the work. Of course, we don't struggle to imagine her while in front of the screen reflecting on how to translate certain concepts into a playful form. Not exactly an immediate deal. The access route chosen is that of the double investigation, if we want to define it that way. The player then becomes Freud's speaking conscience that creeps into his bones (hence the title), taking control and deciding his actions, not without many squabbles with the stubborn genius, who just doesn't want to believe in our presence . It will seem strange, but despite having first opened the doors of the human unconscious, he is in the throes of a deep crisis, between lovers to satisfy, a psychoanalytic society that can't wait to marginalize him in favor of Jung, because of his theories centered essentially on the sexual sphere, his adored daughter, Anna, who gives him some thought (it should be noted that she too will become a psychiatrist), a wife who can't stand him anymore, a lover who requires attention, the anti-Jewish sentiment that the abuse of cocaine and cigars to find the calm he needs to analyze his patients is becoming more and more widespread. Precisely the latter are the second object of investigation. After all, we are interpreting Freud, so we must also accompany him in his work. Double dream Freud's study is the main environment where the gameplay takes place Therefore Freud's Bones follows two directions: the discovery of Freud, with the analysis of the elements of his study, which include esoteric objects, paintings, photographs and a rich library from which to draw quotations; and the discovery of his patients, each with symptoms related to their traumatic experience that need to be brought back to allow the patient to process them. For example, the first case we will deal with is that of a woman who can no longer walk, while a subsequent case concerns a megalomaniacal narcissist suffering from haptophobia. During the psychoanalysis sessions what we will have to do is try to ask the right questions to the patients, in order to bring out the details with which we will be able to produce diagnoses. Here lies part of the beauty, but also a limitation of Freud's Bones: the rigor with which the cases are presented and the ways we are given to approach them, are difficult to understand without specific knowledge. The point is so clear that the author herself, evidently aware of the difficulty of some passages, has seen fit to equip the game with a real mini encyclopaedia in which to provide some fundamental concepts of the subject, such as those of Ego, Super Ego and Es, as well as those of some related disciplines. Nothing prohibitive, God forbid, but it is clear that some good reading helps. Some sequences are very visionary and also contain strong images Sessions with patients are made up of different systems, all integrated with each other to arrive at the final diagnosis. First of all it is necessary to analyze the medical records, which contain the reports of other doctors and all the documents useful for understanding the case, which in some cases Freud will have to analyze in a more specific way, emphasizing the key elements. Then there is the actual session, in which questions must be asked, choosing each time which attitude to take, between being more professional and detached, more friendly or between relying on analysis or intuition. The sessions themselves will be able to produce texts that Freud will have to analyze to find key elements with which to ask further questions and continue with the research. The system is quite simple to manage, given that it is essentially necessary to select the questions based on the topics and try to get the patient to open up, allowing the repressed to overcome the opposing defenses of the Superego to emerge into consciousness. When you have enough elements, you can make a diagnosis, associating some images to the malaise manifested by the patient. Then you can proceed with the prescription. Obviously we must not forget to get paid, otherwise bankruptcy is certain. Investigation of Freud Analyzing patients means asking the right questions and knowing how to interpret their answers The general investigation of Freud, however, proceeds slightly differently. As already mentioned, it is necessary to examine the objects in his studio and manage their stress through cigars and cocaine (Freud was a great consumer of them, so much so that he even wrote an essay on the subject). Every day it will then be necessary to choose how to make him behave in the face of certain events, digging into his psyche, penetrating his dream world. Freud's analysis is the most suggestive part of the game, the one that also offers the strongest images, with direct references also to the reality of the time and to his being a Jew in a world suffocated by prejudices and anti-Semitism. In this sense, the graphic style elaborated by Giulia Sabatini is very effective, which makes all the environments and elements of the game very clear, never appearing out of place, without renouncing a surreal and dreamlike touch, which manifests itself above all in the advanced, where Freud's visions become stronger and more present. As you can imagine, the gameplay itself is very spoken, in the sense that there are many texts to read, both in the form of dialogues and actual documents. Not bad, given the theme. It is certainly one of the most interesting and competent attempts to put psychoanalysis at the center of a video game, without giving up a highly personal touch.", "date": "2022-05-24", "grade": "8.0"}
