Developed by Tri Crescendo and produced by Namco in Japan, the title was not destined to cross the borders of the native land, at least according to the publisher's plans: the intervention of XSeeD and Rising Star Games, architects of the localization process, was therefore decisive and distribution in Europe and the United States. An undoubtedly courageous choice, given the proverbial difficulties in terms of sales for third party works on Wii, especially if addressed to a more hardcore audience. It's hard to believe that Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon could be able to free itself from this unpleasant trend, but at the same time it would have been a real shame to leave this little pearl to the exclusive prerogative of Japanese players ... Global sadness Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon immediately starts off on the right foot, offering a particularly original and well-constructed setting. The protagonist of the story is Seto, a young boy who, following the death of the one he used to call ~father~, finds himself wearing the distressing role of the only living being in a Tokyo devastated by an unspecified catastrophic event. Completely alone, our hero sets out in a desperate search for other survivors, and runs into a strange girl who, however, runs away scared: from then on, Seto decides to follow her trail, in a plot with melancholy tones that it may not fascinate. From this point of view, Tri Crescendo's work was really excellent: to begin with, the decadent settings are inspired by places that really exist in Japan, abandoned following the release of atomic bombs during the Second World War. Again, the characters finally go beyond those cloying clichs evidently so loved in Rising Sun, offering frescoes of complex and multifaceted personalities, which will not fail to touch the strings of the most sensitive souls. These commendable artistic goals are fortunately also accompanied by a more than good technical realization, even capable of reaching peaks of excellence. From a graphic point of view, Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon exploits the modest resources made available on the Wii very well, especially as regards the creation of the scenarios: although they obviously cannot shine in terms of definition and complexity polygonal, the game environments are shown to be cared for down to the smallest details, and guarantee a considerable variety while remaining confined to the post-apocalyptic context that forms the backdrop to the adventure. The light effects are definitely appreciable, in particular those generated by the flashlight handled by Seto, while among the side elements the design of the menus deserves a special mention, displayed as if they were part of the protagonist's travel diary. On the other hand, some animations that are a little too woody and unrelated to each other are less exciting, the only real drawback of a technically tidy cosmetics but above all full of personality. The sound compartment is instead divided between average effects, a more than decent English dubbing and - last but not least - a triple A musical accompaniment: despite the frequent phases of absolute silence (designed specifically to make the player experience a feeling of total abandonment), the title can count on voice and piano melodies that manage to be crepuscular and disturbing at the same time, further proof of the painstaking work of the developers in terms of pure atmosphere. Brittle inside, crunchy outside In addition to the suggestion, Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon also manages to give solid and well-structured gameplay, not immune to certain anachronisms typical of Japanese videogame production but still satisfying and engaging. The game is to all intents and purposes a third-person action adventure seasoned with some RPG elements, and although the Tri Crescendo title does not delve into any of these areas, the result is in any case a decidedly pleasant mix. The control system is quite simple and does not rely excessively on the console's motion sensor functionality: the Nunchuck's analog stick is used to move Seto, while the gaze is managed by pointing the Remote, a solution that works quite well even if sometimes you pay for an inevitable lack of responsiveness. During the exploratory phases, the continuous pressure of the B key allows you to switch to a subjective, indispensable viewbile to examine objects, writings and so on. However, in this mode it is not allowed to move, and when the adventure script requires the search for particularly inconspicuous items, it can be annoying to constantly jump from one shot to another. The remaining part of the time is instead spent crossing the scenarios and fighting against the ghosts that populate the ruins of the Japanese metropolis, using simple but well-implemented action mechanics. Seto is forced to use makeshift weapons such as sticks, iron pipes and so on, which he can store (together with all the other objects he finds in his path) in the limited inventory at his disposal: the offensive tools are however subject to wear , and it can happen that they break due to too intense use. The attacks must be carried out by rhythmically pressing the A key to create short combos, and even if in the long run this activity tends to become a bit repetitive, its place in the game economy still appears to be properly balanced. That said, Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon is anything but an easy title: Seto is not a warrior, and a few hits are enough for him to go down resulting in a game over. In the various levels, however, save points are generously distributed thanks to which you can regain strength and exchange objects with a mysterious character hidden inside a carnival mascot costume. In principle, Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon fully falls into the category of those video games whose value is greater than the sum of the parts: while not excelling in any particular area of gameplay, the Tri Crescendo title sports a skilful balance between phases exploratory and fighting, all supported by a narrative system that alone would be enough to push the user up to the end credits.", "date": "2010-03-05", "grade": "8.5"}
