In the meantime, you have to smile at everyone, even at those who rush at the table and order mussels in sauce while they sniff their noses. Then comes the happy little family with a polished mother, a faux-technological father and barbaric children who enjoy running around the tables annoying customers and waiters. Babies have a silly grin on their faces that makes you want to skewer them with a steak fork, but you have character and you can put up with it. The customer who really can't understand the difference between caponata and capon causes ulcers, but with a little patience, give the necessary explanations and try to get away from it by recommending ordering a hot broth. Then comes the snobbish couple accompanied by the dog Fuffi. Dogs aren't allowed in, you object, but looking at that white-furred microbe, which looks like a sheep passed under a reduction beam, you accept the fact that deep down, even if it barks, it's not really a dog and doesn't fall into the illustrated canine category about the ban. You also think that nature has already been enough stepmother towards that thing and you don't want to rage (but you plan to send him an anonymous letter with a photo of a German shepherd to make him understand his place in the biosphere). Finally, when you are convinced that you can tolerate everything, even the girls who order the dietetic amatriciana, the hungry Moioli enters the restaurant and... Spouses in the kitchen We come to the game, which is better. In the first campaign of Restaurant Empire 2 we will be wearing the tocque by Armand LeBoeuf, former star of the first Restaurant Empire, who has just returned from his honeymoon and is eager to revive the restaurant of his uncle Michel, one of his closest relatives whom he has not seen for years phoned, texted or sent a postcard to ascertain whether he was dead or alive (what a handsome nephew), since he didn't even know his business had gone bankrupt due to the evil multinational Omnifood. In the second campaign, however, we will wear the gravy-stained white clothes of Armand's wife, Delia Delecoeur, who is dealing with problems similar to those of her husband, but faced from a different point of view. Will their marriage be able to withstand the blow of success? Apart from a few narrative parentheses, which serve more than anything else to introduce the game, to explain the objectives to be achieved and to gratify the player, Restaurant Empire 2 is a pure management game in which what matters is being able to create a profitable business by making the clients. The task is not the simplest because there are really many factors to consider, starting from the choice of the type of restaurant, the arrangement of the tables and the hiring of qualified personnel who do not annoy the customers. In the early stages of the game, after the tutorial, the complications begin. What courses should you include on the menu? How to furnish the place in order to make it as pleasant as possible for the customers? Where to put the reception? Better large and luxurious tables, or smaller tables that guarantee more seats? These and a thousand other questions crowd the games of the good manager, questions that end up multiplying when in the advanced stages it will be necessary to manage more restaurants, of different levels and genres. In fact, the aim of the game is to be able to develop a real chain of clubs located in the center of a well-reproduced virtual Paris in appearance. Compared to the previous Restaurant Empire 2 does not offer big news. The game mechanics have remained practically identical. The only note to note, in addition to the canonical aesthetic touches, is the greater care of the narrative side, which honestly adds little to the gameplay and is superfluous compared to the game mechanics. Is the customer always right As any good management system requires, there are numerous summary screens that allow you to keep the situation of the premises under control. These are indispensable tools for understanding what's going and what's not going well with your business, so you can act accordingly. The most useful table is certainly the one that lists customer complaints, because it allows you to understand in detail the weak points of your management. For example, a waiter who receives too many reports because the customers dislike him should be replaced immediately with one with the attitudes more suited to the type of restaurant. To give another example, a place judged ugly by customers will tend to attract fewer customers and cause them to lose a lot of money, therefore, in the event of complaints in this sense, one should immediately get busy to furnish it better. Feasible examples, in conclusion, would be many others (too high prices, unattractive courses and so on), but it is useless to dwell too much on the subject. The important thing is to understand that to have onccess it is important to follow the tastes of the customers. Details and details Technically, Restaurant Empire 2 is nothing fancy. The three-dimensional models are of discreet workmanship and in general there is a sense of poverty in the details even when a restaurant is filled with trinkets. From the point of view of the soundtrack the situation is identical, with a few rather anonymous music that do their dirty work and nothing more. The sound effects, on the other hand, are few, limited and, in general, don't give the user a good service in terms of gameplay. For example, one of the most frequent complaints from customers concerns the excessive noise in the room, a noise which is not emphasized by the soundtrack. Trying to bring the discussion to a general level, which transcends considerations on the soundtrack alone, it is precisely the lack of attention to detail that significantly penalizes Restaurant Empire 2. In summary, we could say that the game limits itself to doing what it has to and try in the least to surprise the user with some original gimmick. Perhaps the lack of courage is the worst flaw of the entire production.", "date": "2009-06-16", "grade": "7.5"}
