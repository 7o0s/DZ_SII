With The Legend of Spyro, the developer team has introduced new dynamics for the series, placing the emphasis on certain atmospheres but above all eliminating much of the exploration in favor of pure action. The Eternal Night begins exactly where A New Beginning left off, with Spyro defeating the all-powerful Cinerea and then rescuing her from being sucked into a magical vortex. Together with the dragonfly Sparx, the two return to the kingdom of dragons hoping for a time of peace ... but there is no rest for the heroes. Not even a bit. The powers of the dragon If in the first chapter of The Legend of Spyro we had to wait for the character to learn to use his powers during the adventure, in this sequel this will happen only in the very early stages: physically tried by the clash with Cinerea, Spyro finds himself weak and devoid of his abilities, but manages to recover them thanks to a mysterious entity that warns him of a new threat. What's more, the little dragon also gains a completely new power, which allows him to manipulate the flow of time and slow it down for a few seconds. For the rest, the wide repertoire of combos (Circle button), jumps (X button) and charges (Triangle button) remains, as well as the use of four elements (fire is the first) that can be ~blown~ (Square button ). Spyro can also run and strike opponents with his horns (R1 backbone) and sidestep (L1 backbone). Finally, the power to slow down time is activated by pressing the L2 backbone, while a spectacular fire bomb can be set off with the R2 backbone, once the appropriate bar is filled. Speaking of bars, in The Eternal Night we will have to keep an eye on four of them: the red one (related to the character's health), the green one (which regulates the fiery breath), the blue one (the temporal power) and finally the purple one, which it fills up by fighting and which allows us to activate the smart bomb. The first two can be restored by destroying crystals of the same color. The game As we were able to ascertain even in the preview phase, this new Spyro is a product with a great atmosphere, characterized by an even greater level of challenge. The fights are the masters, and generally we proceed from one section to another of the stages just to find new enemies to face. The elements related to exploration are reduced to the bone, with some fairly simple puzzles and which mostly concern the activation of devices necessary to open doors, but also leverage the power to slow down time. In any case, the difficulty rises very quickly and after a few fights you will find yourself facing several opponents at the same time, but the problem is certainly not the numerical inferiority: Spyro's attacks are not effective enough and so you have to perform at least twice a combo to take out an enemy, but doing it while they're targeting you from afar is really, really tough. Thus we end up dying repeatedly, struggling between monsters that manage to hit us and damage us too easily, and which on the other hand refuse to go down and can hurt us even while we are on the ground. A disheartening situation, which unfortunately repeats itself very often and ends up undermining the good that has been done for the game. Technical realization As far as the atmosphere is concerned, The Eternal Night is done really well: the technical realization does not shine due to the quality of the graphics engine (which often fails to keep the frame rate stable) and is a bit monotonous when it comes to chromatic choices , but it works well and can count on a really excellent sound both in terms of music and effects, further enhanced by a dubbing in Italian entrusted to professionals in the sector (and you can hear it). Sorry only for the poor synchronization with the mouths. The enemies are many and in terms of design they boast a good characterization, a pity only for the colors (always the same...), while the stages have some elements that can be interacted in a ~free~ way, useless for the purposes of the game, and are well done . The management of the view is entrusted completely to the player (right analog stick), and often the lack of help in this sense is felt too much, given that you have to think about centering the camera while fighting and it's not the best of life. The control system responds promptly, even if there are cases where the jump is not activated at the right time and fends up falling into a bottomless abyss... Comment The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night is a product with a great atmosphere, technically discreet, with some really pleasant aspects (the slow-motion combos, the firebomb...) and embellished with an excellently made Italian dubbing. In the face of the efforts made by the developers Krome Studios in this sense, it is not clear how it is possible the presence of such an exaggerated level of difficulty, which manages to nip in the bud any positive intention after yet another defeat at the hands of a large group of opponents too strong, cunning and ~unfair~ to be defeated. The Eternal Night gives the possibility to fight using a large number of different attacks, which however too often prove to be not effective enough to pave the way towards the conclusion of each stage. It's really a pity that nothing has been done to remedy such an obvious defect, capable by itself of canceling all the merits of the game. Pros: Excellent sound Sometimes quite spectacular A large number of available attacks... Cons: ...unfortunately not very effective Difficulty absurdly high and not adjustable Dancer frame rate", "date": "2007-12-03", "grade": null}
