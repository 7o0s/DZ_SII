Having to describe it, some titles from the 8-bit era come to mind, those in which it was necessary to explore the levels in search of objects to collect and enemies to kill; a mixture between Cybernoid and The Sacred Armor of Antiriad, with a dash of physics applied to objects and the movement of sprites, and with an eye for the artistic direction, despite the scarcity of production means. The duo behind the game, illustrator Jesse McGibney and programmer Lee Vermeulen, spat blood to create a high-level work that does not look bad in the increasingly rich and articulated indie landscape. The plot is very simple: as an astronaut who survived the destruction of his spaceship, the player must explore the surface of a planet full of hostile creatures in search of the crew and spare parts needed to escape. That's all? What more do you want? Perverted dwarfs who live naked, who play on ships and who have to be kicked to amuse them? They come in another review, don't worry. Grab and pull Capsized begins with a tutorial level that allows you to master the basics of the game. The protagonist can shoot by orienting the crosshairs with the mouse and can launch a magnetic beam capable of grabbing objects and moving them. If necessary, it has a pressure shot that can perform various functions, for example it allows you to jump higher or make some voracious enemies lose their grip. By collecting some special icons you can refill the tank of the stock jetpack. There are two types of fuel: one that is consumed after use and one that is self-replenishing by extinguishing the rockets. The jetpack is the fundamental means of movement to better explore the maps, especially when looking for secrets, but in its absence, the magnetic beam can be used as a lasso. Of course, there's no shortage of enemies. The crash planet is populated by various alien races, some more feral, others apparently more civilized, but only in the methods they use to counter the hero. We must therefore beware of some flying monsters capable of nibbling our space suit and the members of a hierarchically organized tribe whose members can't wait to sacrifice us to their gods. From time to time we will also have to collide with special enemies, such as priests capable of exploiting the power of magnetism to throw rocks, beams, blocks of stone and even our own projectiles at us, or guardians who shoot laser beams and teleport after having suffered a few hit. Weapons and horses In such a dangerous situation it's nice to have some extra weapons at hand. In addition to the service rifle, rather useless to tell the truth, we will be able to collect various trinkets of death such as a missile launcher, a plasma rifle, a machine gun and so on. Each weapon has characteristics that make it useful on different occasions and allow for the development of diversified tactics. For example, a flamethrower can come in handy to get rid of a horde of vermin, while the laser can wipe out even the most powerful enemies with just a few hits. Unfortunately, monsters aren't the only dangers we'll have to face, because the maps are littered with traps. Above all, some are full of poisonous gases, levers to pull and plates to press to open otherwise inaccessible areas. In some situations we will have to solve simple puzzles, usually based on physics, to move forward. In reality, you never rack your brains too much and the greatest difficulties come from the shootings which become progressively more difficult, but spending a few minutes figuring out how to press a lever or get a rock to a certain point can still be a good diversion. More to do and see In addition to the campaign mode, Capsized offers the player several extra modes that guarantee a few hours of extra gameplay. For example, it will be possible to face arenas in which to survive enemy assaults or play split screen with a friend to see who scores the most points. However, apart from the one just described, there are no other multiplayer modes. From a technical point of view, the title does not pretend to compete with bigger productions, even if Alien Trap has done an excellent job. Graphically it is highly sought after, especially for how the alien world has been outlined. The first maps don't do it justice and are certainly the poorest from a visual point of view. The situation improves from the fourth map onwards, to get to the live showslli endings that are really beautiful to look at, with dozens of elements to compose a fascinating scenography. The weakest side of the whole production is certainly the soundtrack, evidently the result of some compromise: the music and sound effects are limited to doing their dirty work, adding little to the general atmosphere.", "date": "2011-05-04", "grade": "8.5"}
