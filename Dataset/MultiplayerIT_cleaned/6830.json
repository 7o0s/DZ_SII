{"name": "Ripartiamo da Doom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/139178-wrack-ripartiamo-da-doom.html", "text": "Wrack is a first-person shooter that aims to reproduce the mechanics of id Software's classics, DooM above all. For this reason it doesn't get too lost in preambles, despite having a kind of plot, and quickly throws the player into the action, putting him in front of mechanical spiders and alien soldiers, to be killed initially with swords, then with a gun, a shotgun, a plasma machine gun and so on. The action is really frenetic The model pursued is that of open battle, with enemy projectiles always clearly visible that can and must be dodged in order to survive, with energy that must be recharged through medikits and with labyrinthine levels made up of long and bare corridors, stairways , lava pools, acid pools, secret alcoves, buttons to push, and treasures to find. There is no shortage of more resistant beasts, such as robots that can create shock waves by slamming their fists on the ground, or the classic bosses, of beasts of rare power these days. All this translates into very fast gameplay, with the protagonist moving at a crazy pace that is unthinkable for modern shooters. One of the keys to understanding Wrack is precisely the complete rejection of any compromise introduced in the genre over the years, to slow down the action and make it more accessible. Final Boss Entertainment's title is pure skill, magnified by a combo system based on the speed with which enemies are killed. You feel an extreme taste to enter a room full of enemies holding a weapon with excessive power and give yourself to the dance trying to accumulate as many points as possible. In the long run, the combo system becomes almost a game within the game and the main motivation for replaying the eight maps that make up the single player campaign once the conclusion is reached. Yes, unfortunately Wrack is not very long. Indeed, it is decidedly short and can be completed in about five hours, despite the modder tools released together with the game promise to greatly lengthen its longevity. Wrack tries to take us back to Doom, offering gameplay that flows at lightning speed. Modder's philosophy As we said, the basic contents of Wrack are not very many. During the period spent in Steam Early Access the developers had revealed their philosophy linked to the modder scene, namely that they are not so much interested in the game itself, despite the great care in creating the maps, as in providing the community with a tool versatile and powerful for making free add-on content, such as maps or total conversions, to be distributed via the Steam Workshop. One of the first total conversions in progress could only be dedicated to Doom From this point of view, Wrack is a very successful title and sifting through its mod page you can already find interesting projects, such as a couple of total conversions dedicated to Doom, or maps designed for those who like to make the combo counter grow dramatically ( basically arenas where you fight at a fast pace). Of course, it is also true that something more could be given, even if only among the alternative modes, which are limited to proposing timed challenges and races to whoever scores the highest. Above all, online multiplayer is completely missing, both competitive and cooperative. That's a big flaw for a title that claims to want to bring back the gameplay of the game that invented multiplayer in first-person shooters. The beauty is that the lack of online is all the more felt due to the excellent work done by the developers with the game mechanics. Dashing through the levels killing enemies makes you crave deathmatch at the speed of light, and instead you remain dry-mouthed having to settle for some world rankings to climb. From the point of view of the design of the maps, linked hand in hand with the stylistic choices of the graphics, Wrack offers the best that the ancient conception of the genre has to offer, with levels built outside any rule of likelihood, designed around their functions playful. Wrack is a party for combo lovers In short, the map design is almost perfect, even if such a radical choice determines an undeniable visual poverty, badly masked by the use of cel shading. Unfortunately, the problem is not only in the shape of the maps, since even the enemies are not exceptionally beautiful and lack a bit of imagination, getting too close to the id model, without however reaching it. To say: the giant robots are well done, but they don't impress, just as some bosses are really difficult, but they don't affect the player beyond the bullets they shoot. Here, if we were to point to the biggest flawof Wrack we wouldn't hesitate to point the finger at its lack of vision. All in all, it's a great celebration of an era that was by now, but it lacks the anarchic strength of those years. DooM reeked of blood, laughter among friends and french fries eaten during development, Wrack is only a sincere bow to that world, on the memory of which it fails to affect as it should and could.", "date": "2014-10-17", "grade": "6.5"}
