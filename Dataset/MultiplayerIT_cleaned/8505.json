{"name": "Il battito animale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/103730-extinction-squad-il-battito-animale.html", "text": "Deforestation, global warming or poaching were not enough: the suicidal instinct also pushes some animal species towards extinction. The shrewd scientist-adventurer Chuck Darwin detects the dangerous trend during his field research, and so he decides to prepare an emergency team, the Extinction Squad, precisely, to deal with such situations. How will the two helpers of the doctor be able to save the animals in danger of life? Not with psychology, nor by physically forcing them not to jump into the void, but by waiting for them to jump towards oblivion and then wait for them below with a nice fireman's towel. You got it right: in the new action game developed by PikPok for Adult Swim our goal will be to move the two characters with the towel while dozens and dozens of animals fall from above, make them bounce and save them. A trivial but terribly effective strategy, which the good Chuck Darwin decides to carry around the world, within six different scenarios that must be unlocked as coins are earned: Africa, Australia, Asia, Antarctica, America and the Amazon. Although the game offers a survival-type secondary mode, the core of the experience is not based on the ~single game~ and boasts a good degree of progression, with levels that are completed once you have saved a certain number of animals and then move on to the next setting , where the suicide of an even greater number of animals will have to be avoided. Tell me how you fall and I will tell you who you are In Extinction Squad we will mainly deal with dodos, gorillas, pandas and lions. Each animal species will fall from the cliff in a different way, more or less fast and bouncing cleanly on the cloth or requiring an additional ~hit~ to complete the rescue. The difficulty will lie in trying to catch as many beasts as possible before they crash to the ground, an eventuality that will dye part of the background red and which, in certain cases, we will not really be able to avoid; this is because not only the animals will fall, but also a series of bonus items and the usual bombs, launched by who knows but lethal for our characters: just peck one to run into game over. The control system is completely based on the touch screen and is incredibly immediate and precise, given that there are no virtual arrows or d-pads, but the movement of the characters who handle the cloth is regulated by keeping a single finger on the screen. Sometimes the conclusion of a stage will be crowned by an extra shower of suicidal animals, or by the arrival of none other than a gigantic whale, which we will have to bounce as many times as possible (earning points with each touch) but which in any case we will not be able to put to the safe and therefore will end up spatting on the ground. Among the bonuses arriving from above, the barrier stands out, extremely useful for having an extra chance in case of contact with the bombs, and the magnet, which attracts falling animals for a few moments and allows us to save a greater number of them. A further element of variation consists of the ~wheel of fortune~ which can be accessed between one game and another, which based on the result extracted will make things easier for us in the next match. The gameplay, so simple yet so fun, is effectively supported by a first-rate technical sector, characterized first of all by cartoonish graphics, designed with a captivating and nice style, as well as embellished with animations and a very well done interface. The sound is also good, albeit a bit essential.", "date": "2012-06-01", "grade": "8.0"}
