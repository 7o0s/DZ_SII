{"name": "Butter Royale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/butter-royale-la-recensione.html", "text": "In this review of Butter Royale for Apple Arcade we are talking about a product that is hard not to love right away, and not only for the amusing pun that makes up the title: the game is in fact a battle royale to all intents and purposes, which however follows a different path from Fortnite, PUBG Mobile and singer company. Absence of microtransactions, isometric view and gameplay devoted to the most absolute immediacy are the main characteristics of the work Mighty Bear Games, which stands as a voice out of the choir in a genre as young as terribly inflated. Read on to find out if the experiment can be said to be more or less successful... Bread, butter and jam (of opponents) It is clear that the main objective of the Butter Royale developers was to create a title that could embrace the largest possible audience, both in terms of age and in terms of familiarity with the battle royale genre. The cartoonish look and the total absence of violence and microtransactions (the latter condition necessary to be part of the Apple Arcade catalog) therefore make it a product suitable also for the very young, while its structure oriented towards simplicity can satisfy both the more casual players and the more savvy ones, who can find in the product a pleasant outlet from the competitiveness typical of other similar titles. A single screen is enough to complete the tutorial of Butter Royale, which inherits its control system from the twin stick shooters: with the virtual analog on the left side of the screen you control the character, while with the right one you direct the ~fire~. The quotes are a must as the weapons in the game all derive from the culinary world, including shotguns that shoot ice cream, ketchup-powered machine guns, baguette launchers and so on, but the references to food don't stop there: the various locations in the map have emblematic names (from Pasta Plaza to the amazing San Francheesco) and the progressive shrinkage of the typical scenario of the genre is caused by a gigantic wave of melted butter. Beyond these peculiarities, Butter Royale basically behaves like a classic battle royale: once the game has started, you choose on the map from which point to start and move in search of weapons and equipment, with the aim of being there last of the 32 participants to remain alive. Despite the isometric view and the simplified control system, Butter Royale doesn't miss a pinch of strategy: each weapon has strengths and weaknesses, you can hide in the bushes and supply crates that appear randomly on the map ( suitably in the form of gigantic refrigerators) activate the usual risk/benefit ratio given that in order to be able to open them it is necessary to stand still for a few seconds at the mercy of any adversaries in the vicinity. In its quest for immediacy, Mighty Bear Games has wisely limited battle lengths to a maximum of five minutes, making Butter Royale great for quick play in your spare time. The inevitable downside of such simplicity is represented by the repetitiveness that peeps out after a few games: since the gameplay is very basic, the game runs out of topics rather quickly, leaving the user with the only incentive to accumulate virtual currency to unlock new aesthetic frills for your avatar. The potential longevity of Butter Royale therefore goes hand in hand with the interest that the user of the moment may have in a progression of this type, which to some may still appear cloying even without microtransactions, prize boxes and singing company. It must be said that the developers seem intent on keeping their product alive with events and campaigns that should add a bit of variety to everything, but here we are in the field of hypotheses. The certainties are instead constituted by a mode against artificial intelligence for when you don't want to play online, the possibility of creating or joining a group and a valid technical sector from the point of view of the graphics but less from the sound point of view, characterized by particularly repetitive music.", "date": "2020-02-13", "grade": "7.8"}
