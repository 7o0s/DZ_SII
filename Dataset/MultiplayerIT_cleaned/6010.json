On the other hand, with a portfolio that includes titles of the caliber of La Pucelle: Tactics, Phantom Brave and the Disgaea series, it couldn't be otherwise. Born in 2003 on PlayStation 2 with Hour of Darkness, the latter has become famous from game to game until it becomes almost synonymous with strategic JRPG. Among other things, there are also several spin-offs of the saga, including many visual novels, as well as a free-to-play mobile version, Disgaea: Netherworld Unbound. In short, it will not be a million-dollar series, but we are certainly faced with a name capable of building a hard core of enthusiasts over the years, uninterested in trendy graphics or simplified mechanics, and more eager to throw themselves into the complex worlds that Nippon Ichi has always knew how to create. After all, the Disgaea series has become famous precisely for the depth of the gameplay, as well as for the massive dose of irony that permeates its stories, two elements that now constitute a real ~trademark~ for the Japanese team. In this sense, let's see if the latter has also been applied in this fifth regular episode, which arrives exclusively on PlayStation 4. The world of Disgaea comes to PlayStation 4 with a story brimming with humor and novelty Revenge, terrible revenge! The plot that forms the backdrop to the adventure is not very original, with the Overlords of the Netherworld willing to seal unlikely alliances in order to save their kingdoms from the threat of the demon emperor Void Dark and his soldiers, known as the Lost, but it is like always full of facets, especially in relation to the personalities of the various protagonists. The main one is the demon Killia, who wants to take revenge on the terrible Void Dark for reasons that will be discovered during the game, and which we obviously prefer not to reveal. He's a decidedly solitary type, but capable of gestures of great altruism, except at the table, since he's a big glutton. At his side the player finds Seraphina, the princess of the nation of Gorgeous, vain, spoiled and willing to do anything to avoid the marriage of interest imposed by the family with Void Dark; even to kill her future husband. And again, Christo, who doesn't really like direct combat, but has incredible tactical skills, or Usalia, the heir to the throne of another kingdom, with a friendly personality but forced by a curse to fight on horseback of a large Prinny yellow, as well as eating tons of curry to not become aggressive (confirming the crazy irony that permeates every aspect of the game). In short, as we wrote just now, it is the details that make the narrative experience fun, with the nice animations of the characters, their delusional river dialogues, and the many comic situations that repay the user for the time spent following everything. Each character has his own attack techniques and special powers, which he develops with a lot of patience and dedication by accumulating experience points and leveling up (the maximum achievable for each is 9,999), or by equipping himself properly. In terms of gameplay, therefore, the structure of Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance does not differ much from that of its predecessors. The player must travel through a series of areas within the various realms of the underworld in search of items, weapons and allies to fight against the destroyer demon mentioned earlier. The missions can be accessed from a hub map, where you arrive from the party headquarters (Pocket Netherworld), which then constitutes the focal point of the adventure. This is where you can organize everything between battles: recruit new elements, heal the wounded in the special hospital, access side missions, save your game or buy new equipment. Inner worlds This mini world is a sort of microcosm that can be customized not only from an aesthetic point of view, given that it also has an ~active~ role during the clashes, for example giving particular benefits to allies or, on the contrary, imposing specific penalties on enemies. Inside there is, as mentioned, everything, even the Strategy Assembly, where you can get extra elements or unlock new functions and shops, perhaps by bribing some senators at the time of the vote, and the Item World, i.e. ~the worlds~ all inside certain objects. As per the tradition for the series, each contains a series of randomly generated floors populated by numerous monsters and bosses, overcoming which the powers of the ~analysed~ equipment can be increased, and much more. Then there are the Innocents, creatures that live inside objects and can attributetheir various bonuses. For example, an Innocent of the Gladiator category with a score of five can improve the attack parameters of a weapon by as many points. If desired, they can be moved from object to object or merged with each other. And if by chance the weapon or item where you want to place a small group of them cannot accommodate many, you can always expand its capabilities by going to the Item Assembly within the Item World. The Innocent Shop is also very useful, one of the shops in the player's mini Netherworld, which acts as a warehouse where you can keep all the Innocents, and also allows you to automatically manage a whole series of elements related to them while you are in battle, including the possibility of sending them to a sort of ~farm~ to accumulate experience and, in the presence of two or more Innocents, sometimes obtain new and more powerful ones. The Innocent Farms themselves can be improved by giving more resources to the so-called Innocent Caretaker Squad. Playstation 4 trophies Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance offers 51 trophies, including secret ones, divided into 38 Bronze, 10 Silver, 2 Gold and 1 Platinum. To obtain them, for example, you need to complete different types of quests or the various episodes, capture a hundred prisoners, reach a level equal to or higher than 9,999, obtain some particularly rare object or the legendary weapon of the Item World, etc. Team play As far as the battle system is concerned, it does not stray too far from the canons of the series and therefore remains that of a strategic role-playing game, with the characters controlled by the player who have to deal with groups of enemies, taking turns on maps divided into grids. Compared to the other chapters, Nippon Ichi has however introduced some interesting innovations in the combat system. Meanwhile, it must be said that the power of PlayStation 4 has allowed the team to get to display, in the advanced stages of the game, up to one hundred characters simultaneously on the map, against the ten of the previous chapters. This is no small detail because the high number of enemies makes some battles decidedly epic. Among the real combat options, together with the Team Attack, i.e. the collaboration of two or more nearby party members to earn bonuses and improve the damage of the attacks, the Squad Attacks have been added. These start from the same principle as the others, but allow the execution of powerful special techniques depending on the type of team. In practice, it is possible to create specific groups of characters commanded by a leader, and have them perform particular tasks in battle, obtaining benefits in exchange, such as perks or special skills, as well as the possibility of sharing part of the leader's experience points. Squads can perform various functions, from capturing enemies to interrogating them, and so on. The prisoners, in fact, can be persuaded to join the protagonists, on the field or in the rear, in such a way as to exploit their qualities, including the classes they belong to, which include the new Wrestler, Maid and Dark Knight, just to name a few. someone. Another important novelty is the Revenge Mode, which is activated in particular conditions, such as when one's companions suffer heavy damage or are defeated. When a special bar is filled, the characters' stats increase (also applies to enemies) and Overloads can be used. These are particular and unique skills for each main character, which can alter the phases of the battle: Seraphina bewitches enemies with her charm, making them slaves and confused for a while, while Red Magnus, the strong Overlord of the nation of Scorching Flame, becomes gigantic for three turns, just to give two examples. Little worlds grow In addition to those already reported, there are also others that are revived from past chapters and that alter aspects of the game, such as the Magichange, Dual Magichange functions (a kind of double fusion for the creation of huge, very powerful weapons) or the classic Geo panel. These are colored panels found on some terrain, which affect the characters positioned above her in a positive or negative way. By shattering on it small pyramids of different colors that are scattered in the area, however, their effects can be changed (this happens for all chromatically similar panels). For example, if a green square is able to give those standing on it an extra move on the tactical board, converting it to yellow could reduce the ranged attack power of some enemies, or their resistance, by 50%. The effects of the Geo are manifold and must be discovered stage after stage. Moving on to something else, let's take a lookgive to online. In this sense, Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance offers some interesting features on paper. We wrote ~on paper~ because due to some limitations related to the game's services it was not possible for us to try it, so we have to rely on what the developer declared. In any case, the player will be able to show his Netherworld pocket to his friends and share it together with other minor elements or, by making a stream, obtain ~experience~ in the game based on the number of spectators who will follow him. If he gets comments later, he can even get bonus items. As you can see, it's nothing serious, but it's still a matter of pleasant elements and in some ways original, especially if they work as described. As for the technical part, the transition to the new generation of consoles has brought some benefits to the game. Mind you, we are not talking about who knows what technical upheavals, but the sprites are large, detailed and colorful, properly enhancing the design of the characters, as always curated by Takehito Harada, historical signature of the series. Ditto the scenarios, conceptually simple but chromatically and stylistically appreciable, while the animations are a little disappointing, a little ~wooden~ even for the characters in two-dimensional graphics. In general, while not deviating much from past productions of the series on PlayStation 3, the product is still more pleasant to look at. Moving on to the audio sector, the music curated by Maestro Tenpei Sato, historical composer of the series, is excellent as always. The songs that form the soundtrack, both instrumental and vocal, are spot on, and Kill Real stands out above all, sung in the animated introduction of the game by the original voice actor of Killia, Mamoru Miyano, and the beautiful Lieze Love and Lieze Lullaby, by Aimi . The English dubbing is good, which is not up to the Japanese one, but still makes a good impression.", "date": "2015-09-29", "grade": "8.6"}
