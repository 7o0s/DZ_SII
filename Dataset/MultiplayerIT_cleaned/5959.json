We must give credit to the Japanese company for having managed to develop a ~microcosm~ so deep and detailed that it can afford extravagant releases like this Dancing All Night: without the charm of the characters we have come to love in the original PlayStation 2 title, there probably will not they could never have been remakes and spin-offs. Nor have tons of gadgets, action figures, and print or TV adaptations. The protagonists of Persona 4 (and Persona 3, by now by reflection) have entered the collective imagination, becoming real mascots. For the uninitiated, the original JRPG has already been followed by two canonical fighting games (developed by Arc System Works) and an impromptu spin-off: now it's the turn of a rhythm game, even if the paternity of the idea probably belongs to Square Enix, which with his Theathryhtm inspired first by Final Fantasy and then by Dragon Quest he has also successfully experimented with this path. Can the same be said for this first musical adventure of Yu Narukami and his former schoolmates? Yu and friends solve a new mystery by dancing and singing in Persona 4: Dancing All Night Saturday night fever The story of Persona 4: Dancing All Night officially follows that of Persona 4 and, indeed, takes place a month after the epilogue of the Golden version released for PlayStation Vita, and therefore before the events narrated in the two fighting games Persona 4: Arena. Despite being a rhythm game along the lines of Hatsune Mikue: Project DIVA, Atlus' touch is felt as soon as Story Mode starts, and that is a long, very long visual novel that tells the story through an incredible amount of written and dubbed dialogues in excellent English. Although a barely scholastic knowledge of the language is enough, non-English speakers are warned: they will hardly be able to stomach a story that unfolds for more than eight hours, only occasionally interspersed with short gameplay sessions. True fans who decide to follow the new ups and downs of the world's most bizarre detective team will discover the usual, meticulous care that Atlus dedicates to dialogues, gags and first-person narration: Dancing All Night explores the relationships between the characters and further explores its particular idiosyncrasies, starting from an assumption that is nothing short of absurd. Rise Kujikawa is back on stage, and she asked her friends to accompany her on stage for the Love Meets Bonds festival. Unfortunately, a mysterious accident occurs and the singers of the Kanamin Kitchen group disappear into thin air: in reality, they have been sucked into the Midnight Stage, a kind of parallel dimension in which Yu, Rise and company will have to venture to save them. There is one small problem, though, and that is that they can't fight with their Personas. The only way to express their feelings will be to dance on the stage of the Midnight Stage, and thus defeat the Shadows who dwell there. The best of the Story Mode is given by the interactions between the characters, since it must be admitted that the first half of the visual novel is incredibly boring; towards the fourth chapter, however, the story takes flight, introducing some more old and new characters and finally the mysterious and disturbing atmospheres to which the games of the Persona series have accustomed us. Despite the quality of the script, we have to admit that we found the length of this story mode a little excessive, which at times takes itself a little too seriously and goes on too long, further expanding the game phases. Even if it is possible to speed up the narrative sequences, Story Mode is still a mandatory step in terms of gameplay, as it unlocks most of the music tracks offered by Atlus, as well as some additional ~playable~ characters. Once these contents have been unlocked, it is possible to replay each song, customizing it as desired, in the Free Dance mode: the latter is a bit the heart of the game, since it allows you to choose the difficulty level of the challenges, as well as the dancer's partners who has to face them. By successfully completing each game, you earn yen to spend in the usual Tanaka shop to buy items that allow you to further customize the difficulty level (by altering the notes, for example) or the costumes and accessories with which you can dress up the personages. Do you want to dance in the company of Yukiko dressed as a waitress or Rise in a bikini? You can. Unless you prefer Kanji dressed as a Christmas reindeer... PSVita trophies You will get the platinum trophy after winning 3 gold, 15 silver and 21 bronze trophies. It goes without saying that you will have to completare everything but everything: buy every costume, object or accessory; unlock every song, every partner, every possible combination and conquer practically every medal. For some it will be a titanic undertaking! Footloose Playing Persona 4: Dancing All Night is quite simple, and Teddie will explain it to you in a couple of very short interactive tutorials. Basically the notes unravel in the form of stars from the center of the screen, heading towards the right or left edge, where they will cross the icons representing the keys that must be pressed at the right time: down, up and left on the d-pad, or triangle, circle and X. Sometimes a blue or white circle will also appear which at a certain point will coincide with the circumference virtually described by the icons on the interface: by acting on the left analog stick it will be possible to further increase the score, even if this ~move~ is not mandatory and does not affect the score. enthusiasm of the public. The latter is represented by small icons on the upper portion of the screen, however, and will depend on the quality of your performance. In short, get too many notes wrong and you will be sent back to the dressing room. It must be said that Dancing All Night tends to be rather permissive, in this sense, and does not require total precision in the inputs: sometimes the Perfect is obtained even if the rhythm is slightly wrong, and it is a good and right thing since following it, especially at advanced difficulty levels, it is quite difficult. The fault, however absurd it may seem, lies with the splendid technical sector: during the song, the character on duty dances and fidgets on the stage in the center of the interface, following the rhythm of the music and our inputs and also commenting on his own performance . Furthermore, playing well, a second character also takes the stage, a partner who dances and sings together with the dancer on duty. The polygonal models are beautifully animated and detailed, and the choreography is outstanding; each character dances according to his own style and changes steps according to the partner who accompanies him, all to the rhythm of the songs taken from Persona 4 and its spin-offs, often masterfully remixed for the occasion, even if some of these rearrangements they seemed a little too similar to the original songs included in the compilation anyway. And while our favorites dance like crazy, the camera rotates around them in a wild explosion of lights, colors and psychedelic images. In short, everything is very beautiful, a pity that it is not very noticeable: the gaze tends to focus first on the notes and their possible combinations, without being able to linger on the choreography that takes place in the center of the screen, which at a certain point even becomes a distraction , especially when facing the higher difficulty levels and trying to follow the icons that appear in the center of this riot of colors and splash rapidly towards the sides of the interface. Obviously practice makes perfect and slowly you begin to memorize the rhythms and notes, the fact remains that at times the efforts of the Atlus artists have gone a bit wasted: a pity, also because they are the only sequences that cannot be reviewed in the otherwise exhaustive Collection mode, full of illustrations and information on the characters and songs in compilations, which it is even possible to archive at will and listen to as an MP3 player.", "date": "2015-10-20", "grade": "8.0"}
