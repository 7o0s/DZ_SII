{"name": "Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trine-4-the-nightmare-prince-recensione.html", "text": "The Trine series is back, and as you are about to read in our review of Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince it is a very clear return to the origins. Closed the short parenthesis Nine Parchments, which for the moment does not seem to be destined to have a sequel (not immediately, at least) Frozenbyte has chosen to return to the game which in 2009 sanctioned the fame of the studio in the panorama of indie productions; fame then reconfirmed two years later in 2011 with Trine 2 and partially questioned with the ambivalent Trine 3. Clearly it is still not possible for us to read the future, but Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince could represent the perfect moment to conclude the saga of Amadeus, Pontius and Zoya, a summation of the best the previous chapters had to offer and, at the same time, a demonstration that perhaps there is very little left to explore. The plot: a new mission Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince immediately catapults the player into the heart of the narrative, which forms the backbone of the entire production. It is almost assumed that all three previous chapters have already been played in the past, so as to get to know Amadeus the magician, Pontius the knight and Zoya the thief well; in reality it will not be like this for everyone, but this is not a problem because the depth of the narrative axis leaves the time it finds, preferring to tell a pleasant and fairy-tale story, but never really complex or multifaceted. Even the relationships between the various characters are resolved in brief occasional exchanges, without ever really referring to past adventures (which also, we remember, have led the heroes of the Trine to save the kingdom several times). So don't be afraid, if you are a new player in the Frozenbyte series, because Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince is enjoyable and understandable even for all the latest arrivals, who at most will lose some minimal reference that is never really fundamental. After all, you will be able to enjoy a plot that somehow tries to rejuvenate what has already been heard/read/seen previously, succeeding at least in part. The young prince of the kingdom has a great talent for magic, but his presumptuous character and a somewhat fragile psyche have prompted the Academy to ban him from using spells, at least for the moment. Not happy with the decision, the prince still decided to study alone, thus creating an imbalance between the real and dream dimensions. Read: Many ugly purple and dark monsters now haunt him, and they have invaded the world of Trine. The three heroes we know well therefore have the task of bringing him home safe and sound. Playstation 4 trophies Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince features many beautiful shiny Trophies on PlayStation 4, including the Platinum Trophy. To get it, just complete the main story and then start the individual chapters to collect all the collectibles. Look closely and you won't miss anything along the way. Gameplay Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince is once again a puzzle platformer, like the first three chapters of the franchise, but this time Frozenbyte has decided to go back to its origins also from an aesthetic and stylistic point of view. So forget the 3D sessions of Trine 3, as well as the pure 2D of some moments of Trine 1 and Trine 2: Trine 4 is completely in 2.5D; it is also superior to all the previous chapters also from the point of view of the graphic-technical sector and of the artistic direction, although having to continually remember the ~already seen before~. However, we will talk about this later. The gameplay has remained unchanged: once again the player controls three different characters, and never at the same time (unless playing online). Amadeus the magician is able to summon crates to climb on, or in any case with which he can interact with the surrounding environment; Pontius is the warrior who can keep enemies and various types of dangers at bay, thanks to his sword and shield; Zoya is the most agile of the trio, a master thief and a skilled archer. The abilities of the individual characters must be combined to basically achieve three different but all connected objectives: reaching the end of the various levels proposed, collecting all the collectibles along the way, finally defeating powerful end-of-Act bosses, some of which are truly spectacular. For example we defeated a Wolf born from the prince's nightmare that took up the entire screen, while also having to keep secondary henchmen at bay. Almost always it is Pontius who comes in handy in these ~war situations~. Progression, collectibles, skills The progression of Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince is extremely linear, perhaps even more than seen in the previous chapters. The difficulty levels proposed, at least initially, areor ~easy~ and ~normal~, but in truth already at ~normal~ everything is extremely simplified. Apart from some environmental puzzles that may require several minutes of experimentation before being overcome, the fights against enemies are very occasional and accessible, and in general Frozenbyte accompanies the narrative with suggestions of various types. The goal seems to be to allow everyone to enjoy a good story, without ever stopping for too long at any specific point. A few more stimuli would have gratified the sense of progression. Clearly it is the skills of Amadeus, Zoya and Pontius that will allow both to reach that blessed fugitive prince once and for all (from 7 to 10 hours of play will be enough and they will advance), and to collect all the various collectibles scattered throughout the levels. These are divided into magic flasks (they are used to enhance the characters' abilities), artifacts of various types (crowns, sceptres, treasures), and then again letters that provide little background on the main adventure. Assuming that it is not essential to upgrade the characters to get to the end credits (the basic skills will be given away by the developers once certain points in the story are reached), all the collectibles present will simply allow you to obtain the 100% completion level (and in case the Platinum Trophy on PlayStation 4). Amadeus, Pontius, and Zoya's skills are displayed at all times in the skill tree, broken down by character and category. Some upgrades make the adventure easier, but most of them remain purely incidental. Zoya, for example, can almost immediately learn a skill that allows her to identify the weak points of enemies, so as to inflict more damage on them; Amadeus however, later in the narrative, will learn to summon two boxes at a time. This at least partially favors the replayability of previous levels, where some treasures were previously unreachable. But other than that, there is very little impetus to complete the main narrative again. Graphically, artistically and technically speaking, Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince is a feast for the eyes, and brings all the elements already worthy of praise in the previous chapters of the saga to another level of care and detail. However, this does not prevent a tired, constant repechage operation: it is still the fourth chapter of the franchise, and by now the good ideas have long since run out. In Trine 4 you shouldn't be looking for something new and challenging, but a new opportunity to enjoy what you already enjoyed in the previous chapters, with an overall operation based on constant variation.", "date": "2019-10-07", "grade": "8.0"}
