{"name": "Spider-Man: Amici o Nemici - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spider-man-amici-o-nemici-recensione_a.html", "text": "With the long trail of hype surrounding the third Spider-Man film recently revived by its arrival on various home video formats, Activision still strikes the hot iron with a new video game based on the famous Marvel character, which however has little to do with the Sam Raimi trilogy. It is a secondary production, deliberately aimed at a necessarily smaller audience than the blockbuster Spider-Man 3, dedicated above all to the most assiduous fans of Spider-Man. The idea behind the game is interesting (although it seems born from the mind of another and far more disturbing ~spider~ from the comics, that of Rat-Man): for once, all of Spider-Man's historical enemies decide (willingly unwillingly) to team up with our hero to fight off a mysterious invasion of seemingly alien beings. It is a threat that keeps the whole world in check, and Spider-Man, together with his entire gang of superhero villains, are the only ones who can stop it. At the beginning of the story Spider-Man is literally ~taken~ by Colonel Nick Fury, part of the global defense agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and taken inside his helicopter, a sort of helicopter / spaceship that will be the base of operations for our heroes for the entire duration of the game. So far, the premises are comforting, but the problems arise as soon as a mission is selected to be undertaken by activating the teleporters in charge. Old fashioned beat 'em up In recent years we have often wondered what happened to the glorious tradition of scrolling fighting games. The disquisition could occupy entire pages, but it is quite clear that, first with the advent of 3D and then of new hardware technologies, the Double Dragon-style beatem'up got lost somewhere, without being able to find a real generational evolution, from the early 90s to today. This Spider-Man: Friend or Foe can be reconnected to that glorious lost genre, but it takes up its negative sides more than anything else, enhancing its limits rather than bringing its gameplay and structure to new qualitative levels. In fact, the game structure fully falls into the category of fighting game: the protagonist goes through the various levels in the company of a partner, with whom to beat all the enemies that populate the areas. The action unfolds in the typical syncopated rhythm of the genre, as you explore a short stretch of the level, you are surrounded by an increasing number of enemies, eliminating them all in order to continue on to another area of the scenario. The main problems are represented by the graphic paucity that distinguishes the product, especially when compared to the current videogame production and to Spider-Man 3 itself, also by Activision, and the monotony of the game action. It is clear how the game was developed with the possibility of being enjoyed with a partner in mind Old fashioned beat 'em up The enemies are not even distinguished by a refined artificial intelligence, so much so that they look like puppets, ready to be defeated en masse without even the need to vary the attacks and the numerous combos and special skills, and despite differing in gender they are practically all the same. Periodically, the presence of a mid or late level boss intervenes to slightly modify the basic structure, forcing you to change the approach to the enemy and develop an elementary functional strategy through the study of the opponent's attack/defense patterns. Usually the various bosses are represented by the historical enemies of Spider-Man, who will have to be beaten and then joined their company. It is clear how the game was developed keeping in mind the possibility of being enjoyed with a companion: Spider-Man is always accompanied by a sidekick, managed by the CPU, and possibly controlled by a second user who can enter the game at any time thus increasing the fun. Friends and enemies There are practically no particular objectives in the game, beyond the total elimination of enemies within the various levels, which can be achieved simply by continuing from area to area, until the end. Gradually the various villains are ~liberated~, they join our cause and we advance through the six scenarios that make up the available missions. A little depth is given to the game structure by the possibility of increasing the skills and characteristics of both the protagonist and all the ~companions~ (14 in total, progressively unlockable). The elimination of enemies, and the destruction of certain elements of the scenario, allows the collection of various coins, with which it is possible to buy upgrades. These can be selected by connecting to the appos equipment on the helicarrier, and they differ in two categories: base stats and special abilities. The first includes power-ups to energy, strength and resistance to attacks, while the second includes a plethora of power-ups that allow the execution of a large number of different moves (manual attacks, aerial attacks, combos, and numerous different uses of the web, as far as Spider-Man is concerned). The layout of the controls in the game is extremely simple: with the A key you jump, with the X you attack, with the B you use the web and with Y you change the character between the main and the secondary (both remain in the field anyway) . With the back keys you can scroll through the various active skills (with Spider-Man), while the combos take place with the classic succession of pressing the various keys. The offer, from this point of view, is wide, as happens in less refined products, it is practically possible to defeat almost all enemies through the simple and repetitive pressure of the single attack button, eliminating the depth of the gameplay. Each direction of the digital cross is assigned a particular action, such as momentary invulnerability, an increase in the power of the blows, or a devastating combined attack that Spider-Man can implement together with his partner at the moment. These are also good additions to the basic dynamic of the fighting game, but the generally low difficulty of the game leads to using these skills only in boss fights, because during the levels it is really difficult to get stuck. The discovery of some secret areas within the levels allows you to use these as arenas, for a one-on-one fighting mode. While it does indeed bring some variety to the action, the less-than-polished combat system performs worse in a fight that should be technical, such as head-to-head, than the frantic pace of the normal scrolling ~beatem'up~ phase ~. A nice idea, but it doesn't add much quality to the substance of the game. Last gen fighting game? The technical sector of Spider-Man: Friend or Foe is decidedly scarce (and here, we are referring to the tested version, the one for Xbox 360): in several respects, it would not be too surprising to see it as it is (precisely, in its version Xbox 360) on one of the last generation consoles. Wherever you look, it is difficult to notice the next-gen spark oozing between the rather reduced polygon models of the characters and, above all, of the scenarios. The look adopted is deliberately cartoonish, and can be an appreciable choice, but the realization is not distinguished by a particular style adopted which makes everything coherent. The settings are flat, and do not offer particular stimuli to carry on the exploration, in concert with the already monotonous game action of its own. The scenarios refer to the various areas of the world where the mysterious threat has appeared, but none of them is distinguished by particular graphic characteristics, they are bare and completely lifeless, with little detail and almost no effects. Even admitting the desire to keep the graphics of the game closer to that of a Spider-Man comic, or a cartoon, such a realization cannot be interpreted as a stylistic figure, the sensation that derives from it is rather that given from a work that is not too thorough, which is not suited to a modern production for a title sold at full price. Conversely, the facetious atmosphere with which Next Level (the development team in charge of the game) has marked the title in question, makes it relatively fun and enjoyable in some situations, such as in part of the dialogues and in the intermission skits, which in this way they move away a bit from the machismo of this genre of games, instead bringing the Marvel character back to a more properly comic dimension. Xbox 360 - Goals The achievements inserted into the game are strangely few, in contrast to what happens with most current Xbox 360 games. That's 12 achievements for the usual total of 1000 points. The richest objectives are assigned with the completely total of the various levels, and to reach them it is necessary not only to finish them up to the boss, but also to discover all the secrets present in the settings. The others are unlocked above all through the completion of upgrades, or the execution of particular combos or special moves. In general, it doesn't seem too difficult to reach 1000 gamerpoints, but it certainly requires commitment. Comment Unfortunately there really aren't many points in favor of this Spider-Man: Friend or Foe. Even passing over the really poor graphics that characterize the game, the gameplay fails to stand outfor its ability to entertain. It is a fighting game that is particularly based on the repetitiveness of the action which, combined with the poor artificial intelligence of the enemies, flattens the gaming experience to a continuous repetition of the same events: short exploratory phase - furious fight against the group of enemies - new exploratory stage. Unless you are a true fan of Arrampicamuri, it is difficult to justify the presence of this title within the current videogame offer, so full of alternatives. As it is, it remains a game based on a cute idea that hasn't found a good development and that, if played in two, can give hours of fun, until the repetitiveness of the action takes over. Pros: Cute the idea behind it: Spider-Man together with the villains In multiplayer he earns a few points The facetious atmosphere softens the tones well Cons: Technical realization too spartan Action repetitive and without bite Not difficult, and not even long", "date": "2007-10-30", "grade": null}
