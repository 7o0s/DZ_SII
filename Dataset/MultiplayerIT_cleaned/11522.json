{"name": "Teslagrad 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/teslagrad-2-recensione.html", "text": "Rain Games' Teslagrad was the prototype of the perfect indie game: small, full of creativity and peculiar mechanics that offered a unique take on platform games in its own way. To finish it, the player had to prove that he possesses both great skill with the controller and the intelligence to tackle the challenging puzzles that littered the game world. Conceptually it was near Braid, even if the game mechanics were completely different. Now, after about ten years, the official sequel has arrived in a market that has completely changed its face in the meantime. Will he be able to break through? Find out in the Teslagrad 2 review. Gameplay Some passages of Teslagrad 2 are difficult The vibrations that are felt when starting the game apparently seem the same as in the first chapter, but in reality, even starting from similar assumptions, it soon becomes clear that here everything is more accelerated and dynamic and that the platform part has taken on greater importance than in the predecessor . Teslagrad 2 is like a roller coaster ride, at least when it's at its best. You spend your time running from one part of the map to another, sliding at breakneck speed on circular ramps while avoiding chasms and obstacles. It turns into an electric discharge to follow the threads that lead from one part of the game world to another, creating unthinkable connections that ideally replace fast travel. You break floors, you fall from endless heights, you float using the teslamancy of the protagonist and you dart in the water reaching previously unattainable places. It would almost be tempting to mention the word metroidvania, but doing so would be a blunder because most of the time it goes straight on, with the scenarios flowing fluidly in front of the player's eyes, asking him to go back and forth just in case want to search for all hidden collectibles (cards) or fall into some chasm. There are powers to collect to unlock new areas, but they are always quickly reachable from the point where you are at the moment of the upgrade. Part of the fulcrum of the gameplay is always the resolution of the puzzles, as in the first chapter, but in our opinion simpler to allow the greater dynamism of the game to be expressed without castrations. Teslagrad 2 is basically a 2D puzzle platformer. It tells the story of Lumina, a young Teslaman (members of the Tesla family or one of his pupils) who at the beginning of the game crashes into Wyrmheim, a Nordic land full of decidedly unfriendly creatures, where an immense, apparently abandoned tower stands out. The Teslamants are peaceful and run completely unarmed, so Lumina was powerless against the brutal assault suffered by a group of Viking raiders, who took a few well-placed cannon shots to bring down her small craft. But now she must find a way to survive and return home, while discovering what is hidden in her past and who is the mysterious guy who decided to help her. A fascinating world The bosses of Teslagrad 2 are well designed The initial impact of Teslagrad 2 is somewhat astounding. While not explaining its systems, it puts the player perfectly at ease by giving him the necessary space to understand the basic mechanics and functioning of the first powers. Instead of stalling too much with tutorials and explanations, immediately throw the player into the action by creating introductory moments to new skills that are always contextual and never forced. Furthermore, it immediately manages to fascinate with illustrated book graphics and its dynamics as brisk as they are engaging. As mentioned above, we are faced with a physics-based puzzle game that is certainly not ashamed of being one. So here we are using Lumina's electromagnetic powers to attach us to walls or to overcome insidiously placed electrical discharges, with the major difficulty being never understanding how to do (we only got stuck in front of two puzzles throughout the game, including the final one) how much to be able to do it, between very narrow passages, traps that must be overcome by coordinating all the skills available and more insidious than tough enemies. Teslagrad 2 is much more dynamic than Teslagrad, especially when all the powers of Lumina have been collected In this sense, the first chapter certainly had more complex puzzles, while here the rhythm of the action was favored more. Furthermore, even in Teslagrad 2, a kind of weapon is obtained only at the end of the game, with the player having to think about how to face the few enemies scattered around the areas using the other powers in creative way, like the three-phase electric skeletons or the strange and voracious animals from which you can only escape and which also chase you on the platforms. From time to time you have to face bosses, also built basically like puzzles, between crates to throw, enemies to explode at the right time, slides to coordinate with enemy attacks and floors to smash. These are well-designed clashes, which also turn out to be among the most spectacular moments of the game. The problems of Teslagrad 2 The story is more complex than it seems, too bad it's mostly told by collectibles Unfortunately Teslagrad 2 has some problems that prevent it from achieving excellence. Meanwhile, the strange mapping of the controls, which emerges above all in the final part. Incidentally, some actions share the same button and can lead to confusion just when the gameplay expresses its maximum complexity. The second problem is all narrative, so to speak. As previously written, the game world is very beautiful and there are some decidedly spectacular moments, in particular those of traveling above the electric cables. Sadly most of the backstory of Lumina's story is told through collectibles, which are really well hidden. It is certainly an incentive not to go straight to the end and open up to exploration, but something more could have been done to make the most important facts more present, so as to increase the player's involvement in a story that otherwise ends up appearing too much cold. Lumina's powers create some interesting situations Finally, it is also fair to mention the duration, which for some could be a problem. To finish Teslagrad 2 (without collecting all the cards) it takes between three and five hours, although the challenge level is quite high and some passages are really difficult. Be that as it may, after seeing the ending, the only incentive to go back to playing are the cards or trying a speedrun. This didn't bother us particularly, because the writer tends to appreciate more compact games that don't require you to repeat the same loops to exhaustion just to lengthen the stock, but it's clear that for someone it could be a problem.", "date": "2023-04-25", "grade": "8.0"}
