{"name": "Castle Strike", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/castle-strike.html", "text": "Resource management The core of Castle Strike is the introduction of the creation and management of real castles. Don't worry, the basic structure of the strategic game has remained unchanged. So you still have to create workers who pull up the buildings and collect resources. I open a long parenthesis on the collection of resources: this has been completely automated and made less invasive than in other titles. It will no longer be necessary to assign each individual worker to a specific task but, through a comfortable triangle graphical interface and through a bar that indicates the number of workers at your disposal, you can easily assign workers to the construction of buildings or the collection of raw materials. I'll explain. If we had twenty workers we could assign, through the appropriate bar at the bottom of the screen, fifteen to resources and five to the construction of new buildings. The first ones will therefore dedicate themselves to the collection of iron, stone or wood, the second ones will automatically go to build buildings selected and positioned by you. How to assign a certain number of workers to harvest a single resource? Very simple. Near the worker bar just described is a triangle divided into three parts. A resource is drawn on each of these parts. Moving the indicator inside the triangle will also vary the percentages of workers who will go to work on each individual resource. Thus, if we needed wood rather than stone we could move the indicator more towards the first leaving fewer men on the second; while, if we needed stone and iron and less wood, we could move the indicator towards these two resources, temporarily omitting the collection of wood. Once you understand the mechanism, it becomes a trivial matter to decide how to divide the work among your men and, moreover, the automation of resource management allows you not to get too distracted during the long and demanding battles. [C] The woodcutter's hut will go; built the most; as close to trees as possible Troops can be healed with these shrines [/C] Variety Castle Strike offers a great variety of missions. They range from the classic ~accumulate resources, create an army, massacre the enemy~ missions to others in which you will have to lead only a small group of men to get to real stealth missions complete with enemies equipped with a visual cone. Nothing that screams revolution, but definitely fun additions that keep the game interesting until the end. Castles what a passion! Let's get back to serious stuff. We were talking at the beginning of the previous paragraph about building and managing castles. Your territory on the map will ideally be divided into two parts: the castle and the village (which can be in the vicinity of the first but never inside its territory). While the village will have to be left without fortifications other than a few men to assign to its defense, the castle can (and I would add) be completely surrounded by walls and towers with which to protect the main buildings in case of attack by the opposing troops. In order to build a castle worthy of the name you will first need to have a good amount of resources and then you can dedicate yourself to its design. You will thus have to place the walls and towers as well as decide where to build the gates. Building a good castle is not an easy business. First you'll have to make sure you can fit all the buildings you need into it, secondly you'll have to design it to make it as defensible as possible. Creating more than one wall would be ideal, but in this case the living space for your men would be drastically reduced. In short: creating adequate defenses is no small matter. As soon as you have erected your castle you will have to place troops with long-range attacks (crossbowmen or archers) on the walls and towers (available only after having built an ~advancement~) to be able to say the work is finished. Simple heroes and troops Obviously the primary aim of the game is to lead your army against fierce opponents. This will be made up of various troops, the most important of which is certainly the hero (a must in every last generation strategic game). The hero will obviously be able to level up and become much more powerful than all the other troops. In addition to this, he will also be able to bring together the men available under his ~flag~ forming a real small army. The more heroes you have, the more armies you can form. The advantages of forming armies are obvious: not only will you be able to decide their formation and you will be able to move them with just onemouse click; but depending on the tactical set-up chosen, you will immediately receive bonuses in attack or defense. The troops at your disposal will be the classic warriors with shield and sword, pikemen and archers. Obviously there will be many variations: by performing upgrades in some buildings you can equip your men with advanced equipment to make them more difficult to knock down or more effective in attack. For example, you can equip warriors with larger shields to make them immune to enemy archers or you can give archers flaming arrows with which to do more damage and with which they can better destroy enemy buildings. An excellent possibility is to create horses with which to make your troops fast and lethal. In addition to the regular troops there will be some nice tools specially made for besieging castles and destroying their defences. How can we fail to mention the extremely powerful catapults that destroy the opposing walls? And the ballistae? Excellent both against troops on walls and towers and against enemies on foot. Conclusions Castle Strike could have been a true masterpiece in the field of strategic games, especially in a period like this so in need of good games in this area. ~Could~ because there are some elements that needed to be taken care of much better. For example, the intelligence of our men, which if set to ~aggressive~ leads them to senselessly attack anything that moves, while if set to ~normal~ makes them prey to a strange aporia... that is, they stand still even if ten paces away they are slaughtering their comrade. Another unpleasant element is the graphics engine. Sure, it's not essential, but the eye also wants its part: some animations are really limited and, especially when you go into detail, you see textures that it would be better not to see. Let's not talk about a certain confusion in the action and some moments of panic during the pitched battles in which you no longer know which way to turn. No insurmountable problems, of course, but many flaws which, if they had been solved in the beta-testing phase, would have led to the creation of a masterpiece. Pros: Great variety Really addictive Castles are a welcome change Cons: Troop AI is bad Poor graphics A bit confusing in larger battles A real-time strategy set in the Middle Ages? In fact, there is nothing original about it since there are many RTSs that have a similar setting. Even at the plot level, Castle Strike does not attempt to go beyond the classic clichs of the setting with lots of kingdoms in danger, private vendettas that become state affairs and damsels to be saved kidnapped by the villain of the moment. What is striking is the fact that the events narrated are told particularly well and, in a certain sense, fascinate even though they do not show dizzying videos or other accessories of this kind. In fact, the cut scenes are made using the main graphics engine with an extremely limited visual horizon and with the models and animations of the troops in the field very close to just enough. Yet it is passionate. It will be that the first campaign presents various missions that try to differentiate themselves a lot, it will be that soon one feels part of the game and, having understood the fundamental mechanisms that regulate the action, one begins to appreciate the work done by the developers to try to create a title that introduces something new into the swampy world of RTS.
