{"name": "World Soccer Winning Eleven 9", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-soccer-winning-eleven-10.html", "text": "World Soccer Winning Eleven 9 Winning Eleven is a series that has always been able to produce, up to now, particularly well-made games, renewing itself from year to year, often from month to month (just think of the various ~evolved~ versions of March-April), without losing anything good built over the years, but rather, using precisely the positive aspects developed up to then, as a basis for subsequent masterpieces. In fact, every year we find ourselves faced with an increasingly sophisticated, increasingly complete product, as if KTYO were racing against time to create, piece by piece, the best of the best football simulations. Without neglecting any detail. Even the most ~insignificant~, in some ways. The first thing that appears to the eye, for example, loading the DVD of this Winning Eleven 9 on our Ps2, is the care with which the selection menu of the various game modes has been created. Well, even here Konami now seems to fear no comparisons. It has adapted to the competition, and the spartan and not very winking screens seen in other chapters of the saga have for some time been replaced by others more suited to a title of the value of this one we are reviewing, and which bring to mind those of some past editions of FIFA. A sign that, at least from an aesthetic point of view, the Japanese softo is looking to its Canadian rivals to offer pre-race cosmetics similar to TV productions. These game management menus, therefore, are very clean and elegant in their sober style, as well as very functional. From the main screen, as always, you can access the various game modes, the usual ones and which for this reason we are not going to re-list you. If anything, we limit ourselves to pointing out the new one, the ~Road to World Cup 2006~, a game mode that allows the gamer to lead the Japanese national team, and only that, on its long journey towards the next 2006 World Cup which will take place Germany next summer, starting from the Asian qualifying group. Facing internationals such as India, Singapore, North Korea, Oman and Bahrain, you will have to fight your way from match to match to make it to the final tournament in Europe. In its constant effort to create a database that increasingly complies with the expectations of millions of fans, Konami has acquired the official licenses for some new clubs, such as Chelsea and Arsenal, Porto, Dinamo Kiew, Galatasaray and Glasgow Rangers, as well as confirmation of the ~old~ ones for the Dutch championship, the local Serie A and the Spanish Liga, which translated in a nutshell means official jerseys and rosters for all the clubs of these tournaments, even if, for a change, the official uniforms and the teams present in the various competitions they are updated to the season that has just ended and therefore the newly promoted teams are absent, with the exception of the Eredivisie, which boasts the new ones, Heracles and Sparta Rotterdam. Let the challenge begin But let's focus now on the played aspect and get ready to take the field. The footballers come out of the underpass tunnel. The jerseys, at least those covered by official licenses, appear splendid, very detailed, as well as the turf, while maintaining in some cases a color palette for the green that is a little ~dull~. While our youngsters in their long johns linger in the center of the field for the ritual pre-match photos, we can admire some new shots that show the players shaking hands with their opponents in line, or taken from below near the ball ready to kick start. All offered to our view with a television cut really not bad. Just as the interlude phases between one action and another during matches are now appearing on television, with new skits featuring brawling football players, meticulous referees and even the cheering public. The polygonal structure of the Stadiums presents some artful retouching to offer users an even more credible overview. Even the textures, perhaps due to the use of an ad hoc lighting system, seem brilliant as rarely seen in the recent past. The audience in the stands, despite being in 2D, except when they are framed in close-up in some cases, are still modeled in great detail and animated. Considering that those who play and are caught up in the heat of the match will hardly linger too much to watch it, it does its job very well. In the midst of this polygonal goodness, once again the absence of the linesman (who ~appear~ only in the interludes to signal off-sides) on the sidelines appears unusual, something that is not very important from a practical point of view but which nonetheless out of place a little in such a highly curated aesthetic contextor down to the smallest detail. Another interesting aspect from an aesthetic point of view (and not only as we will see shortly) concerns the change in climatic conditions during the games. In practice, during a meeting, as it happens in reality, it may happen that you see the sky suddenly darken and start to rain. Or worse yet, snow. The climatic conditions will not have a simple aesthetic function, but rather will heavily influence the progress of a race. With the field drenched by heavy rain, just to give a concrete example, ball control will become much more difficult and the physical fatigue of the players will be greatly affected by the state of the pitch, to the point that you could find yourself at the end of the first half with players literally exhausted and in need of a change. This element will undoubtedly create further problems for the gamer, already committed to facing a more aggressive CPU than ever. An A.I. almost human Even if the AI has made great strides in recent years and in general it has always been liked a lot, lately it always seemed to lack that little something extra that would have made it almost perfect. In this WE9 in our opinion, this ~gap~, if you can call it that, has been filled, and now we have the best AI ever for the series. The teams seem more logical in the movements, in the construction of the actions, in the way of conceiving both the defensive phase (splendid, this time) and the offensive one. As for the construction of the game, Konami certainly wanted to meet the (few) complaints of the fans, specifically taking care of the CPU's AI, understood as a ~manager~, finally almost at the level of a human player. And in parallel, logically, the system that manages the passages, precisely the source of the creation of the actions. It seems more sophisticated than usual, and such as to allow the user more total control over their men. Now, more than ever, by moving the directional cross and pressing X to make a pass, you have the distinct sensation of really us deciding where and how to send the ball thanks to a whole series of animations that allow for touches from the outside, forward, internal, more immediate dish. The physics that manages the movements of the ball has also been redone and now the ~ball~ is ~heavier~ than in the previous episode, which will make it more difficult to see absurd ~ping-pong~ style rebounds during the match. As already in the previous chapter, according to the length of time you will spend pressing the button, the power with which the pass is made will vary in intensity, just as according to the position assumed by the player you control at that moment you will make a particular type of ride. Only this time, at least in set pieces, we will be able to adjust with the help of a bar. Just like shooting. It will appear on the screen every time we press the X key. In this sense, the improved intelligence of the attackers is interesting, more inclined, always on the basis of their technical parameters, to enter deeply with diagonal movements that are really not bad and absolutely credible, which they often entice the gamer to experiment with deep plays and vertical cuts to bypass the surly defenses of the CPU, never, as in this last title of the saga, really difficult to overcome. Even if, where a dense network of passes is not enough, you can always try with the classy shot of some champion. The feints have been improved and now appear less exaggerated and more functional and natural: they are performed without any combination of keys, but simply by moving the D-Pad appropriately, or with the usual R2 or L1 keys. Depending on the kicker you control, this command will generate a different feint. Ronaldinho's famous ~elastic~, for example, can be easily performed by the Brazilian himself by pressing the R2 button twice. The same key, with another sample, will allow you to make another one. The defence Up to now we have analyzed the attack phase, the creation of the game. But what happens when you find yourself having to defend? And how does the CPU behave in the offensive phase? Let's start with this last question: the approach to the attack of the teams controlled by the video game. They move in a very credible way, depending on the schemes adopted and the situations that are presenting themselves at that precise moment, the CPU builds logical actions, with superimpositions on the bands or deadly diagonals. The result is an ability on the other side to always and in any case create credible attacks, never exaggerated. But the improved AI of the game can also be seen in our men (those who we do not control directly) whendo they are forced to defend. The central defenders squeeze better in the center, the midfielders take turns filtering, i.e. one goes towards the opponent's ball carrier (in this case it's always us gamers who press, assuming control) and the other climbs in front of the defenders ready to take over , while the outsiders try to stem the wings that try to spread to ~open~ our backward sector. In this phase it is not recommended to use the Run and X commands to heel the opponents because, given the greater control of the player by the user, and an even more complex redesigned impact physics almost from scratch, nine out of ten risk committing a foul or to go empty by losing balance and allowing the opposing attacker to slingshot to the net. It is interesting to note how Konami has inserted the breakthrough foul, that is, when you run too impetuous on the opponent, and the semi-automatic tackles that can always be achieved with the movement of the directional cross while you are side by side with the opponent. Depending on your position, you can extend your foot to move the ball, intervene in a semi-slide, elbow, hold. Another important novelty is on set pieces. WE8 LE's free kicks have been replaced by a new system for managing set shots which, in addition to developing a whole series of indirect free kick schemes as usual, allows for greater control over the power and effect to be imparted to the ball. By pressing some keys, Triangle or R2 to be exact, you can for example give more tension or effect to the ball respectively. In this perspective of absolute realism, with an increasingly sophisticated gameplay, the addition of two new roles for the players is inserted: the ~hairpin wing~ and the ~second striker~ a la Cassano in support of the fixed centre-forward. These new roles will not be fictitious, but will obviously affect the way the players occupying these positions on the pitch play, and their teams. The Master League The Master League is the part of the game that has undergone few major changes. The modality appears, in some ways, even more managerial than usual, especially for the part dedicated to the transfer market and team management. But nothing really striking. As has been the case for a couple of editions now, before starting the full season in this competition, you can choose whether to play with the Default team (i.e. the one made up of the usual suspects, such as Cellini), or with the same team plus three champions famous organically chosen by other teams, or again, directly with your entire heart team. Once you have selected your team among those available in the various international tournaments, and entered this mode, you immediately realize how much ML has become the most complex virtual ~manifestation~ of the game. Dozens of menus strictly in strict Japanese, in fact, introduce the gamer into a labyrinth of menus and sub-menus with dozens of options and things to do to grow your team and make it the best in the world. Just as the WEFA, the football federation in charge of the competition, will sanction that every given period of the season will draw up a ranking of the strongest clubs, based on the economic-technical results achieved. Nothing that we haven't already seen in WE8 LE anyway. If anything, the only thing that has really been revised and corrected in the ML is the player aging system, finally more evolved, and which eliminates the young phenomena, new ~children of the Arab Phoenix on duty~, ~born~ from the ashes of the most successful champions who retired due to having reached the age limit. Another novelty is the improvement of the ~My best eleven~ mode: in this ML session it will be possible to memorize the best players you have worked with, in order to form a very personal Dream Team to load even during online challenges, against representatives of other fans. A television impact The graphics has become for some time now another of the strengths of the series. Mind you, we are not seeing any striking changes compared to what we saw in the Liveware Evolution, but as always, the goodies and touches of class are many and such as to satisfy the eye of the most demanding gamer. The unmistakable ~TV style~ of Fifa has now been completely borrowed from KTYO, to offer us users a total visual experience to say the least. The various moments of the match (before, during and after, warm-ups, celebrations, etc.) have been completely renewed and everything that ~takes place~ around a football match has been faithfully reconstructed in every single detail. The excellent graphics can obviously also be seen in the aesthetic realization of the", "date": "2005-08-10", "grade": null}
