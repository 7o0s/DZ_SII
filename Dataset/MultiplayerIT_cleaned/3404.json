{"name": "Grindstone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grindstone-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Grindstone, the new puzzle game developed by Capybara Games and available on Apple Arcade, projects us into an ideal world in which this particular genre has not been offered for years now strictly in a freemium version on mobile devices, plagued by microtransactions. In fact, there was a lot of curiosity to try the new project by the authors of Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP, Super Time Force and Below, also to verify these dynamics and refresh our memory on how the progression from one stage to another should be. from one puzzle to another, without an artificially increased degree of challenge always obliging us to consider buying a pack of coins or whatever in order to continue. Ready to go, we find ourselves already immersed in a particular atmosphere when the comic-style narrative sequence starts showing the wiry protagonist of the game leaving the house at night, while his wife and son are still sleeping, and venturing out into the cold of a snowy expanse to commute to work; which, for a Viking weighing 150 kg holding a huge sword, consists of entering the tunnels of a mountain in search of precious stones and building materials, to be collected rigorously by massacring little monsters of various kinds. Gameplay and structure The formula on which Grindstone's gameplay is based is terribly simple but at the same time endowed with a considerable strategic depth, which is revealed as the scenarios are completed and one progresses in a campaign consisting of 150 levels. Let's say that the starting point is that of the classic Puzzle Quest, but the character we control also moves around the board and can only carry out combined eliminations of enemies of the same color, claiming enough victims to ensure that the door of round opens to allow access to the next stage. Things start to get interesting when the combo includes ten or more kills: at that point a crystal appears on the screen which, once collected, allows our powerful Viking to continue the eliminations by switching to opponents of different colors, so as to build even more moves. longer and more spectacular, literally cleaning up the board and leaving only bloody offal on the ground. At first, an extra objective could be to collect a trunk, after conquering the key, in order to obtain some further objects at the end of the mission; but subsequently further threats and opportunities are added: cowardly kings wearing precious crowns (essential to be able to move from one setting to another after the inevitable boss fight), but also tougher enemies than usual, wooden crates to destroy, ghosts and whoever has the most, the more. Creating the combinations, drawing on the board the path that the character will have to follow in his fighting spirit, sword in hand, becomes more and more complicated because obstacles and traps continue to appear that limit our movements. Furthermore, monsters that stay alive for too long become enraged and become a problem: if our turn ends within shooting range, they will hit us making us lose one of the three hearts that make up our health bar. However, there are countermeasures (the shield, the arrow, the area shot, the special armor and even the teleportation potion) that allow you to deal with these situations and perhaps find the way to ring a new combo, and strikes the perfect balance with to which the developers have distributed this type of resource. In the presence of a particular treasure, you can go to a club, spend the crystals earned on the field to restore vital energy with a nice drink, check the status of the completed challenges and possibly collect the rewards, as well as visit the blacksmith and the inventor to build new items to add to the inventory. All this is constantly accompanied by very pleasant graphics, stylistically very close to Adult Swim productions, and by an effective sound accompaniment.", "date": "2019-10-28", "grade": "9.0"}
