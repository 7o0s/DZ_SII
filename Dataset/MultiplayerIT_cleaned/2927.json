{"name": "Iron Harvest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/iron-harvest-recensione.html", "text": "A few days after the last test, we are ready to churn out the review of Iron Harvest, a promising new production by KING Art. It is an exponent of the now decadent real-time strategy genre, set in a dystopian world, where the geography produced by the end of the First World War is profoundly different from what we know. Attention has shifted in particular to the area of central-eastern Europe, where the regions of Saxony, Polania (it is not a typo) and the Russian-Soviet one called precisely Rusviet were formed, in constant tension between them. The plot is derived from the universe imagined by Jakub Rozalski, the Polish creator of the 1920+ world and Scythe, who went from being a promising idea (which fetched almost two million dollars on Kickstarter) to one of the most talk about the moment, at least among enthusiasts. The same lucky footsteps have also been covered by Iron Harvest, financed for almost one and a half million even if not all the promised features are still available (such as, for example, the cooperative mode for the single player campaign). So why release it at full price and as a finished product, even though it's clear there's still a lot of work to be done? The programmers justify themselves by arguing that it is only the first season and that, in the future, updates will continue as happened for other titles. We will try to understand if it is worth becoming an ~early adopter~ in the following lines. Plot and setting We will not go into the story of the single player, although it currently represents the main dish of the Iron Harvest menu: it is enough to know that it is divided into three campaigns (one per faction) to be faced not necessarily in sequential order and that it is told both through in-game dialogues and with discrete quality computer graphics videos; to complete it at an average level it will take about fifteen hours. The missions are very structured and offer a good variety of situations (obviously not replicable in multiplayer games), such as escorting a train in the final stages of the adventure of Polani Anna Kos. Although it is possible to set the level of difficulty, it seemed to us that some were excessively unbalanced in favor of the CPU, capable of producing units more frequently than the player. However, the effort of the creatives of KING Art deserves praise, capable of enriching the experience with touches of class unpublished for the RTS genre, even if something more could have been done in terms of differentiating the armies, which share the same structures and upgrade trees and most land units. The future imagined by Rozalski sees mechanized infantry as the absolute protagonist, represented by vaguely anthropomorphic robots moved by diesel energy. However, this development in size has not been accompanied by a reduction in weight, with the consequence that firefights are characterized by the slowness of movement and the long reload times typical of vehicles from a century ago. Unripe multiplayer All this would suggest rhythmic and reasoned game rhythms, which actually happens in single player maps, but in practice multiplayer games are often reduced to being very fast and rewarding for the so-called ~rush~ tactics, that is, those in which the enemy base is attacked as soon as possible with the basic infantry, without waiting for the largest and most powerful units to be available. In these cases, of course, coordination with the mouse matters more than the actual war strategy. These are problems due to a balance that is not yet optimal and which are well masked in the single player where the scripted sequences come in handy, but which show limits both in clashes with other players and in those against artificial intelligence. The multiplayer offer is currently limited to a few maps and only involves the clash between two teams made up of one, two or three people; however, there is an avatar growth process that is stimulated by weekly challenges. The offer is then completed by special missions (currently there are only three), in which you have to resist the enemy waves by losing the least number of men or gathering as many resources before the reinforcements arrive. Gameplay At first glance, the game structure of Iron Harvest recalls that of Company Of Heroes, a milestone from which the developers have declaredly inspired themselves. There are several elements that unite the two strategic, including the selection of troops, which are treated as individualsunits and gain experience by killing and the presence of heroes, equipped with specific skills. What catches the eye most is the management of the attack zones: the maps are equipped with covers behind (or inside) which to repair one's men; all artificial defenses, such as houses and trenches, are destructible; cannons are completely helpless when hit from behind, and mechanized infantry are also more sensitive to hits from behind. Such complexity, of course, rewards positioning: a single phalanx of well-placed machine-gunners is able to eliminate opposing ranks without suffering major casualties. Considering the difficulty in recruiting new units and, as written above, the precious experience gained in the field from the existing ones, which gradually become more lethal, the focus of the action is shifted to the continuous movement of men which should avert the famous massive attack front with all the most powerful units of the army. This tactical setting is reinforced by the possibility of recovering weapons dropped on the battlefield that can transform engineers into riflemen or grenadiers. Unlike Company Of Heroes, the areas of influence are missing: from this point of view, Iron Harvest behaves in a much more traditional way and requires the control of strategic points for the collection of steel and oil, the two resources necessary to build buildings and produce unit. What did not completely convince us concerns the management of the base. In fact, the main structures are too few (only two, excluding the headquarters) and none of these is intended for upgrading weapons or armor. An absence that weighs above all considering what is written above (ie that the units can transform according to the objects collected on the field) and which pushes to bring the attack to the opposing base as soon as possible, putting the control and defense of mines in the background and strategic points; fortunately this temptation is thwarted in the single player where the CPU takes advantage of a decidedly effective preventive stalking. Then there are some gaps that should be fixed, such as the impossibility of orienting the positioning of the defensive bunkers and some behaviors of the artificial intelligence which tends to give priority to close engagements and sometimes seems not to be reactive, especially in the defense phases inside of the buildings. Technique Analyzing the technical aspect there is not much to add compared to what we have already written in our test. The design of the mechs, the real protagonists of the title, is truly inspired and their colossal dimensions, well proportioned with the environment, manage to convey a sense of power and unstoppability, thanks also to the convincing intentionally ~jerky~ animations. The typical locations of the central European regions are also beautiful, with a fair variety of scenarios ranging from snowy plains to mountain roads. Technically Iron Harvest struggles to compare with other exponents of the genre, however dated. The comparison inevitably runs to Company Of Heroes 2: although about ten years have passed between the two titles, the comparison highlights a cleaner and more cinematic cut of Relic's strategy. In the KING Art game, the poorly defined textures and very spartan environmental effects that give an unpleasant cheap effect weigh above all. However, it should be noted that graphic updates have been made compared to the first versions and it is not excluded that more can be added in the future. The soundtrack was entrusted to Adam Skorupa, the same composer of the series of The Witcher and Painkiller, and the result is excellent. The English dubbing convinced us a little less, more for the choice of voices, excessively stereotyped, than for the actual acting. If you wish, you can also choose the voices in the original language; there are subtitles in Italian.", "date": "2020-09-01", "grade": "7.0"}
