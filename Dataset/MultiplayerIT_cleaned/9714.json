What is certain is that the fighting games of this genre have always focused on the gargantuan number of units on the screen to offer the player that sense of omnipotence given by seeing your avatar mow down hundreds of little more than helpless polygonal enemies. But it is equally true that this type of gameplay shows the side of heavy repetitiveness and a chronic lack of renewal; at this point one wonders how and if Konami have remedied these gaps for this N3-2. Lone wolf The premise to introduce us to the action in Ninety-Nine Night 2 does not have a central role in the economy of the game, on the contrary, once the DVD is inserted into the console we are immediately called to hack without wasting time in useless explanations. The theater of adventure is a canonical fantasy kingdom seriously threatened by the inexorable advance of the Lord of the Night's army, complete with elves and goblins fighting each other, in short, the classic light-darkness dichotomy, just enough to offer the player a good pretext to take to the battlefield. As the missions go by, the story acquires slightly more defined connotations, also being told from different points of view while remaining a secondary aspect of the entire package. To give greater body to the experience there are new characters who become progressively available for a total of five heroes, each with specific characteristics and its own personalized list of missions. Although some statistics such as life and attack strength can be managed and increased by the player with the expenditure of credits earned in battle, each warrior always has his own special and peculiar move available to be exploited during missions to interact with the game environment in order to solve elementary puzzles and reach secret areas of the map, even if we have noticed how the interaction with the seabed is limited only to these sporadic predefined occasions, leaving no freedom of approach to the player. There is rarely a need to worry about pondering a more effective or personal path to the goal since almost all the time it is necessary to advance directly towards the closest highlighted objective. Such a forcibly linear approach also leads to underexploited play areas, many of which can boast a pleasant and articulated architecture (especially those set inside castles and fortresses) and also respectable dimensions, but they are always limited by a very reduced interactivity and by an artistic realization that is certainly not exciting with the abuse of textures that are repeated and which leaves the strong impression of how a deep finishing and embellishment work that could make each glimpse unique and recognizable has been lacking. Xbox 360 goals By completing N3-2 on a normal level with all the characters we will be rewarded with about half of the loot of the 1000 points up for grabs, divided into 50 objectives; many of the contextual achievements are pretty easy to unlock including those that require high ranking for missions. Other points are up for grabs for those who play on the net and for the virtuosos who will dedicate themselves to maximizing weapons and skills, while six are the secret objectives. Last Man Standing Needless to say, the heart of N3-2 undoubtedly lies in the hard and pure action: just as it happened in its predecessor we are called to face entire armies alone or in the company of useless allies good only for doing a little choreography ( forget about any real help in battle from them). Thinking back to the promises bandied about in Los Angeles a few months ago, it is immediately clear that the enemies to face are even more numerous this time and, although we have not started counting them one by one, the killing counter often reaches thousands of units with a certain ease, thanks also to a low toughness of the opponents who do not hesitate to charge us frontally in waves, showing a poor survival instinct. Among the cannon fodder there are sometimes even more advanced exponents on average, characterized by effective special attacks that we can make our own once the original user has been defeated. These particular skills prove to be very useful right from the start to reduce the number of opponents or to deal with some types of hostilesi like flying units particularly annoying when hovering safely at high altitudes. From the customization menu of each character it is possible to equip and level up these particular skills divided between active and passive so as to forge a warrior who is closest to our needs and the mission we are led to face. Instead, the combat system shows its side which relies on the classic two keys used for the fast attack and the slow but stronger one, a certainly tested but also abused solution that in Ninety-Nine Night 2 quickly plunges the action into the vortex of repetitiveness since a particular skill in the chaining of combos or attack patterns is not required, making a wild button mashing more effective that has very little to do with tactics. An accurate strategy is instead required in dealing with the bosses, each of which has certain weaknesses often linked to the conformation of the arena in which we are called to face them; nothing to make the player lose sleep but given the general situation, every slightest variation to the usual carnage routine is certainly welcome. In the most desperate situations you can resort to a special attack that can be exploited once the appropriate bar is filled with the sound of killed enemies. This attack that makes us invulnerable for a few seconds, has two forms of execution, one with an area and one that further enhances the weapons we have in hand, especially useful against those rare particularly tough enemies. The Clone War We have said that many, indeed many, are the characters on the screen, but with the exception of our avatar it really seems to be faced with a striking case of multiple births. The types of adversary are in themselves limited to infantry, cavalry, archers and flying units, within which there is no characterization or distinction, with the exception of some chromatic choices that indicate the superior rank of specific platoons. It is certainly understandable how throwing so many units into the field goes to the detriment of the characterization but certainly the expedients to make the glance diversified would have been at least necessary to dilute the chaotic nature of the scene. But that of repetitiveness is now a congenital defect of the entire genre that afflicts both the stale mechanics and the artistic sector, this time mortified by a work done crudely. Even the music has orchestral loops that are too short and devoid of bite that quickly get boring by failing to convey epicness to the clashes. These gaps become heavier as the adventure progresses, which offers a good number of missions, often quite long to complete, thus bringing the longevity of the title to more than good levels. But even in this case, poor management of the checkpoints forces you to redo large portions of the level with hundreds of enemies to face in the event of death, which translates into tens of minutes of play thrown away.", "date": "2010-10-21", "grade": "5.0"}
