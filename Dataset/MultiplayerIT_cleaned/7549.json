Well yes, the line of games filled with zombies that keep coming out in recent years seems really inexhaustible and never before have the slow and decadent undead been so inflated as to appear in every media... we just need a few crazy make us a themed web-series. What How to Survive proposes to get noticed in this crowded sea is to combine peculiarities made famous by other productions in the hope of attracting the interest of players, including those who have already massacred thousands of walking corpses in a thousand other videogame sauces. A refined crafting system, combined with an isometric view and gameplay typical of action-rpg, makes the EKO Studios product an interesting variant on the survival genre. The success of this formula therefore depends on how all these elements blend together within the economy of the game available on Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Steam and later also expected on the WiiU eShop. Crafting and isometric view make How to Survive a curious variant of the survival genre Welcome to the island Yet another shipwreck, this time on an archipelago off the coast of Colombia, acts as an incipit to the events of How to Survive and it is immediately clear that the narrative component just sketched out serves as a mere pretext to drop the player into the action by massacring hundreds of zombies and various monsters. Starting the story mode there is the possibility to choose one of the three selectable characters Kenji, Abbey and Jack, characterized by different starting statistics without being differentiated by real classes. As in the most classic role-playing games, by accumulating experience you level up but, while the parameters of our avatar grow automatically, the player is given the opportunity to choose which skill to unlock among those present in a classic tree diagram. Each aspiring survivor presents variations in the arrangement of the obtainable skills, consequently in the long run and progressing in the game all the characters inevitably look alike with the exception of some unique and peculiar skills for each of the three. Despite this tendency to standardize the evolution of the protagonists' statistics, the game still encourages tackling the campaign with all three of the unfortunate castaways since each of them has its own personal percentage of completion of the campaign that can also be tackled in the company of a second player thanks to the cooperative both online and local. Completing the campaign with a single character at a normal level takes about ten hours, this is accompanied by the challenge mode where we are simply called to flee from time to time from a different island starting with our character totally devoid of equipment . Night falls Surviving in the islands of How to Survive immediately proves to be more complex than expected: it is necessary to take into consideration all the primary vital needs that every human being must satisfy to keep fit, so as to be able to fight to the fullest of their abilities . In addition to the inevitable health indicator, in fact, it is also necessary to keep hunger, thirst and sleep under control, as the good Kovac immediately explains to us, an eccentric and expert survivor who represents the ~comedic vein~ of the adventure. Thanks to his valuable advice during the initial tutorial and above all to the pages of his survival guide scattered around the various locations, we soon learn to deal with the collection of food, drinking water and to organize our movements taking into account the layout of the shelters sure where to rest. The deterioration of vital parameters can compromise mobility, aim and the effectiveness of the blows inflicted, thus making us extremely vulnerable to frequent danger situations. In particular, during the night the fight to stay alive becomes more bitter, with creatures that appear only after sunset and in this regard the use of the flashlight becomes essential to scare away and keep nocturnal predators at a safe distance. The game routine is therefore divided between a daily phase, where it is important to sharpen the eye to find every object or resource that can be useful to us and store everything in our never too large inventory, and the numerous dangers that we will inevitably face with the arrival of the 'darkness. Obviously the mere collection of resources is not enough and in order to have a complete equipment just in case the crafting system comes into play which allows us to combinear objects and food in a creative way. By combining the recovered objects following pre-set schemes it is possible to build ever more complex weapons, from a simple bow to rudimentary firearms, even if nothing can give satisfaction like making a makeshift chainsaw with your own hands to pieces the undead that infest the archipelago. In addition to assembling offensive items, crafting is essential for cooking edible foods and regenerating drinks, but also for creating healing items using some medicinal herbs. Xbox 360 goals Almost half of the 400 points offered by How to Survive are obtainable by reaching all the islands, making the first instant kills and unlocking the first skills from the skill tree. 45g is the prize for those who complete the story mode in normal mode while 80g will go to those who succeed in ~Iron Man~ mode, which is the second and highest level of difficulty available. The remaining points go to side missions and challenges. A bad look The versatility and the numerous possibilities offered by the combination of objects undoubtedly represent the most successful aspect of the game, together with the choice of setting an almost isometric view that is so reminiscent of role-playing games such as Diablo or Torchlight. Just along the lines of the most famous action-RPGs, How to Survive offers a similar gameplay, albeit with a role-playing component as we have seen reduced to the bone. The massacre of hundreds of zombies or other creatures takes up a large part of the game time, with only a few contextual actions related to the missions entrusted to us, but we have already seen how the development of the narrative dimension does not seem to have been a priority for the developers. The gameplay therefore does not shine for variety but the repetitiveness is absolutely not greater than that found in the masterpieces of the genre and can therefore be considered an intrinsic limit of the game structure itself rather than a real defect, perhaps made more evident by a lack of boundary elements that could have contributed to making the action less monothematic. What would have needed much greater attention is the technical sector which shows its side to a truly modest general visual performance while never boasting peaks of action and screen dynamism that can justify polygonal models and animations with a decidedly unrefined realization . The presence of a rather marked aliasing and some inexplicable drops in frame rate even with few characters on the screen are rather perplexing. Even a greater variety in the differentiation of enemies and environments would have helped to make everything less monotonous.", "date": "2013-10-23", "grade": "7.8"}
