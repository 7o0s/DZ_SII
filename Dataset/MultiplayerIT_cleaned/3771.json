{"name": "FRAG Pro Shooter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/frag-pro-shooter-recensione.html", "text": "FRAG Pro Shooter is a multiplayer-based shooter that tries to put together the most interesting and best-tested features of the mobile competitive landscape. We start from the formula: although two teams each made up of five characters descend on the field, there are only two users who manage them, controlling one hero at a time and leaving the others to artificial intelligence, with the possibility, however, of directing their actions in a offensive (~attack this tower~) or defensive (~defend this tower~). When the fighter we fly is eliminated, we will be able to choose which other team member to respawn as, taking advantage of infinite lives. The kills score and experience in terms of progression, but do not count in the context of the match, which ends when one of the two participants manages to score 1000 points by hitting the three enemy bases starting with the two laterals. From this point of view, the Oh BiBi title naturally refers to Clash Royale, but this is not the only aspect inspired by the Supercell blockbuster: cards and coins are unlocked by opening the chests that are earned with each victory and which can be stored in four slots, with timed or rapid opening if you want to spend some hard currency. The cards allow both to obtain new characters, drawing on a roster that has over forty, and to enhance those already in our possession, divided into categories according to the specialization. Gameplay and technical realization The long period in soft launch has allowed FRAG Pro Shooter to build a very large and enthusiastic user base, which makes the matchmaking of the game particularly fast: you enter a match within a few seconds, a minute at the most, and the system appears well balanced in pairing users with a similar degree of experience. After completing a quick initial tutorial, you can take the field taking advantage of a very well implemented touch control system, with two repositionable virtual analog sticks on the left and right side of the screen, as well as an automatic fire system that allows you to concentrate on movements and shoot when we have a target in the aiming reticle. Further icons allow you to reload the weapon (the reload is still automatic when the ammunition runs out), send a message to the opponent, change the view from third to first person and activate the special ability. The latter characterizes each character in an important way, but it is not the only distinctive trait: from one hero to another they also change the class they belong to and therefore the weapon used, which can go from simple pistols to machine guns, passing through rifles of various kinds and rocket launchers. Each setup has strengths and weaknesses that manage to balance the gameplay very well, and thanks to the balance of the matchmaking situations are avoided in which you find yourself facing very strong opponents, who have been able to boost their deck a lot both with the normal progression than putting his hand in his wallet to forge ahead. There are constant references to monetization, but even if you want to stay free, the structure is rich. As in the aforementioned Clash Royale, depending on the level of experience it is possible to access new scenarios, and there are ten of them available: enough to keep the involvement high for quite some time. The technical realization refers to the cartoon style of the classic Team Fortress 2, using cel shading and improbable proportions to represent protagonists who, however, do not have a stratospheric design and indeed often fall into the generic. The glance, however, is excellent and on the iPhone X the graphics move at a stable 60 frames per second keeping the detail at maximum, even if the battery charge drops very quickly.", "date": "2019-03-12", "grade": "8.0"}
