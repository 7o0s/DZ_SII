When Bohemia Interactive finally made it a standalone product, the title quickly placed three million copies as it continued to evolve in structure and mechanics. In order to make the most of the popularity of DAYZ, the developers have seen fit to create a small but interesting free browser game, Mini DAYZ, which used the same survival elements while focusing on a basic technical implementation, in pixel art style. Well, Mini DAYZ has also made its debut on iOS and Android devices, once again sparking enthusiasm with respect to an experience that seems to have remained faithful to the original spirit: the download is free and there are no in-app purchases. Beyond that, how does the game look like? Having selected the control system we prefer between direct commands with virtual stick or a solution close to RTS, ~touch and go~, this little survival takes us by the hand through some of its typical situations, in a short but valid tutorial. After that, as they say, it's up to us to try to survive... Day to day Structurally Mini DAYZ is very simple: the game randomly generates a map that can be consulted at any time and which alternates areas with dense vegetation and now abandoned urban settlements, often and willingly full of wandering zombies who will run towards us as soon as they notice ours presence. The goal is of course to survive as long as possible, so not only will we have to make sure to avoid or intelligently manage the clash with the undead, capable of inflicting significant damage on us as soon as we give them the opportunity, but we will also have the obligation to find food, water, clothes, weapons and materials useful to move forward. The starting rucksack will not allow us to carry many things, therefore it will be appropriate to look for a more capacious one, but everything will happen according to luck: we could find houses full of food and equipment, but also completely empty and desolate areas, perhaps with a quite a few zombies waiting for us. Object management in Mini DAYZ is quite simple and intuitive, for example it is possible to tear off the shirt and make bandages out of it if you have been attacked and lose blood. However, it is precisely the fights that make us turn up our noses: the pixel art graphics, with tiny characters, prevent us from understanding what kind of enemy we are dealing with, which can have disastrous consequences on our chances of surviving. Both the use of bludgeoning and firearms is also chaotic, an alternation of automatic and manual mechanisms that often puts us in difficulty, causing us to suffer damage that we thought we could avoid. Beyond these edges, which perhaps will be smoothed out with the next updates, however, there is no doubt that Mini DAYZ offers a pleasant and engaging experience, all at no cost.", "date": "2017-07-13", "grade": "7.0"}
