Passion and talent together gave us, last year, an engaging experience of great impact, characterized by a valuable technical sector and an above-average level of challenge. The protagonist of the game is Major James Fletcher, an agent equipped with cybernetic grafts who works for the CLN, an organization that is responsible for defending the last outpost of resistance of the human race against the machines, the city of Bezoar. Some strange crimes perpetrated by robots occur on the streets and Fletcher is called to investigate, thus setting himself on the trail of Dr. Percival Novak, the alleged mastermind. Found Novak, however, the situation changes radically and the protagonist discovers that things are not as the CLN wanted him to believe. At that point begins a real search for the truth, which will lead Fletcher to face some of the most powerful robots ever built to prevent the complete destruction of Bezoar. If Hard Reset had a defect, it was undoubtedly the duration of the single player campaign, which can be completed in about four hours net of the degree of difficulty. Well, the free DLC Exile, included in the Extended Edition (which is sold on Steam for only 13.49 euros!) Goes precisely to solve this lack, adding five levels to the story and thus giving it a proper ending. Not only that: the package includes four new enemies, a new powerful boss, extra achievements, an improved graphics engine and two new maps for Survival mode. The latter acts as a nice addition to the single player campaign, throwing us into jeopardy against endless hordes of enemies within relatively small locations, with the aim of surviving as long as possible. City lights We had left Major Fletcher driving a huge robotic spider while defending himself from the onslaught of his former CLN colleagues, at the end of the last Hard Reset boss fight. In Exile the story continues from there and takes us out of the city of Bezoar, exploring its borders in search of a place that in theory shouldn't exist, a free city called ~Haven~. Connected to Dr. Novak's conscience, we will therefore have to explore generally wider scenarios than in the past, open spaces in which to confront ourselves with cunning and resistant opponents, able to target us from a distance, perhaps from an elevated position, but also to hit us hard up close. At our disposal we will have the two ~transformable~ rifles supplied by the agency, one functioning with standard ammunition and one with energy, both of which can be upgraded to several levels by adding extra modules: on the one hand, a shotgun, grenade launcher, missile launcher and mines , on the other lasers that pass through the walls, electric shocks, mortars capable of emitting EMP pulses and energy homing shots. From the point of view of the arsenal, the Flying Wild Hog shooter has nothing to envy to more famous productions, and the apparent simplification of the ~universal~ ammunition only increases our offensive possibilities, passing from one equipment to another on the fly to exploit its peculiarities. What's the best way to defend yourself against the charge of dangerous ~gorilla~ robots, for example? Lock them down with the shotgun's electric bolts, then target them with the missile launcher. Or fire an electromagnetic grenade that pulls them all together and strike in that direction with everything we have. Hard Reset's gunplay is excellent in terms of feeling, sensation of impact, involvement and even ~satisfaction~ when you manage to survive an assault in grand style, such as those that we will have to face several times in Exile. I've seen things... There is perhaps a little less ~cyberpunk~ in this DLC than in the base game, which is natural given that the setting changes almost completely. However, the improvement is substantial: the enhanced engine guarantees phenomenal performance and on the test configuration we easily obtained sixty frames per second with all the effects at their maximum and at the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. In addition to the mere technique, however, the enormous care taken by the developers in the design of the new locations is perceived, some of which are truly evocative and in any case characterized by an excellent level of detail. The new enemies are also doing well, such as the very bad flying units (better to take cover when they appear!), the vandroid soarers equipped with melee blades, heavy mechs armed with missiles and the crazy final boss, to be fought in the middle of a real metal orgy. In this second meeting with the game we better appreciated the excellent support for the Xbox 360 controller, with whose configuration you get familiar with within a few games, while acknowledging as usual the precision and speed of mouse pointing, especially with the small robots. The musical accompaniment, despite being very atmospheric, still didn't completely convince us, while we found the effects of the weapons and explosions really excellent and full-bodied.", "date": "2012-08-08", "grade": "8.7"}
