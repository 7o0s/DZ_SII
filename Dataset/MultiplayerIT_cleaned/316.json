{"name": "PainKiller: Hell Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/painkiller-hell-wars.html", "text": "In Painkiller we will not simply have to travel in the circles of hell, on the contrary the various chapters offer completely different settings, starting from the cathedrals in full Gothic style with skeletons, zombies, witches and the undead, to arrive at military camps dating back to the Second World War with related undead Nazi soldiers to have to fight. If the change of setting is a positive factor, the only point in common between the different stages is the most total linearity of the level-design. Basically you enter from point A, kill anything that moves, arriving at point B, and then start again. Painkiller is basically a sort of doom-clone released in 2006. The enemies have very limited artificial intelligence, the attacks are almost always frontal, and they become potentially dangerous only when their number is high, which happens often anyway . For those who haven't figured it out yet, one of the hallmarks of Painkiller is the high rate of violence. In full horror style we will have limbs that detach for close shots and liters of blood during each fight. The various bonuses are inevitable, which we will find in the form of Black Tarot cards, hidden in the most remote corners of the stages, and which will allow Daniel to gain some special abilities, such as being able to inflict multiplied damage, invulnerability, speed increase and even a sort of bullet time which will slow down the various enemies. The best part of PK's single player are undoubtedly the fights with the huge bosses who, unlike their subordinates, force you to use your head to develop various strategies, rather than keeping the fire button pressed on the pad. The control method is of the standard type, common to the various first person shooters released on the Microsoft console, except for one detail, the way to change weapons. Forget, unfortunately, the classic previous and next weapon and get ready to assign two main weapons on the D-Pad, and then having to press the black button and assign the relative space on the digital cross again to other weapons. Speaking of the arsenal available to Daniel, we find some interesting ideas, relating to the design of the weapons themselves and the two types of shots that can be performed. The developers have included some very different combinations of weapons, an example above all the machine gun with rotating barrels combined with a flamethrower. The possibility of using the two types of shots leads to very useful combos particularly in multiplayer modes. One of the most appreciable sides of PainKiller is undoubtedly the creation of the multiplayer section, which supports up to 8 players in System Link and on Xbox Live. The game modes available vary from the standard ones such as individual or team deathmatches, to then duels, perfect for one against one, up to ad hoc created modes, such as voosh in which the weapons in our possession change in a random. The usable arenas are numerous and well calibrated for the number of players, and to make everything more lively, some dedicated special bonuses have been included, different from those in the single player. Speaking of the technical aspects of PK, it can be noted that the engine used is an optimized version of the one used in the PC version. The result globally falls within the average of the fps available Xbox, remaining distant from the leaders in the category such as Doom, Chronicles of Riddick, Black, Halo or Half Life. The levels offer very large areas, and the models on the screen are always numerous, unfortunately slowdowns are often noticed in the single player. The animations and the interaction with the backdrops are well cared for, in particular the latter derives from the implementation of physics through the Havok 2.0 middleware, and is noted both in the realization of the rag-doll on the models, and for the destructible components all inside the stages. Although this aspect remains limited to a greater scenographic involvement, rather than significantly influencing the game mechanics, as happens for example in Half Life 2, the results obtained are more than appreciable. The sound department, on the other hand, turns out to be much more refined, both in the decidedly apt soundtrack, full of heavy metal-style tracks that appear in the key sequences of the levels, and in the sound and environmental effects Comment Painkiller is essentially a re-interpretation of the first Id Software titles, that is, no particular implication in the gameplay during the evolution of the story, extremely linear levels, minimal enemy AI, and everything evolves in the clashes against the various bosses. For those looking for an old-fashioned, fast-paced FPS with a good multiplayer component, PainKiller is a possible choice.ta, those who want something more, will probably have to go to other solutions. Pros Frantic and immediate action Multiplayer well implemented Sound department Cons Too linear Some slowdown too much Enemy AI to forget Painkiller: Hell Wars, after being released in the United States in late summer, has finally arrived on Xbox across Europe, and is a port of the PC version released in 2004, including the additional levels. Our virtual alter ego, Daniel Gamer, is transported to a sort of parallel dimension after being the victim of a car accident. Unfortunately, even after dying we will not find eternal peace, unless we defeat the various generals of Lucifer's armies, so that we can gain access to heaven and find our loved ones. After the various introduction sequences made in computer graphics, we will find ourselves in the first of over 20 levels that make up the backbone of the single player mode. The stages are divided into 5 chapters, each of which ends with a battle against the inevitable boss at the end of the area.", "date": "2006-10-25", "grade": null}
