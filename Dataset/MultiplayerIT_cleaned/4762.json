You can find our updated judgment at this address. We had frankly lost hope: presented in the now distant December 2011, Fortnite seemed destined to be cancelled; and instead, with a twist, last month Epic Games announced its launch, with a version initially accessible only with the purchase of a 39.99 euro Founder's Package. In fact, the game will take on the characteristics of a real free-to-play only over the next year, and the idea of the developers is that by then the experience will be enriched by various elements, including a competitive multiplayer mode. For the moment, however, we remain faithful to the line originally conceived for the project: a survival with a cartoonish graphic style, characterized by construction phases alternating with sequences in which a specific location must be protected from the attack of hordes of undead. The perfect storm How did the post-apocalyptic scenario of Fortnite become such? All the fault of a mysterious perturbation, simply called ~the storm~, which suddenly hit all parts of the world, causing the disappearance of 98% of the population. The survivors of the event had to organize themselves to resist further attacks, because in this case the problem is not only thunder and lightning: when the sky turns purple, mysterious appendages appear on the earth that open the gates of hell and project on the streets zombies of various kinds: from simple abjects to ~baseball players~, from unstoppable tanks to ~beekeepers~, passing through witches who can bomb our positions from a distance and evil leaping minions. Many types of living dead, therefore, that we will find ourselves facing during the long campaign of the Epic Games title, currently made up of four scenarios (Pietralegno, Tavolaccia, Vallarguta and Montespago) with increasing degrees of difficulty, accessible as we complete the missions. From a narrative point of view, Fortnite puts us in the shoes of a survivor who, having accidentally stumbled upon a stronghold controlled by some nice robots, is encouraged to coordinate the action of the human warriors who are fighting to stem the storm and its evil effects. The dialogues, spoken in English and subtitled in Italian, are very funny and manage to create that cartoonish atmosphere that the graphics suggest from the first impact, pleasant and colourful, with a nice design for the survivors and the zombies. Sometimes there are frame rate drops on PlayStation 4 Pro too, but we imagine this is an aspect that the developers will be able to fix without major problems in the coming weeks. Instead, what really matters for the quality of the experience is the gameplay, and sorry to say there but it's not all rosy. Someone consoles you In Fortnite we are therefore the ~commanders~, but in the end it is a simple expedient. In fact, having selected one of the available characters, we will control it directly, like in a third person shooter a la Gears of War, albeit with a simplified and accessible movement system, which does not provide for the possibility of lurking and regulates quick shots through an indicator of fatigue. A brief tutorial introduces us to the mechanics of the gameplay: some are caught on the fly, with great ease, but others remain a little too obscure and you then have to work hard to understand them, which makes the first few hours of the game a bit problematic. The basic idea, replicated in practically every type of mission (apart from those in which one goes in search of survivors), is to explore some generously sized maps, collect resources by picking anything, from cars to trees, from gates to houses, find the current point of interest and eventually collect the units of energy necessary to start a device. Before starting the countdown that will lead to the arrival of the zombies, however, we will have to switch to ~construction~ mode and set up a more or less resistant structure around the area that we will have to defend from the onslaught of enemies, choosing between different materials (wood, stone, iron) and decorating floors, walls or ceilings with more and more sophisticated traps, capable of eliminating the enemies stationed there. When we're ready, we'll be able to flip the switch and face progressively more numerous hordes, using up bullets and experimenting with a simple but solid combat system, which can give some satisfaction as long as you don't engage in melee combat: the detection ofthe collisions in that case is rough and the fun is less. Organizing yourself together with the other members of the group becomes important as you move on to the advanced stages, also because having a companion who covers us possibly allows you to put uprooted walls and defenses back together without suffering damage. Playstation 4 trophies There are forty-six Trophies that can be unlocked with Fortnite: many are obtained by performing certain actions for the first time, for example building a weapon or a structure, while others are linked to the completion of groups of missions for each specific scenario. In any case, you have to devote quite a few hours to the game if you want to get everything. Night you are mine Fortnite is a cooperative multiplayer game for up to four participants (without the need to be subscribed to PlayStation Plus, however), but nothing prevents you from tackling the missions alone. The first few hours are actually trivial from the point of view of the challenge, and the biggest obstacle is represented by the understanding of some specific concepts. How to create the weapons and their ammo? What is better to pick? How to manage ~active~ defense posts? The latter practice is incomprehensibly cumbersome: you have to recall a survivor, place him on a ~table~, create a weapon and leave it near him, then possibly act as his nurse if the zombies injure him or he runs out of ammunition. It is therefore better to fall back on simpler but equally effective solutions, giving up certain facets. There is a whole outline, which is typical of free-to-play, ranging from unlockable characters (each with unique abilities also linked to the class to which they belong) to specialists who can deal with certain ~departments~ and enhance the our action in the field, from the huge trees of unlockable skills to the research and development sector, passing through a rich list of achievements and the inevitable rite of opening the piatas, from which to draw virtual dollars, materials and extra survivors. From this point of view, the purchase of a Founder's Pack is justified only by the possibility of accessing the game in advance, because in truth the contents of the pack are not essential to play fruitfully. The biggest problem of the Epic Games title, however, lies in the strong repetitiveness of the missions, which move along a path well known to those who know free-to-play productions, made artificially full-bodied to give the feeling of a richness that is instead missing, all in order to focus on monetization. Legitimate solutions, but which perhaps will be more understandable when the game is available free of charge for everyone and it will be possible to decide whether and how much to spend to speed up one's progression.", "date": "2017-07-25", "grade": "8.0"}
