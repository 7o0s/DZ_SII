As per tradition, the product in fact proposes itself - thanks to the exclusive licenses - as the best PC video game as regards the realism linked to the top Italian league, proposing a detailed realization of the playing fields, the arenas that host the matches, fans and everything that revolves around the world of Italian basketball. Team that wins you don't change at best you improve The ancient sporting adage also seems to have become the ~philosophy~ of the ~Fronte del Basket~ series which from the first to the third edition re-proposed the same game mechanics and the same management schemes gradually graphically adapted to the evolution of hardware and improved based on feedback from the community of enthusiasts who follow the product. In particular, this new release, while maintaining the basic elements that now characterize the title, presents a marked improvement in the maneuvers that can be performed, in particular those related to actions that require support for the basket. Also noteworthy is the introduction (missing in previous editions) of the Pivot movement, a maneuver that now allows you to maintain control of the player who passes the ball and who, when the pass button is pressed at the right time, receives the ball back after having lost the opposing defense. The new edition of the game also offers an improvement and expansion of the managerial direction of one's own basketball team and will see the player involved in the management of purchase campaigns, formations, schemes as well as having the possibility of creating ~ex novo~ tournaments and championships being able to include also foreign teams including all those belonging to the Spanish league. As for the game modes, in addition to the classic tournaments, friendly matches and championships, the possibility of free throw competitions, three-point shooting competitions and even 1 vs 1 competitions is now offered. A note on the graphics sector which, although resulting optimized compared to the past, it still has good room for improvement in particular as regards the creation of the public that crowds the arenas and the textures associated with the players which appear at times sparse and poor. A note of applause instead for the sound sector which, in addition to the classic effects related to basket shots, reproduces the chants of the fans in a nice way and offers a commentary (created by Paola Ellisse) which stands above the average for sports games. Who controls the rebound controls the game Fronte del Basket 2007/2008 is proposed more as a simulation than a real arcade experience and therefore requires a good command of the game controls in order to be able to beat the computer-controlled opposing teams or friends who will compete to the last basket. Given the complexity of some maneuvers, we recommend the use of a gamepad rather than the classic keyboard as well as a good dose of friendly matches and training sessions aimed at becoming familiar with the game dynamics and the key combinations required to perform the various actions . Sports & fashion As per tradition for every self-respecting sports game, also in Fronte del Basket it is possible to characterize the appearance of the various players as desired by acting on details such as the physical structure, hair, eyes and somatic features as well as on the skill parameters (speed, assists, blocks...) and also on some details such as bands, tattoos and shoes. Comment Fronte del Basket 2007/2008 confirms itself as a good title as far as the sports games market is concerned, especially considering its budget nature. Numerous improvements have been implemented to perfect the gaming experience compared to the previous version but there are still many feasible ones to make the game up to the direct competitor made by EA. Definitely recommended to fans of Italian basketball and to those looking for a simulation on which to spend even a few hours in order to acquire the right skill in managing the control system.
