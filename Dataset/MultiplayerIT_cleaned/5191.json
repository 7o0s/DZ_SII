It is here that the right humus is probably created for the birth of new hybridizations, a sort of special experimental greenhouse for the birth and improvement of new videogame proposals. On the one hand there is the possibility of producing titles with a limited budget but able to reach a wide audience, on the other the limitations (or new possibilities) imposed by the tactile control system, on the other finally the need to propose something that is as direct and concrete as possible, a game to be enjoyed even in quick sessions and which has meaning even in short games of a few minutes. In a word, the mobile market represents the perfect theater for the return of the classic arcade and the experiments so far have led to very interesting results. Among the new canonizations, however, the pinball machine still tends to be in hiding, and it is something that is not easy to explain considering its characteristics perfectly in line with mobile platforms, including basic controls, speed of action and few pretensions in terms of graphics. For this reason, PinOut is particularly interesting, proposing a very particular vision of this historic arcade game reinterpreted on the basis of some characterizing elements of video games in this particular market segment: what would happen if the theory of the endless, i.e. the game endless, to the typical pinball structure? What if all of this were offered as free-to-play with the ability to unlock the entire game in one go? The result is PinOut, in fact, and it's a game capable of establishing itself in the crowded mobile market thanks to a very specific identity, the strange idea of the infinite table and a truly very interesting technical realization. The pinball machine moves into the mobile sphere and meets the ~endless~ formula: here is PinOut Steel balls Telling how a pinball machine works seems a bit absurd, but in fact the core of PinOut is just that: it is a question of constantly relaunching a metal ball on the elements of the scenario, hitting it with the sticks at the right time and with the right inclination in so as to make it go where we prefer and obviously trying not to drop it out of reach right in the center of the two levers, which will force us to go back to the initial level. Yes, because PinOut has a particular progressive structure which is its main characterizing element, which takes the classic pinball machine and transforms it into a sort of adventure where skill, speed and in a certain way also a sense of exploration become fundamental ingredients. The game mechanic requires you to hit the ball with precision in order to launch it up the ramps and passages that allow you to send it higher and higher, with the possibility of continuing without interruption, or going back to the starting level by dropping the ball between the two sticks. The only limitation in all of this is the timer, which inexorably presents a countdown at the end of which the game must end and based on where you have arrived, the score is sent to the online leaderboards. PinOut is therefore based on the spasmodic search for bonuses, special areas and alternative mini-games which, while the sphere travels around the tables, donate precious extra seconds to allow us to get further and further away. When the timer resets, it is possible to start a new game from the last checkpoint reached by practically purchasing the only in-app product available, which for 1.99 euros unlocks the full game with the possibility of taking advantage of the intermediate save points, which obviously recommended, also because going from one level to another there are pleasant changes in graphic style and atmospheres that give complete meaning to the progression in the game. Just the representation of the tables and the musical accompaniment are particularly pleasant elements in the creation of PinOut, which shows the side only in the behavior of the ball and in the design of the tables, with the first a little too ~guided~ and unnatural and the second somewhat simplistic and focused solely on using ramps.", "date": "2016-11-03", "grade": "7.5"}
