The definitive code turned out to be, in fact, an unlocked version of the beta in which it is possible to choose each character and open previously inaccessible menus. In short, on the content front, the new Dissidia has confirmed our fears about the predominantly arcade turn that the series has taken, originally born on PSP as a hybrid between a fighting game and an RPG and then temporarily disappeared from the radar to peep out in arcades with a three-on-three brawler set in the multiverse of the popular Square Enix franchise. This transformation has aroused several fears especially in the fans of this spin-off, who at the time spent hours growing their favorites between stats and accessories. Now the famous Japanese software, entrusting the brand to Team Ninja, has decided to leave the past behind to timidly sneak into the competitive scene. Will he succeed? Final Fantasy... The diagram of the campaign - a real map, in fact - in the final version of the game has about thirty nodes to be unlocked by consuming a special currency, called ~memory~, which is obtained by playing in online or offline mode and consequently increasing the level of the various fighters. In a sense, it's a clever move that intertwines the story mode with the others, but on balance we found it really annoying having to fight in impromptu matches when we wanted to continue in the campaign. The latter, in fact, proved to be much more interesting than expected, and not just a mere pretext for bringing together and colliding figures who belong to completely different worlds. Most of the characters still remember the events that brought them together in previous Dissidia, so the campaign gently glosses over their relationships and the unlikely dynamics to focus on the mystery of Spiritus and Materia, the two new rulers of this interdimensional realm who replaced Cosmos and Chaos. The heroes and villains will separate to solve the catch and go home: each unlocked node represents a battle or a short cinematic that the player, at a certain point, can face in the order he prefers. Generally it is the story that determines the characters that can be controlled and the skills equipped, also because on some occasions we will have to face their clones in fights as a filler. From this point of view, we found the battles against the Espers much more surprising, the deities that we can summon in battle and who act as real bosses during the campaign. In these cases, it almost seemed like we were playing a Final Fantasy XIV raid: you have to learn the patterns of the boss on duty, dodge telegraphed attacks and study the best strategy to bring him down, perhaps choosing whether to damage the Esper on duty or the henchmen who protect it. Overall, we enjoyed the campaign. Obviously this is an exaggerated fanservice for fans of the series who will find, in the few hours necessary to complete it, all the characteristic features of the heroes represented. Playstation 4 trophies To unlock the platinum trophy you will first need to conquer 48 bronze, 5 silver and 2 gold trophies by completing the campaign, learning every skill of the various characters, opening chests like crazy and winning lots of games both offline and online. ...but not too much We knew the roster of Dissidia Final Fantasy NT and we know that in the coming months Square Enix will release new characters - free or paid, still not sure - but we have to admit that, despite the introduction of heroes such as Noctis, Ramza, Ace and Y 'Shtola, we missed some fighters, like Tifa and Prishe, who appeared in Dissidia 012 and magically excluded from this round. An inexplicable choice, even in the face of the inclusion of Cain, the Dragoon of Final Fantasy IV added with them in Dissidia 012. However, this is not a serious loss because the roster, which includes almost thirty characters, is sufficiently varied and the characters Those lacking in charisma, such as Cloud of Darkness or Exdeath, are still fun to use. We have already explained the combat system to you in our previous tests but, in summary, it essentially works like this: normal attacks load a numerical indicator that represents the power of the attack PV and if this is successful, and exceeds the total health of the target , then the opposing team loses one of the three notches that make up its total energy. Three-on-three fightsare therefore characterized by a marked strategic nature, since it is necessary to evaluate in a few moments who to hit, also because normal attacks reduce the power of the opponent's HP attack, and therefore it is necessary to choose the right moment to deliver a decisive blow while juggling between the wrestlers in the arena. Furthermore, each wrestler belongs to a specific category which makes him more or less effective against the others, and this is another element to keep in mind when composing the team. In this sense, unfortunately, the confusion that is generated in the fighting soon becomes a deterrent. Between explosions, particle effects and light trails, especially once the Espers have been summoned who devastate the battlefield with their supernatural powers, it becomes increasingly crucial to use the radar to understand who is targeting whom, provided that it is possible to reconnect the numbers they represent the players to the wrestlers on the field. The interface is really intrusive and takes up a large part of the screen; although it offers all the necessary information, it helps to give a feeling of general chaos that works against any strategy. In fact, it is clear that Dissidia Final Fantasy NT was designed to play together with teammates, perhaps by communicating verbally. When it happens, the Team Ninja title shines with a light of its own that reveals the competitive potential in which Square Enix hopes. Unfortunately, however, we are faced with one of those cases in which the idea only partially works and collapses under the weight of simply badly thought out mechanisms. Beyond incomprehensible solutions, such as the impossibility of canceling a choice and returning to a previous screen after, for example, standing in a long queue for an online game, the real enemy of Dissidia Final Fantasy NT is the community. Obviously you can't expect to always play with champions, but as you can imagine most players fight online as the saga's most popular heroes and villains, regardless of any meta or team composition strategy: the game, in fact, prevents us from knowing the choices of our random battlemates until it's too late to reconsider. Added to this is also the precariousness of a netcode probably weighed down by the number of players in the game, so that one of them just has some connection problems to ruin the experience for all the others. Therefore, excluding the online mode, which we recommend facing together with friends to save yourself from disappointments and headaches, there remains a very meager single player component, consisting simply of the aforementioned campaign and a Survival-like mode in which you have to win as many matches as possible , choosing the level of difficulty each time. In these cases, unfortunately, another problem stands out, namely artificial intelligence. For some reason, the opponents are cunning, coordinated and deadly especially on advanced difficulty levels, while our sidekicks always look like howler monkeys that cannot be relied on. And it's a shame because the gameplay basically revolves around this mode, which you need to play repeatedly not only to unlock the memories and continue the campaign, but also to accumulate gil or chests that contain myriads of purely aesthetic objects such as costumes, icons , avatars and catchphrases.", "date": "2018-02-05", "grade": "7.5"}
