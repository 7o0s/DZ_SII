We are in an era in which to play you had to have a Home Computer, while Personal Computers, as we know them today, were used for much more serious purposes. In short, those who wanted to play could choose between the machines of Commmodore or that genius of Sinclair, while those who used the computer to work had to go to Intel based computers. But then a historic fact occurred: a little-known software house (known only for having published WolfPack, a submarine simulator) published a game destined to definitively overturn that situation and to demonstrate that the PC was the gaming machine par excellence. That game was Comanche Maximum Overkill and the software house was Novalogic. The voxels that changed an era I still remember my amazement at seeing Comanche at work. It was the first REALLY 3D game in videogame history, powered by a graphics engine known as Voxels which had spectacular graphics. Amiga & Co felt the pinch and from there began their slow but inevitable decline and favor of the PC. Whether this was a good thing remains to be demonstrated, but as they say in these cases: that's another story. The voxels that changed an era Since then a lot of water has passed under the bridge and many bits inside our CPUs, but Novalogic has always continued to develop that very revolutionary project. Over the years, various expansions and new chapters of the saga have been published (I remember Werewolf vs Comanche 2.0 and the latest Comanche 3), but they have also exploited the graphics engine to create other simulators such as the excellent F22 Lightning II and Armored Fist. Well, ten years after the first Comanche, today, on my desk, there is a package containing the fourth chapter of this very long saga: Comanche 4. Let's not delay any longer! Let's go try it now. Simulator or Arcade? I haven't told you yet that Comanche is a helicopter simulator or rather it's a helicopter game. I also tell you that substantially the control system and the typology remained those of ten years ago, only that at the time Comanche was classified as a simulator, while today it appears ~only~ an Arcade. This is also the clear demonstration that the classification of a game is closely linked to the technical means of the era in which it is made. Disappointed? Simulator or Arcade? I hope not, also because Comanche 4 is a great game, certainly not very original and not very simulative, but a great game. But let's proceed in order. The protagonist of this adventure in the skies of half the world is a futuristic American combat helicopter, the RAH66 Comanche which in reality does not exist yet and which will only have to enter service in 2006. We are engaged against various groups of terrorists who, with their actions, threaten the planetary balance (it is needless to say how unfortunately these facts have suddenly become topical). The game features classic Single and Multi-player modes. Let's start with the latter by reminding you that at the moment the game via the Internet is precluded because Novalogic is arranging their Novaworld portal and therefore we will have to be patient a little. What I can do is list the modes provided: Deathmatch, Cooperative and Scoring. The Singleplayer is made up of six campaigns, each consisting of 5 missions for a total of 30 levels. Simulator or Arcade? The management system of the same is curious which is not sequential, but we can choose which campaign to face and once a mission is completed, it will be inserted in a new menu where all the completed missions are listed. The difficulty is not selectable, but I can assure you that, apart from the first campaign, the difficulty stands at high levels and also considering the variety of missions we can only say that longevity is assured. But even if you're a lightning bolt of war, don't worry, the game comes with a complete editor to create the mission you like best! happy? We enter the cabin The helicopter control system is the simplest and most immediate that I have ever seen, and it is the same as in the previous episodes. I repeat that we are dealing with an Arcade game and therefore it is useless to look for things that you cannot find. The collective can be set to three automatic values that adjust our altitude, it is always possible to adjust the altitude manually, but in the end we will almost always use these preset values. Making things even better is the pop-up button (quick incremealtitude) immediate. We can choose from a huge range of views, from the classic FPS style to those with a virtual cabin (with a look separate from the control) to the classic external views. In this respect, Comanche 4 does not lend itself to any criticism, furthermore the HUD is very complete and provides us with all the information we need. We enter the cabin The RAH66 is a deadly aircraft and has an impressive armament: a nice 20mm cannon on the turret and laser pointing, the Stinger missiles (AA), the very useful Hellfires that have the Riple Fire mode that allows us to launch rapid salvos of missiles that they will go to hit, autonomously, the various targets, the powerful Hydras, or choose to have the target hit by a wingman and if this were not enough we can command the fire of the field artillery which destroys everything there is in a vast area. If during our mission we run out of ammunition or we need to repair our helicopter, we can use a FARP (Forward Arming And Refuling Point), basically a supply and assistance base. Here the repairs take place instantly and we can choose which Payload to perform. A great graphics engine And we come to the highlight of Comanche 4. The graphics. The images already give a good idea, but seeing it in person is a unique spectacle. It is a bit demanding as Hw and has small problems here and there, but the result is in any case excellent. Not to mention the water which is simply exceptional. A great graphics engine Sometimes I happened to take away from the action to look at the landscape. Well in this respect Comanche 4 is unassailable. The same goes for explosions, trails or other ~special~ effects. The models of the units, but also the individual soldiers are up to the rest and as usual the pictures speak for themselves. The sound sector performs its task without infamy and without praise. Fire! As you could easily understand, Comanche 4 convinced me. I like flying low between canyons to avoid being identified by enemy radars, I love suddenly appearing from behind a hill and unloading a deadly series of Hellfires. Fire! In short, an Arcade as it should be, an excellent example of how to make a game, easy to play, but at the same time complete. Well done Novalogic! To those interested, I highly recommend downloading the demo which illustrates the quality of the game very well. A bit of history. In the history of video games, a very special place is occupied by Novalogic, an enterprising software house known for some good titles but above all for having published the legendary Comanche Maximum Overkill. Why mythical? Well this is soon said. We were in the early nineties (ten years ago!!!) and the information revolution entered a decisive phase that still continues today.", "date": "2001-12-11", "grade": null}
