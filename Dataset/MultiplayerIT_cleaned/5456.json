{"name": "A Plague Tale: Requiem", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/a-plague-tale-requiem-recensione.html", "text": "Iron, fire, stone and mud are the first elements that come to mind when speaking of the Middle Ages; elements that the talented French team Asobo Studio has made its own and used as solid bricks for building a world, that of A Plague Tale, as fascinating as it is disturbing, which now returns with a second chapter on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X | S and Nintendo Switch via cloud. The series made its debut in 2019 with a stealth-based adventure that was talked about a lot, above all because of the story told and its protagonists: a couple of aristocratic kids who miraculously survive to the sudden massacre of their family and are forced to flee from the ferocious troops of the Holy Inquisition, sent to capture the younger of the two. As the older sister, Amicia, we have completed that journey vowing to protect our little brother, Hugo at all costs: in his veins flows a cursed blood, which is said to attract plague rats. Not tens or hundreds: millions of rats crowding the streets, emerging from the underground like a tide and voraciously biting anything in their path, it doesn't matter whether it's objects or living beings. Reunited with their mother and the alchemist apprentice Lucas, brother and sister decide to embark on a new journey in a desperate search for a cure for the Macula, the curse that threatens to kill its very young bearer and destroy the whole world. The answer, which appeared in Hugo's dream, seems to reside on a mysterious island dominated by a mountain with two peaks: we will take you there in the review of A Plague Tale: Requiem. Story: A dramatic and majestic adventure A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia and Hugo stroll near a castle If the story of A Plague Tale: Innocence revolved around the loss of innocence, the sudden transition from childhood to adulthood that Amicia had to face, the concept behind Requiem is how this sudden change is handled by the girl, now aware of her role as protector of Hugo. There are moments of levity like the ones we find in the first minutes of the campaign, when the two play hide and seek with Lucas, which however are immediately replaced by the horror and anguish associated with the cruelty of the world around them. As mentioned, there is a journey on the horizon of the protagonists, desperately looking for a cure for the Macula. Every place that the two reach is inevitably condemned by the plague and devastated, thousands of people end up horribly devoured by rats and so at one point the inevitable separation is reached when Amicia has to make an important decision in Hugo's interest. A junction that will lead the brothers to meet memorable supporting actors such as Arnaud and Sophia, and then finally set sail for their dream island; all in the context of a campaign consisting of seventeen chapters, for a duration of approximately seventeen hours. A Plague Tale: Requiem, Befriend Lucas and his mother Narration and stealth mechanics are mixed in A Plague Tale: Requiem in an even more relaxed way than in the past, demonstrating how the boys of Asobo have learned from the best representatives of the action adventure genre and have managed to bring to the screen a plot that grows very rapidly progressive, gradually introduces new places and new characters, arriving in the final stages to take on epic and majestic connotations, which remain impressed by the visual power of the solutions put in place and by their terrible drama. The dubbing in English, subtitled in Italian, plays a central role in the construction of these sequences (and the theme is important, given what recently happened to Hellena Taylor with Bayonetta 3) thanks above all to the splendid performance of Charlotte McBurney, the actress who gave Amicia that strong and fearless character . It is a pity that in the first hours his interpretation is exuberant compared to the animations: in this case the technology that has not kept pace with the art, but it is one of the few uncertainties for a production that seems triple in all respects A, while probably not coming close to those budgets. Gameplay: much richer than the first episode A Plague Tale: Requiem, one of the districts of the first city we will visit The progression used by Asobo for the narrative sector of Requiem also extends to the gameplay which, while immediately introducing some innovations regarding Amicia's offensive capabilities (specifically the possibility of creating a series of alchemical mixtures that allow her to ignite or putting out fires, throwing pitch or a powder that attracts ratsti), during the first third of the campaign remains linked to mechanics very similar to those of the original chapter. Subsequently the situation changes, but the concept of watertight compartments applied to stealth mechanics remains valid: each scenario, however broad and multifaceted (but watch out , the game is not an open world), is presented as a problem to be solved with its patrolling guards that we can get around, confuse or attack. Whatever our approach, however, the important thing is that once we reach the inevitable exit door we will be able to close the dangers we have just run behind us and move on to the next phase without problems: a simplification that is sometimes obvious, but necessary. In Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia faces an armored soldier The offensive attitude is clearly new, given that in Innocence it was managed only in the context of certain clashes, but the developers have made it sufficiently mangy because it almost never represents a fast track, on the contrary. The slingshot allows Amicia to kill soldiers without helmets, while armored ones require an extra commitment in terms of resources that the game does not always deem it right to grant, making objects such as vases rather rare, which can be transformed into small incendiary bombs. It is also a pity that the workbenches for the improvement of weapons often find us without materials to use them. It is played mostly on strategy, on staying hidden in tall grass or behind cover, letting the soldier on duty turn his back and then perhaps hit his torch with the fire-extinguishing mixture, causing the swarm of rats surrounding him to rush in swiftly to devour him. Naturally the flames will come in handy for crossing said swarm, within sequences characterized by great tension and in a couple of cases by difficult to read solutions, which irreparably give rise to a series of frustrating random attempts. A Plague Tale: Requiem includes sections where you have to walk with a torch through the swarm of rats Then there is the great novelty represented by the powers of Hugo, already revealed in some trailers: the child begins to perceive the plague, which allows him to activate a sort of thermal vision which also includes the enemies present in the scenario, and to check small groups of rats, which, although moving in a somewhat slippery way on the map, and for a limited time, are tremendously effective against the soldiers that we may have just deprived of the torches. As mentioned, the more we go on, the more the possibilities multiply at our disposal, as well as the settings that we will find ourselves visiting (with some missed opportunities in terms of enriching the exploration), and without wanting to anticipate anything we can say that in some moments we will bless the fact that there is someone to watch our back in various ways, while we grapple with environmental puzzles and mechanisms that wink a little at the classic Uncharted: an interesting attempt to lead the experience packaged by Asobo towards new destinations, between collapsing bridges and frenetic racing framed upside down. Technical realization: so much beauty but at 30 fps A Plague Tale: Requiem, Lucas and Amicia in an interlude sequence The proverbial elephant in the room needs to be addressed right away, because A Plague Tale: Requiem runs at 30 fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X, not even rock solid, without a performance mode that allows the game to scale the resolution in order to double the frame rate: a feature that by now owners of new generation consoles have practically taken for granted, but which has recently been sadly questioned. There is clearly some problem with the optimization of the Asobo Studio title, especially considering the surprising weight of the PC version, which we tested for a third of the campaign and which with an RTX 3070 at 4K, with the maximum settings, does not go beyond 24 frames per second, requiring the use of DLSS in order to reach at least 30 frames. 60 fps are possible, but at a high price: with that GPU you have to go down to 1440p and use DLSS with ~balanced~ presets, which brings the effective resolution to 1080p or probably lower. One of the wonderful panoramas from A Plague Tale: Requiem Is all this effort justified by the visual quality of the game? Partly yes, partly no. There has certainly been a substantial improvement in the assets compared to Innocence, the settings are much larger and the rats have been dramatically increased, with swarms made up of something like three hundred thousand rodents on the screen at the same time, which make possible sequences with a very high rate of showmanship che proves to be important for the purposes of the narrative. Let's say that in general the graphics of Requiem boast a quality very similar to that of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, a title with which this adventure also shares the medieval setting, and it is really a good race with the Ubisoft's action RPG with regard to the beauty of the scenarios, used in a wise way and placed at the service of an artistic direction that never disappoints, indeed offers some truly breathtaking landscapes that also flow at an often controlled pace, preventing us from running and ignoring so much beauty. The point is that Valhalla grants 60 fps, Requiem does not. In Plague Tale: Requiem, fire remains a lifeline against rats It's a shame and it's a disappointment, no getting around it. An update arriving on launch day should improve performance and therefore fix the moments in which the graphics engine is pushed to the point of dropping a few too many frames, but nobody talks about a possible 60fps mode. Let's be clear: after the initial disappointment you get used to the 30 frames and artistically the title of Asobo Studio manages to be forgiven thanks to its extraordinary qualities, but the question remains and we are sure that in the coming months it will be talked about a lot. We want to spend the last words for the wonderful audio sector of the game, which as mentioned can count on a very heartfelt and intense dubbing, which greatly enriches the narration, and on a portentous soundtrack signed by Olivier Deriviere, which from the Gregorian chants of the main theme to the pieces of contour always manages to support in a very solid way what happens on the screen, adding depth and involvement to the experience.", "date": "2022-10-17", "grade": "8.8"}
