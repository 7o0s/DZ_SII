{"name": "Real Racing 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83322-real-racing-2-tutti-a-inseguire.html", "text": "In the summer of 2009, an unknown Australian software house called Firemint helped build the gaming reputation of the iPhone and iPod Touch by placing one of the most important stones in a teeming but immature App Store. The title in question was Real Racing, an absolutely successful attempt to apply the accelerometer and touch screen in the context of a realistic car racing game. Even with the passing of the months and with the entry into the field of various challengers, perhaps with the high-sounding names of companies of enormously larger dimensions behind them, Real Racing has managed to maintain the role of leader in the genre, in addition to the highest positions in the classification of sale all over the world. After a decidedly long period of development for the iOS environment, the expected and obvious sequel is now finally available on the Apple online store. Just better If Firemint has earned the respect of the community, the reason is simple: it makes few games - Real Racing 2 is the third, after its predecessor and the excellent Flight Control - but with a passion and care in many cases extraneous to the magnum sea of titles on the App Store. The sum of factors such as greater resources, superior experience and knowledge of hardware, and the technological progress of Apple devices has allowed the team to improve practically every single aspect of the first episode, with a sensational gap in some cases. We start with the 30 real cars, which replace the fictional ones and all the same from the debut chapter, from manufacturers such as BMW, Chevrolet, Ford, Jaguar, Lotus, McLaren, Nissan, Volkswagen and Volvo. Cars full of details, well modeled and immediately recognizable, complete with faithfully recreated dashboards to be appreciated with the internal view. In the latter case, subtleties such as the speedometer hands and revs that really work represent only one of the many testimonies of the painstaking work carried out by the programmers. But probably the most surprising thing are the 16 (exactly, sixteen) cars in the race, a sensational leap forward compared to the 6 of the first Real Racing and more generally an enviable result for a racing game on any platform. Challenging 15 opponents obviously makes the races much more engaging, frenetic and demanding, especially considering the excellent artificial intelligence developed by Firemint; the 3 difficulty levels, which can be modified at any time during the career, allow the game to be calibrated exactly to the point desired by the player, in relation to his driving skills. We were talking about the career mode, which is developed in tournaments, races and events with an excellent variety for a total of about 10 hours; although there is a mechanical tuning section (not aesthetic, except for the change of body colour), most of the tests set access limits - such as the number of horsepower of the car - such as to always guarantee a balance and a satisfactory competition. It is therefore impossible to throw oneself into an extreme upgrade of one's car, presenting oneself with perhaps 100 horsepower more than the opponents, only to then greet everyone at the first corner; in Real Racing 2, on the other hand, everything is well calibrated and coherent, without smudging. The control system, one of the strengths since its debut, has been kept practically unchanged; steering is managed by the accelerometer simply by tilting the held device horizontally, while accelerator and brake are managed by different touch screen areas. Everything works great, with a very high level of precision, and effectively exploits the characteristics of the Apple hardware without particular awe. 15 locations then act as theater for the circuits, characterized by a track design with some ups and downs but more than satisfactory in general. Even the balance between arcade and simulation has been kept roughly identical in this second chapter; Real Racing 2 is a realistic but not exaggerated racing game, which requires you to brush trajectories and set the curves by dosing gas and brakes but at the same time it doesn't punish for cheeky driving behaviors and contacts with opponents. In this sense, despite the inclusion of aesthetic damage (just mentioned, since it concerns little more than the detachment of the bumpers), there is no mechanical damage whatsoever, and the car's reaction to impacts is very permissive. Turning instead to the aesthetic component, Real Racing 2 is a simply beautiful game to look at, surprising at times; the level of detail and the applied effects make the overall picture really impactful, but the incredible thing is how the Mint3D graphics engine is scalable based on the device it runs on. Yes why ifIt really seems like a miracle, yet Real Racing 2 works on any iPhone and iPod Touch. Really, any, even older ones. Obviously, the results are better on an iPhone4, both for fluidity and for definition and quantity of effects and details, but the one achieved by Firemint remains a result of absolute respect. Of note are only a few small jerks in the frame rate in our test on 3GS. The multiplayer concludes the picture, locally on WiFi for 8 players or for 16 online via Game Center.
