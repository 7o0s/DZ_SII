This is now the fixed thought of Annie, Bob, Max and Ziggy, four penguins absolutely determined to make their dream come true, which is to reach Hawaii. However, the journey is very long and fraught with pitfalls, given that, apparently, this small group has the ability to always be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And so you have to run, trying to reach the end of the stage each time within three different scenarios: Antarctica, Jungle and Desert (the first playable for free, the other two to be unlocked by spending 1.79 euros), each consisting of five challenges main and as many secondary, which are unlocked only when we get the canonical three stars. In this specific case, however, it is not a simple evaluation of our performance, but rather three stars that we must be able to collect during the race, repeating the level if necessary. Halfway between the typical running game and a platform, Aloha from Hawaii gradually introduces new elements to deal with, traps and objects to collect, but above all it allows us to switch from one penguin to another as needed, taking advantage their peculiar abilities: Annie is very small and therefore manages to pass through narrow spaces; Bob is short and fat, but full of money to bribe any guards along the way; Max is tall, slender and athletic, and can pull off extraordinary leaps; Finally, Ziggy has a few wheels out of place and this allows him to do things that others cannot, such as breaking through walls with his head. Fantastic Four Playing with Aloha from Hawaii is very simple: at the beginning of each stage our character starts running and gains speed after a few seconds, and we have to act on the touch screen to make him jump (possibly double) when necessary, to overcome chasms , climb platforms, avoid traps and so on. The presence of three little hearts to make up the health bar implies that at each impact we do not systematically incur game over, but it is possible to get back on track, even if we have to take a running start again and risk, therefore, that our many pursuers reach us . When one of the four penguins passes over a beam of light, we can press the on-screen button that allows us to switch characters on the fly and continue thanks to his abilities. On paper, this peculiarity could have translated into an experience of greater depth, but not in a running context like this, and therefore in the end changing penguin becomes a maneuver like any other, to be performed at the right time but only because the scenario forces us to do it. Or at least that's almost always the way things are. The idea of inserting bonus missions every time we get the three stars is nice, but even here something more could have been done to make these moments more meaningful, perhaps by making a variation on the theme rather than insisting on the same idea. However, when it comes to analyzing the technical sector of this all-Italian production, one is amazed by the quality of the cutscenes, which manage to convey the idea of nice characters and an irresistible, albeit not very original, story. The in-game graphics are also very nice, accompanied for once by not very varied but amusing music.", "date": "2012-11-20", "grade": "7.6"}
