{"name": "Mirror's Edge - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mirrors-edge-recensione.html", "text": "Runners! The runners are a group of outlaws in a society dominated by a totalitarian regime that controls all forms of communication. They live by jumping between the skyscrapers of an icy and emotionless metropolis, carrying out small paid missions of theft and recovery. Faith, the protagonist, who recalls Milla Jovovich from Luc Besson's Fifth Element, finds herself unwillingly involved in an intrigue that will bring her sister under arrest, and the whole game is nothing more than a race to try to free her, recovering clues and trying to save his skin. Mirror's Edge is a 3D adventure that mixes the mechanics of a platform with a first-person view, with those of Fps, in which freedom of movement is combined with a painstaking study of the interactive elements, which you can grasp, of the seabed, so that, with a little practice, you never feel lost even when running at full speed from one skyscraper to another. This thanks to the idea of the developers to give life to a world in which total white approaches the bright red with which the stairs to go along, the doors to break down and the parapets from which to lean out from in the middle of a complex backdrop and otherwise hardly legible. Having become familiar with these elements, the only limit is the sidewalk on which you inevitably crash with every mistake, which happens with a remarkable frequency, especially in the more difficult passages. In fact, to appreciate Mirror's Edge, one must not be frightened by the classic structure known as Trial and Error - in English - that is, a game in which one must try acrobatic sequences countless times until one has found the right series of jumps or the best passage to be able to traverse one of the maps. Sometimes, understanding where to go is not very simple and the control system, almost perfect in open spaces, shows some limitations in more closed ones, where it becomes even more complicated to understand which walls to jump on to move forward. In fact, pressing the B button activates the Runner Vision, which is a pointer that indicates the exit to be reached in a level, but as the crow flies, without taking into account the shape of the map. Outdoors, the system is quite functional, given that from the top of a roof it is possible to see clearly even from a long distance; indoors, on the other hand, the pointer is of little or no use, directing the player towards the wall, window or door that stands in the way from there to the final destination, but without giving any really useful indications for reaching it. In other words, you find yourself spending several minutes in some settings jumping from one wall to another, trying to figure out where to go next, perhaps dying all the time if you find yourself suspended in the void. Faith's mirror To pursue Faith there are government militias, armed with pistols, rifles and machine guns. At the beginning, these are simple policemen who descend from helicopters and who can also be avoided by running. Continuing the plot, special troops enter the field, also capable of jumping on buildings, and sometimes armed with sniper rifles, capable of making life really difficult. To deal with the soldiers there is a melee combat system, made up of kicks and punches, which is completed with the possibility of stealing the enemies' weapons by pressing the appropriate button at the right moment, or when, after a series of blows or during an attack, the wielded weapon glows red, telling Faith when to steal it. To help, there is also a power that allows her to slow down time so as to have more chances to execute the move. The artificial intelligence of the opponents is truly remarkable, just as the aim is often infallible, a pity that the same cannot be said of the means that the player has to defend himself. The aiming system is not comfortable, as is that of managing the weapons, which are discharged after a few shots and which must be abandoned before being able to recover others from the corpses of the soldiers. In short, while having fun at first, one gets the feeling that the combat system was added later to lengthen a single player campaign which already does not exceed eight hours on the first pass. Once finished, the reasons for replaying may be the desire to unlock objectives or trophies, the exploration of the seabed in search of a series of suitcases hidden in the most incredible places or the time attack modes in which to perfect yourself in overcoming the levels and comparing their times with those of friends on the net. This relative brevity and the lack of a multiplayer mode are perhaps the two most glaring shortcomings of a game which, when everything works right, with Faith leaping like a panther everywhere, makes for a truly immersive experience.or unique and an electrifying feeling of freedom. Faith's mirror The Dice, the same team behind the Battlefield series, have taken the Unreal Engine 3, rather than their proprietary engine, and made it unrecognizable for Mirror's Edge. The blinding white of the skyscrapers contrasts splendidly with bright oranges, reds and blues, to recreate a modern setting, but suspended in the air, which transmits dynamism and coldness at the same time. Blur is skilfully used to render the effect of speed and the blowing of the wind, and the care placed in Faith's clothing manages to make her captivating and familiar from the first moments. There is some problem with aliasing, with the definition of the textures, which, given the nature of the game, are often observed closely - defects included -, and with the models of the characters and their animations that leave a little to wish, but it goes without saying that the visual impact is one of the most successful elements of the whole game. The buildings, unfortunately empty of passersby and supporting actors, the sewers and other locations are all coherent and excellently made, so as to suggest that the city is the true protagonist of Mirror's Edge. The story, rather thin, is told with some animated cutscenes and made as if it were a cartoon. The choice is interesting, but the detachment between the 3D characters and those of the animations is clear and the connection between the two levels becomes a bit too weak as the game progresses. Particular mention for the soundtrack, composed of a captivating new song and sung, which with the various remixes echoes throughout the adventure, and a series of music halfway between techno and new age. All are of an excellent standard and, together with the graphics, contribute to recreating a setting without comparison in the current panorama, in terms of style and personality. Comment Mirror's Edge is perhaps the bravest and most successful exponent of those titles that try to give substance, merging them, to signals and inspirations from popular culture, music and design, expanding the boundaries of a rapidly evolving media, the video game . In this intent, the Dice succeed perfectly, packaging a product in step with the times, full of style, inventiveness and charm. The actual game, on the other hand, alternates moments of involvement and pure adrenaline with moments in which the fights, the controls and the structure of the levels slow down that flow of emotions which would otherwise be exhilarating from start to finish, leaving the taste of a experiment not fully completed. However, a title to play even if only for the innovation it brings, bearing in mind the limited longevity and the lack of any multiplayer mode, but which will be able to give anyone more than a thrill. Pros Innovative gameplay The sense of vertigo Unique creative idea Cons The fights The longevity Lack of multiplayer Xbox 360 - Goals Finishing the game once at normal level results in between 300 and 400 points. To get to the thousand you have to find all the hidden suitcases, perform combinations of particular moves and dedicate yourself to timed modes. All things considered, it won't take long to get a sizable haul of points.", "date": "2008-11-13", "grade": null}
