Seeing the Chrono Trigger logo appear on the Steam home page was a real heartbreak for a very large group of enthusiasts: after all, no one expected to see what is defined by many as one of the best games ever to land on PC created. Do you really need a summary for a title that reaches the enviable 92 points on Metascore in its Nintendo DS port? For that RPG that marked throngs of 90s teenagers? For that artwork that bears the signature of the ~dream team~ made up of the creators of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and Dragon Ball? Well, evidently it can only be useful to the less experienced millennials and the Taliban of the Personal Computer, a system that had never had the honor of hosting it on their hard drives, except through the beloved/hated emulation. The game saw the light in 1995 inside a Super Nintendo cartridge where, alongside the 32 megabits of ROM, there was also a RAM buffer memory, powered by an auxiliary battery, which was used for saves. There was no need, given the relative simplicity of the graphics engine, of the famous coprocessors which represented one of the many goodies of the Japanese house's ~console-gourmet~. If you are wondering how 4 Megabytes became 700 (such is the size of the download from Steam), you are missing a fundamental passage: the good Chrono Trigger was in fact dusted off in 1999 for the PlayStation, in an ~enhanced~ preparatory edition upon the release of the spiritual sequel Chrono Cross. On that occasion, anime-style FMVs made by Akira Toriyama (one of the magnificent three) and Toei Animation were added, as well as other tasty delicacies that the capacity of a medium such as the CD-Rom could guarantee. If you thought it was over here, you are very wrong because about ten years later the role-playing game also began to invade the mobile world, starting with the DS with a release adapted for the dual/touch screen of the Nintendo portable console at to which two new levels were added: Dimensional Vortex and Lost Sanctuary. In 2011 the iPhone version arrived, with ~improved~ graphics, but without the videos, and localization in Italian; the following year it was the turn of the conversion for Android systems. Both recently saw the reintroduction of anime sequences with an update that came out to coincide with the Steam release. Do you like to win easy? A long history just to say that what we have in our hands should be the most complete version of the Square-Enix title (Squaresoft at the time of the initial release), but we really want to hope that this is not the case. It is in fact a catastrophic copy / paste of the smartphone code, nothing more: there have been so many complaints from the community that the team has tried to reassure the angry fans by promising a series of adjustments a few hours after the launch of the title. Let's go into a little more detail to understand what triggered this real wave of discontent. From a technical point of view, the only real innovations are mouse and keyboard support, however very inaccurate and with the impossibility of reassigning the keys, and automatic saving on the cloud. The realization, as a whole, is approximate, weighed down by a confusing interface, designed for touchscreen displays, which often ends up invading the screen. The resolution, the only option that can be modified from the initial menu, rises up to the FullHD standard, but to reach this limit the programmers have simply zoomed in on the original backdrops with a result that is frankly indigestible unless you own a tablet or an ultrabook. Only on the monitors of these devices, where the PPI is high, are the graphical glitches smoothed out; while for owners of the traditional 24 or 27~ the only way forward will seem to be playing from the window. A very interesting tweet from Fred Wood, author of the Kuso platform, helps us understand what happened during the conversion phase starting from the sprites: most of them have been the subject of a curious remake that has certainly defined them in outline but at the same time it seems that made them less detailed; some elements have been redesigned from scratch and clash with the pixelated graphics, while others have remained as they are. However, the most dramatic part concerns the backdrops where the textures are placed side by side in a random way: in simple terms, the SNES release is undoubtedly superior. The lack of care in the transposition can also be seen in other details, such as schermate where you can change the name of the protagonists, which are nothing more than Windows 3.1-style system windows, worthy of the worst amateur program and certainly not justifiable for a giant of the caliber of Square-Enix. And what about the mouse pointer that continues to remain in plain sight during the sessions? The icing on the cake is the request not to turn off the ~mobile device~ during the save screens. To this we must add a list of bugs: the gallery and the bestiary, for example, have disappeared; the movies start at will (we happened to pass the point where the first one should have been activated and instead nothing happened). Other events felt buggy to us, such as the cat in the millennium fair disappearing from the screen, making it impossible to complete a mini-game. Difficult to accept that a title with the beauty of twenty-three springs on its back can still have similar errors. Despite it all Absorbed this low blow, however, the exceptionality of a practically perfect game remains, able to brilliantly overcome the passing of the years in its skeleton. This is thanks to the creativity of a team that is in some ways unrepeatable: a swarm of authentic artists who have been able to hit the mark starting from the plot, a masterpiece in which the stories of six unforgettable protagonists intertwine, jostled over time in an attempt to save the world. The game begins in the year 1000, with the mute Crono who comes across Marle, a mysterious girl who wears an equally mysterious pendant, on her way to the Millennium Fair where her friend Lucca wants to demonstrate how her latest invention works, a contraption that allows you to teleport people from one platform to another. It turns out, thanks to Cronus who acts as a guinea pig, that the Telepod actually works, and Marle decides to try it too; but, once inside, she is swallowed up by a temporal vortex and only her necklace remains on the ground. A search starts from here that will lead our heroes to one of the thirteen endings of the game, which is reached on the basis of numerous choices made during the thirty hours required to complete the adventure. Unlike traditional jRPGs in Chrono Trigger the clashes are not random, but the enemies are always clearly visible on the map, and take place without opening a battle screen as happens in Final Fantasy. The use of both single techniques and magical combinations that are gradually unlocked by leveling up with the party helps to increase the tactical level of the clashes, the difficulty of which should not create many headaches, however. The main quest is enriched with other optionals, numerous mini-games and ingenious puzzles to be solved, often taking advantage of the possibility of time travel. The musical accompaniment, entrusted to the master Yasunori Mitsuda (with the collaboration of the inevitable Nabuo Uematsu), is yet another flagship of this stellar production: fortunately it has not been affected by the lack of care given to the graphics, so that you can enjoy of the orchestral symphonies brought to theaters all over the world and worthy of being also transferred to commemorative CDs. What was the rush? With all the praise poured out above, the bitterness of the devotees of Crono and Lucca is understandable, who felt cheated and even brought up conspiracy theories. Square-Enix shouldn't have afforded to put even its most iconic, revered and revered creature into the commercial juicer: a minimum additional economic effort would certainly have allowed a better result than this porting of porting. The extras granted by the publisher are of little use to appease spirits (the limited version, which includes a medley of five of the most iconic songs, a digital booklet created by Yasunori Mitsuda and six wallpapers, is guaranteed at the same price as the standard one for both has already bought the game and for those who will do so by the end of March). Once the bitterness has passed, it remains one of the milestones in the history of videogames (not only Japanese) and for this reason we can only recommend it to those who have never played it, paying attention to the price and the changelist of the (hopefully) next patches . Or, alternatively, resorting to emulation.", "date": "2018-03-08", "grade": "5.0"}
