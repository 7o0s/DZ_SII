{"name": "My Happy Planet", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/my-happy-planet.html", "text": "The temperature is hotter, the air is increasingly polluted and natural resources are running out: this is the current situation of our planet, a trend that started only a couple of centuries ago but is bringing the Earth to the brink of the abyss. Nations are mobilizing, hopefully not too late, to implement measures capable of guaranteeing a livable and non-devastated environment for the next generations. However, as often happens, the change must start from the single person: sorting waste, using public transport where possible, avoiding waste, etc. these are habits that need to be spread so that the situation can really change. And information is a fundamental part of the process, even when it comes from an often overlooked pastime such as video games. My Happy Planet offers us a collection of eight more or less valid minigames, with the common denominator of dealing with ~ecological~ topics and providing brief but interesting information on various issues of general interest. The game starts from an image of planet Earth, with a thermometer next to it indicating the alert level: to bring down the ~temperature~, we will have to try our hand at the various minigames and achieve satisfactory results, gradually unlocking all the applications. Some are presented as a real test of reflexes, in which you have to act on the entire numeric keyboard to achieve your goals, while others have a more classic setting. The minigame ~Panic by fire~, for example, sees us managing three pumps that have to put out as many burning trees. Each element is marked with a number, which must be pressed in the right order: if we want to collect water from the pump with number 3 and throw it on shaft number 4, we will have to press the corresponding keys. The action is made more varied by the presence of alternative objects to the ~drops~ of water, such as the heart (which acts as several drops together, bringing even a now charred tree back to life) or the hurricane (which, on the contrary, makes the flames flare up). The ~Toxic Disaster~ minigame, on the other hand, has a structure that refers to shooters: in the lower part of the screen we have our character, who has to shoot blocks of ice at the barrels of toxic waste that are unloaded towards the sea, preventing contact with water. We find an almost identical setting in the minigame ~Space cows!!!~, in which we have to shoot caps towards the backsides of flying cattle prone to flatulence, while in ~Chaotic commuters~ we will find ourselves managing automatic ramps so that each character reaches the own ideal destination (a bus of the same color, in this case). The graphics of the game are well done, with a series of nice characters and designed with a good style. The animation is lacking, unfortunately, but it is still eight different minigames, each with a different connotation. The level of each application is variable, also from an aesthetic point of view, and as usual there are less brilliant moments than others. The action is accompanied by the MIDI version of some pieces of classical music: an original solution at least, in many ways pleasant and certainly preferable to the anonymous melodies that are too often heard in mobile video games.
