However, we have thought about it and concluded that it has been many years since the advent of CD-Roms and interactive films, so something may have changed. Maybe it's a brilliant work that will go down in video game history, who knows! We immediately point out that in the package you will find the first two episodes of the series. We start the game and the first movie starts: an elderly maid brings two children a drink but can't find them in their beds. Someone has kidnapped them! And who will you call? The game begins and James Burton, the lead investigator of the series, explains the situation to us by calling us colleagues. Throughout the game it will be up to him to question witnesses, while we should collect evidence. In fact trying Casebook: On the scene of the crime (both episodes) it is difficult to speak of a graphic adventure. All the player has to do is explore rather small environments and take pictures of the underlined elements that could represent clues. Filled a roll of eight shots you have to take them to the van with the machinery inside to analyze them. The clues will then be examined by a forensic man (another actor) and, if necessary, we will have to solve simple mini-games to extract organic or synthetic traces, isolate DNA, remodulate audio and video recordings and so on. The collected clues will be placed in a folder and some of them will be connected to each other. Overall, these are elementary operations to be carried out, since there is no possibility of making mistakes. A DSLR with film? If from the point of view of the puzzles we are faced with a title obviously designed for the widest possible audience, which recalls the casual games in which you have to find hidden objects, the scenic apparatus put up for production. The cutscenes are nothing great, with bad actors and mono expressive. The actor chosen for Burton is so good that looking at him for too long gives rise to the desire that he is the next victim of the killer on duty and, despite the plots of the two episodes claiming to be serious and dramatic, there are moments in which the laughter comes spontaneously, as during the interrogation of the loan shark in the first episode. What a beautiful hairstyle, lady! Did he kill anyone recently? To be honest, there are even dialogues bordering on the absurd or jokes that would like to be brilliant, but they only make one feel pity for poor Burton, who redeems himself for the obvious discomfort he feels in pronouncing them. In addition to this there are a number of errors that leave you dumbfounded. For example, in the first episode you have to find kidnapped children. Exploring their bedroom, we discover that their miserly father (they live in a large villa with a garden) bought them an Amiga 500 with lots of pirated floppies to play with and at the end of the episode we see one of the children greeting Burton with a GameBoy (the first... are you sure they were kidnapped and didn't run away?). Not bad, one might say, maybe it's set in the early nineties, even if it's not mentioned anywhere. The answer is a solid no, unfortunately, and we can say this for several reasons. Meanwhile, the photos are taken with a digital reflex (we understand from the electronic display, visible when it is raised), and in fact it is not clear why only eight photos can be taken at a time, forcing the player to go back and forth between environments to explore and the van for analysis (8 MB memory?); moreover, in the second episode some clues are found on SD cards used with a video camera. If this were not enough, the technologies used for the surveys include analyzes introduced in recent years. You draw your own conclusions. Textures and bugs But the defects do not end with those listed above. Meanwhile, the gameplay has some practical problems on which we can not fly. The exploration of the environments to be photographed takes place in three-dimensional spaces with little detail. That is, the detail is good as long as you look at it in general, but when you zoom in with the camera you find yourself looking at strange abstract images made up of washed out textures and incomprehensible shapes. Interrogations are simple films The resulting problem is very simple: unknown objects are often photographed, the function of which will only be clarified in the van, because the lack of detail prevents them from being defined. In other cases, absolute nothingness is photographed, to later discover that in that punto there was a fundamental test. From this it follows that we often end up photographing at random, leaving it to the analyzes to decide whether those collections are evidence or if we have taken a useless photo. The flaws are not finished, unfortunately. Testing it on two different computers, we encountered an annoying bug that crashes the audio of the movies and automatically skips some dialogues. The problem was encountered in both episodes, but it proved to be more serious in the second where we had to repeat the same scene three times before being able to continue. Initially they thought they had forgotten to do something, but, solution in hand, we discovered that it was Casebook that had crashed. On the third attempt we managed to carry on doing nothing different than before. Consider that the game does not allow you to save when you want but does everything automatically. Haven't you figured it out yet? If it crashes and won't let you advance, you have to start all over again!", "date": "2009-12-11", "grade": "4.0"}
