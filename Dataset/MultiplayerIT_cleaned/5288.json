{"name": "Per mari e per deserti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/174023-forza-horizon-3-per-mari-e-per-deserti.html", "text": "Having entered the hearts of fans since its debut, which took place in 2012 on Xbox 360 with the chapter set in Colorado, the Forza Horizon series has not only been able to elegantly translate the playful recipe of Forza Motorsport into an arcade key, but in this context it has risen to real point of reference, driven by a second episode of very high quality that has won unanimous acclaim from critics and audiences. With these premises, the announcement of Forza Horizon 3 was practically obvious, and punctual as a Swiss watch, the title peeped out at this year's E3, where it shook the audience thanks to a particularly inspired and exciting trailer. The goosebumps experienced by many arose from the perfect marriage between the melancholic notes of ~Wicked Game~ and the dazzling Australian setting, with beautifully sampled engine roars and breathtaking landscapes in the background. In short, there could not have been a better business card for the latest Playground Games effort, whose disruptiveness, supported by the tests during the presentation, was also revealed in the highly appreciated demo. The tasty appetizer was the forerunner to the final code of the Xbox One version, which in these days we have thoroughly pitted to offer you our inevitable analysis. Forza Horizon 3 does not betray expectations and exceeds the momentum of the second, excellent chapter Change of perspective In the first chapters you played the role of an anonymous novice who, driven by the hunger for victory and delirious fans, decides to participate in the Horizon Festival to climb the rankings (indicated by colored bracelets) and become the champion; a virtuous path that translated into rivers of credits to invest in the garage. The recipe worked very well and, we are sure, it would have been welcomed also in the third episode, nevertheless the developers have decided to shuffle the cards on the table, proposing a radical change of perspective in support of absolute freedom of action. In Forza Horizon 3, in fact, the player is the boss of the festival, and as such he can shape and organize it according to his own tastes. The incipit of the game, whose narrative component is even more nuanced than in the past, unfolds in perfect Forza style, being able to immediately get your hands on the cover racing car - in this case the splendid Lamborghini Centenario - and have a smattering of the controls basis. Having reached the destination in Byron Bay, not before having experienced the thrill of an 800 horsepower off-road vehicle, the first novelty approaches, namely the choice of one's appearance from a roster of fourteen avatars. Once the name is also determined, the doors of the real Festival Horizon will open, which as head we will have to expand on the vast Australian map (twice that of the second chapter) through the opening of new venues and expanding those already conquered, thanks to the 'accumulation of fans and experience. Progressing in the career, in addition to being able to hire new radio stations, through the projects the player will be able to set up the car category, the number of laps, the weather conditions and the time for each unlocked route, creating labels similar to those seen in the Grand Tour of Forza Horizon 2. Of course, you can compete in exhibitions and championships with the classes suggested by the game, or you can jump into a project created by another user. The aim, fundamentally, is always to have fun behind the wheel by challenging your opponents, but with even greater freedom of action. The appeal does not lack a plethora of predetermined challenges with new proposals and old acquaintances; among them we find the clandestine races, the unmissable Challenges renamed for the occasion in ~Wish List~ (in some cases customizable), the signs to be destroyed, the iconic forgotten jewels to find and the spectacular duel events against vehicles of all kinds, a trademark of the series. We leave you the pleasure of discovering them. In addition to the classic speed cameras, among the so-called stunts we also find the ~Warning signs~, or rather spectacular jumps in pure GTA style, and short drifting sessions to be exhibited in specific sections of road. Other novelties are the Drone mode and the possibility of forming caravans while on the move; instead, the appreciated slot machine, the photo mode, the rallies and the Skill Points to spend on the perks return, for the occasion distributed over three different items. The full-bodied Horizon Campaign, which should be completed in one hundred hours of gameplay, for the first time can be enjoyed in a cooperative with three other friends, even in Cross-Play with PC players, to the full advantage of fun. We remind you that the title is part of the Play Anywhere line, and you can buy itdolo on the store will be accessible on both platforms. The famous Drivatars, flagship of the artificial intelligence of the Forza series, after a dedicated challenge can be hired (and fired) to let us accumulate credits, fans and experience, moreover it is always possible to challenge them in real time while circulating on the street, without forget the Rivals vs Ghosts mode, now seamlessly integrated into the menu of each event. Among the specific modes of the network game, divided into Online Adventure and Free Game for twelve players, in addition to the dynamic challenges related to travel and the so-called PE Championships, we find the classic King, Infection and the new Flag Rush. Due to the difficulty in finding available sessions we could only do some quick tests; we will evaluate this component more thoroughly in the PC review, in which we will also analyze the weekly events of the new Forzathon mode. The picture of the immense playful offer is completed by the support for Clubs, the livery editor with additional options, the ForzaVista mode for all the racing cars in the garage and the great return of the Auction House, which will make drivers and designers very happy. Xbox One goals Forza Horizon 3 features the classic 1000 points to unlock with various achievements. The most valuable, from 50 points, consist in winning the final event and all the clandestine races, while among those from 25 there is the achievement of level 150 and the unlocking of all skills. Lots of those from 10 and 20 points, involving photos, competitions, exploration and music. The asphalt that asphalt Forza Horizon 3 offers a total of over 350 cars, divided into classes from D to X and embellished with new categories inspired by Australian automotive culture: among them we find the so-called UTEs, or sports pick-ups, and above all the dune buggies, ideal to tackle the most treacherous terrains. The gameplay fits perfectly in the wake of the Horizon series, whose arcade imprint is however permeated by nuances taken from the physical-dynamic model of the much more rigorous Forza Motorsport. The keywords therefore remain accessibility and fun, without ever leading to the banal: yes, it is possible to launch at breakneck speed and easily manage the excesses of the vehicles, even on the most impervious surfaces, however above all by disabling the aids (TCS, SCS, ABS and so on ), the challenge is always satisfying and demanding, especially against the more aggressive Drivatars. Before competing, you can intervene on the setting of the racing cars to align them with the conditions of the course, furthermore there are always mechanical and aesthetic modifications, with some innovations such as customizable horns, body kits, new sets of rims and better shop management. Like Forza Horizon 2, there is the day-night cycle and the dynamic weather, which makes use of one of the most appreciated features in Forza Motorsport 6, or the impact on the driving of puddles of water, although mitigated by the more arcadey nature of the production. After all, in Forza Horizon 3, there are courses that wind along waterways and even among the waves of the sea. The title is very enjoyable both with the joypad and with the steering wheel, with the latter able to more effectively return the interference of the various types of terrain (many and well diversified), despite a not always vigorous force feedback. The garage, as specified, contemplates a large fleet of off-road vehicles suitable for the wild ecosystems of the Australian map, which in addition to presenting deserts, rainforests, rocky gorges and fascinating beaches overlooking the ocean, also offers small settlements and a large and modern urban complex, the spectacular Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast. While capturing the distinctive features of Australia as a whole, the open world map still seems to focus on the eastern portion of the land of kangaroos, between the states of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, with excursions in the desert areas of the Outback and in the wine areas of the Yarra Valley. Master races It is undeniable that Xbox One has often found itself chasing the competition from a technical point of view, but the show offered by Forza Horizon 3 in certain situations can surprise even those used to high-end PCs. The sublime modeling of the cars, the cleanliness of the image, the infinite horizon, the sumptuous light effects and the suggestive Australian landscapes, in fact, push the work into the Olympus of the most beautiful Microsoft exclusives. The fluidity is practically granite and the only hiccups we observed during loading, at the start of some cutscenes and in the race only during the downpours in Surfers Paradise, without affecting the enjoyment of the experience. A rendersre the even more fascinating image, which travels at 1080p and 30 frames per second, there is the ~photogrammetry~ technology applied to the elements of the landscape and the excellent rendering of the sky, whose nuances derive from shots taken with a monstrous 12K camera HDR. Some areas of vegetation, such as in the heart of the lush rainforest, sometimes have a delay in updating the image compared to the main scene, and as in Forza Motorsport 6 the antialising filter is not always effective, but it is detail when compared to the graphic magnificence offered by the title. After all, it is impossible not to be amazed as you whiz between the majestic rock formations of Ormiston Gorge or among the Twelve Apostles, perhaps caressed by the sunset. Even the audio offers incisive and crystalline effects, especially as regards engines and tyres. The range of songs broadcast by the eight radio stations is vast and varied, and can be expanded with a subscription to Groove or by a personal selection. As far as dubbing is concerned, unfortunately we must report the removal of the Italian, while the subtitles are sometimes annoyingly positioned in the lower right corner. The netcode was solid in our preliminary tests, but for a definitive judgment we will have to wait for the official launch, on September 27th (the 23rd for those who bought the Ultimate Edition).", "date": "2016-09-20", "grade": "9.5"}
