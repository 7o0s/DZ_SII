In this boundless sea of hopes, epigones and bets, there are small experiences that manage to emerge enough to be able to communicate beyond their own small audience. In this context, a small adventure of Turkish origin entitled Havsala: Into the Soul Palace approached the launch without pretensions, almost in a whisper and with the charm that an investigative game between history, philosophy and the occult can arouse, fully illustrated in mano.We will tell you about this in the review of Havsala: Into the Soul Palace. A timeless and spaceless room A timeless and spaceless room is the setting for Havsala's adventure: Into the Soul Palace Havsala: Into the Soul Palace is, even more than an investigative puzzle game, a philosophical experience. The game by the independent Turkish team Stratera Games has chosen a strongly narrative formula, with simple point and click mechanics, full of texts and images of the history of scientific and esoteric philosophy. It is a journey through centuries of critical thinking, which takes place in solving a series of visual, mechanical and conceptual puzzles, which serve to solve the mysteries that lie behind the lives of the characters. All of this takes place in a room detached from time and space, in which the player is called to retrace the lives of these men who lived in some historical moments of ferment of thought. Their point of view is explored through the pages of a diary in which they tell their story and which was left by them in this room, together with all the elements that allow the player to deduce the rest. In fact, the Turkish word havsala can be translated both as basin, but also as ~to understand with the mind~, and so it is to be interpreted when reading the title. One of Havsala's puzzles: Into the Soul Palace The style of the puzzles is very varied and although everything takes place in a single room, one does not get the impression of being faced with a limited game. In general, once you understand the key to the solution, it is not difficult to proceed with the puzzles, but if you get stuck, there is a way to ask for a hint. The adventure diary that takes into account all the steps completed up to that point, will also write the next one in red, basically describing part of the actions necessary to solve it. The challenge rate is therefore low, but not trivial, demonstrating Havsala's goal of entertaining, involving the player and teasing him with ingenuity rather than really putting him in difficulty or blocking him in one phase of the experience. The witty content proposal, which cites the highest calibers of ancient and modern philosophy, is accompanied by a convincing atmosphere, which frames a well-crafted, albeit modest, game picture. A respectable artistic package A shelf full of Soul Palace clues The artistic endeavor of Havsala: Into the Soul Palace is in line with the entire production, functional and fit for purpose. From the point of view of the illustrations it is a single room, well represented in 2D with a handful of views and zooms dedicated to individual scene elements. The quality of the work shows the small size of the team, not in a negative sense but to contextualize the considerations, also by virtue of the economic limitations of the project. The work done with the soundtrack is certainly more exuberant, consisting of 11 songs that well complete the sensory package of Havsala: Into the Soul Palace, and which are perfect for immersing yourself even more in the game atmosphere while thinking about the various puzzles. A limited but aware offer One of the books you can find in Havsala bookstore The adventure proposed by the boys of Stratera Games is very short, it can be completed in two hours. They can become three or a little more in case you decide to deepen each cultural stimulus proposed by Havsala: Into the Soul Palace. The duration is certainly justified by the goodness of the work done as well as by the reduced price of only 9.99. The only drawback is the replayability factor, really limited, but which despite the one-dimensional nature of an investigative puzzle game doesn't even try to offer a secondary challenge, or a second level of interpretation of the puzzles to justify a possible return to the palace of souls after the credits. The advice is therefore to face the first game by taking all the necessary time and let yourself be guided by Havsala: Into the Soul Palace.", "date": "2022-07-17", "grade": "8.0"}
