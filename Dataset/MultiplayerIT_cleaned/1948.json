{"name": "Deathrow", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deathrow.html", "text": "The game modes After this brief but in my opinion necessary, to bring you into the atmosphere of Deathrow, introduction, we just have to analyze the game modes offered: Tutorial - It seems almost superfluous to tell you the function of this mode, however for the less informed it serves to explain the basic commands of Deathrow, through useful indications provided on the screen during a test match against robots. Single Match - In this mode you can play alone or up to a maximum of 4 players, and with it you will be able to earn ~unlock credits~ (obviously the higher the difficulty of the game and the more credits you will earn, but I will explain shortly what they will be used for, although it is easy to guess). After selecting this mode you will be asked to choose a team and stadium and then you will move on to setting up the game and here comes the fun part. First of all you will have to choose between ~classic Blitz~ or, if you have already unlocked it on the ~unlock~ page (see below), ~Multi Disc~; it will now be the turn to choose which rules to use (you can also decide, and this is the default setting, not to use rules), the difficulty and duration of the rounds (keeping in mind that each match consists of 4 rounds). Conquest  It is the main mode, a sort of Career mode. During a Conquest you will have to take a team from the amateur category and bring it to the top positions, challenging other teams, carrying out missions, buying players, training and healing them. Once you reach the top of the table in a division and if you have enough money, you will be able to pay the entrance fee to the next division, where you will face stronger teams in new stadiums. Now let's talk about the so-called ~Unlock page~ or the section in which to use the Unlock Credits I was talking about earlier and which you will have won in Single Match and Conquest modes. With these credits you will be able to unlock and use new teams, players, stadiums and game modes and more; however, keep in mind that only by defeating a team during a Conquest game can that team and its stadium be unlocked. A few more words should be spent regarding Deathrow's Multiplayer. As already mentioned, in every game you play both in Single Match and in Conquest, you can play up to 4 people on the same Xbox, obviously in Split Screen. It is also possible to connect 2 Xboxes together with the appropriate cable or, if you have an Ethernet hub, even up to 8 Xboxes. The teams For the sake of completeness I have to tell you that in total there are 14 official squads available and more precisely: Blitzers, Sea Cats, Protectors, Convicts, Crushers, Sandraiders, Resilient Mercs, Nukeheads, Sentinels, Marines, Disciples, Black Dragons, Demons and First Blitzers (the most violent team and with the most victories in the championship). It should also be said that in each team each player has, in addition to specific moves for matches and characteristic behavior, the following characteristics: strength, speed, life, regeneration, pass/shoot, capture/intercept, combat, aggression, solo/team play and injury indicators. Concluding Finally, something must be said about the slightly more technical aspect of the title. To begin with, it must be said that although the manual and box are completely in Italian, the game is completely in English from speech to subtitles. As for the graphic side, the setting is recreated very well (it really seems to be in the future in a Blade Runner-style atmosphere), the textures on objects and players are fairly defined and aliasing is almost completely absent. During the game it will then be possible to choose between 2 cameras: Sports View, that is a view from above with which you lose a lot on the graphic side but you can make better game strategies, or Action View, a view located behind the player from you controlled and fully 3D, which will take you directly to the pitch. Finally, it should be emphasized that the title unfortunately lacks playability: the controls are in fact not immediate and only after assiduous practice (which in my opinion could discourage many players) will it be possible to enter the game rules and complete discrete game actions and carry out good defenses. Introduction Let's start with a little history just to get into the game environment. 2197:Blitz, an illegal and extremely violent game, makes its first appearance in Los Angeles. It is said that it is a way for criminal organizations to recruit new followers. 2218: The Prime Network television network finally takes an interest in the game. Establishes the rules and creates the BDA, i.e. the Blitz Disc Association. However, only exhibition meetings with large cash prizes are held and the show becomes a great success throughout the solar system. 2219: It is the year of the first official Blitz competition. After a bloody preselection, 14 teams still remain in the running. They were chosen for the motivation expressed in the fights and for their sheer brutality. The cybernetic, genetic and chemical transformations performed on the participants promise levels of violence never reached on TV, but ~The show must go on~!", "date": "2002-11-08", "grade": null}
