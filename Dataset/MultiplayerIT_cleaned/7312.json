{"name": "T3 Arena", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/t3-arena-recensione.html", "text": "The shooter genre on iOS and Android has evolved substantially over the years, offering significantly improved touch controls with each new experience but also much more sophisticated technologies in terms of graphics, almost eliminating the technological gap with what is available on PC and consoles. Well, XD Entertainment's new free-to-play hero shooter takes it one step further in this direction, delivering characters that seem to come out of a Disney Pixar movie, rock-solid shooter mechanics and a great abundance of content: there are let's talk in the T3 Arena review. Structure T3 Arena, Skadi is the first character available As a good hero shooter, T3 Arena boasts a roster of characters that differ from each other in terms of equipment and skills, as well as of course in appearance. At the moment the game includes eighteen heroes that can be unlocked simply by playing, accumulating points, leveling up and opening the inevitable prize boxes, but without microtransactions that allow you to buy them directly. Obtaining new fighters to be discovered and the gradual unlocking of content goes to characterize a particularly solid and interesting progression system, which while showing the side to some marginal pay-to-win aspect (see the upgrades for the characters, which it is somehow possible to ~accelerate~ by buying coins and crates) corrects dynamically the shot thanks to a matchmaking very careful to pair users of similar level. In this regard, there are already seven modes and fifteen maps for Season 1: a decidedly rich starting endowment, which however thanks to the reduced number of participants in each match, limited to six players, does not seem to have divided the user too much nor slowed down in any way the very fast matchmaking, which does its duty in seconds both under Wi-Fi and on a cellular network. Modes include traditional three-on-three Deathmatches, Crystal Assault in which you have to destroy the opposing team's crystal, Control which is the classic territorial stipulation with zones to control, Payload Race with its cargo escort mechanics, Free- For-All which is the inevitable all-against-all, Payload Escort in which the load must be defended or attacked before delivery and finally Clash, a deathmatch without respawn. Gameplay T3 Arena, Iris opens fire on opponents with her very fast machine gun If there is one thing that surprises about T3 Arena, it is the extraordinary immediacy of its gameplay, undoubtedly the result of a study that has led the developers not only to provide a lot of options to better adjust the experience ( there is even support for Bluetooth controllers!), but also and above all to pack a basic system that is immediately extraordinarily precise, reactive and effective. First of all thanks to the automatic fire: a mechanism that we have always considered obvious, given that in a shooter if you frame an enemy in the viewfinder you do it to shoot him and not to greet him, but which many titles in the past neglected, thus undermining the dynamism of the experience, inevitably adding cumbersome controls. T3 Arena, Glory's alternate fire mode The third-person view is perfectly at the service of gunplay and special abilities, some available immediately and others to be loaded but which can resolve a fight even if we are outnumbered thanks to laser slashes, bombs, rotations and so on. The repositionable virtual stick and well-arranged buttons do the rest. Of course, at present there are some balancing problems that make certain characters a little too strong. Many, for example, complain about Iris, the fighter who is able to heal her comrades and shoot rapid bursts with her light machine gun, but Gloria is not joking either since she can attack up close with a powerful shotgun and from afar with a sort of really devastating fixed machine gun. Graphics and sound T3 Arena, Skadi fights in a deathmatch If in terms of pure playability and content T3 Arena immediately reveals itself as an excellent hero shooter, the same can be said of the technical sector. The sound, despite its essentiality, remains in the lead with some jingles and accompanies the action in a very functional way thanks to well-crafted audio effects, but it is above all the graphics that stand out. The scenarios are perhaps not a concentrate of originality and spectacularity, indeed in some situations they appear generic, but the design of the characters is truly irresistible, each hero appears well valued on an aesthetic level and also the animationsthey do their job, without the usual netcode simplifications. On the iPhone 12 Pro it is possible to play with all the settings at maximum and 60 fps, a pity that after a few minutes the terminal begins to overheat: in these cases it is better to scale a preset.", "date": "2022-06-05", "grade": "8.5"}
