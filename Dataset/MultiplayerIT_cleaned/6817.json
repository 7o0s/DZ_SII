Take the beginning of Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth where we see a destroyed planet where nations have federated to send colonists into space so that we can survive. The question that flows like spring water watching the images of the introductory film flow is: hundreds of rounds to win a game of Civilization V and this is the result? Are you sure we want mankind to survive? Wouldn't it be better to save the bonobos that only reproduce and are well liked by all? Space, final frontier, which planet will we destroy in the next hundred years? No really, in honor of optimism we demand a Good Civilization that begins with humans being exterminated upon landing on an alien planet, with E.T. on duty angry just because one of the settlers brought along a record by Gigi D'Alessio. It would be cathartic, as well as an excellent review of the barking neomelodic. Impossible wishes aside, the first choice that Meier's team's latest effort puts before us is that of the composition of our space expedition. Indeed, it is possible to leave the burden of generating a game with random values to the CPU, but a self-respecting strategist loves to plan his games from the very first moves. Choosing the coalition, the size and name of the planet, the type of spaceship and other bonuses to take with you, you can leave into the unknown hoping to find favorable conditions for landing. Unlike what normally happens in Civilizations, the first city cannot be founded wherever you want by sending a settler around to look for the ideal terrain. Instead, you have to settle for starting from the square where the spaceship will land, selected from a grid of adjacent squares. If desired, it will be possible to help oneself in the choice by activating the display of resources on the map, so as to have a clearer idea of where the conquest of space is starting. Don't worry, because the game will not leave you alone and the tools available to newbies are many: there is a very rich tutorial to learn the basics of the good stellar conquistadors, you can activate the advice of the various ministers, or you can read the Civilopedia which is always a gold mine of information. However, once the initial practices have been completed, we just have to start exploring our new home. Alien economy Despite the crackling start, Beyond Earth immediately falls into the ranks by offering early round gameplay very similar to that of the other titles in the series. At the beginning you have to explore the planet one hex at a time, looking for crashed Earth capsules, territories with richer resources to build new colonies and, why not, aliens to come into contact with. Unlike the barbarian populations of terrestrial Civilizations, the wandering aliens of Beyond Earth have different functions, both socially and economically. Apparently they just look like very dangerous creatures who spend their time killing our explorers and jeopardizing the life of the colonies, but it soon turns out that the situation is different. We will discuss their role later. Wandering around the planet, one immediately discovers one of the most insidious characteristics of the new environment: the miasma. Some squares are covered by green toxic clouds which do not allow units to be stationed on them, on pain of losing hit points each turn. In short, the place is decidedly hostile, despite the fact that it is immediately noted that the aliens do not attack the outposts head-on and, above all, that any source of concern for the colonists can become a resource in the long run. Yes, because in addition to having to accumulate energy (used for the maintenance of buildings and units and can be used as currency), culture (used to acquire the Virtues, which we will discuss later), production points (used to construct buildings and units), science (guess what it's for?) and a series of resources that will be more or less useful depending on the chosen philosophy (they can still be used as bargaining chips), you will soon have to decide how to relate to the planet and its inhabitants. This is no small decision, as it will lead to clear changes in gameplay. Will Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth have succeeded in making our civilization conquer the stars? The affinities The three philosophies, or affinities, of Beyond Earth represent three ways of conceiving the relationship between the occupants, ie the earthlings, and the host planet. Wanting to simplify, we could define Harmony as a sort of ecologism that aims at integration and contamination between humans and aliensthe; Supremacy as another way to make the human race evolve, but contaminating it with technology; and Purity as the complete rejection of any form of change in human physiology, which is reflected in a complete conservatism. When playing, it is not mandatory to choose to follow a single affinity, but if you want to get the most out of gameplay and resources, you should stay consistent and aim for the complete development of one of the three. Only in this way will you get the best troops and some advanced buildings, essential for achieving certain types of victory. Choosing one or the other affinity will also change the production of some resources or the way others are exploited, including aliens. For example, a player with a high affinity in Purity and with military ambitions can aim to link scientific production to alien extermination, selecting some useful virtues for this purpose. Virtues are nothing more than skills that can be selected after having acquired enough culture. They are divided into four trees covering the four key sectors of civilization management: military resources, population growth and well-being, scientific research and industrial development. The more points you give to a single tree, the more bonuses you get. From the point of view of development Beyond Earth leaves a lot of freedom to the player, while establishing some limits dictated by management logic. For example, if military supremacy is to be established, it will be necessary to aim for greater energy production at the expense of science and culture, while if cultural victory is to be achieved, expansion and troop production will necessarily have to be sacrificed in favor of science and culture. In the game the choices are not so clearcut, but you should have understood what we mean. From this point of view there is little to go around it, because despite the light years, the aliens and the philosophies, the modus operandi is very reminiscent of that of Civilization V. Between evolution and conservation The sense of deja vu becomes even stronger if we take into consideration the game interface, which is not only very similar to its predecessor, but is practically identical. Not bad since we are faced with the best that the world of turn-based strategy has to offer. Is there a development studio capable of creating clearer and more natural interfaces than those of Firaxis, which manage to be fluid despite the amount of options they manage? Definitely no. Sure, having kept some functions unchanged for years helps, but it's certainly not a bad thing, just as it's not a bad thing to resemble a beautiful and deep title like Civilization V. Unfortunately, however, when playing, the feeling of being faced with a mod, as advanced as you want, but still derived from the other title, becomes irrepressible. If you remember the same did not happen playing other spin-offs always made by Meier and his, such as Colonization and Alpha Centauri. Especially the latter, given that the comparison with Beyond Earth is inevitable, had so many gameplay peculiarities compared to the Civilizations (from advanced terraforming to the complete customization of the troops) as to appear fresh and original compared to the source, while sharing many aspects of the interface and gameplay. Of course, even in Beyond Earth it is possible to grow the units in different ways depending on the chosen affinity, with the possibility of selecting one of two upgrades for each evolutionary step reached, but in this case it seems more like a brilliant solution to the problem of not having the same number of units as any Civilization available to offer some variety, instead of an added feature with a willingness to innovate. Let it be clear that we are talking about a situation of full balance, with an excellent amalgam between terrestrial (sea, land and satellite) and alien units, such as to eclipse the competition. We just wanted to note that, paraphrasing the game itself, if we had to indicate the affinity chosen by Firaxis to evolve the series, we would have no doubts in choosing Purity. Science or science fiction? But let's go back to the game and talk about the scientific evolution system, which deserves to be covered in particular. As you know, the Civilizations have always offered a scheme of technological advancement linked to the historical reality of our planet. Unfortunately Beyond Earth is set in space and therefore it was no longer possible to discover fire or the wheel to people who have just made a journey of several light years by establishing a colony in a hostile environment. For this reason, Firaxis has focused on a freer scientific growth, in which selectable technologies are positioned in a radial pattern. In the center of the graph trWe obtain the essential knowledge, the simplest to research, surrounded by all the other nodes, which the further they are from the centre, the more they require time and resources. Each node can have one or two subtechnologies to research in any order after the main one is learned. In short, there is a hierarchy of research, but depending on your objectives it is possible to have only some technologies flying over others, in order to make the games more varied. As in the other Civilizations, even in Beyond Earth technologies unlock new units, new buildings, wonders, hidden resources and so on. Let's say that having a research plan, perhaps creating a queue to get to a certain objective, is essential to be able to win. Searching at random or driven by the needs of the moment is useless and, indeed, in some cases it can prove harmful. Note that some technologies earn affinity points. This means that if, for example, one wanted to pursue the path of Purity, it would be necessary to carefully evaluate whether to build a technology with affinity for Harmony, otherwise a more unstable society would be born. The Alternatives The market in recent years has offered several valuable turn-based strategies that deserve your interest. For example, if the idea of playing a fantasy Civilization-like game appeals to you, you will surely appreciate the beautiful Endless Legend, which, even if more immature, really has a lot to offer. Still from the same development studio, but more in line with Beyond Earth, is Endless Space, a title from which Firaxis has taken some ideas for his latest effort. Other aspects of gameplay A game of Beyond Earth offers many other aspects to consider in order to arrive at the final victory. Let's take for example public health, which worsens by building or conquering new cities due to the atmosphere of the alien planet and which can lead to significant malus or bonuses depending on how it is managed. Or how can we fail to mention the commercial networks, by land or by sea, similar to those seen in Civilization V, which yield often invaluable additional resources to keep the whole shack afloat? After all, satellites should also be mentioned, excellent defense tools, but also for cleaning the miasma or improving production. Finally, we cannot forget two fundamental aspects of the game, both of which have remained identical to what we saw in Civilization V: the first is the diplomatic system, with the usual pinball machine of offers and counter offers, declarations of peace and war, with treaties and agreements underground, useful for achieving political victory, but little evolved compared to the rest. The second is multiplayer, which offers the same game modes. After all, intelligence management has also been slightly modified, which is limited to making us assign spies to the various cities, to then give them a goal to achieve such as, for example, theft of energy, technologies or the hiring of deserters. Very weak, albeit unedited, is the quest system. Every now and then we will be assigned missions to carry out that will make us discover secret aspects of the alien planet and will question our choices. Some are also linked to buildings and are used to direct their production. In general we can say that we tend to forget its existence. Of course, every now and then some notification appears to remind us that we have tasks to do, but in the advanced rounds we end up not paying much attention to it, taken as we are by the flow of the game. As you will have understood, we could stay here and tell you about other aspects of Beyond Earth for many more thousands of characters, but the substance would change little and the comparison with Civilization V would come up several times, with which the latest effort by Firaxis also shares the graphics engine and the general style. Of course, the graphics have been completely overhauled according to the new scenario, but the overall quality hasn't moved forward an inch compared to the past. To be honest, some choices in the design of the aliens are really questionable and, in general, many new units know that they have already been seen, resulting in essentially anonymous. Also in this case the problem is secondary, given the genre, but it is undeniable that if we add it to the other features taken from Civilization V, we inevitably end up establishing an overall comparison that leads us to speak of Beyond Earth as a beautiful title, not very courageous, that is, unable to make the series take the slightest step forward.", "date": "2014-10-23", "grade": "8.8"}
