{"name": "Dungeon Defenders", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/95236-dungeon-defenders-lassedio.html", "text": "Tested version: Windows PC If you have a castle and one day you find yourself having to defend magic crystals, which you normally use to make elves drop their underwear, from ugly slobbering creatures, you have only one option: buy the +5000 orifice-widening supercannon. Unfortunately there is the economic crisis, the spread is truly a spread and you lack the money even just to buy toilet paper for all the bathrooms in the manor. No super cannon, sorry, it costs too much and Merkel doesn't like it. All you have to do is put your destiny in the hands of four hired heroes, the ones who are found in the dungeons of any castle killing rats and collecting rusty swords to sell to the first generic merchant passing by. What a sad life. Luckily they consume mana rather than money and you see a lot of room for improvement in them. After all, the four have pretty good defensive and offensive skills, at least on paper, and they need to be driven around in Maseratis. Of course the enemies are really dangerous. Some open doors with their breath, others turn navel mold into poison bombs (when they don't eat it), not to mention those with acid sweat and the others who use pubic hair to sharpen swords. There's also a big dragon, which probably didn't find a place in the Skyrim cast (as we know, dragons were invented by Bethesda). In short, to put it like Adriano Celentano, the situation is not good... and it also stinks. Contents Dungeon Defenders is summed up by saying his name aloud three times, like Beetlejuice. It's easy to describe it: it's the classic tower defense in which you have to build defensive structures to block the enemy waves. More difficult to make the fact that it is one of the best exponents of the genre, especially when played in multiplayer. At the beginning you have to choose which of the four characters to use in action: the wizard, the huntress, the warrior and the monk. Each has five defenses and four special powers, two that can be activated by spending mana and two linked to the weapon. The defenses are not all available from the start and must be unlocked by leveling up. At first there won't be many choices in terms of game modes, but as you beat the maps in the campaign, a whole series of game customization possibilities will open up that will allow you to replay the maps several times, always in a different way. The gameplay is ideally divided into three phases: the planning phase, in which you choose how to spend resources to put up your defenses, the combat phase, in which enemies arrive, and the gathering and upgrading phase, in which you counts resources and improves the character. In reality, the distinction between the phases is not so clear and, for example, it is possible to build defenses even in the course of the action, without having to wait for the end of the round. How do I dilute the broth for you We think the best way to praise Dungeon Defenders is to talk about the fact that we've been playing it well beyond editorial duties, that is, that we liked it so much that we let us play it beyond the review. This is not an original title, this is not, since the world of video games is now full of tower defense, but it is done really well and the gameplay is so refined as to make it rise by force to the top of the genre. To help him are also the role-playing elements which, linked to the online, create that process whereby one feels satisfaction in growing the character and facing increasingly difficult challenges, unbearable for beardless low-level heroes. Playing in single player is fun, how to deny it, and to overcome all the maps that separate from the final sequence it will take several hours in which you certainly won't regret the little money spent to buy it, but it is in multiplayer that Dungeon Defenders blossoms and shows its better side. The maps are designed to be quite affordable, especially at the lower difficulty levels (easy and normal), but there are surprises and the advanced maps, those with at least two crystals, become quite challenging, especially when playing with others and the number of enemies multiplies exponentially. There is no shortage of items to collect, features to upgrade, extras to discover and pets to take care of. Everything contributes to creating a winning formula with many nuances, which allows for a lighter approach, but also a more dedicated one for those who want to discover all its secrets. Technique and fireballs The interface is very simple to use, comfortable with both the joypad and the keyboard. With the pressure of a few keys you are ready to place your defenses, to decide their orientation and, if necessary, to upgrade or sell them. Also the control of the charactersi is very straightforward, with one button to jump and two to use base weapon attacks (pets do it all by themselves). In short, it only takes a few minutes and you are ready to play. If desired, there is also a quick tutorial that explains all the basic mechanics of the game, so as not to live with the suspicion of having lost a few pieces along the way. Visually Dungeon Defenders has a cartoon look, with cartoon characters and cartoon colors. Nothing transcendental, actually, but everything is well done and, above all, fluid even on PCs with limited power. The only real downside is the soundtrack, which has a few very repetitive songs and a handful of light sound effects. Nothing annoying, actually, but not enough stuff to tear off your underwear and throw them damp against the screen.", "date": "2011-11-07", "grade": "8.8"}
