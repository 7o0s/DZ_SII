In fact, the formula adopted by Nintendo for the series, absolutely spartan and completely devoid of frills, immediately defined products clearly aimed at nonogram enthusiasts, perhaps orphans of Mario's Picross or the most recent episodes for Nintendo DS. And so, a few months after the previous chapter, here comes - again rigorously in digital delivery on the eShop at the price of 4.99 - this new Picross e4. However, which again has very little in reality, this time eliminating even that minimal element of curiosity linked to the variations of the original formula that instead had characterized the predecessors. Picross e4 represents the ideal compendium for the Jupiter Corporation series Picross e4 seems to bring with it the characteristics of a conclusive chapter for the series; although not in possession of any ~insider~ information about it, in fact, the way in which Jupiter Corporation has developed the individual chapters suggests, if not the word end, at least a firm point from which to possibly start again. If the first Picross was in fact basically introductory, with the second and third the Micross and Mega Picross were presented respectively, both interesting variations on the theme that helped to spice up the franchise's excessive content and aesthetic sobriety . This fourth iteration, on the other hand, constitutes a compendium of what has been shown previously, also adding a sort of prize for those who have wanted to faithfully follow the development of Nintendo production, step by step. In fact, in addition to the hundred classic nonograms, in grids ranging from 5x5 up to the unprecedented maximum size of 20x15, Picross e4 also includes the aforementioned Micross and Mega Picross: the former are a sort of matryoshka in which each square of the puzzle main contains another nonogram which is then destined to compose an image, the latter are instead characterized by the presence of Mega Numbers which suggest the squares to be colored in two lines instead of one. These are pleasant variants, which - above all - are capable of giving a slight refresh to the formula without distorting it at all. Furthermore, those who keep the previous episodes on the console's memory will be happy to be rewarded with 5 extra Mega Picross for each of them: a sort of loyalty bonus, which precisely reinforces the feeling of being in front of a chapter that wants to somehow pull the sums of what has been offered so far. For the rest, there's not much to add: Picross e4 is certainly not an exciting game but absolutely competent, packaged with the precision and care that one can expect from a software house with all this experience in the specific genre. Organization of the menus, options and control system have remained completely unchanged, with the only difference related to the color theme (this time orange) through which you can distinguish the various episodes at a glance. The musical accompaniment is repetitive and quite annoying, destined to be soon deactivated without any remorse.", "date": "2014-07-11", "grade": "7.3"}
