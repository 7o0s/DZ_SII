{"name": "Professor Layton and the Curious Village - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/professor-layton-and-the-curious-village-recensione.html", "text": "Puzzle with story We essentially find ourselves wandering the streets and houses of St. Mystere, trying to get to the bottom of the many puzzles that pervade the town, which seem to chain one after the other, becoming more and more dense. The exploration takes place through passages between static screens, in each of which it is possible to interact, through the stylus, with the elements of the scenario and the characters present, in a style that is somewhat reminiscent of Myst, for example. The puzzles that are proposed to us in the game are mostly detached from the plot, puzzles that are practically ends in themselves, if not for some simple reference to the game situation, and to the character we are interacting with. Exploration is therefore extremely simplified, and is limited to finding the element capable of providing the new puzzle, through which to continue the story (usually this happens by talking to the various villagers). The tests we are subjected to are just over 130, and are characterized by a truly remarkable variety, and by an excellent level of challenge: there are some difficult to understand puzzles, but with the use of aids it is possible to manage to get out easily ( the latter are found in limited numbers, which can be activated by collecting the ~hint~ coins scattered around the village). One could argue that there is no effective system to discourage the use of cheats - such as turning off the console after reading all the hints, then reloading the save and solving the puzzle without actually spending any ~hint coins~ - but it would be a bit of nitpicking. The questions obviously hinge on logic, mathematics, geometry, optical illusions and generally all the basic elements of puzzles, but they never lack inventiveness, and their variety makes the approach to each new test attractive. In addition to continuing the story, solving the puzzles unlocks bonuses and additional content, which are linked to some sub-games inserted to vary the action and deepen the structure (paintings to be reconstructed that reveal new backgrounds, furniture to be inserted in the rooms of the two protagonists to best satisfy them, strange mechanical parts to be combined together to build some mysterious robot). Magical atmosphere What is already an excellent collection of puzzles in itself, becomes a fascinating game thanks to the interesting plot, and above all to the wonderful characterization applied by Level-5. The graphic style, as regards characters and scenarios in the static screens and in the cartoon animation phases, partly recalls the works of Miyazaki with strong western influences: the product that comes closest, in particular, is ~Appointment in Belleville~ by Sylvain Chomet, to which the developers seem to have made more references in some settings, and for the many caricature-looking characters. The musical accompaniment is perhaps the weak point of the careful packaging work implemented by the developers: the accordion motifs are fascinating at first, but tend to turn into annoying lullabies when we find ourselves focusing on individual puzzles. Inside this magical atmosphere, we are kidnapped by the story of Prof. Layton, who, starting from what appears to be a simple research mission, turns into a whirlwind of mysteries concatenated one inside the other: what secrets does the Reinhold family hide? ? What does the strange tower inside the village mean and why does it make strange sounds and vibrations? Who is the hooded figure who wanders around St. Mystere making people disappear and then reappear? The story is obviously revealed by solving the puzzles, updating the list of mysteries that the Professor diligently keeps in his bag, which serves as a menu that can be recalled at any moment of the game. It takes from 10 to 15 hours to get to the bottom of the plot, but there are many secret puzzles to be discovered and resumed even after finishing the story: some secret puzzles can also be played after the conclusion of the various chapters, new modes appear after beating the game and, interestingly, there are new additional puzzles downloadable every week by connecting to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Comment Far from being a product for children, as the illustrations might suggest, Professor Layton and the Curious Village is a challenging challenge for the intellect and a fascinating storytelling experience. The excellent technical realization and the style adopted give body to the whole project, which effectively completes the transformation of Brain Training (understood as a videogame category) into an adventure, an operation similar to what was carried out by Puzzle Quest with a puzzle gameand RPGs. A certain propensity (or at least interest) towards puzzles is clearly necessary to fully appreciate the game, which in any case does everything to fascinate even those who are not used to puzzles. Once all the puzzles have been solved, the attention for the game abruptly diminishes, but the presence of additional puzzles to be downloaded weekly from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection manages to further lengthen its longevity. Pros Intriguing puzzles, and present in large quantities Fascinating general characterization Compelling amalgamation of adventure and puzzle game Cons Sometimes repetitive musical accompaniment Some difficult to understand puzzles", "date": "2008-06-09", "grade": null}
