In a sense, all those that came before and that Square Enix has released during 2021 were preparing us for this kind of event. Final Fantasy VI is undoubtedly one of the most loved and influential Japanese role-playing games in the history of the genre, but it is also one of the episodes that Square Enix has revived less often, especially if we think of the various remakes that have followed one another over the years. quality of the game there is little to discuss, as you will discover by reading the following lines, there are some questions that seek answers: was it worth waiting for this re-release, which also came out later than the originally scheduled date? Were the tweaks that Square Enix needed the most time really that significant? If you want to know, all you have to do is continue reading our review of Final Fantasy 6 Pixel Remaster. The best Final Fantasy? Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster, Earth in the world map We assume that the narrative behind Final Fantasy VI remains, even today, one of the most original and elaborated in the whole series: the mere fact that the game begins by putting us in the shoes of an invading army, with an introductory sequence with a cinematic flavour, already it tells us that we are about to experience, or relive, a special adventure. In reality, Final Fantasy VI is not even the story of Terra, the protagonist who deserts and, rebelling against the despotic empire of Gestahl, discovers unsuspected truths about her. Final Fantasy VI is a choral story that revolutionized the way of telling a JRPG at the time. Today perhaps some flaws may appear more naive - the fact, for example, that some supporting actors, being optional, have a completely marginal role in the plot and in the dialogues - but the work of Hironobu Sakaguchi and Yoshinori Kitase in 1994 was something absolutely experimental. In addition to dissecting the traditional canvas by entrusting it to multiple points of view, the story ventures twists and turns in the most disparate genres, but manages to maintain a coherence and a rhythm that many JRPGs still dream of today. The cast is made up of extravagant figures who occasionally slip into what we would today call clichs, but who nonetheless return a nuanced and genuine characterization, thanks also to fluid and never verbose dialogues. Final Fantasy VI even ventures a prototype of ~open world~ in its final segment, allowing the player the freedom to choose when and how to face the final showdown in a world that opens up to many opportunities before the final word. And in this regard, how can we fail to mention Kefka, the most hateful, treacherous and, ultimately, successful antagonist of the entire Square Enix gallery? Traditional gameplay Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster, the iconic clash with Ultros On the gameplay front, there are no major differences with respect to the past, but if you have played the Pixel Remasters in order you may notice the significant return to the forced dynamics of Final Fantasy IV. The Final Fantasy V Job System is in fact set aside in its entirety, and each character is defined by its peculiar abilities: Sabin, for example, has a series of special attacks that must be performed as if you were playing a fighting game, while his brother Edgar can use a plethora of different gadgets; Strago is essentially a Blue Wizard who can learn the techniques of enemies, while Locke is one of the fastest characters and being a thief can steal gil and items during the fight. These are just a few examples, as the cast has fourteen different playable characters. Within certain limits, however, the player can customize the various party members with Relics, accessories that grant very specific bonuses, and Espers: the latter are the canonical ~summon~ of the series - such as Ifrit, Shiva, Ramuh and so on - and they can be associated with different characters, altering their stats and giving them the ability not only to summon them, but also to cast certain spells. By repeatedly using these spells, a character ends up learning them definitively and will not forget them if we move the Magicite containing the Esper to another member of the group. It's an intuitive and ingenious system that lends itself to an interesting search for synergies and combinations, and above all that allows you to frequently change the structure of the party. In combat, however, Final Fantasy VI remains a very traditional title. The Active Time Battle System marks the speed with which the turns of protagonists and enemies follow one another, and the actions are chosen from the classic drop-down menus. The difficultyIt seemed to us slightly more balanced than the original: some historically demanding moments have been revised to guarantee a smoother experience even for new players. Pixel Remasters: pros and cons Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster, the Espers are very important both in the story and in the gameplay We did a quick brush up on Final Fantasy VI, a nearly thirty year old JRPG that has aged extraordinarily well, but now let's focus on the Pixel Remaster, because even this edition has its pros and cons. We certainly can't complain about the technical sector, because Square Enix's idea was certainly brilliant: the Japanese developer has essentially redesigned the pixel art in high definition without distorting its 16-bit origins, and the work has been absolutely superfine. Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster is undoubtedly the best possible version on the aesthetic side, except for the terrible font that also afflicts the other Pixel Remasters. Final Fantasy VI, however, deserves a separate discussion because Square Enix has decided to redesign some sequences of the game: specifically, the introduction and the famous scene of the work. As for the first, the Pixel Remaster is essentially identical to the original - net of the renewed pixel art - but lacks the opening credits that appeared during the famous march of the Magitek armor. A choice that finds justification in the fact that those credits should have changed in the Pixel Remaster, and therefore, to avoid any confusion, and to respect the original authors of the game, it was preferred to remove them completely, however weakening the cinematic style so desired by Sakaguchi. Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster, the very famous opera scene has been completely redesigned The opera scene, on the other hand, was completely recreated in HD-2D. Square Enix has decided to implement the peculiar style inaugurated by Octopath Traveler to refine one of the most iconic sequences in the history of Japanese RPGs. Some purists might turn up their noses, but the effect is great, with everything leaving one wondering why Square Enix hasn't re-released the entire game in HD-2D. The real protagonist of this scene, however, is not the renewed pixel art, but the song ~Middle character air~. In the original, Square Enix used the SNES synthesizer to mimic the voices of characters singing in the middle of a play. The song - composed, like the whole soundtrack, by an extraordinary Nobuo Uematsu in one of his most successful collaborations - was later sung in various concerts, but this is the first time we can hear it in the game: for the occasion Square Enix he had Celes dubbed while he sings, and in seven languages, including Italian. The effect can appear alienating in the very first moments but, believe us, the scene is so successful as to be nothing short of moving. Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster, the new pixel art is gorgeous and respectful Ultimately, it's not like there really are any downsides to playing the Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster. Some Square Enix choices may be less agreeable, and there are also those who have criticized the reconstruction of the opera scene not only for the HD-2D pixel art, but also for having replaced the nostalgic synthesizers with a sung song; however, the edition is also a gem on the accessibility front, with a plethora of options that allow you to customize the experience, an illustration gallery, quick save and, above all, the new soundtrack rearranged with the supervision of Uematsu himself.", "date": "2022-03-11", "grade": "8.5"}
