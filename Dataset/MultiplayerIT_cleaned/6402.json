There is no doubt that the brand has an impressive media strength and Ubisoft has managed to capitalize on this result thanks to an ecosystem that transcends the general episodes of the series and offers short films, comics, gadgets and spin-offs. Assassin's Creed Chronicles China falls precisely into the latter category, composed of variations on the theme that are often less related to the cornerstones of the series and allow for greater experimentation; the game is available for free for those who have purchased the Unity Season Pass, it costs 9.99 otherwise as a stand-alone product. China is part of a trilogy set in different places: the next episodes will take place in India and Russia with peculiar types of gameplay, without forgetting the points of contact with the series and a narrative that makes various references to the main chapters. In this case the protagonist is Shao Jun, whom we have already seen in the short film Assassin's Creed: Embers; she finds herself one of the few assassins who survived the Tigers, corrupt eunuch templars headed by a certain Zhan Yong. All after being trained by Ezio Auditore and receiving an ancient artifact as a gift. We have thoroughly analyzed Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China, the first of the three spin-offs of the Ubisoft saga Xbox One goals Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China provides the canonical 1000 points, half of which is obtained naturally by finishing the title. The other points are related to the completion of side missions, 100% memories and some specific conditions, such as finishing sequence 11 without being seen. Probably the most difficult goal to complete, for a title that can be classified among the ~easy~ ones in terms of points for your gamertag. Honor and ardor The events of China revolve around revenge and the recovery of this ancient artifact, with the protagonist who initially lets herself be captured in order to face Yong's lieutenants until the decisive battle. Meanwhile there are some dialogues made in a style reminiscent of watercolors, which delve into the events of the protagonist and do not hesitate to make references especially to the second ~regular~ chapter of the series. The same style distinguishes the actual game, which offers two-dimensional mechanics within three-dimensional levels that allow you to move to different levels, giving depth to the setting. Perhaps precisely because of these mechanics, the developer Climax preferred to use the Unreal Engine instead of the excellent UbiArt, with a generally good result in technical and stylistic terms: in reality, not all levels enjoy the same visual beauty and attention to the detail, alternating anonymous sections with other well-detailed ones both in the ~interactive~ elements and in the backgrounds. In general, however, the impact is positive, the Ubisoft title has a good personality and there are several glimpses that deserve to be photographed. The imprint of Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China is above all stealth. In the eleven sequences available, the aim is to eliminate specific targets while completing some secondary missions and avoiding the overwhelming vigilance that characterizes the levels. In this regard it is possible to completely circumvent the clashes, assassinating the enemies and taking advantage of the available shelters, or face them with cold weapons, it being understood that the toughest ones shoot from a distance, have impenetrable shields and there are areas in which the enemy is impossible to overcome. Each opponent has a field of vision clearly indicated on the screen: as soon as they are identified, you have a few moments before triggering the alarm, at which point the nearby guards begin to chase you and scan every corner, with the best solution being to hide or start over the section according to the classic ~trial and error~ formula, accentuated or not according to the level. In the sample of moves available to Shao Jun we have the predictable assassinations from ledges or from behind, the sword to parry and attack, kills from above, in flight or in sliding. If that's not enough, there are four types of gadgets available, ranging from whistles to firecrackers, through knives that make noise, which can direct opponents towards a point away from their position. The difficulty curve is rather soft: little by little they comeo introduced opponents who are more resistant or who need more elaborate strategies to be avoided and overwhelmed; based on the end-of-level score, power-ups such as energy and increased capacity are obtained, while the main moves are learned naturally. In general it is possible to avoid any clash, as underlined by some specific objectives, but in certain situations it is preferable to fight the enemies at a distance, or to assassinate them to have a free field. The artificial intelligence is rather scholastic, but precisely because we are faced with a title with two-dimensional dynamics, we have not identified blunders but not even extremely satisfactory sections where the use of stealth strategies really pays off: there are undoubtedly difficult points in which throwing yourself headlong doesn't pay, but you just need to think a little to easily get the better of it. We finished Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China in just under three hours; once the game is finished it is possible to restart keeping all the skills unlocked and in difficult mode. We would have liked this degree of challenge right away, since having only one energy bar available, we are more inclined to face the game in stealth mode. As mentioned, there are some secondary and collectible objectives to collect that reward a less linear structure than initially thought; there are also sync points to reveal the map and the iconic Leap of Faith, which is one of the many references to the main saga present in the game. The reference that was most liked, in reality, comes from the musical sector, which in many arrangements takes up the fantastic one of Assassin's Creed 2 and the main theme linked to Ezio: a really nice heart leap for veterans of the saga. In a couple of the eleven sequences available, the formula changes slightly and involves the need to flee quickly while the scenario falls apart, for example due to a fire. At these junctures, the joys and pains of the control system are accentuated. The beginning is in fact unsettling, because this system is calibrated as if it were the one of the series, transported in two dimensions: with the left analog you walk, to run you have to hold down the right trigger, which also works together with A for jumps and the passage from one point of support to another. With X are light attacks, Y are heavy; where with a little practice it is possible to easily execute all the main moves, the response to the commands is not exactly immediate, the hooking is also not very fluid in the chained actions, such as when you have to go from one hiding place to another or climb and then assassinate an enemy consecutively. This is felt more in the escape sequences and therefore affects some of the mechanics that instead have made the fortune of games like Mark of the Ninja, from which China takes its inspiration without unfortunately approaching it in qualitative terms.", "date": "2015-04-21", "grade": "7.0"}
