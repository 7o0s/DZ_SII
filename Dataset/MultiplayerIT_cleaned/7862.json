However, a more reasoned approach was preferred, made up of a part of constant support for the first episode, which over the months has reached the considerable figure of no less than three hundred and fifty levels; on the other hand, a commitment to find new ideas for a sequel that evidently didn't have to be born necessarily, but only when the conditions were there. And so Cut the Rope: Time Travel arrives on the App Store and Google Play, a chapter that offers us various historical settings focusing on the narrative device of time travel, but with an important variant consisting of the ~double~ of the protagonist. In fact, the irresistible little green creature Om Nom meets himself in the various eras, which therefore leads to two mouths to feed to complete each stage and, in fact, modifies the puzzle mechanics that we know well. The initial offer consists of a total of ninety levels distributed within six scenarios: Middle Ages, Renaissance, Pirate Ship, Ancient Egypt, Classical Greece and Stone Age. Others will be added to these through the inevitable updates of the application, and in the same way it will be possible to access entertaining animated shorts. Double snack Anyone who has tried the first Cut the Rope knows well what our goal is in each level: to make the protagonist eat the sweet that is in the scenario. To complete this operation, it is often necessary to do some reasoning and some tests, because the trick is connected to a system of ropes that we can cut but which are influenced by a physical context and therefore are subject to various forces, whether it is simple inertia or a quick spring snap. The point is precisely to find the right system every time, while trying to make sure that the bonbon comes into contact with three stars before reaching Om Nom's jaws to improve our overall performance. In Cut the Rope: Time Travel, as already mentioned, the gameplay ~doubles~ due to the presence of two characters instead of one and, therefore, of two sweets to be sent to their destination. Sometimes this is achieved in a very simple way, but in certain cases it is necessary to combine the puzzle elements with perfect timing, for example to cut the rope to which the object of interest is attached when it swings towards one of the protagonists. Each scenario introduces additional variables, some already familiar to fans of the original Cut the Rope and others never seen before, such as rockets or wings. In short, the situations manage to be fairly original and to renew interest in mechanics that the developers had extensively explored with the first chapter. The only drawback of this production perhaps lies in a slightly lower degree of difficulty than what we were used to, which leads to completing the initial offer in a short time, but we are comforted by the idea of updates already in the pipeline and a support post-launch that will hardly disappoint our expectations. For the rest, the touch control system once again proves to be almost perfect, responsive and reliable, while the technical sector can count on a funny and effective design, very colorful, strong in very pleasant nuances.", "date": "2013-05-01", "grade": "8.5"}
