The debut on old generation consoles with the subsequent arrival on the current ones had left us with more shadows than lights, both in terms of modalities and for the handling of the motorcycles, too much the same despite the changes in terrain between one circuit and another. We announce that in these years of work the Milanese software house has managed to put a patch on both of these weaknesses, mostly listening to the requests of the fans but keeping others intact by now atavistic, hard to die. Positioned the bike at the starting gate, we then pressed the clutch, put the weight on the front end and gave the gas to the hammer, elbowing like crazy to get in front of the first corner. Milestone takes us back to the mud with MXGP2 with an improved driving model and lots of content Back in the saddle Although the experience packaged by Milestone is not purely simulative, the first impact with the track is not as easy as one might expect due to the peculiarities of the discipline under examination: getting used to rough and uneven tracks, designed on a constant alternation of bumps, jumps, hairpin bends that put the player's skills to the test, it is not immediate. The driving model is not particularly refined, but represents a further evolution of the PlayStation 4 version of the first chapter, improved in some very important aspects. The most pronounced innovative thrust comes from the very welcome introduction of the clutch, which adds further depth to the gaming experience by changing the cards on the table in different situations: in addition to the already mentioned use at the start, dosing it sparingly allows you to keep the engine revs high and have nice acceleration out of corners and during jump sequences, but it takes very little to end up on your butt when you take the physics to the maximum level of realism. It is also necessary to manage the rider's weight, which is essential for regulating the angle of the motorcycle in mid-air, seeking to land parallel to the ground in order to unleash all the horsepower of the engine with maximum efficiency. The scrub, a typical motocross maneuver that allows pilots to cut the jump to decrease flight time, is always delegated to the use of both analog sticks, but is less guided than in the past edition: in MXGP 2 it is possible set the whip before taking the wheels off the ground and have better control over the trajectory, adapting it to the amplitude of the jump. In this sense, the handling of the pilot in the air during normal jumps and bump sequences could be more reactive and landings are sometimes not convincing, above all due to an unsatisfactory dynamics of collisions with the ground which is confirmed as a lasting shortcoming of the series . The same also afflicts the pilots in the race, who elbow like madmen entering treatment sometimes ending up on the ground, other times maintaining the trajectory as if they hadn't even been touched. A step forward has also been made in the management of the ruts on the ground which affect the handling of the motorcycles as the revs go by, forcing the riders to rethink the cornering approach to gain some speed. The bike tends to break down if we ride off the trajectory, but avoid violent jolts and sudden changes of direction. The result is less effective than we expected, but since it's a game that doesn't aim for hard and pure simulation, exaggerating on this front would have led to excessive frustration, especially on a four-stroke bike that is already very difficult to tame . Playstation 4 trophies MXGP 2 offers 42 trophies to be conquered by victories in all the tracks available in the title. The promotion from MX2 to MXGP and the victory of the championship complete a picture that also reserves some trophies dedicated to online modes. The 3 gold, 14 silver and 24 bronze trophies, to which the inevitable Platinum is added, don't seem impossible to conquer, provided you dedicate a lot of time to them. A complete package Lap after lap the learning curve is getting lighter, but to fully enjoy the driving model and learn its secrets, tackling the Career mode is probably the best starting point given the absence of an adequate tutorial which is limited only to a handful of videos. As in any self-respecting racing game, also in this case we will begin our adventure in the motocross with a couple of wild card races in hopes of impressing the factory MX2 teams and getting them to offer us their first contract. Experiencing a championship in the second category with less powerful and more manageable bikes has allowed us to refine the technique and have a first contact with all the 18 official circuits of the 2015 world championship, from the night time of Losail to the insidious ups and downs of Maggiora, testing all types of land and competing with 22 other riders on the track. In this sense it is necessary to specify that the license is that of last year so we have found in the ranks of the now retired Ryan Villopoto riders, while Tim Gajser is still in MX2. Overall, the Career proved to be quite engaging and rich in content, especially for the introduction of motorcycle upgrades to be purchased by spending the credits earned on the track based on the achievement of the objectives set by the sponsors and the placement in the general classification. With a system very similar to that of Ride, it is possible to improve suspensions, brake discs and exhaust which guarantee performance increases to our motorcycle, while other options concern only the aesthetics of the vehicle and of our virtual alter ego to which helmet, boots and masks from the most popular manufacturers to personalize it properly. Honda, Kawasaki, KTM, Suzuki, Yamaha and Husqvarna will soon battle to sign us and it won't take long to get to compete shoulder to shoulder with the legend Cairoli and the French champion Fabvre. In addition to the Career, Milestone's work is completed with the Motocross of Nations, a challenge between teams of riders of the same nationality that allowed us to get on the track in the exclusive Erne circuit in France created specifically for the event. There are also the Stadium Series, highly adrenaline-pumping indoor events to be run on narrow and winding tracks, and the Real Events, a series of challenges that catapult us into real-life scenarios with specific objectives to be completed. To these are added the Single Races and the Time Challenges for a package that has marked a substantial step forward in terms of variety of content compared to the past. As for the multiplayer, having not been able to test the stability of the servers by hand, we can only wish for an optimal debut, devoid of the numerous problems that had afflicted the first chapter. On the technical front, the Milestone engine remains the same as Sebastian Loeb Rally Evo, here a little cleaner due to the limited dimensions of the tracks. The general impact of the image is more than satisfactory starting from the creation of riders and motorcycles, up to the locations, all well characterized. Outline elements such as the public, vehicles and structures on the side of the track still leave something to be desired, but the fluttering of the centaurs' jacket as well as the overalls which gradually become covered in mud satisfy the view. The only flaws are some sporadic drop in framerate at the start and an audio sector that is too flat.", "date": "2016-04-06", "grade": "7.5"}
