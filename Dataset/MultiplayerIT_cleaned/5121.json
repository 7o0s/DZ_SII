These are huge drifting space wrecks, full of secrets and pitfalls. When the Deathwings, the first company of the Dark Angels, encounter one of them, the psychic Space Marines sense that inside is hidden something extraordinarily valuable to the Imperium. Thus a small expedition is organized which will have the task of exploring the abandoned station, finding the bodies of the soldiers who controlled it and investigating the load they were carrying. In the heavy armor of a Librarian, accompanied by an Apothecary and an Assault unit, we will therefore have to enter the Space Hulk, walk its long and dark corridors, survive the multiple hordes of Genestealers hiding in the walls of the structure and find out why this wreck is so important. All in the context of a campaign to be played in single player or cooperatively with three other users, characterized by a story written in collaboration with Gavin Thorpe, a name certainly not new to Warhammer 40,000 fans. Space Hulk: Deathwing is a title extremely faithful to the franchise, hard and complex, full of atmosphere Loyal to the Imperium The first thing that strikes you about Space Hulk: Deathwing is the absolute fidelity to the dynamics of the board game from which it is taken. In the board game, the Space Marines had to explore a wreck, access rooms full of hostile creatures, complete the turn objective and finally proceed towards an extraction area, which is exactly what they are asked to do during the nine missions that make up the campaign of the Streum On Studio title. It is a fundamentally simple and inherently repetitive structure if we compare it to that of any other shooter, but one that will not fail to involve and exalt the fans of the Games Workshop franchise. The degree of challenge of the experience is in fact quite high, which creates a certain tension when you enter a new area of the station without knowing what will come out of the air ducts and when. The medical unit has a set of medkits to be distributed among team members, but the number of ~injections~ must be managed wisely so as not to run out of energy at the climax. From this point of view, the game is almost a survival game and often requires a double attempt for each mission, given the enormous amount of enemies to face and the distance that must be covered to reach the objectives indicated from time to time on the map. In short, there's a great atmosphere and ~Aliens - Final Clash~-style situations are the order of the day, see also the scanner that signals the direction from which the hostile activity is coming; but precisely because of these factors it becomes so complex to complete a mission as the last survivors of the team, or simply without the Apothecary and its cures, that at that point we have to take the risk of opening a portal (we have few available and we need several seconds for it to activate) and return to the hub, restoring fallen companions, or start the level over. An undoubtedly frustrating eventuality, especially if the final stages of the stage have now been reached, but which proves to be inevitable when we have suffered damage and a close encounter with one or more Broodlords is on the horizon. Who told you to die? It is a pity that the survival approach chosen by the developers for Space Hulk: Deathwing has not also been extended to the available resources and perhaps to the upgrade system: the latter allows, by spending the points earned in battle, to amplify the Librarian's psychic abilities that we control in the game, allowing him to unleash powerful attacks that electrify, defeat or burn enemies, and which require a cooldown period to be reused; or to improve the tactical skills of the team, which will move more intelligently and make better use of the position; or even to speed up the control of the Space Hulk's systems, see for example the hacking of the fearsome turrets that guard certain areas. The ammunition of the weapons is infinite: a choice that clashes with the hardcore interpretation of the experience, but which is more than understandable if we think of the general degree of difficulty of the campaign and the limited number of medkits. That said, the combat system appears solid and multifaceted: as you progress through the levels it is possible to unlock new equipment and change the setup of each unit before being teleported to the wreck, taking up weapons with very different renderings: pistols, light machine guns, Powerful but inaccurate Gatlings, flamethrowers, plasma cannons fromvariable fire rate, or melee tools like the lightning claws, thunder hammer, or absolution mace. Depending on your selection, as in the recent Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide, you can get a setup that is ideal for ranged or close quarters engagements. For example, by holding a plasma cannon, excellent in power although slow in reloading, we will be able to fire with the right trigger and use the iron mallet or the flaming sword with the left trigger. The possibility of using the left backbone to parry any attacks makes the system developed by the developers multifaceted and coherent, which in this way allows our characters to respond blow by blow and avoid unnecessary damage. The physicality of the fights is not at the level of Dishonored (to make a comparison with a title that uses a similar approach, with attack and parry on the same ~side~ in terms of layout), but it is satisfactory. In the same way, the possibility of zooming in which highlights the opponents' heat allows you to open fire even from a long distance, when the Genestealers and hybrids (the latter armed with machine guns or rocket launchers, therefore very dangerous) are still unaware of our presence. Side by side Space Hulk: Deathwing includes a cooperative multiplayer mode for four players that in many ways takes the mechanics of Left 4 Dead. Having selected a game from those listed, set in one of the nine levels of the campaign, we will be able to choose our class from five possibilities and support the team by covering the backs of our teammates, or perhaps healing their wounds if we decide to take on the role of the medical unit . During our tests we have not encountered problems with the online, moreover fairly populated, although the default setting that resets the progress with each new game in relation to the equipment appears useless: it is better to unlock everything immediately to have more choice. Played in company, the Streum On Studio title changes its face: the survival dynamics become decidedly less marked and walking the long corridors of the Space Hulk without being alone is more fun, dampening the frustration that often accompanies the inevitable backtracking. An ideal situation could be that of four friends passionate about Warhammer 40,000 who organize themselves to complete the campaign together, perhaps on the highest difficulty level: a daunting task, which you can only complete by fighting with the furious determination that befits a Dark Angel! Cross and delight The picture painted so far for Space Hulk: Deathwing is undoubtedly positive: we are talking about a title that is extraordinarily faithful to the franchise from which it is taken, capable of creating a great atmosphere and generating genuine tension while exploring the narrow locations of a tough and ruthless, which takes about ten hours to complete. The developers have drawn on the assets of Warhammer 40,000, delivering us a credible Space Hulk, at times disturbing, extremely vast and full of dangers that can come from any direction. Structurally simple, peppered with situations in which a switch is activated and then faced with various waves of enemies, the game largely justifies an artificial intelligence of the creatures that is sometimes scarce: it stands to reason that the only purpose of the Genestealers is to reach us and hit us, so like the ability of the hybrids to take cover between one shot and another, but it sometimes happens that the opponents move away inexplicably, losing interest in the fight and making it easier for us to eliminate them. The progress compared to the controversial EYE: Divine Cybermancy are still substantial from all points of view, although there are aspects of the experience that are still angular, which need a simplification work, first of all an interface that at first appears a bit too chaotic and a couple of glitches to fix (psychic powers setup resets from time to time...). The support for the controller is unfortunately partial: it is not possible to invert the Y axis and navigating the menus is problematic to say the least, so while waiting for an update you have to compromise or use the mouse and keyboard, which playing on the sofa in front to TV may not be super simple (and it wasn't, in fact). Strange lack for a title that will also arrive on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in the coming months. In terms of technical implementation, it was decided to sacrifice the music in favor of the atmosphere, while the graphics move between ups and downs: the representation of the wreck is excellent and a good job has been done with thelighting, essential for such an experience, but many other aspects appear a bit dated, from effects to polygonal models. The intermittent flash of the assault cannon is annoying (be careful if you have photosensitivity-related disorders!) But in general the yield of the weapons is good and the enemies are pulped like a pleasure, leaving us to walk in a sea of blood and limbs. The performance, however, does not shine: to be a title powered by Unreal Engine 4, Space Hulk: Deathwing proves to be too heavy, putting some configurations in difficulty. In our case, with an i5 6600K and a GTX 1070, we played at 1440p with everything maxed out getting 60 frames per second, but there are situations where inexplicably drops in fluidity occur and this should be fixed with a certain urgency.", "date": "2016-12-18", "grade": "8.0"}
