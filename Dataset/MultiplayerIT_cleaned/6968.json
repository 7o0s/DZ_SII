Aware of his desire to abstract himself from the fight of the GaaS looter shooters, the People Can Fly game was however not really able to steal the show from all the more or less direct competitors. This despite the development team's pedigree and a series of certainly interesting but not exactly revolutionary gimmicks. After the infinite number of server problems, several months of life strongly anchored to the distribution through Xbox Game Pass and an important free update like New Horizon, here the guys from People Can Fly try to drop the ace with the first real expansion of Outriders: Worldslayer<.After having told you most of its aspects and news with the previous one tested; and following the endgame speculation last month, we're ready to tell you what we think in this Outriders Worldslayer review. Avoiding dwelling too much on the known additions and trying to figure out if the project still has a future. It's time to dive into the darkest areas of Enoch and his devastating past. Searching for the Citadel Outriders Worldslayer - Tarya Gratar awaits you Worldslayer picks up right where we left off. Enoch is a slightly less unknown place, but still far from the Promised Land to which we have traveled so far into the nothingness of Space. The Anomaly is always there, one step away from us and while we ideally continue to recover dozens and dozens of pods from the atmosphere through expeditions, it's the storms that really worry us. It's because of one of these that Ereshkigal, the new bad girl on duty taken over by any Starcraft, she feels compelled to unload her pains and the recently acquired powers to move her handful of rebels against the Outriders. The new opponent also manages to carve out two or three interesting moments, but what leaves much to be desired is the feeling of haste and little depth that lives inherent in the Worldslayer narrative. It is no coincidence that the campaign of the new expansion can be completed easily in four hours, which can go up or down slightly based on the difficulty set and secondary tasks completed. Don't get us wrong: we never expected a campaign with a duration approaching that of the base game, but there is a constant feeling that everything smells like a missed opportunity. We are still talking about a development team that thinks about the substance and tends to give a damn about the motivations, but then why work so hard on building a story and characters that are not then exploited? And we assure you that from the point of view of stimuli Outriders Wordslayer is not joking. Unfortunately everything runs away, in an indecipherable time and with a conclusion that really leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, as well as opening more doors than it closes. The discovery is up to you! Change, never to change Outriders Worldslayer - lots of new loot We've said it over and over again: Outriders is fun. This is an aspect that could hardly change for the worse. The development team is one of the spearheads of TPS in the world and never lacks the ability to always find some new idea to stand out from the crowd. Despite this Outriders has not managed to really make inroads in the players, however carving out a rather substantial and loyal slice of fans. In the light of this new expansion, published as the first paid content after its release, at the (not) modest sum of 40, it was reasonable to expect something more from People Can Fly. The reality appears slightly different. Yes, because it is difficult to argue against a title that makes the solidity of its gameplay a stylistic figure that for many players could already be sufficient in itself. So where does this feeling of general dissatisfaction come from? We've played and replayed Worldslayer. Wasted time in his bizarre menus. Faced new threats and conquered the ruins of Tarya Gratar. Only at the end of many ruminations did we then understand: the point is that nothing has changed and therefore perhaps we are the first to be a little tired of the constant reiteration of a fun gameplay, but always the same. A series of mechanics that in this expansion do not bring any real changes. Outriders Worldslayer - no shortage of new bosses Pax points are nothing more than a way to disguise new skill points - moreover scripted and assigned at specific moments in history. The apocalypse levels don't change much compared to the previous ones, if not the obvious need to stretch the growth and the artificial longe even furtherlife of the title. The progression in the new maps is, if possible, even more linear than the base game. Long, narrow corridors leading from one horde to another. Few deviations, few stimuli, only lead on lead. This is the sensation that has made its way inside us over the course of the hours, immutable and inexorable. We were having fun, but we already knew everything. Shortly thereafter, however, the only real novelty also revealed itself to us. And the latter is far from being represented by many new weapons and armor which then shoot at the end like all the others and have the same seven perks. What changed our vision of things for the better was the new endgame : Tarya Gratar. On the other hand, the expeditions that represented the final phase of the game for the entire first year lacked precisely in the idea and in the placement. The trials of Tarya Gratar do not deviate from the concept, but assimilate and reimagine it, inserting everything in a narrative timeline that is also the background to the ending of Worldslayer. Tarya Gratar Outriders Worldslayer - Enoch is increasingly hostile Playing the Worldslayer endgame means finding yourself catapulted to the origin of the Pax and their architectures. The citadel is nothing more than a gigantic dungeon made up of tests different from each other in terms of type, location and rewards, but all united by the need to kill and advance to the next room. To progress the dungeon it is necessary to choose a path and complete one or more of the different tests that are placed before us. Whether it's waves, simple progression mechanics or an actual boss, the feeling is that the Polish team has somehow tried to re-imagine the conclusion of the journey as a kind of particular third-person roguelite. This element, given by the randomness of events and enemies, obviously also increases its replayability: a fundamental element for a title that will have to make this expansion last over the months, waiting to find out in which direction the project will move. of the tests it will be possible to recover the best loot, as well as have some last and interesting answers to the connection between the human race and Enoch, in an ending that really smells like Destiny for how it is staged and for the language that follows. Always and in any case remaining far from that overall quality of writing and artistic depth.", "date": "2022-07-04", "grade": "7.8"}
