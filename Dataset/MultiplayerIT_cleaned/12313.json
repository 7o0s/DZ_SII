{"name": "Boom Boom Rocket - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/boom-boom-rocket-recensione.html", "text": "Boom Boom Rocket is a music arcade, a cross between the old Dance Dance Revolution, because it's about pressing the keys in sequence with the right timing, Fantavision, for the fires that form the background to the soundtrack, and all those rhythm games like Samba de Amigo or Ouendan, where colors and spectacle are determining factors in entertainment. The aim of the game is to detonate the rockets that are fired into the sky exactly when they reach the top horizontal bar, causing a beautiful explosion of fireworks. You can use the digital cross of the joypad or the keys. The rockets have the shape of an arrow that indicates the direction to be given to the directional, or the color of the buttons, and once they arrive on the bar, if pressed with the right timing, they explode and an inscription appears that judges the precision of our reflexes , from a generic OK up to the maximum rating, Perfect. Unlike Guitar Hero, however, an option is missing here to adjust response times taking into account the latency due to LCD screens and in a game where precision is everything, it makes itself felt. The graphic component is reduced to the bone, but it is certainly not the fundamental thing for this kind of game. In the background there is a city, a large brilliant and glittering megalopolis with its thousand night lights, illuminated buildings, streets crowded with cars and the darkness that enhances the beauty of the fire exploding in the sky. The camera roams free as we set off our fireworks to the music, showing every side of the setting. The technical realization is very simple and essential, as indeed it was at the time Fantavision on Playstation 2. The aim of the game is to detonate the rockets that are fired into the sky exactly when they reach the horizontal bar high up in the sky Initially the soundtrack consists of ten songs, each of which can be performed in three modes, from the simplest to the most difficult. However, completing one of them at the maximum level does not unlock the objectives of the lower difficulties, so the three modes must be played all if we want to get the most out of this profile. Boom Boom Rocket is as simple in idea as it is immediate to play, for everyone, even those who have never had experience with this kind of game. Unlike the good old Geometry Wars, however, in this new title the sense of progression that one should have by improving one's skills is much less marked. The difficulty level is immediately calibrated according to our choice and the goal is therefore to complete all the songs in all modes. There is also an option called marathon in which the pace increases over time until it becomes pure and simple brain training: the fingers are gradually less and less important and mental concentration becomes fundamental when the ~beat~ reaches 200 shots, keeping time and pressing with the right timing becomes a bargain for a few, and the online ranking will be there to testify it. When the brain whisks too much, or too little. By creating another profile on the Xbox 360 it is possible to bring a friend of ours into the game, live. The fireworks double and the frenzy multiplies too. Too bad for the non-implementation of online challenges, they would certainly have helped the longevity of the game. Browsing through the menu, a nice training option appears, useful for refining the capabilities of our reflexes and fingertips, followed by a freestyle mode, in which simply no bar appears to indicate when to press: in this way we are free to explode the rockets as we want. It is mostly a pastime to switch off the brain and enjoy the fireworks display, without thinking about scores, ratings and rankings. But if we want to disconnect even more, if we really don't want to do anything at all, Bizarre has thought of us, lovers of beers and armchairs: by selecting ~viewer~ you can access the Xbox 360 Hard Disk directly, choose a song and we enjoy it accompanied by the graphics of the game with bows bursting rhythmically, just like a new plug-in for the console's media player. The tracklist, a very important pawn for a musical game, is reduced to the bone with only 10 songs, all rearranged and remixed re-editions of classics such as William Tell, Carmen, the Cavalcade of the Valkyries and others. The genre is a sinto-pop that suits the game but is conspicuously lacking in personality and verve. Moreover, quite serious, skill, dexterity and timing do not affect the rhythm or musicality in any way, as happens in Guitar Hero and the like. Sin in the musical side, for a titlelo of this type, is mortal. Goals 360 Like any title downloadable from the Live Arcade, BBR is also giving away 200 points, instead of the canonical 1000. Some objectives are linked to the single player mode, and are the ones that are conquered faster by completing the songs in every mode and every difficulty. Others are objectives related to particular combos or events to unlock. In Boom Boom Rocket there are many achievements to obtain, all quite easy but for the most part they only give 5 or 10 points. Comment Boom Boom Rocket is one of the most anticipated titles of this spring of the Live Arcade, the second work of the guys who created that pearl of Geometry Wars. For this reason, the high expectation had to repay the players equally generously, but the new Bizarre title in the end turns out to be little more than enough precisely because of the flaws in fundamental aspects for the genre, the musical one. The selection has no bite, the tracks don't have that personality that is required in these games and on top of that they are also very few. The lack of online multiplayer is inexplicable for a Live Arcade game. Immediate, even fun, but not as perfect as expected. Pros: Immediate and fun, for a while Marathon mode Cons: Bare and unsatisfying tracklist No online multiplayer No interaction with music Legend has it that during breaks in the development of Project Gotham 3 on Xbox360, Bizarre Creation employees enjoyed themselves in the office with a simple and immediate game played in their spare time, almost as a joke. The same title that some time later was then adored and downloaded by thousands and thousands of people, that frenetic and damned fun Geometry Wars which soon became a pleasant obsession for many Live Arcade users. The talent of the Bizarre was already known, but no one would have ever expected an old-fashioned arcade of that thickness: this is why Boom Boom Rocket, the second son arriving on the Microsoft digital delivery service, is today one of the most anticipated games of the 'entire spring XBLA. It's finally been available for a few days, at a cost of 800 Ms Points.", "date": "2007-05-04", "grade": null}
