In recent days we had the opportunity to review the PC version which, thanks to the latest generation hardware, showed itself with a high-impact technical / visual appearance. Unfortunately the same thing cannot be said for that console which, as we will see in the review of Cyberpunk 2077 in the PS4 version, presented itself at the starting gates in a disastrous way. There are really no other words to describe an experience bordering on unplayable on base consoles and far below the promises for mid-gen (we tested the game on both PS4 and PS4 Pro). CD Projekt has already confirmed that these ~old gen~ versions will also be supported and improved over time, obviously we will not fail to follow these developments; however, it remains undeniable that at the moment it is a product well below our expectations. A technical catastrophe The PC review highlighted the many merits and minor defects, AI deficient aside, of a game developed with this platform as the main reference. Here we will instead deal with the PS4 and PS4 Pro version of Cyberpunk 2077, which as you can imagine or have personally experienced is something completely different, and not in a positive way: it fails to reach even the lowest standard of technical quality that one would expect. it should wait even when playing on hardware with its years behind it. It performs so badly that it makes driving, combat, and what is otherwise a great game hard to watch - it's no exaggeration to talk about frame rates so unstable that it feels like watching a continuously buffered video.With patch 1.0 .2 the drop even reached 10fps and although the following 1.0.4 seemed to have fixed things, that little difference is however overshadowed by the crashes and bugs that affect the experience to the point of forcing you to frequently reload the game, or even shutting down the game in the hope that they will be resolved. An attempt is not an act, they say, and right now the patches put up by CD Projekt Red don't even reflect this effort. Base PS4 is in no way able to maintain frame rate stability, which improves on the Pro version but still takes significant steps backwards while driving, in the open world and in frenetic firefights. On base PS4 there is such a delay in the actions that enemies react to our shots after a few seconds, making it impossible to determine the progress of a shootout or even just to manage it in the best possible way. Regarding the resolution, we discussed it in the technical analysis article, we have dynamic 900p on a base, which often settles on 720p, and dynamic 1188p as usual more tending to sag on 972p. Despite this, as things stand right now we're always faced with a performance hit, and while we've slightly adjusted stability with the 1.0.4 patch, the price was an extended texture loading time - basically, yes they see many characters with polygonal faces as in the best Picasso in three dimensions. It can be worse, however, as in some cases NPCs are doomed to remain in their geometric cocoon and environmental textures won't appear even if you turn off effects like film grain and motion blur. We are only dealing with a part, albeit an important one, of the problems of Cyberpunk 2077 on PS4. A couple of paragraphs further on we mentioned the bugs and how their presence also comes to torment the gaming experience already marred by everything else: you can expect everything from understandable and in a certain sense amusing ones such as weapons and telephones that float in the air or characters who walk in the void with all the nonchalance in the world, to others decidedly more annoying that often go against your progression. We are talking about fundamental characters to continue with a mission - yes, even the main one - of which, however, no trace is found, actions made impossible because the selected weapon is not shown despite the fact that V's hands are seen in the act of holding it. Commands like taking cover inside the car during a firefight that don't work and make us a perfect sponge for anyone who wants to do some target practice. And again, characters who play hide and seek with collisions, getting stuck somewhere so as not to get out again and once again hinder us in our intentions. Invisible clothes as well as weapons, which are not displayed on V although in the equipment menu they are considered. Not to mention the annoying pop ups which no, patch 1.0.4 doesn't fix at all. Non it will be necessary to advance a lot to see Cyberpunk 2077 in its true light. Or rather, to notice all those shadows that have been hidden in the marketing campaign: from the very first steps in what should be the city of the future, videogame speaking, Night City presents itself with a low traffic and population density. If on PC you had the feeling of a metropolis that was not empty but still less crowded than you might have expected, a look at the console version will let you keep your observations for yourself. In addition to being self-evident, it is also noticeable by the means used to not burden performance, undermining the immersion. Beyond removing the effects of explosions, weapons or even just smoke, the excessive multiplication of the few passersby to avoid as much as possible showing too many different models. Let's take the example of night clubs, rather crowded places par excellence between strippers and the public: in this case they are hardly filled by any characters, who give the idea of being there just to decorate. In this sense, Night City has a very strong setback in its ability to immerse the player, who will have a sense of disconnection on many occasions. Cyberpunk 2077 is not just about graphics, we agree, but a huge part of its fun comes from its atmosphere and attention to detail that deserves to be shown to pay homage to Night City and the adventures that can be experienced there. some visual roughness by virtue of the fact that it is still running on an old console like the basic PS4 (the Pro version is a little less justified) and it is not even to think of having the same quality as on PC, however we cannot do it for everyone the technical problems affecting the game. Put more succinctly, we would have accepted to play it at a low level of detail if the performances had proven to be stable: this is not the case and we can do nothing but report its shortcomings. Cyberpunk 2077 on PS4 is broken. Gameplay and storytelling We will devote a little less space to these two aspects because everything has already been expressed in the PC review. Cyberpunk 2077 is a mammoth game, in terms of spaces and activities, and its Night City is the melting pot par excellence with all its design influences taken as much from the West as from the East in the creation of a dystopian city. We would like to say alive but it would not be entirely accurate, given the low density of NPCs, however it cannot be denied that especially at night it is a potential show for the eyes with all those neon lights that seem to want to show the true face of the city, what is hidden during the day. The activities to do are as many as the ways to approach them and our or our V are the extension of ourselves, although not as we would have expected from the premises developed in recent years: we are not faced with an empty character to fill, but to one already characterally formed, whose path is quite influenced by the lifestyle we decide at the beginning but who basically perceives himself as a Geralt of the future. That is, precisely, a protagonist with his own character and his own personality that we will be able to swing between the two poles of black and white. On the one hand, this is in favor of voice acting, which is very rare for a first-person RPG, on the other hand, it presents an already well-established character whose future is left in our hands. From a narrative point of view, CD Projekt Red has memorable storyline and shown to care about the characters created by Pondsmith, making Cyberpunk 2077 the natural extension of the paper RPG. The main mission is treated in detail, as well as many of the secondary ones, however we could not help but notice an important stain that makes this aspect dirty in general, namely the management of the narrative: in other words, a level is missing of adaptability based on our actions. Taking the example of Red Dead Redemption 2, throughout the game we are faced with potential lines of dialogue in relation to what we have done before tackling a given mission. There aren't many variables, certainly it wouldn't be possible to take into account every possible nuance, but they still change the trend by taking into account the previous actions. The game remembers what we have done in the world, making us feel part of it. Something that does not happen in Cyberpunk 2077, on the contrary, it goes in the opposite direction in a rather brutal way: certain characters behave assuming that certain missions or actions have already been done, when in reality this is not the case, and this creates a very strong sense of detachment with the narraction. It deprives the player of an immersion which is everything, for a title of this magnitude, and it is a misstep due both to the desire to put too much stuff in to be able to manage it properly, and to the fact of making missions accessible immediately logically they should be unlocked gradually. As for what you can actively do, be it side missions, occasional events, finding the perfect equipment, firefights, why yes, customizing V through grafts, everything is somehow hampered by the quality of the artificial intelligence that dances between the too omniscient and lethargy: in some cases the NPCs know perfectly where we are without having the opportunity to understand it, while in others they turn out to be too blind and deaf. We go from the ability to detect the player when he would be theoretically invisible or to total impassivity despite having just killed a companion two meters away. The situation does not improve during the combat phases, which could even turn out to be comical if it weren't so annoying: there have been times when the AI crashed and the enemies remained stationary in spite of the bullets that hit them, or a situation in which a whole group of five or six crowds in the corridor without crossing the threshold that separates them from the player. Tragi-comic situations which, again, undermine the immersion especially when they occur against the bosses, who out of the blue turn into passive amoebas ready to welcome any blow aimed at them without batting an eyelid.", "date": "2020-12-15", "grade": "4.5"}
