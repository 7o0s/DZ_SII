{"name": "La Bussola d'Oro - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-bussola-doro-recensione.html", "text": "Xbox 360 - Goals It is certainly not the difficulty that constitutes a brake to get all 1000 points up for grabs, the real problem is getting to play the SEGA title. After several hours of adventure you will have obtained only a few points and at least 5/6 will be needed to recover most of them. Our advice is to let your child play and thus enjoy the achievements effortlessly. Comment The Golden Compass proved to be yet another video game developed for the sole purpose of exploiting the official license of the film, its advertising drive and why not in this case also the pre-Christmas release. The SEGA game leaves no room for doubts about its quality, a certainly insufficient product, with some interesting ideas but very repetitive and banal in its essence. From a technical point of view we are not in the presence of a level product, also in this case everything is decidedly approximate. Yet another missed opportunity. Pros A children's adventure For movie lovers Cons Too easy Technically just enough The Golden Compass is available for Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii, PC, PSP, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The version tested is for Xbox 360. Storylines The SEGA game re-proposes the events of the film as they are, we will find ourselves in the role of Lyra, a little girl who grew up in Jordan College, Oxford dealing with a story much bigger than her. It's not the Oxford we know, but it's a sort of fantastic city, a setting that seems to be from the 19th century but in which several extraordinary elements are inserted. Each person lives in contact with his daimon, a life partner with the appearance of an animal. Obviously Lyra also has her own, a funny ermine named Pantalaimon, Pan for friends, who will follow her during her adventure and will be a real help for the little girl. The quiet of Oxford will be upset by strange events and mysterious kidnappings, it will only be up to us to find out who the Gobblers are and what happens to the missing children. We will be placed under the guidance of the mysterious Mrs. Coulter, Nicole Kidman in the film, and our deeds will move among the arctic ice where we will meet our second faithful companion, the armored bear Iorek. We will not go further with the plot, we only remind you that before leaving Oxford college we will be given the alethiometer, the Golden Compass, a tool that will serve us to reveal the different puzzles that we will meet on our way. This action adventure begins with an entire level set in the ice of the Pole, in which on horseback of the fighting bear Iorek we will have to face precipices and ravines without forgetting the hungry wolves and unscrupulous hunters. In the scenes where Iorek comes into play we will take control of him, making him run through the ice and attack his opponents. Nothing extraordinary in all this and indeed all too linear, with a button the big white bear will jump and with another it will launch deadly blows. Once a certain number of attacks have been reached by pressing the B key on the Xbox 360 joypad we will be able to unleash his fury, which is a much more powerful blow. We will be able to increase the bear's armor by collecting the appropriate items and also restore its health with particular herbs. During the course of this scheme we will also learn to exploit the particular abilities of Pan, Lyra's daimon. Pan who is normally an ermine will be able to take on three other different forms that will give him new powers. We will be able to manage these transformations through the directional cross, since a mutation is associated with each direction. As an ermine he will help us explore the playing area by finding the right elements to continue our journey. In the sloth version it will help us to leap into the air and grab objects far from us. Thanks then to its mutation into a hawk we will be able to fly for a short time after a leap and finally as a wild cat we will be able to sprint quickly and climb certain walls. This first level of the game is actually located at the end of the story, we will understand it immediately when once finished and defeated the trivial final boss a voiceover will set the action in Oxford, two months earlier. Here the real adventures of young Lyra will begin, dealing with the disappearance of her friend Roger. The alethiometer Throughout the story in the role of Lyra we will find ourselves facing more than a few bad guys, the hand-to-hand challenges will turn into a sort of quick time event in which by choosing the direction at the right moment to dodge the opponent's attack we will get away with it. More than these ~physical~ encounters, those that allow us to obtain information from the other characters are more frequent. Dialogues with these npc's will be interbroken by simple mini-games, the outcome of which will be reflected in the conversation. The mini-games are absolutely trivial and unfortunately badly calibrated, more than once we will have to redo the entire dialogue for not being able to win one of these challenges, which are repetitive and not very stimulating, without even the possibility of avoiding them, so much so that for get the right information we'll just have to endure. With Lyra we will also participate in competitions of skill and agility such as the race on the roofs of Jordan College, the real problem of these challenges is their very low degree of difficulty, which is almost nil, the action is always very guided and also apparently very large, they are limited, often by invisible and therefore inaccessible walls. The golden compass or alethiometer, if you prefer, as well as giving the title to the film and the game, is the element around which Lyra's events revolve. We will learn to use it to answer questions that will be asked during the adventure. The compass is made up of some hands and 36 symbols, each of which has three different meanings. We will be able to discover the meanings of the elements either through the collection of some luminous spheres while exploring the patterns or through the vision of our Pan in ermine mode. For each question we will be provided with three words, to each word we will have to associate a meaning, for example we will be able to associate the word work with the beehive and the word sin with the apple. Associations are generally taken for granted but sometimes they will make us suffer. Once this is done in the game we will have to concentrate on answering the question, and this will be done by keeping the cursor in the center of the compass thanks to the analog stick and pressing the right keys in sequence. In essence, this game of concentration is meaningless all the work of associating symbols / words as it is very simple to succeed in meditation and therefore formulate the correct answer. Technique? The SEGA title is technically certainly just enough. The ice that we will face with the bear Iorek are quite well recreated as well as the interiors that we will visit with Lyra. Only sufficient are the polygonal models of the characters, with the only exception for the virtual counterpart of Daniel Craig, absolutely identical. The animations are instead of a low level both those of Lyra and Iorek as well as the lighting system of the scene. As we already said, the spaces to explore which at first glance seem infinite are actually very small and the ~invisible walls~ limit our path in practice not allowing us to make mistakes, also in this case the level of difficulty plummets. All eleven levels have been set with a difficulty suitable for a child but nothing more. Longevity is around 7 hours of play and you will certainly not be attracted in any way to redo the adventure over again. The SEGA title is entirely dubbed in Italian and all the cut scenes are taken from the film certainly with a decent quality, but that affects loading times and excessive fragmentation between one level and another. Basically regardless of the hardware on which you run the title developed by Shiny Entertainment you will not be satisfied, unless you go over obvious programming defects.", "date": "2007-12-27", "grade": null}
