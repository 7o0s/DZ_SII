{"name": "Tiger Woods Pga Tour 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiger-woods-pga-tour-2003.html", "text": "News and Improvements Unlike the 2002 version, ~Tiger Woods Pga Tour 2003~ features a perfectly balanced level of difficulty, allowing even less experienced players to face their first tournament opponents. This does not mean that it will be easy to defeat all rivals; we can assure you that, advancing in the various tournaments, to win you will have to unleash all your tenacity and skill. The ~True Swing~ (the exceptional shot control system, already present in the 2002 version) has been improved and further refined and, even if it will take some practice to be able to measure the strength of the launches, you will have the sensation to actually hold the bat. The shots will always be carried out using the analog sticks, being able to decide to shoot straight with various types of effect, increase the power of the shot with the L1 key or giving the effect to the ball with the L2 key. As in the predecessor, in the case of very precise or powerful throws, you will be able to witness scenographic special effects (such as trails of fire caused by excessively strong shots), funny animations (funny or worried facial expressions, comic exultation, etc.) or very particulars (during which perhaps the heartbeat of the character will be heard). This definitely confirmed EA Sports' intention to make its titles ever more spectacular and, even if this clearly goes to the detriment of the real sports simulation, it must be admitted that being able to play a ~slow~ sport like golf in this way is more fun and engaging. The number of courses has significantly increased compared to the previous version, in fact it will be possible to compete on 12 of the most famous golf courses in the world (including Princeville, Poppy Hills, Torrey Pines, Pebble Beach Golf Links, Spyglass Hill, etc.), with the possibility of unlocking three specially invented for the game (with very suggestive scenarios) and with the opportunity to create your own course (even if it is not a real editor, you can combine the 216 holes in the game with each other, even choosing its name and logo). As usual, it will be possible to impersonate many true golf champions (such as Tiger Woods, Ty Tryon, Brad Faxon, Mark Calcavecchia, Jesper Parnevik, etc.) or create new ones, using even bizarre characters as a basis, full of tattoos or dressed in classic scottish kilt. In addition to this, by entering a special menu, it will be possible (and necessary to beat the strongest opponents!) to increase your player's statistics, but to do this you will have to use the money won during the various tournaments. The real gem of the new Tiger Woods, however, is the presence of many game modes, which will ensure you a longevity rarely seen in other Golf games for Consoles. In addition to the usual tournaments played individually, there will be: the two-player mode (for head-to-head challenges with friends), Speed Golf (already seen in the previous version: it is a timed race, where whoever gets to hole with the fewest shots, but who makes the most holes in a given time interval) and the Skill Zone (a sort of game within the game, created to test the accuracy and power of your character, where you will have to face many challenges: for example example, throwing the ball on holes located at various distances or hidden by obstacles, receiving a score based on the accuracy of the shot). The online mode is also very interesting, with which it will be possible to connect to the www.ea.com site to participate in bi-weekly tournaments, where you can challenge the best virtual golfers in the world. Graphics and Sound If you thought the graphics sported in the 2002 version were of the highest level, wait to see what the guys at EA Sports have managed to achieve this time. The polygons on the screen have significantly increased, bringing ~Tiger Woods Pga Tour 2003~ to a graphic level that is nothing short of exceptional. The landscapes appear rich in detail and have been recreated respecting the true proportions of real playing fields. Some of the visual effects are truly mind-blowing, like the mist drifting or the sun filtering through the leaves. The animations of the characters, in addition to being incredibly realistic, change according to the roll made or the result obtained, always managing to reflect the state of mind of the character. Sometimes, moreover, it will be possible to witness shot changes that will give a decidedly television cut to the game, allowing you to follow the launches from different angles and to review the best shots with the replay. As for the sound, the first time you try the game, you will think you have inserted SSX or Freekstyle, because that is the ppresentation that the management of the menus are accompanied by songs in the style of ~Metallica~. Such an ~ebullient~ soundtrack certainly doesn't suit a calm sport like golf, but it makes some sections much more adrenaline-pumping and sparkling. During the matches, however, you will only hear the ball bouncing, the chirping of birds or the sound of the sea, which from time to time will be interrupted by the applause of the public or by the reporters who will comment (unfortunately only in English) some phases of the match. Concluding With Tiger Woods Pga Tour 2003, Electronic Arts proves once again to be one step ahead of the competition, managing to create the best Golf game for Console. The almost impeccable control system, the top-level graphic design and the various game modes make the new EA Sports title a truly suitable product for everyone, both for enthusiasts and for those approaching virtual golf for the first time. Pros Almost perfect control system Graphics and sound at very high levels Many game modes Cons Not always accurate shot control system Not everyone likes golf There's no two without three! Let's face it, even if golf is one of the most fascinating ~elite~ sports, in Italy for various reasons (culture, high costs to practice it, etc.) it has never been widespread. Even in the world of video games it certainly cannot be said that there are many interesting titles dedicated to golf and many of the existing ones have proved to be mediocre and unable to fully satisfy true enthusiasts. With the release of the Tiger Woods series on Ps2, however, Electronic Arts managed to create a very valid alternative for Golf lovers, arriving, with the 2002 version, to earn the title of best Golf game for Console (Everybody Golf is the only, very valid, alternative ndTanzen). Knowing the well-known Canadian Software House, it was to be expected that it would not have been satisfied with this record, in fact, not even a year after the release of ~Tiger Woods Pga Tour 2002~, the 2003 version has arrived. Electronic Arts will it have managed to surpass a title already considered among the best of its kind? The answer is absolutely yes!", "date": "2003-01-19", "grade": null}
