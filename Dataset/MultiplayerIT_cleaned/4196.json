Released three years ago on the market and reached its final version only last year, it was for a long time the most played survival game by Steam users and still today it maintains a very large fan base. After landing on the console, it's now time for a new challenge: being able to carry the same experience on mobile devices as well. We know that you will already be laughing at the thought, we too did it before launching the game, but having to change our mind when a small miracle of programming and cleaning appeared before our eyes. Ark mobile works, and it works pretty well too. You will be called to make some small sacrifices, but we already know that you will not be able to believe your eyes. The charm of the setting There is no doubt that Ark: Survival Evolved is still one of the most fascinating titles of its genre today. The possibility of creating and breeding one's own personal Jurassic park is the gimmick that has decreed its great success already at the time of its release. In a setting full of different biomes and with more than eighty races to interact with, many players have found their favorite pastime, between hunting, building their own base and training the most disparate prehistoric creatures. The mobile version of the Wildcard Studio title is no different and tries, succeeding quite well, to give us back the same sensations experienced with its home version. After creating the character through an extremely small version of the editor that we already know, we are catapulted into a map in which we are asked to complete a few simple tasks. The will of the developers to create an experience that can be enjoyed by everyone, even and above all without the need to be connected to the internet, has merged into a single player that is more articulated than expected. All elements are in place, including character growth, crafting and learning the various recipes. Completing the tasks gives an important amount of experience and, after a few minutes, you will already be able to create your first base. What's really surprising about this mobile version of Ark is the work done in regards to the controls. Survivals are notoriously titles that require the management of a considerable number of resources and interaction with multiple elements. This is why we started the game fearing a lot from this point of view. On the contrary, we were faced with a more than manageable game, with changes made to the interface that go very well with the touch nature of the mobile version. The possibility of pressing more than once on the screen to ensure that the actions last over time, as well as that of exploiting different areas of the device, to carry out different interactions, are all very appreciable elements and denote the desire not to create a simple port hurried on the wave of success. Certainly when things get more intense and you find yourself fighting with aggressive dinosaurs, the possibility of performing one action rather than another is the order of the day. However, this does not affect the general goodness of the work done, on the contrary it highlights how it is evidently possible to make even a title so damn far from a smartphone enjoyable. Once you have completed all the required tasks and reached level twenty, you'll be ready to decide whether to continue your adventure alone, or jump into the online fray together with other players to create a tribe and conquer your own server. We have not had the opportunity to delve into this component, which we will return to later, but the effort to bring the most complete version of the game to the phone is something that certainly deserves praise, regardless of any prejudice. Graphically inconceivable Let's get going right away. Ark, even in its mobile version, is a heavy title and hardly manageable by a phone more than a couple of years old. We played it with an iPhone X and this allowed us to push it to the max and enjoy an incredible technical work. Let's not exaggerate by saying that the look and feel of this ~reduction~ of Ark is hard to believe. Despite a inevitably decreased number of polygons and textures far from the ultra version on PC, the impact on the screen of a smartphone is jaw-breaking and the fluidity with which everything moves is so surprising as to leave you amazed. Seeing a tyrannosaurus of this quality move on your phone leaves you pleasantly surprised, to the point that we often dohe finds himself more looking around and going on a long safari in prehistory rather than thinking about his own goals. Even the sound side is reported with a disconcerting quality and the effects do not disfigure in front of the home version. As if that weren't enough, the game has the possibility of setting a series of graphic values to make everything less heavy and, in this way, to meet those who have fewer resources to spend.", "date": "2018-06-22", "grade": "7.8"}
