In command of a green alien who is so reminiscent of this guy, our task in the game is to set up a successful business, in this case a kiosk where delicious colorful milkshakes are sold. People go crazy for it and the line of cars that pass in front of the shop seems endless, but raw materials often run out and you have to go around to get them. The point is, the delicious milkshakes we just talked about are nothing more than zombie juice. Green, blue, yellow and pink zombies, various types each characterized by different behaviors and prerogatives, which our alien has the task of catching by going to the nearest swamp and using infallible baits to flush them out: human brains. When one of our drones finds undead, we can go there and set up our traps next to a pool of slime where there should be zombies, wait from a distance or from a cover for them to come out of the murky waters and then chase them with a sort of diving rifle capable of harpooning them, tying them to a balloon and making sure that our UFO picks them up and deposits them in the basement of the kiosk. There a series of sophisticated contraptions, what we might call zombie juicers, whip up the pathetic creatures to transform them into the fantastic drink that people are so happy to drink. Zombie Catchers is a nice, fun and solid action platformer with lots of zombies to catch Few ingredients, all natural The gameplay of Zombie Catchers is very simple and takes advantage of a rather immediate control system, with the two directions on the left side of the screen and as many buttons on the right side, to jump and operate the jetpack (press and hold) or to shoot the harpoon. There is no shortage of alternative weapons, such as the net or the tranquilizer dart gun, but these are tools that call into question the freemium nature of the game and which therefore require the disbursement of hard currency to be recharged. Beyond this detail, the whole experience is usable for free and without any problems whatsoever, beyond the wait of a few minutes for the zombie squeezers to do their job, delivering the drinks and increasing the total money earned , and for our drones to find new undead to hunt. Research operations can be made faster by spending the precious crystals or by watching an advertising video, and in the same way it is possible to speed up the ~juicing~. However, the funnest part of the game remains the one in which the zombies are actually hunted down, since after they come out of the water they get scared easily and run towards the woods, which means that we will have to chase and catch them quickly before they disappear among the bushes. The undertaking is not always simple, because some zombies are equipped with a ~shell~ (a can or a barrel that covers their body, in reality) which must be broken with a series of blows before our harpoon can block them. Graphically pleasing, with perhaps redundant but spot on musical accompaniment, Zombie Catchers remains engaging even after several games, even if the swamp setting remains in fact always the same and to unlock further scenarios it is necessary to wait for the completion of quite a few achievements .", "date": "2014-11-18", "grade": "8.0"}
