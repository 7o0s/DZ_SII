The continuous search for novelty, in an attempt to escape the long shadow of World of Warcraft, has claimed several victims including top-level titles such as All Points Bulletin. The challenger of the moment, while champions like Star Wars: the Old Republic are heating up, is Vindictus who has chosen an alternative approach to escape direct competition with most other online RPGs. The Nexon recipe is in fact that of the hack & slash that makes real-time action and the destructibility of objects its distinctive feature. In addition, Vindictus adopts the free formula with microtransactions which, by now, seems to be the only way to have the possibility of creating a large niche of players and, subsequently, also earn something. Massive Multiplayer Hack & Slash There are three characters available, to which two other heroes will soon be added, and obviously they differ in skills and fighting style. Strangely, the fastest of the three is the only male who can attack almost relentlessly with two swords and throw javelins. The special abilities, easily obtainable in the first city, are the Thousand Needles, which allow you to carry out a series of attacks followed by a final move, and the Double Crescent which consists of two particularly powerful slashing. Lann, this is the name of the male model, is the simplest and most immediate to use and bases its defense on dodging which are very useful especially when facing bosses who have slow but destructive blows. Fiona on the other hand prefers shield defense and counterattacks. In short, it is the tank that can absorb most of the damage of an enemy attack by adopting the Heavy Defense. The Counterattack, on the other hand, is the warrior's dynamic move that can electrocute a target after blocking its attack. Finally, Evie has to manage magic and support skills. But despite the ability to throw fire projectiles, summon creatures and heal companions, the sorceress certainly does not disdain the possibility of beating enemies with her staff. And these are obviously only the starting skills that are acquired in the first few days of the game. By carrying out missions and increasing their skills, which can be trained by spending specific experience points earned in combat, the characters obtain far more powerful and spectacular abilities. There is no shortage of devastating blows, melee attacks with an ever-increasing area and spells that can hit dozens of enemies, and it is essential to obtain them to try your hand at high-level instances. But even at the highest levels the heart of Vindictus always remains anchored to reflexes and timing. And there are not only combos and special abilities but also grabs that allow you to use an enemy as a shield or as a weapon to hurl at other opponents. Some projections are truly spectacular, they vary according to the context allowing you to crush an enemy or launch into a ravine and add dynamism and variety to the game action. Action and physics in the service of an mmorpg As you can already guess from the characters available, that even when endowed with magic they are all based on dynamism and combat, the key to Vindictus is action. The title created by the Koreans devCAT is nothing more than a massive multiplayer online beat'em up and therefore with the addition of inventory, character levels, skills and a social component. In fact, the 4-player parties and the gameplay do not differ much from the famous scrolling fighting games by Capcom, with clubs to wield, barrels to smash and various spells that often resemble, or at least have similar effects, to the special abilities of the arcade titles once. But the action effect is magnified both by the three-dimensional nature of the title and by the possibilities guaranteed by the graphics engine chosen by devCat. It is in fact the Source engine created by Valve for Half Life 2 which, in addition to being quite spectacular for an mmorpg, allows you to implement respectable physics. Furthermore, by sacrificing the size of the maps, Vindictus takes full advantage of the destructibility offered by the engine allowing the player to smash not only columns, palisades and chests but also entire structures, turrets and the vast majority of dungeon furnishings. And we must also consider that the physical nature of the engine allows us to avoid enemy shots and forces us to have a certain aim especially with ranged weapons, something that is impossible with mmorpgs based on automatic targeting. Obviously this type of approach also has costs in terms of resources and here and there, due to the hardware demands ofsuch an engine combined with an mmo, the dungeons are divided into rather small sub-environments that can be equated to the stages of an arcade. And at the end of an instance's stages, of course, we find the end-of-level boss. These, almost all gnolls or similar at least in the first group of adventures, often move following repetitive sequences which in some cases, needless to say, are very similar to those we find in classic beat'em ups. Obviously the skills of the bosses become more and more lethal while at the beginning they can be tackled without particular attention. The learning curve is in fact rather soft and the first hours of the game are all too easy. But to make up for the lack of variety and increase the degree of challenge, there are three difficulty levels that significantly vary the degree of challenge of an instance. Furthermore, the prospect of updates must be considered which, as in any title based on microtransactions, are expected to be copious and aimed at keeping the difficulty in line with the level and skill of the players. European servers Currently Vindictus is playable only in the United States even if using a program to redirect the connection to a proxy located in the USA, it is possible to play, at least in part, the devCAT title. Given the problems related to latency, we do not recommend it and hope that the European servers, already announced, will arrive before the end of the year. Valve's Source Engine tackles mmorpgs Vindictus gives us some breathtaking sequences with a spectacular initial presentation that also serves as a tutorial. Basically it is a small single player adventure that leads us to discover the peculiarities of the mmorpg game system and some aspects of the game world. Particular is the decision to create the interiors of shops and city buildings as static environments populated by drawings. The manga feeling is certainly desired but breaks with the design of the rest of the title which, excluding some costumes in full Korean-eccentric style, is rather sober and neutral. The source engine is well exploited and offers pleasant environments, full of details and characterized with care. Even the characters are well modeled and animated and, when the equipment is enriched, there is nothing to complain about either from a scenic point of view or from the point of view of aesthetic variety. On the contrary, the dungeons are rather poor and, even if the settings range from the desert to the snow, the environments are rather repetitive. Furthermore, the instances are small and divided into small environments that take away both the pleasure of exploration and that majesty that many users seek when playing an mmorpg. Fortunately, when you get to some obviously more well-kept areas, which often include mechanical traps and a myriad of destructible objects, the technical standard rises considerably. So in various moments of the game the show is guaranteed, especially when four good-level characters unleash their fury in a room full of objects and enemies that are projected everywhere and crash crumbling columns, vases, crates, wooden buildings and whatnot. Unfortunately all this turns into an unmanageable chaos as soon as the worst monster of all manifests itself: latency. A high ping generates jerks and anomalies of all kinds that make the action confusing and even affect the interlude scenes, cutting the enjoyment of the title in two. Obviously we have played Vindictus on American servers and this means that the lag can be considerable. We have to wait for the European servers to open to verify the playability of the title in better conditions.", "date": "2010-11-19", "grade": "7.8"}
