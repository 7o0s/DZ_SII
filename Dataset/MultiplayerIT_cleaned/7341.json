Until recently, tower defenses were popping up like mushrooms on mobile devices, also because their mechanics adapt very well to touch screen controls. We have therefore seen and played various titles, generally of excellent quality, which interpreted the same strategic sub-genre in different ways, even without introducing substantial innovations, with the only exception of Anomaly: Warzone Earth and its ~reverse~ gameplay. Castle Doombad therefore arrives in a favorable period and imposes itself right from the start as an extraordinarily inspired product, full of weird ideas that reflect the traditional Adult Swim style, strong in respectable numbers and mechanisms that are assimilated within a couple of of internships. But what exactly is it about? Well, you know the clich of the princess being kidnapped and locked up in an ominous castle until a brave knight races to rescue her? This is exactly what happens in the title developed by Grumpiface Studios, but with a small difference: we are the ones who take on the role of the evil being who has kidnapped the princess and we will have to place traps and little monsters in the castle rooms so that the heroes do not reach their goal. but rather end up sliced, skewered or cooked to perfection. Castle Doombad stands as one of the best tower defense games currently available on iOS devices The Cursed Castle The Castle Doombad campaign consists of forty-five levels within three scenarios, to which is added an endless mode to be unlocked by obtaining a certain number of crowns. Each stage basically sees the composition of a different castle, organized in floors and with stairs or doors that allow knights, adventurers, archers, ninjas and even superheroes to climb up to reach the glass bell in which we have locked up the princess. in order to free her and bring her to safety. Our goal, as mentioned, is to stop them by placing a series of traps along their path, using the touch screen to select the desired tool from a bar located at the bottom of the screen and then touching the area where we want to place it. The units at our disposal are really many, they must be unlocked using the gold coins earned with each victory and can also be upgraded because their effectiveness increases. They are divided into three categories: automatic traps, which are activated when the heroes pass by; minions, demonic creatures who attack when they see a knight coming; the manual traps, which must be made to work by touch. Between spikes that rise from the ground, dart-shooting cannons, little monsters of various sizes, huge trolls, lead chandeliers that crush whoever is underneath them and mechanisms of various types to slow down the enemies, the choice is literally boundless and constitutes an undoubted point of force for Castle Doombad. In some situations the action becomes chaotic and the touch controls do not always respond properly, becoming inaccurate when there is a need to activate manual traps in the presence of many units or move the view quickly. However, this is a minor defect for an excellent quality tower defense, characterized by a comic and fun graphic style, as well as a sound accompaniment that is up to the situation.", "date": "2014-01-28", "grade": "8.5"}
