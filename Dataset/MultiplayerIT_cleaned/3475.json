{"name": "Code Vein", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/code-vein-recensione.html", "text": "Vampires. Fights bordering on splatter. Cultural and artistic references to the Baroque and Gothic style everywhere. Let's also add a pinch of soulslike mechanics, which go with everything. This and much more, contains our review of Code Vein. This and much more has to offer what is in all respects the most ambitious Bandai Namco project of 2019. The title has had a tormented management, it is true. In the first versions shown, there was a lack of charisma, the game mechanics didn't have much to say, and everything seemed technically very unfinished. Things, for the most part, have changed. Code Vein has been reincarnated, like the Revenants in their eternal, insatiable fight against the Taken. We spent hours and hours playing with them. You want to read the final verdict, don't you? Gameplay: action, soulslike, RPG Let's not start by talking to you about the narration this time, but from the gameplay of Code Vein. This is because all the value of the work, the spark that could push you to buy, lies precisely in the functionality of its game mechanics; vice versa, it is also important to know its limits, to avoid being disappointed by excessive expectations. What genre does Code Vein belong to, exactly? It is a third-person action RPG, lived for almost all of the entire main plot in a minimum party consisting of two members (one controlled by the CPU, or by your online friend). This clarification is important, because at first glance the game looks like a soulslike, something very, very similar to Dark Souls and Bloodborne. Even the first two game maps consolidate this basic idea, as well as the placement of enemies and their incredible strength, which lead to a very cautious and thoughtful approach. But, and soulslike players have already noticed it for some time in the opinion of this writer, Code Vein is not a soulslike. It has borrowed some cues from the genre, it proceeds in a similar way, it is sometimes punishing in the same way: but it can also be approached as a simple challenging action. And by enhancing your protagonist, above all, it becomes very accessible, if not downright simple. The most original idea of the production lies in the blood codes. These are pre-packaged and freely interchangeable builds, with which it is possible to customize your protagonist at any time. You start the game with the Occultist, Fighter and Ranger codes, all widely shown in the tutorial, then others are unlocked; many others, almost one for each character in the narrative. Codes can either be obtained courtesy of the developers, who give away some at some point in the main storyline, or by finding them within levels, most often in plain sight. Each of them has different parameters, modifies the character's statistics in a certain way, allows you to use or not certain weapons, unlocks and denies support for certain special abilities. With the Occultist, for example, you can become vampire-magicians capable of hurling long-distance energy projectiles; this will be impossible by equipping the Fighter or Berserker code, specialized instead in slashing and close-quarters massacres. Code Vein codes can be unlocked and exchanged at any time. The difference with the main Souls is evident, where individual points are assigned for each statistic by leveling up; to change the stats and abilities of the character there you must therefore start a new game, create a new protagonist. In Code Vein it is enough to modify the code to change the style of play - a nice advantage. The loss of depth is only apparent, because each code has Gifts, specific skills that can in turn be upgraded and leveled up, but only if used properly in battle. To unlock everything and try every combination, therefore, the player is encouraged to experiment. And very often it is precisely the experimentation that allows you to overcome some difficult moments to continue. This experimentation in a single aspect of the gameplay finds correspondences in all other aspects: clothes/armor (the veils of blood), weapons of all kinds (giant hammers, two-handed swords, one-handed swords, bayonets), consumables, collectibles . In fact it makes Code Vein a deep RPG, long-lived and full of secrets. These are all positive aspects of production. The game world, mistletoe Code Vein is set in a single, vast post-apocalyptic game world. Few areas are separated from this context, all the others are linked together through a central map, the old ruined city. Man mAs the main narrative continues, a way is found to unlock initially inaccessible areas of the ruined city, which can lead to the strangest and most disturbing environments: sewers overrun by poisonous beings, snow-capped peaks, a splendid white city where perhaps once resided Queen. To move from one area to another it is possible to continue on foot by mowing down the monsters (not recommended) or rather use the mistletoe, that is the bonfires of Dark Souls of Code Vein, or the lanterns of Bloodborne if you prefer. Each mistletoe allows teleportation to an already unlocked area, or to the main game hub, the base of the heroes on duty (protagonist, Luis, Coco and so on). Mistletoe is also an essential element of the gameplay. By collecting enough haze from the monsters in the levels you can level up, upgrade your character, inherit new Boons for their respective blood code (and then equip them for use in combat). Returning the mist to the base, the latter is used together with the queen's iron (a material hidden almost everywhere) to upgrade weapons and armor, making them more lethal and resistant. When the player dies, all the collected mist ends up on the ground: in the next run it is necessary to collect it, but if you are eliminated again it is lost forever. Since each death respawns at the last mistletoe visited, it's important to explore the surrounding area as much as possible; there aren't many, however, so you should always proceed with extreme caution. Playstation 4 trophies Code Vein has a glittering Platinum Trophy on PlayStation 4: to get it you will have to dedicate yourself to collecting the various collectibles (memories of the protagonists and objects to upgrade weapons and armor). Again, you'll need to max out your gear, inherit most of the Boons in the game, as well as see all the different endings. Enemies, progression Code Vein resembles the setting of levels and progression to a soulslike, we said. But it's really much more accessible than any other title of the genre: just equip a new weapon found in the specific unpublished game area, level up the character and let your partner do his job, to continue. Enemies, monsters and bosses have very predictable behavior, and are sometimes stupid enough to end up in cliffs by themselves. However, the difficulty of the game is not optimally dosed, not only because by upgrading everything becomes much more accessible, but above all because in certain situations it suddenly rises upwards. This makes the progression itself see-saw, now expeditiously now extremely slow. There are areas in which just two enemies dominate open spaces, and others in which the developers have amassed up to six large, lethal enemies in a small hole. Also considering that most of the corridors and paths of the levels are very narrow, it is not possible to say that the level design of Code Vein is too clever, nor that the positioning of the enemies is too clever. And there is also another observation to make: stamina is quite generous, and escaping is always an enticing option, especially for newcomers. While running around and dodging all the monsters up to the boss still doesn't seem like the most sensible way to play. The plot, the strengths and weaknesses Inaccuracies and defects in Code Vein are frequent, both in gameplay and in the technical sector. Some interpenetration too many, some unexplained drop in frame rate in areas without enemies in action, the character's hair that blends with the clothing; sometimes slightly woody hero movement, actions and abilities of the not-so-great variety, a not-so-brilliant CPU in both (super-powered) companions and (sometimes dull) enemies. But this should not give the false impression that Code Vein is not a valid game, on the contrary: the production remains on a more than discreet, indeed excellent level. He could have aspired to higher grades and memorable results, but we must not forget how much good there is. And there are many good things. Starting from a truly significant amount of content, which allows you to customize almost everything and everyone, first of all the real style of play of the protagonist. The plot, among other things, remains on good levels all the time, despite an incipit of the narrative that is anything but memorable. Just turn a blind eye to the insistent search for fanservice in female forms. Among other things, the story of the Revenants, in their struggle for survival and for the maintenance of their humanity (physical, but above all moral and mentale) provides extremely current food for thought. Once you have physically become monsters, is it still possible to remain human at least in social relationships, to help those who don't trust us? Code Vein constantly raises ethical questions that are not trivial, even if sometimes the answers fall into the banal. Not always, fortunately.", "date": "2019-09-26", "grade": "8.0"}
