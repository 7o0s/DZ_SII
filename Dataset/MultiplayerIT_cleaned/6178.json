After reviewing it in the original edition released on Apple Arcade and trying it in the beta version on Steam, we are finally facing the definitive version of LEGO Brawls between consoles and PC, with the result that does not differ much from what we have seen previously . Although the idea of a LEGO-based multiplayer fighting game/platformer may seem strange, the formula of the game appears perfectly designed to take advantage of the characteristics offered by the subject in question: the typical mini figures of the Danish toy construction company, in particular, provide a sensational starting point for making an enormous amount of characters and customizations available to the player, in fact providing a perfect pretext for a title focused on unlocking objects and modifying the appearance and characteristics of the fighters. On the other hand, the variety of locations and objects provided by the different building sets also work great to justify the various crazy situations one can find themselves in the game. Between action, beating and platforms LEGO Brawls, a screenshot The gameplay of LEGO Brawls can be considered a mixture between a fighting game and a MOBA, which takes place in multiplayer arenas made up of platforms. A rotation of objectives changes the aim of the game from time to time, even if these are marginal variations on the game mechanics: basically, it is a question of conquering and managing territories on the map, eliminating all enemies, surviving longer than the others certain threats or collect a certain amount of items, always strenuously fighting against your opponents. The rotation manages to vary the gaming experience but the fulcrum of the action remains largely unchanged, focusing above all on the clash between two teams made up of 4 players each intent on beating each other, with a combat system that is intuitive and fun but also rather simple, far from the depth seen in Smash Bros., to return to the cumbersome source of inspiration. Although the representation is totally in 3D, the movements take place only in two dimensions, with the scrolling shot and the characters intent on running in two directions and jumping between platforms like in a platformer. LEGO Brawls, a moment of confrontation The controls are extremely basic and simple, which probably also derives from the origins of the game on mobile platforms and immediately allows a certain mastery of the action, even if in the most agitated moments it becomes rather difficult to be able to clearly discern what is happening on the screen. given the amount of characters, the speed of the action and the variety of power-ups that can intervene in the midst of the clash. The immediate respawns immediately relaunch us in the midst of the chaos and this total dynamism pushes us to continually return to the heart of the clashes and continue game after game, but it is as if a certain ~inconsistency~ of the fights emerged, more focused on the chaotic and agitated action than on a focus on collisions and grappling techniques. The combat system LEGO Brawls, fight and environmental threats Whether you find yourself having to control an area, collect objects or resist attacks, the fulcrum of the action still lies in the physical fight and this relies on a rather limited amount of attacks: basically a standard one, the air attack and a series of power-ups to collect in the maps that allow you to use vehicles, armor or unleash powerful weapons and creatures on your opponents for a limited period of time. Difficult to judge LEGO Brawls a real fighting game, because the limited amount of moves, all absolutely standard for each character, does not allow for specific strategies or fighting styles to be adopted, limiting tactics to minimum team actions agreed and timely use of evasive maneuvers and temporary power-ups. This makes the gameplay extremelyfast and intuitive, certainly suitable for any type of user, but also shallow and inevitably repetitive in the long run. The fun emerges above all from the quantity of characters and elements that intervene on the screen and from the need to wriggle in the midst of real fights between players. From this point of view, the sense of ~brawl~ is captured in a decidedly marked way, perhaps more than in Smash Bros or Multiversus, more focused on tactical action. This makes LEGO Brawls a different title from the previous examples, aimed at those looking for a more immediate and faster type of action and driven by the charisma of the LEGO world and by the enormous possibilities for collecting and customizing fighters. Progression and customization In LEGO Brawls, fighter customization is everything The progression in LEGO Brawls is essentially marked by the unlocking of new objects to customize the mini figures, so there is no particular in-depth content to be expected in terms of history or game elements usable in single player. There are sorts of battle passes that can be selected by the players and focus on the various LEGO series (the Middle Ages, space, Ninjago and so on), essentially setting some unlockable objectives by advancing from game to game but mainly related to obtaining additional items for customization. The latter element represents the fulcrum of progression in the game, leveraging the collecting spirit of LEGO enthusiasts thanks to a practically perfect reproduction of the characters and the various elements that can be applied to them, from wigs to weapons and armor.Great care has been placed in the customization of the mini figures, which like their real counterparts have a practically infinite amount of possible combinations. By progressing in the game it is possible to unlock a huge ~arsenal~ of objects to be applied to the fighters, modifying their appearance to follow the standard settings of the various LEGO sets or creating new more or less crazy and flashy hybrids. It is a pity that all this does not have effective reflections on the gameplay, given that the conquerable objects are mere aesthetic trappings that do not affect the characters' abilities, but we have already seen how this counts relatively, compared to the great push offered by the desire to collect as many elements possible and compose them as you like. Arenas and achievement LEGO Brawls features a good variety of settings The LEGO characterization already determines a very specific choice as regards the graphic style, which precisely takes up the appearance of the characters, objects and settings of the famous Danish toys. The 3D reproduction is truly remarkable and the animations bind perfectly with what is now the well-established imagery for LEGO videogame productions, for years now. Although in this case we are not dealing with the usual authors, the Red Games team has managed to precisely resume and re-propose the style now consolidated by years of games by TT Games, with a fidelity that in some cases is even higher, considering the attention placed above all on the mini figures. The scenarios are also in line with the typical settings of the various construction sets, even if they limit themselves to carrying out their task in a more anonymous way. Although the possibility of building platform levels based on LEGO scenarios can represent an attractive starting point, the LEGO Brawls arenas all feel rather flat and repetitive. They are certainly functional to the game action, limiting themselves to offering spaces in which to collide with enemies and more or less difficult to reach places in which to place power-ups, but a particular study in terms of map construction does not seem to emerge, with ~lanes~ structured in such a way as to offer strategic attack and defense possibilities or which actually require a certain skill in terms of control over the platforming elements.", "date": "2022-09-04", "grade": "6.5"}
