{"name": "The Witcher", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-witcher_a.html", "text": "Based on a series of fantasy novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski, The Witcher has garnered widespread acclaim in its PC version (the only one available so far). In particular, industry critics appreciated the possibility that the game offers to make choices that go beyond the normal concept of ~good~ and ~evil~, allowing us to choose ~which side to take~ within the events narrated. An element capable of conferring extraordinary freedom, and which Breakpoint has also tried to introduce in this conversion for mobile phones, with due proportions: we will have to make decisions, but the influence of the same on the progress of the story remains to be demonstrated. The game sees us control a very powerful mutant called Geralt, belonging to the category of ~witcher~, or capable of fighting with weapons but also with a series of spells. The structure of the stages is similar to that used for the recent transposition of Turok, which in turn was clearly inspired by the timeless classic Flashback: the screen is not fixed, but there are generally two planes on which it is possible to position yourself; and to get on the platforms it is necessary not only to jump, but also to climb. The character is controlled using the joystick, with the 5 key for attacking and the * and # keys that are used to change swords (there are two available) or to activate one of the four available spells, regulated by a bar that indicates total magical energy and recharges over time. The combat system has a surprising thickness: the normal slash is accompanied by various combos, to be performed by pressing the joystick in sequence in the direction indicated on the screen, with Geralt swinging the sword in different ways or kicking the opponent. In addition there are the four spells, which are based on the four basic elements: fire, water, air and earth. At the end of each level it is possible to upgrade one of your choice, and at the same time use the collected plants (sometimes well hidden in the locations) to create different types of potions. The numerous offensive maneuvers serve to eliminate the many monsters that we will face: the sword change must be done when one of the two metals has no effect on the enemy, and we will be able to experiment with seven types of opponents, each with its own characteristics as well as own approach to combat. The technical realization is excellent from every point of view: the sprites are all well designed, with a discreet animation (nothing to do with the fluidity of Shadowalker, mind you) and quite varied in appearance. They move within truly evocative stages, equipped with a scrolling with parallax on two levels of depth but above all characterized by an excellent use of colors, with a predilection for dark and dull tones, which make the atmospheres of the game perfectly. The action is effectively accompanied by a series of well done and catchy MIDI music. Finally, the control system has been studied very well and combines simplicity and immediacy with a higher than average number of actions: it is a pity that the response to inputs is not exactly immediate. PRO Graphics rich in quantity and quality Interesting combat system Good general atmosphere AGAINST Response to commands not immediate... ...that takes away the dynamism and fluidity of the action Linear and basically repetitive", "date": "2008-04-21", "grade": "S.V."}
