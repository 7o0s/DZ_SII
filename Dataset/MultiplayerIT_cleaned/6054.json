We were fascinated by the entertaining narration of Stick It to the Man and by his peculiar graphic style, and we found both of these elements in the new production of the Swedish team, Zombie Vikings. Currently available only on PlayStation 4, but also coming to PC and Wii U, this absurd zombie-based side-scroller fought against Grow Home and Armello in the first Vote to Play reserved for PlayStation Plus subscribers, not but managing to win against the popularity of Ubisoft. It's a real shame, both because the cooperative nature of the game deserved the widest possible user base in order not to miss participants in the matches, both for the story mode and for the arena mode; and because, as you will be able to read, Zombie Vikings fully deserved that opportunity for visibility. Zombie Vikings is a brilliant concentration of jokes and gags, but also a solid and full-bodied action game Hell is coming In Asgard, Odin proudly admires his latest creation, a war stick, so much so that he gouged out his only remaining eye to look at it more closely. However, the evil Loki plays a cruel joke on him, stealing the bulb and running away. Deprived of sight, with Thor busy in other matters, the father of the gods decides to resort to extreme remedies to regain possession of his precious eye; and thus raises from the dead four valiant Viking warriors: Gunborg, Seagurd, Hedgy and Caw-kaa. Gunborg is the strongman of the group, a gigantic Amazon who supplements her diet of brains with protein and creatine, assaults her enemies wielding fearsome weapons and can literally pump herself to bursting; Seagurd is a bizarre cross between a Viking and an octopus, born from the fight between these two creatures, capable of spraying poisonous ink (from the butt of his tentacular half, as he likes to point out) and of spinning furiously to hit anyone within range; Hedgy is a kind of little caveman who likes to bite everything, a real crazed splinter that projects itself from one side of the screen to the other, attacking all enemies; and finally Caw-kaa, the raven queen, as fast as she is deadly, is able to summon her fluttering subjects to perform a mighty dive from the sky. Four valiant warriors, we said, who return to tread the earth in the form of zombies and have to face over twenty-five levels full of hostile creatures to find Loki and recover the stolen goods. Crazy laughter What was the strong point of Stick It to the Man, the brilliant humor, returns in a big way in Zombie Vikings, taking advantage of the context and all the gags to which it lends itself. It starts from the philosophical reflections of the protagonists to get to the speeches of their enemies on duty: the feline monster who licks the hair of cats like cotton candy, the worm who stole the body of a man and therefore wants to keep the same attitudes, taking selfies with the family (the epilogue of the matter is splendid), the old lady of a secondary mission who returns to embrace her lost kitten and praises her powerful anal glands, or the cat princess in withdrawal from pink bows . The narrative sector of the game is pure gold, a mix of jokes that will win you over from the first to the last dialogue and which enjoys a good text adaptation in Italian. Of course, a level dubbing would have been perfect, but we are still talking about an independent title, so that's perfectly fine (and in any case the original voices are very enjoyable). In the same way, the authors worked on the lore, creating absurd stories for each mission and even crazier weapons that can be purchased using the coins collected from the various crates scattered around the stages. We are talking about normal swords and two-handed broadswords, but also skunks, cats or hammerhead fish on a stick, nose-swords and then a whole series of runes that act as a shield for the characters, each with its own characteristics. Playstation 4 trophies There are thirty-four Trophies in Zombie Vikings. Beyond those obtained by completing the campaign, most of the achievements revolve around the execution of particular actions, often linked to the multiplayer component and therefore difficult to unlock in single. Zombie Attack! Zombie Vikings is a scrolling fighting game, as already mentioned, with a campaign consisting of over twenty-five levels and an arena mode to surround the offer. You can play alone without problems, however the experience is at its best in cooperative multiplayer for four players, even better if they are all sitting on the same divyear instead of picked up online. The epic nature of some situations is in fact enhanced in such a context, and one passes without problems over the intrinsic defects of the genre to which it belongs, above all the repetitiveness of the action. In this sense, not much has been done, to tell the truth: the characters can perform a normal or charged attack, parry with the shield, strike while running, use a special maneuver and pick up/throw objects or their own companions, but the real sockets. For practicality or pure convenience, in short, one ends up always carrying out the same attacks, and this gets tired in the long run. Furthermore, there is no enhancement of the impacts to Capcom: the shots produce specific animations, but there is not enough ~weight~ to give the same satisfaction as the great classics of the genre. On the technical implementation front, however, nothing to complain: the graphic style is the same, original and captivating, seen in Stick It to the Man, indeed it boasts a more accurate selection of color shades and a general enrichment of the scenarios. The characters are basically two-dimensional silhouettes that move in the background, and this effect is rendered great, especially during the cutscenes. When we took the game in hand for the first time there were obvious frame rate and tearing problems that significantly affected the enjoyment of the experience, but a big update (basically a rebuild of over 4 GB) solved the problem brilliantly , giving us a smooth and very pleasant action.", "date": "2015-09-08", "grade": "8.0"}
