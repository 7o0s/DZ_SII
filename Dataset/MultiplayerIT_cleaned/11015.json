Blockbuster is the second chapter of the quiz series created by Microsoft in the wake of that kind of party game that has so depopulated (and continues to do so) on the rival console with the famous Buzz. Buying Scene It? we also come into possession of dedicated controllers, four push-button panels equipped with a central button to reserve the answer and four smaller ones to choose the exact one. Blockbuster is entirely dedicated to the world of cinema, ranging from films from the 60s to the most recent productions of 2008, passing from Hollywood to our home titles. Then winter is the ideal season to have fun with this kind of title, when the cold and the rain rage you can't do anything but rest under a blanket, put a hot chocolate on the fire and challenge your friends in a battle to the last minute movie! If I can change, and if you can change. the whole world can change! The game structure of this new chapter faithfully reproduces that of the first. After deciding the length of the game, the questions begin, divided into different quiz genres. Each correct answer earns points, which add up to the jackpot that will ultimately decide who is the winner. Some particular actions offer specific bonuses, such as not even making a wrong answer, chaining a series of winning ~combos~. There is a wide variety of situations which ensures that Scene It! Blockbuster to not be a game in which trivial questions follow one another, but rather a series of challenges different from each other.

The new Scene It? includes content from more than 250 movies, from family and classic titles like Breakfast Club, The Sting and Shrek to more recent blockbusters like Charlie Wilson's War, The Last King of Scotland and Juno. Once the game has started, before each question a short tutorial explains what we have to do in the quiz that is about to start. The good news is that the comment, which is tedious in the long run, can be skipped. Despite having a good number of films from which to draw questions, there is a certain tendency to repeat them after a few hours of play, a clear sign that Scene It! it does not use a database with all the questions previously released and therefore shows a certain repetitiveness in the long run. . When do you sleep 007? Never when I'm on duty The quizzes are many and of different kinds, all quite original and fun. Some are too similar, however: for example, there is one that offers stylized film images with colorful and simple drawings, as if they were drawn by a child, through which we have to guess the title to which they refer. Then there is also a quiz that proposes the same stylization of scenes but this time through the pixelization of the image, as if it were an 8-bit game. The ~show stylized image - guess what it's about~ structure is the same. Other quizzes are also similar, such as the ~scretch~: a virtual pencil starts drawing an illustration that refers to a certain film, and the first one who understands what it refers to has the opportunity to answer. Also this time the question is linked to the stylization of an image, even if in this case there is the waiting factor due to the creation of the drawing itself. Nice quiz that erases the faces of the actors and lets us choose which film is right. The quizzes are many and of different kinds, all quite original and fun. Some look too much alike, though When do you sleep 007? Never when I'm on duty It is a sign that many films offered in this title are little-known productions, films from many years ago and some films that went quietly at the box office, a factor that could put some players in difficulty during the challenges. In Scene It! Blockbuster there is also much more to do: ordering a series of films chronologically, completing famous quotes, understanding the title based on a dialogue. The last set of questions of each game concerns a piece of film, a clip of a few minutes after which the interrogation starts. This quiz gives lots of points and often refers to movies pwell-known or not too recent films, making the challenge difficult even for true cinephiles. Champion of Blocks also introduces a pleasant novelty in the series, inserting the support to Xbox Live and the possibility to challenge other groups of friends. The best mode, however, is always the live one. Comment With Christmas approaching and the winter cold, a quiz game becomes the ideal way to spend an evening with family or friends. The package offered by the new Scene It!, which includes the four dedicated wireless controllers, is attractive and promises hours and hours of play in the company of the most famous films from the 60s onwards, through a series of tests and quizzes. Many of these are a bit too similar to each other and after a few hours of playing the same questions begin to be asked again, a factor that cuts longevity, while the game is still fun and engaging, until those defects appear. Excellent avatar support and the introduction of online, even if it is always preferable to challenge friends live. Pros First packaged title to support avatars Introduction of online play through Xbox Live Many different quizzes...
