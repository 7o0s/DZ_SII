{"name": "Chuchel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chuchel-recensione.html", "text": "Chuchel is the name of the funny creature protagonist of the adventure of the same name by Amanita Design, the team behind little gems like Machinarium and Botanicula. Originally released on PC last March and now also available on iOS and Android devices, the title tells the story of a little black, hairy monster with incredibly elastic arms and legs, a huge mouth and a hat made from an acorn , from which it never separates. At the beginning of the game we find him intent on sleeping in his little house, surrounded by objects and improbable pets (an elephant, two birds and a kind of alcoholic toad), without anything apparently being able to rouse him from his sleep. It is in these situations that the peculiar approach developed by the authors emerges in all its surprising simplicity, asking us to touch anything to trigger interactions that could solve the puzzle of the moment and lead us to the next enigma, in a sequence of situations that they gradually become more complex and multifaceted, keeping us company for a couple of hours and telling, in their own way, a story that is certainly worth living. A small example: to wake up the protagonist it is necessary for the toad to spill its bottle on a little bird, which, drinking it, will swell dramatically until it falls from its own twig and lands in Chuchel's mouth. Now standing, well rested, the character will try to retrieve a delicious cherry from his ~bed~, but an enormous black hand will take it away, grabbing him too and dragging him into this surprising, evocative adventure. A crazy cartoon The type of gameplay proposed by Chuchel actually refers to the tradition of ~point and click~ adventures, replacing the pointer with our own fingers in the case of the mobile version and putting on the table the sequence of trials and errors necessary to identify the interaction what we need and the moment in which it must be done so that we can continue the puzzle. From this point of view, the variety of situations is incredible: we go from moments like the one described in the opening to decidedly more intricate phases, with Flappy Bird-esque interludes and even homages to classics like Pac-Man and Tetris to act as the glue between a riddle and the other. However, it is above all the technical and artistic sector of the Amanita Design title that strikes from the very beginning. What unfolds before our eyes is in fact a real cartoon with an original and mature style, characterized by an excellent design for its many and incredible characters, an excellent use of colors and an abundance of animations that no moment leaves room for doubts about the efforts made by the development team. Every detail has been meticulously cared for, every valid input corresponds to a reaction and there were many moments in which we found ourselves smiling like idiots in front of the expressions of one of the creatures involved in the numerous puzzles that enrich Chuchel's campaign. The action is also accompanied by a valuable soundtrack, which manages to enhance the scenes while the protagonists continue to utter weird verses which, however, after a while, we will tend to interpret as legitimate forms of expression.", "date": "2018-12-14", "grade": "8.0"}
