It's still not the easiest of marriages, but a lot has come a long way since Final Fantasy XI, for a long time it's practically the only example of the genre that actually works on both PC and console. At the basis of this discrepancy between the two worlds there are technical constraints and bottlenecks represented by the use of the controller, the need to rely on a proprietary and closed online infrastructure, the possibility of cross-play between different platforms and the problems management that can follow and finally the problem of the monthly (or annual) subscription, which, thought superimposed on the payment already present to take advantage of the online services on the console, easily made users flee to other shores. Many things have changed in recent years, even if several have remained intact, but among the evolutions there has been the diffusion of free-to-play, which by eliminating the payment of the license fee has at least made the idea of dedicate yourself to an MMORPG on consoles, not having to pay for two services at the same time. Mind you, the amount of MMO titles on machines exclusively dedicated to gaming is not yet comparable to the chaos currently present on PC, but customs clearance is now as good as it started for a while. As for the MMORPG in particular, The Elder Scrolls Online has definitively demonstrated that the public is ready for this type of experience on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 as well, but before that the pioneer on next-gen Microsoft was Dungeons & Dragons: Neverwinter, who boldly launched himself into practically unexplored territory on this console and was able to plant his own flag, albeit not exactly impressive. Neverwinter defies prejudice on MMORPGs, F2P and consoles and arrives on Xbox One with good results A magical cataclysm in the Realms We are facing a game that brings together the knowledge in the MMORPG sector of the Cryptic team with a simply historical setting as regards role-playing in general, namely the Forgotten Realms of Dungeons & Dragons, several times staged in large RPG classics of the past and here reinterpreted to work better in the massive online context. The story tells of a terrible magical cataclysm followed by an invasion of an army of the undead, led by Queen Valindra and intending to conquer the lands of Neverwinter, a threat against which the heroes are called to mobilize for all the Kingdoms. The premise falls into the clich of the genre, but the story then unfolds in many quests that follow different strands, intertwining with the various events that characterize the Realms and in this maintaining a certain fidelity to the canons of the Dungeons & Dragons videogame tradition. In short, the lore guarantees a considerable depth and a very solid background, even if the dynamics of the quests often do not live up to the high-sounding name, offering interesting ideas in various cases but often limiting themselves to the task of bouncing from one side to the other. other of the various areas without showing particular peaks in terms of level and dungeon design. It must be said that the pace of the game always remains high, given the amount of things to do, only that often in the various explorable areas, all heavily instantiated, you almost always find yourself running after the luminous trail that indicates the road from follow without getting too lost in explorations, also because in fact there isn't much else to do, with areas that are often linear or in any case rather poor in secondary objectives outside of the quests themselves. As long as it comes to leveling, however, such a dry structure based on the continuous succession of quests to be completed also works well and Neverwinter in fact manages to keep the player's interest quite high up to the level cap in its succession of objectives without stop, in a sort of extended and online version of a classic action RPG. A big flaw of the Xbox One version is the absence of the Foundry mode, which on PC allows users to create new quests and adventures through a complex system of tools for building mods and which has contributed to significantly lengthen and enrich the game. play offer on Windows platform. At the moment there is no information on the possible arrival in the console version, unfortunately. Between action and role Neverwinter manages to keep the balance between the powerful classic structure of RPGs based on Dungeons & Dragons and a rather light and fast action, like an action RPG, which in some cases almost seems to lean towards a button masher drift given the frenetic pace of the clashes. a carfeature that harmonizes well with the console context. The traditional role-playing front is maintained above all in the management and progression of the character, selectable from 8 classes and 9 different races with combinable attributes and specialties, which allows numerous different nuances such as specializations and characteristics, avoiding relapse into excessively standardized categories. The evolution of the character takes place in a rather fluid and intuitive way in the initial leveling phase, before the cumbersome microtransaction system begins to make its weight felt, which usually happens towards the more advanced levels. The simple and action combat system applies very well to the use of the controller and on this aspect the adaptation work carried out by the developers for the Xbox One version has been remarkable. Relying on a not excessive amount of commands and various shortcuts, the mapping of these to the controller keys (and related combinations) did not represent a big problem, resulting rather comfortable and making Neverwinter an MMORPG particularly suitable for the console environment, adopting a solution similar to the great crossbar from Final Fantasy XIV. If anything, it is in the very structure of the fights that flaws can be found, with enemies who generally attack according to very simple and predictable patterns and a somewhat repetitive basic mechanics, not requiring excessive alternation between the types of attack nor a particular strategic approach apart from the need to dodge at the right moment and fight back with intensity. Also because of this general flatness of the clashes, within the quests, it is difficult to find the need to face the missions in company, which could push those who do not already have a group of friends with whom to face the game to continue calmly in single, without actually encountering particular difficulties, except obviously for the contents specifically designed for multiplayer such as skirmishes, PvP arenas and quests to be tackled in groups, which however are secondary elements at least until the endgame. Money and friends While it may not be a hugely popular and promoted game, there is good online activity in Neverwinter, proving that Xbox One users have welcomed this free-to-play MMORPG experiment onto their console. The launch of The Elder Scrolls Online has removed the monopoly of the genre from the Cryptic title, presenting itself as a somewhat more perfected product, but the Forgotten Realms are still quite populated, demonstrating how they can always count on their historical charm. In the first weeks of launch there was often a chronic lack of players and the will to communicate between them, but after six months things seem to have changed quite a bit and it is easy to come across adventurers willing to lend a hand or welcome us into their group. while the streets of Neverwinter are always decidedly crowded, also allowing numerous opportunities for trade and opportunities for PvP clashes. We're still a long way from building communities as solid and gigantic as those of other online PC titles, but it's clear that Neverwinter has attracted many console users and as a result its world is now quite populated. On the other hand, the microtransaction system adopted by Perfect World always leaves us perplexed: that a title structured in this way must obviously receive funding from somewhere is undisputed, but the solutions adopted are certainly not the best, with a continuous and costly begging that is hidden in various nooks and crannies of the game structure. We reiterate that the system is not that much invasive in the character growth part, offering the possibility of reaching the level cap without too many financing problems, but the possibility (sometimes the need) of having to put hand in the wallet to successfully execute super powerful attacks, reduce the wait in crafting (perhaps even normal objects, which tends to take away the meaning of the same activity in question), quickly recall a companion engaged elsewhere and more demonstrate a rather perverse attitude against the paid content or service. This is also underlined by the particular currency system adopted, which combines the standard virtual money with the presence of Zen, a currency that can be converted from real money. To these is added the use of astral diamonds, which are the most important and required currency for the purchase of contents of a certain value. The problem is that the unfair exchange rate between zen and astral diamonds really compelsto extreme farming procedures in order to reach decent numbers, or precisely to pay with hard cash to avoid the problem. Even the pre-set packages that can be purchased on the shop are distinguished by truly exorbitant prices. Xbox One goals There are 48 achievements for a total of 1000 points. The quantity is therefore the usual but, given the intrinsic length of the game, the achievements are distributed in such a way as to focus heavily on the accumulation of results. Alongside the standard ones that are unlocked simply by completing quests, many are achieved by performing long-term performances (killing a certain amount of enemies, collecting a certain number of objects, reaching various experience levels and more). The uncertain realms The conversion from PC does not show particular variations in technical terms, with the graphics sector, in itself not too advanced already in the original, remained practically the same on Xbox One. Being an MMORPG it is normal that it does not push excessively on the polygonal complexity or the applied effects, but also compared to other productions of the same type Neverwinter has difficulty shining, although it manages quite well in the representation of the Forgotten Realms. In general, the yield is discontinuous and depends a lot on the various explorable areas, going from a certain simplicity in some areas (those of the initial stages or various districts of Neverwinter) to clear improvements for others, especially those that appear a little later in the story (Icepeak, Mount Hotenow) both for the evocative capacity of the places themselves and for a different degree of evolution reached in the most advanced stages of development, probably. The problem is not so much the simplicity of the scenarios and characters (which indeed prove to be quite rich in detail in some situations, such as in the interiors), if anything, it is rather a certain lack of inspiration that hovers for a good part of the game and which determines a style comparable to a rather generic fantasy. On the other hand, one might also think that, in the case of Dungeons & Dragons, a certain adherence to the classic canon of the genre without eclectic flourishes makes sense. More serious is the notable inconsistency of the frame rate in the Xbox One version, with an always variable fluidity that also descends to extremely low peaks in certain situations, up to affecting the gameplay in the most extreme cases. The problem has been detected since the launch of the console version and since then some improvements have been applied, with the initial catastrophic results appearing to have been largely mitigated, although without having yet achieved true stability.", "date": "2015-09-08", "grade": "7.2"}
