And so maybe there are days when you want a deep, thick experience that combines narrative quality with a solid and full-bodied structure; and others where the only desire is to open fire with a large machine gun and pour tons of ammunition on endless hordes of demonic creatures. God Mode responds precisely to this need: it is a third person shooter that presents itself in an ~honest~ way with respect to the user, does not tell us fantastic stories and indeed does not tell us practically anything, but for less than seven euros it catapults us in the depths of the underworld, he hands us a weapon and tells us ~see those hordes of monsters approaching? Take them all out.~ A solution that recalls, in some ways, that famous joke about prostitution: ~it's like dating, but more honest~. And so, having selected the ~quick game~, matchmaking starts in search of three adventure companions to face a scenario chosen from the five available: ~Fire's Cave~, an underground location dominated by flames, with separate structures from chasms that are recomposed when you pass from one area to another; ~Fortress~, an open and very large stage, generally ~flat~ but with lateral outlets to be able to attack the hordes from a raised position; ~Moon of Hades~, a dark and mysterious map, where surprises are always lurking and are never what we would like; ~Ascension~, this is also an open location, with large stairways that create useful spaces for retreating in the face of too numerous groups of enemies; and finally the ~Fossa del Basilisco~, a rocky battleground that overlooks nowhere, with some narrow passages as opposed to areas where it is easy to lurk. Four against all The offer of God Mode can be easily summarized in its cooperative mode and in the five scenarios that we have just described. It is in fact possible to start a solo game, but it only takes a few minutes to realize that it doesn't make any sense and that, even in terms of balance, coordinating one's actions together with three companions is a completely different thing. The developers haven't developed a particularly clear interface, but in the end you can do everything you need to do before jumping into the action; in this case, it is possible to spend the gold coins collected within the stages to upgrade the starting equipment, consisting of an SMG light machine gun and a shotgun, or to buy new weapons. The choice is fairly wide and the characterization of each tool is good, but money is not enough: to obtain the powerful grenade launcher rather than the plasma pistol, the enormous minigun rather than the rotating saw (which, like a ferocious lawn mower, kills both up close and from a distance) you also need to reach certain levels of experience, and this is the engine that drives our desire to face dungeons again and again. There is also an option to change our character's appearance, always based on gold coins and XP, with a series of nice alternatives regarding the face, accessories and clothes. Hell of a bonus The guys from Old School Games have focused on a very simple and dry gameplay, in which you do nothing but go around the levels while more and more numerous waves of enemies appear on the horizon with the aim of eliminating us. There are three values to constantly keep an eye on: the health indicator, the armor indicator and the ammunition indicator. Scattered within the scenarios we find red, light blue and green bonuses that serve precisely to replenish the three items, but a minimum of trivial strategy is advisable when the groups of monsters approach in a certain way, thus trying not to insist too much with the machine gun and maybe score a few rifle shots to save the other ammunition. The elements of variation designated are basically two: on the one hand the difficulty levels (bronze, silver, gold), which substantially affect the number and resistance of the demonic creatures determined to kill us; on the other a series of random rules (the so-called ~Test of Faith~) that literally shuffle the cards on the table, for example assigning us random weapons every few seconds, making bombs rain, activating instant kills on both sides, and so on. As mentioned, each of the five scenarios sees us engaged in repelling a certain number of waves of opponents and then moving on to the next area and finally facing a different boss. Well, the boss fights didn't seem like it to usthe splendid ones, indeed much more could have been done to enrich them and add some facets to what actually arises as a simple target practice, characterized by too limited and simplistic attack and movement routines. Defeated the boss, the epilogue of the game is represented by a special room that fills with gold and a limited time available to us to collect as much as possible; even hindering himself with his companions, given that friendly fire is activated in this situation. Hellish technique The God Mode control system draws heavily from the tradition of third person shooters and, of course, supports the Xbox 360 controller without problems. So right trigger to open fire, left trigger to aim, A button to run and execute rapids lateral discards, B to carry out a melee attack (not useless, but almost), Y to change weapons and X to use the equipped special ability, while the right backbone is used to reload. It is possible to customize the commands, but the layout does not present particular problems, unless you choose the combination of mouse / keyboard, which does have some problems. For example, the spacebar to run and discard does not appear to be a winning choice, as one is always led to act on the left SHIFT, but so be it. You know well that for third person shooters our preference always goes to the controller, and in the specific case of the Old School Games title there has been an excellent job of adaptation in this sense. The speech of the technical sector is different, which predictably is not there to amaze. On the test configuration the game behaves excellently, from forty to sixty frames per second without ever slowing down, not even with a hundred or more enemies on the screen at the same time, but at the same time the level of detail is what it is and the design of the scenarios and monsters does not exalt that much. The sound effects are good, which with their impact make up for a gunplay that appears satisfactory at a distance but which instead disappoints a bit in close exchanges.", "date": "2013-04-25", "grade": "7.0"}
