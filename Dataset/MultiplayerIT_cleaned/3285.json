However, as the now imminent Shadowgun War Games taught us, when the competition is so strong you have to try to diversify the product, offer something different to avoid direct confrontation. Well, Warface does not choose this approach and rather tries an improbable frontal assault counting on the brand's albeit discreet popularity but peppering the game with microtransactions that have not only an aesthetic but also a practical value, showing the side with inevitably pay-to-win implications. From a structural point of view, we are dealing with a multiplayer-based shooter for eight players, equipped with a very fast matchmaking that gives life to matches that take place in two different modes: team deathmatch and Control, a clash territorial in which our goal is to conquer and maintain three points of interest within the scenario to score the score necessary for victory. There are five maps available, all of modern inspiration, and offer a fair visual variety, as well as a with sufficiently compact dimensions, in some situations even too much: sometimes it happens to find yourself in the respawn point of the opponents, thus obtaining a big advantage. In terms of navigability and strategy, however, the settings appear well done and also offer an excellent level of detail, net of some less convincing glimpses. Gameplay and pay-to-win Warface: Global Operations does not support Bluetooth controllers, at least at the moment, but the touch controls are immediately precise and reliable, with two repositionable virtual analog sticks and an automatic fire system that can be deactivated from the options if you want two right thumbs to shoot and move at the same time. The gunplay appears fairly solid, although the weapon feedback is not as valid as that seen in the aforementioned Call of Duty: Mobile and Shadowgun War Games, and it is possible to modify the setup as new tools are unlocked between assault rifles, shotguns shotguns, light machine guns and sniper rifles. The management of vital energy implies the regeneration of the same when we are not hit for a few moments, but it is above all the armor indicator that makes the difference, determining a time-to-kill that is anything but immediate, which gives a little breathing space even in the most chaotic situations without overdoing it. The problem, as mentioned at the beginning, is the pay-to-win mechanisms that revolve around the many microtransactions present. By playing and winning you get many rewards that partially smooth these edges, it is true, but the very fact that the armor (restorable during games only by consuming another ~charge~) is available in limited quantities, to be replenished only through purchases in-app with the hard currency, it gives a basic idea of how the developers have studied the monetization system. The whole system of upgrading weapons and equipment creates obvious advantages during matches: whoever has the most effective tools wins the fights, whoever wears the most resistant armor is difficult to eliminate, and all these aspects can be bought with the real money: whoever spends has a better chance of winning. A real pity, because beyond the few modes and the lack of original ideas we are dealing with a very well made product on a technical, playable and fun level.", "date": "2020-01-27", "grade": "6.5"}
