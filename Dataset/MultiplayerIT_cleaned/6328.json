{"name": "Order of Battle: U.S. Pacific: Guerra in alto mare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/150024-order-of-battle-pacific-guerra-in-alto-mare.html", "text": "Order of Battle: Pacific takes us right into the middle of the Pacific War, a very long chapter of the Second World War that saw the United States and Japan as the main protagonists. It all started on December 7, 1941 with the infamous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor which led, almost four years later, to an even more dramatic epilogue that was consumed in the nuclear fire of the only two atomic bombs used for warfare. Putting aside the moral issue, we can undoubtedly say that it is a scenario with intense implications, a decisive conflict that the guys from The Artistocrats have exploited while remaining in the balance between history, uchronia and experimental weapons. Once one of the two factions has been selected, we find ourselves facing a classic wargame with a turn-based structure harnessed in the typical hexagonal cells. The gameplay, in essence, does not leave the canons of the genre by focusing on the careful evaluation of the movement and on the weighted use of each unit in relation to the context. First, attacking first isn't necessarily an advantage. In fact, it is not said that a unit without specific armaments is able to damage a heavy unit and the return fire of the latter risks transforming an attack into a disastrous situation. Furthermore, an offensive must take into account the advantages guaranteed by flanking enemies and the support skills that make some units very important. Engineers are vulnerable but can increase the entrenchment speed of nearby allies as well as lay mines, destroy structures that generate supplies, demolish bridges and build new ones. Their usefulness, in essence, is undeniable even if it is a drop in the ocean of the over 500 types of units, many of which can be upgraded, that we find ourselves using or facing in Order of Battle: Pacific. Things can get decidedly complex between historical scenarios, random events, supply lines, exclusively maritime and general missions that transform the unit to which they are merged into a very special support unit. Furthermore, the initial phase of the game does not only involve the deployment of troops and allows us two other important choices. The first concerns specializations ranging from the classic unit bonuses to the terrible Manhattan Project that allows Westerners to deploy B29 nuclear bombers. The second choice concerns which objectives to pursue among those available. Victory Points are divided into three orders of importance but they are all relevant given that they guarantee healing or repairs when they are reached and the possibility of choice not only changes the way in which a scenario is approached but can have effects on subsequent missions. Not eliminating an enemy contingent, in fact, could force us to face it again later. Order of Battle: Pacific wants to show that wargames still have something important to say An ocean of possibilities One of the most evident qualities of Order of Battle: Pacific is the attention paid to sky and sea. Also in this case the versatility of the units is a key element in a title that does not sin from the point of view of variety. Submarines, bombers, aircraft carriers, and cruisers all have a dual role in ranged gunfire, submarine detection, repair, diving, scouting, and anti-aircraft capabilities. Naval units play a vital support role even in the case of land engagements and moving their forces from one island to another, which is quite common given the Pacific scenario, involves a lot of action between mines and airborne torpedoes. In all of this it is good to take advantage of the scout units that can save us from nasty surprises both at sea and on land. And the same goes for aircraft mobility which allows us to quickly dispel the so-called ~fog of war~ and, although placing the most important unit on an airplane can be risky, it can also be used to quickly bring a general into the midst of the his troops. But artificial intelligence doesn't necessarily punish us for gambling. In fact, the CPU is not particularly aggressive and prefers to move methodically. This does not mean that it is not dangerous but it happens that it misses rather tempting opportunities thus losing credibility. However, we must admit that the electronic brain finds itself managing decidedly complex situations such as in the case of supplies. In order for these to happen, the units must be connected to the rear lines by a corridor of free squares. If the enemy interrupts this corridor, the connection is lost and the cut off units lose their effectiveness. It then becomes possible to kneelhio a stronghold by surrounding it or harass the enemy without even engaging them. In essence, it is a mechanic implemented in a simple way but which is incredibly effective and is a symbol of a title which, starting from the interface, manages to be complex without being complicated. The specific functions of the selected units appear in the command bar and become automatically available if the context allows it. In addition, pressing the spacebar instantly shows all supply lines and helps us to carefully plan each offensive. Finally, we must applaud the unit management menu which occupies a large portion of the screen but in a few steps allows us to evaluate all the available forces, those deployed, those in reserve and those that unfortunately ended up meeting a bad end. In essence, the turns alternate quickly through two substantial campaigns that offer a large number of situations, almost all of which are well balanced thanks also to the high resistance of the most important units which are never easy to eliminate. Perhaps this approach is not particularly realistic but it facilitates balancing and almost always leaves a door open to be able to reverse the situation even when the fates are particularly adverse. To all this we must add an intuitive editor that allows you to create complete scenarios and the four-player multiplayer that promises longevity in abundance thanks also to the balanced mechanics of the title. On the one hand there is the Hotseat mode with players taking turns playing on the same computer and on the other the PBEM++ which allows you to play over the internet also in cooperative mode. We are, in essence, faced with a profound and multifaceted experience that makes the most of a scenario little explored by this genre. On the other hand, the polygon count is not high, the textures do not shine in quality and the variety of models is not striking. A pinch of more detail would probably have enhanced the enormous variety of units among which we also find the never built Super Yamato class battleship. But we are still talking about defects that have a relative value all the more if we consider that the wargame genre is often satisfied with decidedly more modest technical compartments than that of Order of Battle: Pacific. Among other things, the developers have also thought of those who prefer the more classic setting by implementing a completely two-dimensional game map or a 2D/3D hybrid variant. Ultimately, we are talking about a well-finished product even if we find ourselves closing with a sore point for those who live in the boot: unfortunately, the support for the Italian language is completely missing.", "date": "2015-05-19", "grade": "8.5"}
