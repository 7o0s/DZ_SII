{"name": "Knockout Kings 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/knockout-kings-2002_b.html", "text": "...And Still the Champion of the World VAT Enter the ring... Turn on your trusty Xbox and take a look at the introduction which focuses mainly on the figure of Muhammad Ali, ~The Greatest Of All Time~; welcomed by harsh and almost street rap music, you will be presented with a simple and concise menu, bordering on the meager; the choice (to tell the truth, in my opinion excessively narrow) can simply fall on Exhibition, tournament or career. That's unless you want to take a look at the game Credits first with some interesting glimpses of the Motion Capture sessions, the Back Stage and the game programming. Okay! now you are ready to enter the ring, in the Exhibition or Tournament mode you will have the possibility to interpret one of the legends of the past like Ali, Sugar Ray or of the present like Lewis and Holyfield; you will be in the ring, just you and your opponent, surrounded by a noisy and incredibly tense audience; the clash will soon begin, without frills, without side dishes and without presentations (but this is certainly missed). Let the fight begin... Jab, Direct, Hook, Uppercut As I anticipated, the control system has been largely revolutionized and adapted to the shape of the Xbox pad. In fact, the Jab is assigned to the X button, the direct to the Y and the left and right hooks respectively to the A and B buttons. The two triggers located on the back of the joypad are assigned to block as regards the left one, while the right trigger will be used to change any of the previous shots into an Uppercut (or uppercut if you prefer); finally, the black button will produce a forbidden blow, mainly to the lower parts (Low Blow), the white button will be used to perform the punch characterizing the boxer used and finally the select button will be used to taunt the opponent. To this schematic presentation of the commands is added the configuration of the analog stick which is used to direct your boxer without worrying about the position of the camera (among other things dynamic and excellent when it follows the exchanges between the two boxers by changing the angle and height according to aesthetic needs); explaining better by directing the stick upwards at some point, your boxer will approach the opponent, downwards he will move away and will go around him respectively from the right or left if you press the lever on the horizontal axis. After long and tiring game sessions I can without a doubt say that the control system certainly makes the most of the ergonomics and construction of the Xbox pad. As the last gem of an excellent control system, one certainly cannot help but mention the vibration function, which will be the only possible way for you, together with some signals in terms of posture and attitude of your boxer, to understand the status physique of the boxer during the game phases. If the pad begins to vibrate rhythmically and powerfully, it is better to try to catch your breath and get away from your opponent's swings. Dance like a butterfly... Sting like a bee... This was the motto of the great Ali, the boxer that everyone remembers as the undisputed champion both on and off the field; a motto that still applies in boxing and beyond. Surely this game also has the elegance of a butterfly in some of its facets, with an amazing and well-studied control system, easy to master right from the start but with indescribable improvements over the long term; with touches of class on a graphic level such as the veins that can be glimpsed on the swollen biceps of the boxers or the light layer of sweat that builds up on their bodies during the various rounds. If we combine this with the powerful blows like bee stings that strike, stun and knock down the player, the sublime realization of the faces and facial expressions of the contenders, which change from a serene and calm certainty at the beginning of the round to grimaces of pain and tiredness when subjected to the stress of an opponent's strikes or knocked over by a flurry of punches from champions like ~Stone Hands~ Duran. As you may have understood, nothing can be objected to the excellent graphic design of the game or the interesting configuration of the controls. Is this the masterpiece that all fans of the sublime art of boxing have been waiting for? Knockout Kings 2002 still remains The Champion of the World? Muhammad Ali or George Foreman? (per the most current Lennox Lewis or Mike Tyson?) The combination is by no means casual, just think of the meeting in which the aforementioned champions faced each other in 1974; an Ali considered by all to be in decline (32 years old) collides with a young, physically insurmountable and by all given as a favorite Foreman. For several rounds Ali took tremendous blows that would have destroyed anyone, he took for a quarter of an hour standing almost still, leaning on the ropes cushioning, as much as possible, the blows and stinging on rare occasions. While taking these broadsides, Ali never missed an opportunity to bring his head close to Foreman's and ask him in his ear if that was all he could do, to try harder, to hit harder. Suddenly the ~old~ Ali woke up, began to dance as only he knew how to do, began to prick and strike: to strike and dance, dance and strike. And so he got one of the most beautiful victories in boxing history ever, against an exhausted George Foreman. Is Knockout Kings 2002 therefore to be considered like Ali, rejuvenated despite his age and full of surprises at all times or is it simply a dull clay giant like Foreman? (in recent days it seems to me that a similar thing has happened between an English gentleman named Lewis and a former street thief named Tyson) After the analysis made up to now of the positive sides, one cannot pretend nothing has happened and one must the negative sides and shortcomings from which unfortunately this game still suffers are also at stake. What are these shortcomings? An uninspiring career mode, few options for creating your own virtual alter ego, meager and few menus and modes, little atmosphere (read presentation of the boxers, entrance into the ring and referee's speech) and in my opinion more serious flaw than all, the lack of a training mode, excellent instead and perfectly integrated with the career mode in the previous chapter. The judgement In conclusion, putting both positive and negative sides on the scales, I can certainly tell you that the novelties and potential for a masterpiece were all there: stunning graphics, excellent control system and wide range of all-time champions ; unfortunately despite these premises, the aforementioned shortcomings are quite serious and heavy on the playability side, certainly not capable of making this game suffer a knockout blow but undoubtedly such as to prevent its labeling as a masterpiece. It remains a good game, more suited to Boxing enthusiasts than the average gamer. Pros: Almost touching expressiveness for the faces of the boxers Fast, responsive and snappy control system A great selection of champions of all time Cons: Oversimplification of the control system Few modes not deep enough Sometimes really frustrating Materials: Screenshots ...And Still the Champion of the World Knockout Kings 2002, this is the title of the last chapter, in chronological order, of the glorious EA Sports series born and raised on PSX and PS2; this excellent series, which represents excellence in Boxing simulations for the two Sony systems, is now about to land on our beloved Xbox to allow fans and non-enthusiasts to cross the boxing gloves with a wide and very interesting selection of the most famous and strong in the world, whether they are current or from the past. The only thing that can be reproached to the previous episodes is an excessively arcade mold applied to a game that labels itself as a real sports simulation; this inconsistency should perhaps be overcome by the much acclaimed completely revolutionary and revolutionized new control system, the elimination of the power and energy bars and the abandonment of the Slugfest mode which in the previous chapters distorted the technical game mechanics and which transformed boxing into a (among other things very bad) fighting game complete with vulgar special shots and luminous effects of the fists. According to the developers, these improvements should be able to elevate the last chapter to a real masterpiece by raising it from that condition of good play but nothing more, which the previous episodes have acquired in the eyes of all the specialized press and the community of gamers more in general. Now let's see if the guys from EA Sports have succeeded in their intent. It's time to step into the ring...", "date": "2002-06-10", "grade": null}
