{"name": "Giorni di tuono", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/75687-raging-thunder-2-giorni-di-tuono.html", "text": "There are now quite a number of racing games available on the App Store, and the beauty is that the products that fall below a certain quality level can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The racer genre is always spectacular, to which the developers generally dedicate themselves to ~show off their muscles~ and demonstrate their skill in creating ever more detailed scenarios and ever more realistic cars that shoot up to the finish line. Raging Thunder 2 is just that: a clearly arcade title that offers us the beauty of six different cars and a total of twelve tracks in which to impose our skills. Collisions between cars are the order of the day and indeed constitute a source of pride and a source of power-ups in the context of a race, so always expect incorrect maneuvers from your opponents and be ready to do your best to put an end prematurely to their dreams of glory: a wall and a little push are enough. The product developed by the Swedish Pixelbite offers a driving system based exclusively on the accelerometer, so we have to tilt the device left and right, like a steering wheel, to tackle curves. There are also two buttons on the screen, respectively to brake and activate the boost, the latter regulated by a special bar which is filled by collecting the power-ups present on each track. The lack of an alternative option is surprising, usually represented by the classic virtual d-pad: in the options screen we can calibrate the sensitivity of the commands, possibly set the automatic boost and activate the vibration, but nothing more than this. Unfortunately, the repercussions of such a clear-cut choice are already felt during the first run: learning to perfectly dose the inputs requires a little practice, and the presence of an uncertain frame rate only makes the driving experience chaotic. The strength of numbers Everything can be said about Raging Thunder 2 except that it is not supported by large numbers. Beyond the six cars and the twelve tracks already mentioned above, we have a single player that counts the beauty of six different modes and an excellently crafted online multiplayer. The latter allows up to six players to challenge each other within a selected route, so we can create a game from scratch or join those already available: once we enter a lobby, we can choose our car and possibly write messages of chat to the group, through an interface that however could have been more intuitive. The cars used for the online challenges are those available to us in the career mode, therefore they can be upgraded and perhaps constitute an imbalance factor when using cars with very different performances. As for the single mode, we have the Instant Race which allows us to play immediately and without delay, perfect when we have a few minutes available since each selection is made randomly. The Single Race, on the other hand, is the classic single race in which we select a car and a track, while Time Attack allows us to memorize the curves of each track to obtain ever better times. Arcade mode is a sort of ~OutRun~ in which we tackle all twelve tracks, one after the other, crossing the finish line in any position as long as this happens within a certain time limit (which can be increased by collecting power ups along the way ). Survival is a single mode in which the car at the rear of the group is progressively eliminated, while Career Mode is undoubtedly the fulcrum of the game, a mode in which we can face eight tournaments made up of different races, with cash prizes that they allow us not only to buy new cars but also to enhance those already present in our garage through the purchase of more performing engines, bodies, wheels and spoilers. With races asking us not only to be fast but also to be aggressive, it goes without saying that a stronger, better gripping car can be the key to success, especially in the more advanced events. The technical sector also sports respectable numbers, in particular as regards the polygonal count. The tracks are not very long, on the contrary, but they are well differentiated and characterized by a good level of detail. Unfortunately, all this translates on the one hand into truly negligible pop-up effects, on the other hand into a too often uncertain frame rate, which ends up making driving via the accelerometer too chaotic and very little fluid.
