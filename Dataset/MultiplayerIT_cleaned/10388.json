However, when Rabbids Go Home was announced, it immediately became clear how the projects of the French giant for its bunnies were very different: having abandoned Rayman's ~sponsorship~ in the title, the psychic little animals set up on their own, and judging by the quality of their new adventure, the choice was extremely spot on. Stupidity of the author To be honest, the success of this Rabbids Go Home does not come as a bolt from the blue, considering how the involvement of Michael Ancel (father of Rayman and Beyond Good & Evil) in the project was well known. Together with the Ubisoft Montpellier team, the historic game designer managed to infuse the product with all those elements that the franchise lacked to walk on its legs: obviously starting with a simple, immediate and also decidedly original play structure. Everything starts from the irrational and sudden desire of the bunnies to go to the moon in order to finally be able to doze off in peace, away from the noise of the city: to do this, the demented protagonists choose the most stupid solution possible, that is to accumulate a huge pile of junk for the purpose to create a mountain capable of reaching the earth's satellite. Therefore, the user's task will be to move two Rabbids armed with a shopping cart within various scenarios, collecting all the elements that can fulfill the purpose. The standard ones are marked with white circles, and it is sufficient to pass over them to collect them, but each stage has the objective of obtaining an extra-large object, to be sent to the rabbit base camp by flushing a toilet. As is evident, the humor component plays a leading role in the charm of Rabbids Go Home, and not only due to the bizarre narrative premises: the game is constantly enriched by amusing skits, dialogues bordering on the absurd and extremely comic situations, the all seasoned with the delirious screams of the bunnies who alone manage to keep the smile on the user's face. But beyond this, the Ubisoft title can also boast solid and exciting gameplay, despite its innate simplicity. The levels are full of essential gimmicks to avoid the risk of repetitiveness, and therefore enemies of various types, environmental puzzles, timed sections and so on, make a good impression. The control system also registers excellent results: the movement of the cart is delegated to the Nunchuck's analog stick, while by shaking the Remote it is possible to attack using the shock wave of the Rabbids' cries, and there are only a couple more keys to complete the performable actions. BWAAAAAAAAHH!!! One of the most positive aspects of Rabbids Go Home lies in the evident care with which all the elements surrounding the actual playful action have been created. Ancel and his companions have been able to masterfully make every single aspect that accompanies the crazy bunny rides fun, starting with a traditionally neutral section such as the character editor. The In the Wiimote mode not only allows you to dress up your Rabbid as you like using the elements unlocked during the adventure, but it also turns out to be one of the craziest minigames that the history of video games remembers: what should be displayed on the screen the inside of the Remote that you hold, with the stresses applied to the controller reflecting on the unfortunate rabbit's body, for example by slamming it against the walls if you shake the peripheral. The variety of interaction is vaster than you might imagine, and you find yourself ~wasting time~ in this section just to smile at the Rabbid's reactions to various movements operated with the Remote. Even the technical aspect has been the subject of commendable care by the developers, starting with an impeccable graphic design. The minimalist style typical of the series does not force the Nintendo hardware to show off its limits excessively, but Rabbids Go Home does not lack colorful and detailed settings and animations worthy of a cartoon: there are also genuine touches of class such as the physical routines that regulate the movements of the trolley and its contents, not to mention the sparks a la WipeOut that are produced in the event of aextreme nights. Finally, the sound accompaniment is excellent: an improbable small orchestra of Rabbids follows the two protagonists playing gypsy rhythms that blend perfectly with the frenetic game action.", "date": "2009-11-12", "grade": "8.2"}
