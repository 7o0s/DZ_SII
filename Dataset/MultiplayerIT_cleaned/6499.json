{"name": "The Deer God", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/146625-the-deer-god-cervo-a-primavera.html", "text": "The number of games that have seen the light after successful Kickstarter campaigns is now quite high: among them, we often end up talking only about those with particularly important names behind them, but there is also an ~undergrowth~ made up of more or less curious and deserving titles, able to profitably ride the wave of crowdfunding. The Deer God belongs to this category, a game that hasn't been talked about a lot but which was still able to attract 2,800 backers, who financed the project with about 52,000 dollars. Let's introduce the project briefly, remembering that it is the result of the work of Crescent Moon Games, a team founded in 2009 and so far engaged mainly in the mobile field, with a few touches on PC via Steam as in the case we are dealing with today: from pre-alpha shown in July 2014 on Kickstarter only 8 months have passed, during which the game entered Early Access in early December, only to be released a few days ago. Impersonating a deer in a video game is by no means an everyday thing: obviously we didn't miss the opportunity, and taking advantage of the release of the final version of The Deer God we tried it. All deer in (almost) Spring, with the review of The Deer God! Bad karma With its animated introduction, The Deer God touches on an element common to any religion, tickling the most sensitive topic of all: what awaits us after death? It does so in its own way, initially putting the player in the role of a human being busy hunting a majestic deer. During the joke he ends up dying due to an accident and on the other side of the tunnel he doesn't find an old man with a long beard waiting for him, but the Deer God who gives the title to the game, who will think well of reincarnating the hunter himself in the guise of a tender fawn, to ensure that he can atone for his sins and return to his human form after settling karma. Thus begins The Deer God, a title that in its simplicity touches a fairly large number of videogame genres - as we will perhaps see too many - trying to please as many people as possible but falling into a series of design and technical errors. The basic setting is that of a roguelike with procedural levels and - in the case of the highest difficulty level - permanent death, but there are also elements taken from role-playing games. The animal we play can in fact grow under various aspects, the first of which concerns the physical one: going forward in the adventure without dying, it is in fact possible to become an adult deer, capable of making opponents much more afraid than its version from cub. Various skills are also acquired, often through barely sketched quests, to carry out which one must in any case go constantly forward without ever going back, while there is also an inventory, through which to make use of objects that give bonuses of various types or which allow to reach otherwise precluded areas of the level. In the scrolling 2D created by Crescent Moon, there is naturally no shortage of platform phases in which to avoid dangerous ravines, interspersing one's run with the opponents that The Deer God puts in front of us: that of the enemies is probably the least inspired aspect of the game design, and it is a pity because their number would also be acceptable, but in the end they always behave in the same way, making the fights boring for this reason with the consequent desire to avoid them whenever this is possible. Emotions in pixels Technically, The Deer God features light and shadow. The former are certainly made up of the visual quality of the entire work, presented in pixel art with a three-dimensional environment which, as already mentioned, sees our deer moving only horizontally. The retro graphic aspect fits perfectly with the idea of Crescent Moon, given that the developers have declared that they found inspiration in their childhood for the creation of The Deer God: the prevalence of pastel colors in fact gives the impression of being in halfway between a child's drawing and a dream, recalling the otherworldly dimension that gives the story its pretext. Scrolling in 2D takes place with a parallax effect on the backgrounds of the game, which are also of a good quality level, provided you naturally love this kind of operation that gives a nod to the past. The sound part is also decidedly good, made up of a series of music that perfectly accompanies the game action, without ever being too intrusive. Speaking instead of shadows, we cannot fail to highlight the presence of a fair number of bugs, for which spexed, not even a precise activation pattern can be found, suggesting that their main cause could be precisely the procedural generation of the levels. Beyond the bugs, the general impression is that the development team has accelerated the release of the game from the Early Access phase for no known reason, with evident approximate areas where more could have been done: among these the cooperative multiplayer mode also includes, in which the main story stands aside, making the dynamics more similar to those of an endless runner without however particularly scratching.", "date": "2015-03-12", "grade": "6.0"}
