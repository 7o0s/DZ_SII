{"name": "Fantasia canaglia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/148789-3d-fantasy-zone-ii-fantasia-canaglia.html", "text": "The history of Fantasy Zone II is a bit troubled: released in 1987, unlike the prequel designed for arcades, it was developed directly on the Master System, and the resulting limitations inexorably affected the success and fame of the title. It was only in 2008 that M2, the same team that deals with the 3D Classics series, on the occasion of the Japanese compilation for PlayStation 2 dedicated to the saga, created a heavily altered version both in terms of gameplay and technical component, developing it on the System 16 arcade board and then emulating it on the Sony machine. 3D Fantasy Zone II is the conversion of this decidedly superior edition with further modifications and additions, and finally does justice to this little gem of the genre. The new 3D Classics is Fantasy Zone II: usual great work to rediscover a great shooter! Get out of my house! As in the prequel, also in Fantasy Zone II the nice sentient spaceship Opa-Opa finds himself having to fight the invasion of cruel alien beings against his peaceful world, along seven levels (plus a final one which is the classic ~boss rush~, i.e. facing all the bosses of the game in succession until the final surprise) which appear as in the most classic of horizontal scrolling shooters. With one difference however, and that is that you can move both to the right and to the left: this modifies the gameplay a bit, but there is no mention of crossroads or alternative roads, as the game world develops, let's say so, at ~donut~, and then going right or left at the end you still return to the starting point. In addition to the numerous canonical enemies, scattered throughout the levels there are several ~bases~ suitably signaled by the radar, and it is only by destroying these that the fateful end-of-level boss arrives, in each stage characterized by different qualities and consequent different strategy to defeat him. To further complicate things there are warps which, activated by eliminating certain bases, allow you to enter a sort of ~dark version~ of the game world, with more dangerous and sneaky enemies which, however, yield a greater amount of coins: it is possible to finish the game avoiding these warps altogether, but only by defeating all the bosses in their dark version will we witness the definitive ending. Furthermore, the aforementioned coins are used for the peculiar power-up system, an indispensable classic of the genre: every now and then during the game a balloon will appear which, once touched, will allow you to enter the shop, where you will be able to buy Opa-Opa, for his primary and secondary weapons. These power-ups are, even in their basic version, remarkable and greatly facilitate the player's task, but they have a limited duration over time. Finally, exclusive to this version for Nintendo 3DS, there is an alternative ~endless~ mode, Link Loop Land, in which equipped with only one life but with upgraded weapons, enemies, bases and bosses face off in an endless sequence through a classic point system with links and multipliers, in the style of Geometry Wars and the like. Definitely well done and frenetic and spectacular from the outset, Link Loop Land is alone superior to offers that we can find on the eShop at much higher prices. The 3D effect Unlike other 3D Classics, Out Run comes to mind, here stereoscopy is perfectly useless for gameplay purposes. But it's implemented very well, adding depth and richness to the colorful two-dimensional graphics and does not affect the fluidity at all. Great job, but you can't expect less from a title of this very valid series. Cute and cuddly, guys! Like all shooters of yesteryear, Fantasy Zone II is a difficult game, which renounces compromises right from the start and which knows how to give considerable satisfaction to those who dedicate themselves to it with constancy. In the 3DS version, two factors artificially increase this situation, and therefore are to be considered defects, and if the hand cramps after a few minutes spent frantically pressing the buttons are resolved simply by switching to the autofire, kindly provided by M2, the screen size , in the non-XL versions of the Nintendo portable, are a limitation that is difficult to circumvent, which makes at least some enemies and projectiles too small to be seen and circumvented in peace. In the 3D Classics, however, M2 always allows you to change the difficulty of the game, and in this case the option is particularly appreciated by those who are no longer used, or have never been, to the uncompromising harshness of video games of the past. As usual, the work done by the talented team to best adapt the source material while reverently respecting its spirit is excellent: by LinkLoop Land we have already talked about, for the rest they range from nice options but nothing more like the possibility of saving a replay of one's performances, to other much more significant ones, such as being able to restart from the level one was facing when one died or the possibility to keep unspent coins in previous games to immediately have the best power-ups. Graphically the widescreen, to which the game is perfectly adapted, marries wonderfully with the genre for an even more rewarding experience, and for the rest everything is wonderfully colorful and cheerful (one of the characteristics of Fantasy Zone is precisely the comic and humorous setting , which distinguished it from its competitors without reaching the insane levels of Parodius), full of screen elements that move, shoot and explode without a trace of the typical slowdowns that all older players will surely remember. Honorable mention for the music by Tokuhiko Uwabo and Manabu Namiki, to be listened to comfortably in the sound test, and ear-pull for the lack of any online competitive component (even just a leaderboard, eh), which would have further increased the thrust to play and replay a title that will keep you busy for a long time.", "date": "2015-04-23", "grade": "8.5"}
