{"name": "Dead Rising - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-rising-recensione.html", "text": "My mall But let's go back to the beginning, to the most puzzling element of Dead Rising, its ludic premise. The aim of the game is explained right away: the protagonist Frank West (almost a clone of Ben Affleck) is an assault photojournalist who is investigating strange events that occurred in the village of Willamette, Colorado. The population seems to have gone mad, the streets scourged by the carcasses of cars involved in obscure accidents, the scenario is apocalyptic and Frank captures it from the helicopter that is transporting it. It's the first opportunity to dive into the game and discover its bizarre feature, the ability to photograph the scene at any time, and receive a score proportional to the quality of the shot. Our alter ego's lust knows no bounds, and the possibility of a revolutionary scoop is irresistible. He then decides to land on the roof of a shopping center to investigate what happened, the helicopter will return after 3 days to take him away from the hell that awaits him, and this is basically also the main quid of the title. To complete DR, it is sufficient to be found at the heliport 72 hours before arrival, regardless of the actions necessary to complete it, and to receive the appropriate ending among the many available. It's up to the player to dictate the tenor of the game, whether he takes refuge in a bathroom all the time, or discovers the origin of what happened, the game will end anyway. I'm a pro! Such a structure finds its perfect location in the contextual scenario chosen by Capcom, the whole adventure takes place inside the mall, progressively invaded by increasingly aggressive zombies. The natural consequence is the possibility of exploring the map in its entirety right away, establishing the maintenance offices as an operational base, a place made safe thanks to the intervention of one of the survivors, where the player can save the game and lead the survivors through the ventilation duct that connects with the rest of the building. The challenge consists in establishing safe itineraries to fulfill the missions suggested by the walkie talkie given to us by an orderly, which suggests clues to Franke to track down the survivors. The practice of backtracking, a typical ploy used in other contexts to lengthen the broth, represents the spinal cord of Capcom's effort, as the recovery missions require, as already mentioned, the passage of already known areas to get to the coveted office area . All this with one eye fixed on Frank's clock, which marks the time available for each mission. An apparently complicated and cumbersome framework, but which is resolved brilliantly with an ingenious graphical interface. Once the clock is displayed, on the right of the screen we can see a series of colored bars that highlight the time available for each mission, compared to that of 72 hours. Out of hours Regardless of these side quests, there is a special dossier concerning the cases that will lead to the resolution of the main story. Because DR has one, inextricably linked to the Romerian masterpieces, but also The X-Files and many other films, very well done and full of characters to discover. But even in this context, Capcom's willingness to offer a free experience to the player is surprising, in case you are unable to solve the main story (basically a long series of mandatory missions linked together), you will still have the possibility to continue the game and save Frank's skins and the survivors, but without understanding the causes that caused the infection. Time passes much faster than real time, 1 minute of play every five seconds, corresponding to 6 hours, these are not enough to reconcile the main story with the rescue of all the survivors, in addition to the player's natural desire for digression. It is therefore necessary to make precise choices on which imprint to give to the adventure. Curiously, the programmers seem to overshadow the story, despite the profuse care, considering it almost optional, and emphasize the survival factor of the protagonist. It goes without saying that, by opting for this solution, you lose the essence of the game and the typical ludona-narrative orchestration we are used to, excited and exciting, which does not make us regret the Resident Evil saga, although it deviates from it on practically every side. A world of zombies Technically DR is a title to watch carefully. After the amazement aroused by the cutscenes, the first glance at the game conveys an almost familiar aspect, from a product of other times. Subsequently, however, the remarkable definition of the textures emerges, unthinkable on 128 bits, and as mentioned at the beginning, the exorbitant number of zombies ddrawn on screen. Each area of the hypermarket is overflowing with staggering and insidious creatures, which oppress the player in every action and act as an obstacle to the conclusion of the missions. In certain situations, the screen is literally saturated with monsters (the graphics engine suffers only rare slowdowns), so many as to leave you speechless and make the passage seemingly impossible. But Frank can count on an offensive department that leverages the high interaction with the objects available on the map, really a lot and open to personal interpretations. Every inedible object can be used as a weapon: gardening tools, knives, sticks, iron pipes, each game reveals a new object to use, previously ignored, whose use causes new, hilarious effects. Also noteworthy is the possibility of combining actions to amplify the offensive power. Just to give an example, putting a pan on the stove, it will become incandescent, causing even more serious damage. We get to levels of grotesque humor, such as sticking traffic cones on the heads of zombies (or carnival masks), depriving them of sight, and therefore, their danger. Matter of style The violence in the game goes beyond paroxysms as one-handed disembowelments, ridiculous waves of blood spattering walls, beheadings, all displayed in morbid detail. In another stylistic context DR would have been scarcely sustainable, but the exceptional artistic work carried out by Capcom dilutes the violence in a whirlwind of colors and characters bordering on cartoonish, a truly irresistible trashy irony that seems to have picked up on the lesson of GTA, but which surpasses it in this sense thanks to the limitation of the scenario. Above all the characterization of the mall itself, which contrasts the blood of the funny Texan-style restaurants, amusement parks, and all the typically Yankee aesthetics in an almost Disney-like sauce. It is such an effective contrast that it makes the carnage hilarious and grotesque, while there are moments of seriousness inherent in the most dramatic situations. In this area everything is really conceived with commendable perfection. The audio sector proves equally commendable. There is no real main soundtrack, but a whole series of effective sound effects. The true masterpiece remains the voices of the psychopaths, essentially the mini-bosses that we will be called upon to face, characterized in a simply exceptional way. These clashes are accompanied by pieces of various genres, from techno to hip hop, decidedly spot on (to mention the one in the central park). Follow me! Reading so far it would seem that DR is a masterpiece, unfortunately this is not the case, the enormous care given to the characterization of the game has left other parts decidedly more incomplete. Given the relative brevity of a game, some of the game's problems are not entirely incidental, such as the choice to offer only one save slot to the player, and only certain places to save (the bathrooms!). Solution that leads to very frustrating situations, as if you save yourself in an unsolvable situation, you are necessarily forced to start over. Each area of the hypermarket is overflowing with staggering and insidious creatures, which oppress the player in every action and act as an obstacle to the conclusion of the missions Follow me! In this sense, the slight rpg component of the game is indicative: Frank levels up once he gets prestige points from his actions, and so does his offensive capacity, movement speed and inventory capacity. These skills remain forever regardless of the current game. The player is therefore urged to try his hand at the adventure several times, gradually flattening the difficulty curve, impassive to a protagonist who gets stronger and stronger. Another problem is represented by the AI of the survivors, very deficient, which often makes them prey to zombies, if not a total hindrance to Frank's actions. Carrying out recovery missions in these conditions is far from fun, but these are precisely the most profitable opportunities to obtain prestige points, which are therefore rather imperative. Capcom partially solves the problem thanks to the enormous empathy developed between the player and the survivors, on many occasions we have wounded mothers looking for missing daughters, rowdy girls, elderly people, and so on. All very well characterized and believable. Even the unarmed combat system, far from being an accessory in the story mode, deserved more refinement. Several moves are confusing and questionably mapped to pad keys. The title is designed mainly from a single player perspective, Live support is limited to the classificationsthan for prestige points and survival mode, obtainable after completing the main one. Target hunters The part dedicated to the unlockable objectives in the game is decidedly exhaustive, as many as 50, which leave very little to chance, and which concern every action that Frank can perform. Some decidedly hilarious, in perfect line with the spirit of the title, such as stealing the prisoner's van in the park, jumping from dizzying heights or photographing the bosses. The most infamous is the famous Zombie genocider (nemesis of zombies) which consists of killing 53,594 creatures, practically the entire population of Willamette! The ideal mode in which to unlock the most delicious objectives is the one called Infinity, in this it is even possible to obtain the famous lightsaber of the Jedi knights. Let the hunt begin! Dead Rising is not a title without flaws, but its negative sides are balanced by a game of rare charisma, with simply outstanding characterization, a perfect balance between humor and seriousness, which accompanies an experience that is surprisingly fresh and free compared to canons of the Japanese house. The enormous quantity of interactable objects, combined with the variety of uses, avoids any danger of boredom. The tendency towards gameplay based on physical combat makes it almost a gigantic and sophisticated fighting game with adventure grafts, a factor that lovers of the zombie saga par excellence (obviously Resident Evil) should take into consideration. What awaits them is a profoundly different experience, no less fun, absolutely worth trying. If you've always dreamed of a world overflowing with zombies, this is your panacea. Pros: Great design Great interaction and freedom Thousands of zombies to grind Cons: Lame save system Artificial intelligence not always up to scratch Some minor slowdowns Announced together with the new Microsoft console, Capcom's survival horror started as a silent project, almost a low-cost test to test the capabilities of the machine. Strategically dissociated from the Resident Evil brand, the game was immediately struck by the similarities with the second chapter of Romero's zombie saga (see special) and by the exorbitant number of enemies, obviously zombies, present on the screen. Even more clamor aroused the information on the gameplay, which traced the identity of an extremely non-linear product, almost a horror sandbox in stark contrast with the canons of the Japanese house. The delay in the release and the perfect internet marketing campaign, with videos released on a weekly basis, let us understand how the project had gained several places on the Capcomian priority scale. Final version in hand, we must note the effort made in offering a decidedly peculiar title, more risky than it was legitimate to think. A winning bet, considering that in the US the game is already a cult piece, with an exorbitant number of 500,000 copies sold. The reasons are revealed pad in hand, the sensational premises have had to deal with some compromises, but actually the player finds himself in front of an entire shopping center to discover, with the freedom to build his own game within the game, and then there it's zombies. So numerous as to fill the screen without the graphics engine undergoing excessive trauma (or almost), astonishing for behavioral and aesthetic characterization.", "date": "2006-09-08", "grade": null}
