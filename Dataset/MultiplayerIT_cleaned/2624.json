{"name": "ONI", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/oni_a.html", "text": "A secret agent in a skirt! The story centers on the adventures of Konoko, a disturbing purple-haired girl, who has the task of infiltrating and destroying a nascent criminal organization. She is a police officer of the Technology Crimes Task Force and, not surprisingly, during the game we witness several scenes and dialogues between her and her superiors, which prove to be very useful for understanding the dense plot, which is influenced by manga influences (a further confirmation comes from the characterization of the characters in maga-style) and cinematographic (see Nikita). A cinematographic care has been lavished in the creation of the script: twists, betrayals, pathos surround a plot that will catalyze the attention of every player thanks to its non-linearity and unpredictability, which has few equals if not in rpg productions. Konoko: the devil incarnate In Japanese Oni means Demon, and honestly there is no more appropriate term to describe Konoko. Despite her sweet appearance, she proves ruthless against crime thanks to her martial arts skills and in the use of weapons. Thanks to the possibilities offered by the PS2 controller, our heroine is able to perform an impressive number of moves: jump, run, roll, kick and punch, perform combos, use weapons and more. The training session proves to be very useful, in which you can familiarize yourself with the control system which initially proves difficult due to the use of all the joypad keys (even L3 and R3), but once you get used to it you can get around the 17 stages of which the game consists and indulge yourself in the execution of combos (going forward in the game you will always learn new ones), which prove to be very useful in the fights against the Bosses. Hand-to-hand combat is not the only way to defeat enemies, in fact our Konoko will be able to use various weapons present in the stages, each with its own characteristics and devastating effects. Each weapon adapts to particular situations and, being able to take up only one at a time, the beautiful Konoko will have to be very careful in deciding what is the case to take with her on the various missions. A small flaw can be seen in the pointing system which, while benefiting from a laser sight, does not prove to be very reliable in ~up~ work, and makes us regret the non-compatibility with the mouse-keyboard combination. Graphically speaking! According to the programmers, the real strength of the game should be the graphics, and even in this case the truth lies somewhere in between. In an attempt to recreate scenarios as real as possible, Rockstar Games has spared no expense by hiring a famous architect, David Dunn. Unfortunately, despite the good realization of the scenarios, they are a little too sparse and lacking in detail (just look at the images to confirm this). But certainly overall the graphics are of excellent workmanship: the characters are excellently characterized and created through the use of a large number of textures, which contributes to making them almost ~real~. Really impressive is the fluidity of the movements, achieved using a technique called ~interpolation animation~. In practice, the animation of the skeleton was specifically designed to avoid that when one sequence of movements is suddenly changed to another, there is a short but annoying interruption in the action, a defect that you have probably already seen in most games of combat, when you switch from attack to defense phase or after finishing a combo: you have to wait for the current animation to finish completely before starting another one. Furthermore, the game runs smoothly even in the most chaotic situations (4 characters present on the screen at the same time), maintaining a constant frame rate around 60 fps. Authentic gems are represented by the explosions caused by the weapons, which vary from a simple pistol to the most powerful of missile launchers, by blood splashes, by the vapors that come out of the pipes, in short, there is all the paraphernalia to delight our palates. Concluding... Surely Oni presents itself as an excellent game, which succeeds where many have failed, amalgamating different genres in the best possible way and giving life to a story-line worthy of the best film. A game that is in direct line with the legendary Final Fight, reinterpreting it in a modern key. Certainly a must for lovers of video games and beautiful women.. among the stars of the videoludic firmamentor there is a new Demon: the beautiful Konoko. pros: excellent characterization of the characters well thought out plot cons: poorly detailed backdrops inaccurate aiming system A demon on the PS2 In recent years, several developers have undertaken the arduous task of transferring the simplicity and immediacy of titles such as Final Fight or Streets of Rage into a three-dimensional world, but the results have not always been the happiest. Just think of Fighting Force or Urban Chaos to realize that there is still no third-person 3D beat-'em-up worthy of its two-dimensional predecessors. Like an oasis in the desert here comes Oni, the latest effort by the guys from Bungie Software, which has all the credentials to become a point of reference in its genre. It is a wise blend of different genres: fighting games, shooters, beat-'em-ups, all seasoned with the breathtaking curves of the beautiful Konoko, who could become Lara Croft's antagonist for the Videogames heroine scepter.", "date": "2001-03-03", "grade": null}
