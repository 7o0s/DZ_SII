Beyond the tears of nostalgia, time passes for everyone and although Hudson Soft no longer takes care of the franchise she created, the newborn NdCUBE (Wii Party, Mario Party 9) has firmly taken over the reins. Eleven official titles featuring a large amount of mini-games, especially the first few episodes; the challenge facing the team at each new iteration is constant and pertains to the ability to make a concept of party game in company still attractive after so many years now buried by the sands of online. The ~Goose~ style structure of the brand is well known; therefore it remains to be discovered how the additions in purely playful and inventive terms manage to breathe life into this spin-off for Nintendo 3DS. Is the party here? Up the tower Mario Party Island Tour, let's face it, offers a single mode definitely below expectations. A clichd nintendo story outline leads Bowser to place his tower-island a few steps away from the carefree and playful island of our heroes. It is with a simple pretext that the game invites you to climb its floors, guaranteeing a challenge against the CPU at each step and inserting bosses every five steps up. The offer, frankly, guarantees very little bite on the purely playful factor; the level of difficulty remains at the minimum unquestionable until the top floors, where the degree of challenge grows too weakly to guarantee satisfaction. With a design designed to make the road smooth for the less skilled and newcomers to the saga, Bowser's Tower is certainly the least interesting of the game boards as, not too absurdly, it appears as the real filler of the package. Perhaps the desire to wink at newcomers is complicit, but such a partial commitment to providing no reason to return to the Tower after the first completion cannot be let go. To make everything even less defensible there is a focus on luck (a factor unfortunately present in all the boards) which sometimes brings with it obvious frustration; the choice at the crossroads of the minigame is the only action that will separate one floor from the other: which, frankly, is very little. Adding up the team's decision not to guarantee her exclusive mini-games, the quest runs out quickly without leaving emotions or giving particular fun. The focus of the title definitely lies elsewhere. Mario Party has historically been a companion title, and it is almost endearing to note that Nintendo firmly pursues the path of offline multiplayer. The Kyoto company is perhaps the last to stand as a bulwark of overall entertainment in the same room and from this point of view Island Tour worthily continues the tradition for laptops. As was the case for the Nintendo DS chapter, even on the new portable a single cartridge is enough to get three other friends to download the software and share the game. Always a winning idea, as it fits perfectly with the philosophy of portable sharing, also thanks to a truly negligible download time, accessible in a few seconds. Thanks to seven game boards, the offer multiplies, guaranteeing an ideal fusion with the prerogatives of portability, first of all the battery; each board provides its own unique completion time, so as to facilitate management for those who find themselves far from power sources. To be honest, there would also be indications regarding skill, luck and quantity of mini-games, a pity that they are however very subjective, especially the factor linked to the randomness of the dice roll. But you know, under the guise of Mario Party there is a nice way to laugh and make fun of each other, and it must be said that the result is convincing; specific levels are characterized by good environmental gimmicks, which add dynamism and bite to a competition that in the long run risks becoming bland. Mario Party Island Tour is a decent portable party game, but we are far from the glories of the franchise The 3D effect In Island Tour, NdCUBE has opted for a rather forgettable use of the 3D effect. Perhaps thanks to the recently released Nintendo 2DS, the use of the title absolutely does not make you feel the lack of parallax; games to which the element of depth adds depth can be counted with one hand. Considering the movement-based nature of the console of some games, the 3D element, due to structural limitations of the technology, sometimes becomes more of an ostacolo that not a nice playful addition. Mini-mini It is not easy for a 15-year-old franchise to still offer gameplay freshness and stubbornness today. Mario Party Island Tour defends itself in half: quantity and quality are of a good level, with a consistent number of skill-based games, others that take their cue from the developer's ~wii partyan~ curriculum, others that unfortunately remain anchored to luck-based challenges . It is a balance that now seems stable for the saga; long gone are the days when you dared to offer deep, innovative mini-games designed for the specific occasion (see splitting the pad and using the microphone on Gamecube) but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The little courage translates into many mini-games that remain fun when faced in competition with opponents of the same level and ideal for raising the bar, even on those apparently simple games with a purely arcade flavor. To alternate are games based on physical keys, on touch controls and also on the accelerometer and gyroscope. And if the hunt for the stars is a thing of the past, NdCUBE has well thought of filling the title with many collectibles and unlockables, made so thanks to the coins that will accumulate session after session. The absence of those types of mini-games so dear to nostalgics, such as 2 against 2 or 3 against 1, weighs heavily; perhaps the choice to lighten the multiplayer load has decreed its absence, however it is sad to note how the focus of game design has been based on providing continuous all-against-all matches and not on creating improvised circumstantial unions between the players.
