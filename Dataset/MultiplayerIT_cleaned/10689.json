{"name": "Far Cry 6", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/far-cry-6-recensione.html", "text": "In its own way, Far Cry 6 marks a small revolution for the Ubisoft series, putting us in command of a character who speaks, who we see during the intermission sequences and in the exploratory phases inside the outposts, who boasts his own personality and who can be a man or a woman depending on the choice we are going to make in the very first stages of the campaign. At the same time we are faced with a traditional chapter from the point of view of the structure, equipped with a large map, that of the Caribbean island of Yara , clearly inspired by Cuba, which we will be able to explore freely to try our hand at main or secondary missions. The territory includes three large regions, each with a different group of revolutionaries to try to ally with in order to oust the dictator Anton Castillo. Played by Giancarlo Esposito, Breaking Bad's Gus Fring and The Mandalorian's Moff Gideon, Castillo represents another traditional element for the franchise, namely the ruthless but charismatic villain who opposes the hero of the moment and who can count on the support of several lieutenants. It goes without saying that we will have to eliminate them all, one by one, before facing El Presidente and completing the mission. Will Dani Rojas really be the spark that will guide the men and women of the Libertad rebel group towards victory, allowing him to free their isolate from the oppressor? And above all, will this sixth chapter of the Ubisoft series mark the best possible debut for the brand on new generation platforms? Find out in the Far Cry 6 review. History Far Cry 6, the protagonist Dani Rojas in the male version It is a decisive night for Dani Rojas: an orphan, raised in the midst of violence, who has become a guerrilla, he wants to abandon Yara once and for all together with a childhood friend. Everything is ready, the boat that will take them clandestinely to America is waiting for them at the port, but something doesn't go right: Castillo's troops break into the neighborhood and start shooting. Dani manages to escape somehow and reaches the however, once offshore, the boat is intercepted by the coast guard. In the hold crammed with people, none other than the president Anton Castillo descends, evidently looking for someone: his young son Diego, who was trying to flee together with the desperate. The boy agrees to return to Esperanza in exchange for an act of clemency, but the dictator opens fire on the ship and everyone is killed... except for Dani.

However, Dani's energies and thirst for revenge against Castillo will not be enough: to make the revolution in Yara it will be necessary to obtain the help of other factions. Let's talk about the Montero family, which operates in the Madrugada region and is led by Carlos, a gruff and lethal but fair man; of the Legends of '67, the old revolutionaries who had ousted Anton's father, led by the exuberant El Tigre and active in the territory of El Este together with the rebellious students of La Moral; and finally the Maxima Matanzas, who carry on their fight based on music and transgression in the Valle de Oro. Far Cry 6, Dani during a meeting with the Monteros As mentioned at the beginning, compared to the previous episodes Far Cry 6 allows you to get to know, see and hear the protagonist of the story, in particular through interlude sequences that we found really well written and reminded us a lot of the excellent ones of the Wolfenstein series: a mix of violence and dark humor, but also of many emotions told in the right way. Here, in this sense it must be said that the villain played by Giancarlo Esposito is certainly convincing and has an undoubted depth, especially in the ending, but the his is a stereotyped and frankly predictable figure, devoid of the peculiarities that still today make us remember characters such as Vaas Montenegro, Pagan Min and Joseph Seed. In this sense, we appreciated the supporting actors more, capable of bringing non-trivial situations to the screen and of doing so in a sometimes surprising way. Far Cry 6 does not have Italian dubbing We don't honestly know what the reason is, but Far Cry 6 does not include a dubbing in Italian: the game is only partially localized in our language, therefore with interface and subtitles. It is a scelta which inevitably makes you turn up your nose, given that the previous episodes were all dubbed and this chapter boasts speech in English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Japanese, but not in Italian, in fact. Even if you know English and want to play without watching the subtitles, you will inevitably end up missing something due to the marked Spanish accent of the characters, which makes sentences unclear in excited moments. Sin. Structure Far Cry 6, a ride on horseback If on the narrative front Far Cry 6 boasts some interesting innovations, the same cannot be said of the game structure, which follows quite faithfully what has been seen in the previous chapters of the series. So there are the regions, each with its bosses to eliminate at the end of a more or less substantial sequence of missions, and the inevitable abundance of secondary assignments, treasures to discover, posts to destroy and so on. The progression is regulated by an RPG-style level of experience that clarifies very well which areas are or are not within our reach and which ones it would be better to keep away from. Furthermore, the presence of anti-aircraft turrets makes it impossible to quickly explore the entire island aboard an airplane or a helicopter, unless they have been neutralized first. Far Cry 6, a fight with a helicopter The limitations with respect to the desire to move, however, are very few: Far Cry 6 immediately unlocks equipment that in the past had to be conquered, from the parachute to the wingsuit, from the grappling hook to the possibility of ~ordering~ any vehicle and seeing it appear a few meters and then get on board and follow the path that will take us to the next objective. Motorcycles, quads, cars, off-road vehicles, armored vehicles, trucks, tanks, the aforementioned helicopters and planes, snappy buggies and even horses or drones with the passenger compartment will always be available provided they are deposited in the garage, but we can also opt for the convenience of quick trips to any previously visited point of interest. In short, we are not forced to explore the scenario except in the way we prefer. Far Cry 6, a car ride to quickly cross the map Although these simplifications reduce downtime, the duration of the campaign stands at twenty-seven hours even where something is left behind, placing Far Cry 6 probably as the longest and most substantial chapter in the series. Furthermore, having completed the story, you can dedicate yourself to an endgame that will be updated from week to week, or dedicate yourself to the tasks left pending pending the already announced DLC dedicated to the most iconic villains of the franchise. They are particularly interesting, from this point of view view, Special Operations. These are missions accessible within any hub, in parallel with the expeditions of our guerrillas aimed at the simple obtaining of new resources, which can be tackled alone or in cooperation. For the moment there are two: Mesozoic, set in a huge theme park dedicated to dinosaurs, and Maceo, which takes us to the city of the same name. In both cases, the goal is to steal a dangerous chemical compound and bring it to safety. Gameplay Far Cry 6, the protagonist armed with a rifle cleans up an enemy position Certainly a synthesis of the latest experiences of the French company, with particular reference to Ghost Recon Wildlands (the review) and Ghost Recon Breakpoint (the review), the gameplay of Far Cry 6 moves between ups and downs, characterized as mentioned by a system of progression that aims to ensure that the player is able to self-regulate in the face of the excessive challenge of certain areas of the map which however are not precluded to him. The developers have rightly thought of giving the headshots a priority value regardless of the level of experience, and it must be recognized that eliminations from a distance can play a fundamental role in the approach maneuvers to a base full of soldiers belonging to Castillo's troops, but the close-up stealth between crouching and daggers proves sketchy and uninspiring. Far Cry 6, the protagonist advances with guns blazing at sunset However, problems arise when the fighting becomes tighter and more frenetic: in this situation the accuracy of the hitboxes often appears lacking, the assault rifles become almost unusable due to Dani's shaky aim (which can only be mitigated at a certain point, by the unlocking of specific extensions) or of the very short loader, and there are some situations in which these factors stand out very clearly, forcing us to repeat sequences again and again in chere it seems to shoot blanks against the targets. The artificial intelligence of the enemies does not help in this sense, who often and willingly focus solely on numerical superiority and on any special and armored types to flush us out and inflict really huge damage, with shots that at sometimes it is not even clear where they come from and from which we can only recover by moving away quickly or using the ~medicines~ based on an indicator that recharges over time. Far Cry 6, the adorable Chorizo can be petted like all other Amigos The management of the arsenal appears a bit confusing, again with very few limitations: we will be able to equip any unlocked weapon and at any time, for example a rocket launcher where we have to face a tank or a helicopter, but the upgrades deriving from the installation of accessories and projectile modification will only be possible at traditional outpost workbenches. You will hardly allow yourself the luxury of trying out the special weapons or variants of the Supreme, preferring something more practical and effective: a wasted opportunity in terms of game design. Amigos, i.e. companions, in the case of Far Cry 6 are all animals all too intelligent that they must be unlocked during the campaign, by completing specific tasks. There are the silent ones that act as a distraction for hostile soldiers, such as the adorable Chorizo, the paraplegic puppy, or those that attack violently, such as the crocodile Guapo and the rooster Chicharron. However, resorting to their help is not essential, when you get on a vehicle you will leave them behind and at a certain point you will almost forget to call them. The cooperative mode Far Cry 6 can be played cooperatively with a friend, and we got to try this experience too during our tests. Using a normal invitation, you enter the host's game and play according to his rules, i.e. the level of experience reached by him and by the enemies on the map. However, any progress is stored for both users, and if you want it is possible to face the entire campaign in two: an extra that for some people could be of great value. Technical realization Far Cry 6, the tropical landscapes of Yara We played Far Cry 6 on PS5 and there is no doubt that the introduction of 60 fps makes a big difference compared to the previous generation of consoles, even better if accompanied by a resolution that reaches 4K (non-native, we imagine) and a texture pack optional that visibly increases the definition of the various assets, adding important details to the game world. Well, unfortunately we must say that the island of Yara visually did not conquer us, indeed we found the graphic elements a bit too generic adorn the landscapes, none of which struck us in a way comparable to the many suggestive glimpses of Assassin's Creed Valhalla (the review). A big lack for a tropical island that should make its views a strong point. Far Cry 6, the dictator Anton Castillo with his traditional expression of disappointment The cutscenes run at 30 fps, albeit with a few too many shots, but they use more sophisticated polygonal models and an excellent direction in our opinion, which allows them to play an important characterization role on the basis of brilliant writing, which puts scene situations bordering on the absurd and brings us closer than ever even to the protagonist, his motivations and his points of view. In-game quality is that to which Ubisoft has accustomed us, the day-night cycle enhances the backgrounds with a solid lighting system and support for HDR, but the surfaces are a bit too flat and the combined use of cubemaps and screen space reflection on the puddles obviously fails to fill the lack of ray tracing in the console versions. We wrote for insight to know all the differences of Far Cry 6 PC version with PS5 and the exclusive features. Far Cry 6, Dani in the company of the Legends of '67 The DualSense controller is exploited in a convinced way by the game, with the various weapons that produce a different reaction of the adaptive triggers and the haptic feedback that transmits the blows suffered, the fury of the battles or the roughness of the terrains that we cover on foot or on board a vehicle. Finally, as regards the sound sector, the interpretation of the dialogues in English is quite convincing but the music that we will hear during our stay in Yara will be mostly of Latin American derivation: if you don't appreciate the genre you will always find yourself turning off the 'car stereo.", "date": "2021-10-06", "grade": "7.8"}
