In fact, Star Rush represents an attempt to give freshness to the series, which in recent years seems to have lost a bit of its edge. The NDcube guys have thus brought some rather important structural innovations, which aim to make the game system more immediate and faster. Let's find out together with what results. Mario Party: Star Rush is a particular spin-off that gives a breath of fresh air to the series A shower of stars Mario Party: Star Rush doesn't go too subtle and successfully abandons any narrative ambitions, making it immediately clear to the player that, if he were looking for a deep single-player experience, he should go elsewhere: not that this is new for the series , mind you, but at least you get out of the ambiguous mediocrity of the Browser tower seen in the previous portable iteration, Island Tour. With most of the modes still to be unlocked, ~Toad Fighting~, the main attraction of the new playground, is thus given great prominence from the very beginning. After years, the series has in fact abandoned its classic ~Game of the Goose~ structure, to offer scoreboards characterized by great freedom of movement and by the presence of a single character: Toad. The other heroes of the Mario ~family~ instead have a secondary role and can be recruited as helpers both during the game and by using the appropriate amiibo statuettes. Another feature of this mode is the presence of a small number of bonus boxes, which push players to take advantage of each step to decide whether to give priority to recruiting helpers, collecting coins or reaching one of the bosses to try to conquer the stars. Although the activation of the mini-games is not automatic after each roll of the dice, interactivity is in any case guaranteed: in fact, the players move at the same time in each turn and can activate alternative paths on the board, or take advantage of the ability of one of the helpers to get benefits. If we exclude some loading a little slower than expected, the dead times between one shift and another are therefore reduced to a minimum. Thanks then to the presence of scenarios with a level design that is anything but obvious, games in company are always fun and not too subject to the whims of fate (which does not, however, lose its role as arbiter of the dispute). The 3D effect This time NDcube has opted for more classic mini-games than those seen in Island Tour. Without actions based on the movement of the console, the 3D effect is thus a pleasant addition to a technical sector without obvious flaws. In addition, it is also well exploited in some specific situations, such as in the challenges of ~Surf Leaf~. You don't live on Toad alone ~Toad Fight~ is not the only attraction of Mario Party: Star Rush and, after a few hours of play, you finally have access to the complete package. Not making the modes accessible right away is actually a choice that we find it hard to share in a product of this type, even more so in a chapter that, on paper, offers little or nothing to solitary players. In the absence of real extra content, apparently the developers have not found anything better to restore a vague sense of progression: so we find ourselves having to earn a fair amount of party points not only for having a handful of characters in more, but also to access the only mode designed exclusively for the single-player, or Fulmina-torre, a sort of vertical minefield. Even on the characters front, there is a risk of being deceived by the dedicated section: of the fifty-seven entries in the encyclopedia of heroes and villains, in fact, only twelve are actually playable, to which must be added the four chromatic variants of Toad. However, the lack of content is not limited only to collectibles: even the mini-games are not many, although they are generally better thought out and diversified than what we have seen in recent years. A dozen of these then find their maximum expression in the Monetathlon, a series of ten coin races, without dice and exclusively linked to the player's ability to prevail in fifteen different trials. There is also room for rhythmn game enthusiasts but, together with a puzzle mode and a linear reinterpretation of the classic snakes and ladders, ~Concert Guys~ is more of a mini music gallery than a real game within a game. Finally, we close with a brief consideration on the absence di any online mode, which would have discreetly combined with the new structure of the scoreboards and would certainly have given added value to the Monetathlon challenges as well. A real shame, because the barrier of owning a console is much more limiting than having a few more controllers, despite the confirmation of the download mode and the arrival of the ~guest~ version on day one to play locally with a single cartridge.", "date": "2016-10-05", "grade": "7.5"}
