Yes, simulators with hyper-realistic graphics have their charm, but throwing blue shells at your opponent gives priceless satisfaction. Over the years, many have tried to exploit the wake of Mario Kart to attract the attention of players with similar products, never managing to replicate the same quality of the source of inspiration. This is also true for Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway. Nickelodeon, on the strength of its most famous series, tries once again to offer an enjoyable kart game suitable for everyone, but - we tell you right away - it only manages to copy the most important ideas, without however perfectly replicating that balance dominated by Nintendo. Let's see all the details in our Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway review. From Spongebob to Korra Spongebob is just one of many and arguably one of the most beloved characters in Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway is exactly how you imagine it. We control a character, drive a kart or a motorcycle and complete courses and cups with the moves we most expect, including drifts, jumps with stunts, objects to use to hit opponents and shortcuts to be exploited to gain an advantage. The most visible difference is that of the cast. Nickelodeon can exploit many different franchises and this creates a great heterogeneity both in terms of characters and paths. We will be able to use characters from Spongebob, Avatar, Catdog, the Ninja Turtles, Garfield, Jimmy Neutron and more. The various characters are well done, even if they are clearly adapted to a single unique graphic style and in some cases the result may not be fully pleasing. The dubbing, on the other hand, is lacking not so much in quality as in quantity: the few available sentences are repeated all too often during the courses. You can perform stunts in Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway to get boost bonuses Each character then has different stats in terms of weight, maneuverability, speed, acceleration and so on. However, we can customize our vehicle with various elements: in addition to the main body, we can define elements such as the rims and the muffler, which condition the values of the vehicle and therefore balance or accentuate the differences between the various riders, depending on personal needs or tastes. . Personalization has no aesthetic limits and allows you to mix characters and kart parts from different sources: this also means that you can create vehicles that are an eyesore and that clash heavily with your driver, but that extra half point at speed we just can't deny it. Skills and paths Local co-op is a good feature in Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway Where Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway tries to differentiate itself is in the ~slime~ that gives the game its name. As mentioned, in the middle of the paths you can collect objects to use to hit opponents or to defend yourself or get some other type of bonus. To all this, however, are added equippable skills, the first of which is an active move to be loaded by getting dirty with green slime. Once a bar is filled, for example, you can use the skill that allows you to get a turbo, or to hit nearby opponents and beyond. Then there are two passive skills that are activated automatically depending on the situation and the actions performed, or even randomly. For example, some give a speed bonus when hitting an opponent, others prevent you from taking damage while on slime slides, still others allow you to place obstacles every time you get an item. Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway offers various cups from four thematic courses Between statistics and these additional abilities it is possible to clearly customize your pilot, even if the truth is that it is not that fundamental given the low level of difficulty and the simplicity of the routes. These never reach the level of quality of the best Mario Kart tracks and often lack surprises or elements that can really challenge the player. What is missing is that touch of chaos typical of karting games. There are some shortcuts and ~slime slides~ that ask us to jump in rhythm to avoid bumps, but overall the courses only ask us to perform a couple of drifts (which if held for several seconds then give a turbo effect) and not to crash into every guard rail in order to finish first. The controls are simpleand the various levels of difficulty make the game perfect even for the very young. The latter are probably the best audience for Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway, also because they will probably have more time to invest in progression. Progression and modalities Each Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway character can be customized through various elements Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway offers many characters, around 40, with dozens of pieces for their vehicles and a series of paints to change the aesthetics of the kart and the motorbike. The aforementioned additional, passive and active skills are then added. A few items are unlocked from the start, but most items must be purchased with currency that you accumulate as you play. The pace of progression isn't high and it takes several races and cups to unlock a single character. Getting everything certainly takes a long time: it can be good or bad depending on personal tastes, but if you only want to play once in a while you won't be able to enjoy all the characters. Drifts help you get speed boosts in Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway At least there are many modes to enjoy. In addition to the classic free races there are the discounted cups with four thematic tracks, but also special challenges with specific objectives (such as doing a certain number of stunts before finishing a race) as well as timed races and all-against-all or team arena challenges . There are for example battles in which whoever hits their opponents ten times first wins, or a capture the flag (a bit too chaotic, honestly). There's also a clearly Splatoon-inspired mode where you have to drive around littering the arena with your team's slime - whoever has the highest percentage of color on the ground wins. Added to this is the possibility of playing in local cooperative. There is also online, but the number of players is very limited and there is no cross-play. We couldn't find any online players in our tests. Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3 Slime Speedway is to be considered as an offline game rather than an online one.", "date": "2022-11-02", "grade": "7.0"}
