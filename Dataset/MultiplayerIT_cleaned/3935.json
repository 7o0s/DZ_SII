{"name": "Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sky-gamblers-storm-raider-2-recensione.html", "text": "Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders 2 sums up a franchise that has given so much to fans of aerial shooters for mobile devices, and does so six years after the release of the first episode of the series set during the Second World War. The formula remains the same as always, strengthened by a widely adjustable gameplay, which allows you to control the aircraft in a more or less immediate and accurate way, to meet the needs of any type of user. Similarly, the options allow you to change the quality of the graphics and the frame rate to ensure that the game runs consistently even on less advanced terminals. Finally, the three difficulty levels substantially change the degree of challenge of the experience, transforming it from a simple target shooting session into something certainly more difficult and complex, which requires a certain commitment and often multiple attempts to get to the end. of each assignment. From a structural point of view, Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders 2 appears fairly rich, and although the twelve missions that make up the single player campaign can be completed in a short time, they are supported by customized battles within seven scenarios belonging to the war conflict , as well as a very robust online multiplayer mode in terms of matchmaking, which allows you to challenge other players taking advantage of eight different stipulations, which include frenetic free-for-all, cooperative, team deathmatch and more. Gameplay, missions and technique Two short tutorials allow you to immediately familiarize yourself with the interface and the control system, adjustable as mentioned on different layouts to ensure greater realism or a distinctly arcade approach, to be managed by default via a mix of accelerometer and touch controls. The automatic calibration (which can be recalled from the pause menu when needed) works very well and, in general, the tilt solution guarantees great precision of the standard maneuvers, to which are added special movements to be performed via horizontal or vertical swipes on the screen to quickly change direction . In short, the same system appreciated last year with Sky Gamblers: Infinite Jets. The combat mechanics are those to which the franchise and the genre have accustomed us, and which focus on the reactivity of evasive actions when an enemy is targeting us, in order to get to the right distance and open fire at our turn. The progression is supported by the possibility of spending the money won in battle to purchase new aircraft or components that improve their characteristics, including weapons, so as to obtain the perfect vehicle for our personal approach to the clashes. In short, everything proceeds in the best possible way, and even the sound sector helps to create the right atmosphere, communicating the noise of the bursts, the reloading mechanism of the machine guns and the sound of the engines in the best possible way. Unfortunately, the artistic direction does not dare that much, and so it happens that the situations of the campaign generally turn out to have already been seen, linked to a pattern that the aerial shooter genre itself has abused over the years: identification of a group of enemies, combat, arrival of hostile reinforcements. Beyond the lack of a certain originality, in any case, the experience of Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders 2 is also confirmed with this very solid and fun new episode, capable of giving beautiful emotions and involving thanks to a extremely detailed graphics, which perhaps do not give a great visual impact to the airplanes but certainly do not save money as regards the large and suggestive scenarios.", "date": "2018-11-26", "grade": "8.0"}
