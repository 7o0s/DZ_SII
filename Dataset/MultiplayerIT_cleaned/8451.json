Imagine his joy at having landed such a coveted job. Ours counted on having a good life after having killed hordes of idiotic enemies by wielding modern and very powerful weapons. Besides, he knew the effort was minimal. His colleague and friend the Master Chief had told him one day, sipping an ice-cold Vodka by the edge of a swimming pool, where there was also Lara Croft practicing how to whine to be more profound in her next game (you know, questions of 'close physical intimidation'): ~Actually, there isn't much to do. You pretend to be a tough guy full of adrenaline, they shoot toy bullets at you that do little or nothing to you and all you have to do is dry them and keep going along that curved line called level. ~ Zaku, not convinced by his friend's story, replied: ~Are you sure they don't hurt you? In my opinion, you're making it too easy.~ ~But yes, before in video games you died a lot more. Now there is energy that recharges itself, so, after a few hits received, you just need to get under a stone, give yourself a scratch at the zebedee and the that's it! You come back neat and pinto! Trust me, it's a godsend! If they put a helmet on your head, you don't even have to force yourself to act.~ - concluded Master Chief throwing splashes of water with his foot against Kratos who had joined the party with his new thong stolen from a Teletubbies. On his first day on the job, Zaku showed up in his game, Okinen, with a one-hundred-and-thirty-toothed smile, all of judgment. When he was given the go ahead he boldly advanced along the initial corridor, then, having reached the first enemy, he stood in front of him with a forced gesture and made a gesture to shoot him (you know, he wanted to try that rechargeable energy story). After a few blows ours got to safety and waited to get back in strength. He spent six hours waiting, but nothing, the energy didn't come back. Taken by discouragement, he decided to leave his lair and ran past the enemy, making faces at him during the leap. Too bad for him who ended up smashed into an abyss and lost his first life. At that point he realized that something was not right. It was then that he looked around and understood: yes, he was the protagonist of a video game, but one of the strongly retro ones inspired by the very difficult classics for the NES. In short, he could die and he would soon discover that from there to the end of the game it would happen to him more often than not. ~Holy shit Sara Tommasi~, was the only sentence produced by his brain before returning to his duties as a hero. Nintendo presents... Don't be fooled by the caricatured tones of the article's introduction, because it actually describes very well what Oniken is: a Ninja Gaiden-like platformer for the NES, with sequences in vehicles, totally focused on proposing a more retro gaming experience possible, with all the implications that this entails. Bottom line, don't expect a health walk because you will be disappointed. It's hard, bloody hard, and it does nothing to ease the gamer's woes. By purchasing it you will find levels that must be learned by heart and bosses who require good mastery of the controls and knowledge of their attack patterns to be eliminated. Zaku has two weapons: his lightsaber, inspired by Capcom's Strider, and grenades that he can collect in crates scattered throughout the levels. In the same it is possible to find an enhancement of the sword and medikits that are used to recover the energy consumed. The six levels that make up the game are in turn divided into different stages. Every now and then it happens that the platform phases alternate with rides aboard futuristic vehicles in which you have to avoid obstacles by eliminating enemies and, sometimes, bosses (see the mechanical bear of the ice caves). From the level design point of view, the developers were very good and scattered the short maps of secrets and shortcuts, but without exaggerating. Staying on the design, we also want to praise some bosses with well-crafted and refined attack patterns, which made us sweat hard to defeat them. It's been a long time since we had to commit to a platformer like this. Missing... a plumber As you may have noticed from the images, Oniken focuses on a very particular graphic style. Not only is the graphics completely in pixel art, but the color palette used is exactly that of the NES. The overall feeling will make those who lived and loved that period go crazy with joy, as they will find themselves living a videogame experience that would certainly not have disfigured on Nintendo's toaster. One of the big bosses Even the soundtrack is inspired by that period, with excellent songs che magnify the celebration of that glorious past. Unfortunately Oniken is not free from defects. We will try to completely avoid discussing production issues, since we are talking about an indie product that costs four euros. Let's just say that there are some flaws, but it's nothing compromising (therefore no big bugs). Unfortunately we can't gloss over some gameplay issues. The most obvious is the lack of responsiveness of the controls when you need to perform some more precise shots, incidentally those in jump. It takes some timing to jump and throw a grenade at the right moment, but sometimes the results don't come even if you've done everything right. In normal situations it is nothing dramatic, but in the most agitated moments we notice it. Another little problem is given by the collisions between the sprites, sometimes really penalizing for the player. It happens that you find yourself with the energy diminished by blows that have just grazed the protagonist. Here, too, you get used to it, but a little more precision would have been welcome so as not to go crazy when you have to perform millimeter maneuvers.", "date": "2012-07-06", "grade": "8.0"}
