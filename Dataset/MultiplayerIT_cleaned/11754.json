{"name": "WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2008 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2008-recensione_c.html", "text": "In the chaos of toys imported into Italy following the new-found success of wrestling, maybe someone will remember what looked like a ~bas-relief~ by John Cena, distinguished by a highly inspired commercial in which a satisfied child stroked the wrestler's abs and pecs. Who knows why, this line was almost immediately withdrawn from stores. What makes us think is not so much the genius of certain advertisers, since they have accustomed us to many other masterpieces, but the fact that the WWE sports-show has reached such levels of popularity as to justify even the marketing of these ~bas-reliefs~. From one extreme to the other, a disaster (which has very little to do with wrestling itself) was enough to cancel everything: free-to-air Smackdown broadcast, toys, backpacks, notebooks and so on. And it is no coincidence that Chris Benoit is no longer available among the characters of Smackdown vs Raw ... Custom Wrestling Cross-platform products have accustomed us to a ~traditional~ approach, even when switching to an atypical console such as the Nintendo DS, with often mediocre results: accurate reproduction was sought where it was difficult (if not impossible) to obtain. With Smackdown vs Raw 2008 we are therefore witnessing a small revolution, or rather a title that is completely redesigned to marry with the peculiar characteristics of the device on which it must work. In this case, this translates into a completely new experience: the dozens of modes present on the other systems disappear and make room for a single career mode, but it is also possible to play a free match by selecting the protagonists and the type of stipulation. Once the career has begun, we will have to choose a character from the many available, so we will find ourselves playing the role of a wrestler who has just returned from a long injury and wants to establish himself quickly. To do this, we will not give up changing rosters (between Raw, Smackdown and ECW) to defeat anyone who stands between us and the title of WWE Champion. The plot that we will follow is rather simple and linear, and develops within various environments: the locker rooms, the weight room, the canteen, the interview room and the general manager's office. Very often we will be able to explore the locations in search of useful tokens to increase our free time between one meeting and another, time that we can use to train to improve our characteristics. It is clear, however, that the action in the ring will mark the time and progress... Wrestle with the stylus How does Smackdown vs Raw 2008 work on the Nintendo DS? Let's also say that the game has nothing to do with the versions made for all other consoles: once you find yourself in front of your opponent, it's only the touch screen and our ability to operate it that determines the outcome of each phase of the meeting. Three icons of different types appear on the screen, which depending on the color (yellow, orange, red) imply greater difficulty in performing the related action. In fact, when you press on one of them, arrows appear that indicate the movement that we will have to draw with the stylus for the maneuver to be successful: in the case of the yellow icon, you just need to draw a line for the wrestler to throw a punch or a kick to the opponent; in the case of the orange icon, in general, you must first perform a quick ~tap~ and only then follow the trajectories; finally, in the case of the red icon, it is very often necessary not only to draw lines, but also to fill in ~spiral~ bars by quickly drawing concentric circles. The result is different moves depending on the position in which our character is as well as the area of the ring in which we fight, and in the case of more complex maneuvers we will have to guess the combinations several times in a row. On the upper screen it is possible to keep an eye on the situation of the two contenders, because the appearance of heavily damaged areas can give us the possibility of executing our ~finisher~ or simply of carrying out a ~pin~ for the count of three: this maneuver is also is regulated by the touch screen, in this case we are asked to perform very rapid ~taps~ so that the opponent remains on the ground. Technical realization As for the graphics, the developers of the Amaze team have done a really good job, rightly concentrating the power of the Nintendo DS in only one of the two screens. The results are excellent, with the wrestlers not reaching the levels of similarity also seen in the PSP version but coming close, and above all boasting a huge number of good animations, including the features that have entered the scene. The frame rate does not fall meadowsnever, and the scenarios are quite well done, with a good level of detail and an unspectacular but respectable audience. The sound sector is really excellent, with all the music of the various wrestlers and a fair amount of speech (the announcers, in this case). There is no signed soundtrack that has always distinguished the series, but this is absolutely not a problem, on the contrary they earn the sound effects. As far as multiplayer is concerned, unfortunately the game does not have an online mode and allows you to challenge a friend only if he too has a cartridge: shortcomings that should be remedied in view of the 2009 edition. The Italian translation, to conclude, unfortunately very often it turns out to be approximate or even produces gross errors (one name rather than another). Comment It is a pleasure to see that every now and then the purely commercial logic that dominates multiplatform products is set aside to create something different and, in its own way, courageous. Smackdown vs Raw 2008 on Nintendo DS would have been quite successful even if the developers had limited themselves to creating a mere imitation of the game as we know it for its ~major~ versions, but it would not have exploited the particularities of the Nintendo console in any way. The result is an absolutely original title, a sort of mix of many minigames that together build the encounters. It is clear that an experimental approach brings with it inevitable flaws; in this case it is a question of the total lack of movement as well as, in some way, of ~decision-making power~: we are guided by the game without actually leading it, and if in standard matches all this makes sense, the same cannot be said when a stipulation special forces us to submit the opponent with a hold, because we won't be the ones to decide when and how to do it. Ultimately, we are faced with a really interesting game, which shows us a different perspective and which cannot avoid some physiological ~mistakes of youth~. For next year we expect the introduction of the d-pad for movements and an online mode... Pros: Very innovative Great graphics and sound A large number of fighters and moves... Cons: ...but only one mode of depth Limited gameplay No online", "date": "2007-12-07", "grade": null}
