{"name": "Gt Pro Series", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gt-pro-series.html", "text": "Plastic steering One of the fortunes (or misfortunes, depending on your point of view) of the wii-remote is that it can be adapted almost completely and cheaply to any game you are playing: one of the most famous historical fakes of the last year was the famous appendage formed by a sword and shield that would have been able to transform the player into a fully armed Link, the desire of a well-known accessory house to create plastic supports to be applied (or rather, added) to the wii is now well known -mote to visually transform it into tennis racket or golf club. Ubisoft, which undoubtedly sees a long way, given the presence of two racing titles in its launch line-up, has seen fit to insert a plastic steering wheel inside each package of Gt Pro Series and Monster 4x4 World Circuit together with the Wii remote control in order to recreate the sensation of driving in all respects. The accessory (developed by trustmaster and of absolute quality) is presented in the box disassembled and made up of three easily assembled pieces to which -as in the best Japanese animated cartoon about big robots- the most important central part is added, the wii- mote. The steering wheel is solid in the hand, decidedly smaller than the one you find yourself using in everyday life when driving a car, but with the same tactile feeling and good ergonomics. Gt Pro Series, compared to its Gamecube version, has been completely revolutionized in terms of controls, in this Wii version it is obviously possible to steer simply by turning the steering wheel clockwise or counterclockwise, essentially making the same movements as when driving a real car , with buttons 1 and 2 it will be possible to accelerate and brake respectively, while with the + and - buttons the view will be changed. However, one of the most appreciable elements found is represented by the large number of possible configurations of the controller, which can be selected according to your driving preferences (with manual driving it will also be possible to go up and down by simply tilting the steering wheel forwards and backwards respectively). . Metallic red tiles Although, on paper, Gt Pro Series has the potential to prove to be a good product, it is when a random mode is selected among those proposed that the title will unfortunately demonstrate its poor videogame value. The main mode linked to the game is the one called Championship in which, like Gran Turismo, the player will be able to participate in a whole series of special championships dedicated to particular categories of cars (according to parameters of size, number of doors, make and quantity other) at the victorious end of which you will get extra cars and accessories useful for personalizing your car as prizes. In fact, the game, in addition to presenting a fairly varied choice of licensed vehicles (coming exclusively from Japanese production companies such as Honda and Suzuki, for example) will allow the player to intervene on the classic tuning of the vehicle by modifying the components of the car to adapt it to your driving characteristics. The proposed championships will vary according to the difficulty, and if the acquisition of any driving license will not be required for the beginners championship, when the competition will increase in rank the player will be required to pass a series of decidedly simple and not very competitive tests that will be useful above all to understand how the driving style of the game works (in this regard, the linked choice of inserting licenses/tutorials only from the second championship onwards is a mystery...). In addition to the championships, Gt Pro will allow players to try their hand at fast races, the classic time attack, a rather trivial versus and finally a mode called drift combo where the player will have to produce a series of continuous drifts without the car leaving the track or run into accidents along the way. unfortunately the textures seem to come from a first generation game for psx and the machines are sometimes more reminiscent of large colored cubes Metallic red tiles The tiles mentioned in the title linked to the paragraph unfortunately do not take long to appear and, partially omitting the fact that tracks, machines, accessories and modes come en bloc from the cube version, the game has an enormous drawback: the graphic design. Definitely subdued even just for a Gamecube, years ago the GT Cube developers had set aside the unattainable realism (?) of the more famous GT cousin to aim for something that came close to the mixture of polygonal graphics and cars made in cell, resulting in any absolutelynts inadequate to the means of the time and above all resembling more a product for the past generation. As if the lesson received with the cube game wasn't enough, even in this Wii version there have been no improvements whatsoever, with textures that seem to come from a first generation game for psx and cars that are sometimes more reminiscent of big colored cubes than their actual real counterpart. All this is combined with a decidedly subdued sound sector, with absolutely substandard effects (the engines all ~sound~ in the same way) and a soundtrack to forget. Ultimately Gt Pro Series can be judged as a decidedly simple title that has the big sin of being a recycler of an old title and, already at the time, little followed. Past mistakes have not been corrected and, apart from the control system, nothing new has been done. The inclusion of the steering wheel sold as a bundle with the game is not enough to put a stone on the lack of the title, and neither is the new way of understanding driving. The fact remains that the accessory contained in the pack will surely be useful for the next Wii racers; the first to arrive, we remind you, is a certain Excite Truck. Pros: Air-driving is definitely fun The steering wheel in the package is a very pleasant extra Accurate and precise controls Cons: Absolutely inadequate graphics Poor longevity The Wii title has nothing new compared to the old one for GC One of the most tragic moments of any software house can be identified in the launch of a new console: hardware not yet fully understood, lack of time and a great desire to prove themselves present with large numbers on the market, often play tricks. If this console is called ~Wii~, then things get complicated to the nth degree, in an extreme attempt to have games that arouse some interest in the public. One of Ubisoft's attempts related to the launch is called GT Pro Series, a transposition of that GT Cube that never came out of Japan and of which very few people remember (there are even fewer who remember it positively), completely rebuilt to marry at the new type of game imposed by the Nintendo console. Will Gt Pro Series be able to carve out a place in the memory of gamers or will it remain forever branded by the seal linked to the launch games of a new console?
