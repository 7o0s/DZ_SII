It will also be remembered by football-loving PC players, who after some time finally this year had the opportunity to choose between the best that FIFA 18 and PES 2018 have to offer. For the Konami-branded title, the very latest edition has in fact brought a PC version on a par with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ones, which is now a consolidated tradition for the EA Sports simulation. Today more than ever, the long dispute between the two titans is therefore renewed even outside the universe of consoles, landing on a PC market which, for the reasons listed above, was dominated by EA Sports until a year ago. But no more chatter, let's find out together what FIFA 18 has in store for us on PC. Back to Travel We have already had the opportunity to speak properly of the various modes of FIFA 18 in our main review of the game, to which we refer you for all the details of the case. Here we will therefore only make a brief overview, for which we can only start from the return of Alex Hunter, protagonist of the Journey mode debuted in FIFA 17. The story of the young promise of English football continues in the ~sequel~ where the 'we had left, allowing us to go around the world while the previous game formula remains almost unchanged. Jumping to the always very popular Ultimate Team, a great novelty of FIFA 18 are the so-called Icons: these are some special stickers dedicated to legends of the past such as Ronaldo (the Phenomenon), Henry, Van Basten, Maradona and many others. The roughly equivalent of the Legends known in previous versions of FIFA for Xbox. Each Icon comes with three different stickers, corresponding to as many moments in his career. The online sector undoubtedly remains the beating heart of FIFA 18, which as every year can boast of a stable and efficient server system, whether you play the classic Seasons or choose instead to switch to the Pro Club, a mode that is always capable of giving great satisfaction. There is no shortage of news related to the single player, concentrated in particular on the Career: transfer market addicts can now enjoy a special section where they can start discussions with other teams to sign players, keeping everything under control in a more effective way. In terms of playability, FIFA 18 takes advantage of the excellent foundations offered by its predecessor, compared to which the fluidity in the movements of the players is improved. The action therefore appears overall more harmonious, above all thanks to the work that EA Sports has summarized under the name of Real Player, a technology capable of defining the movements of the players with greater precision even in complex phases such as that of dribbling. Multiple possibilities emerge for changes of direction and accelerations that make the gameplay more varied overall, as well as more fluid as already mentioned. The beauty of football The PC version of FIFA 18 differs from the console ones in some small details, among which we find the possibility of setting some technical parameters in the appropriate configuration menu. The latter is traditionally external to the game and rather minimal, since it allows us to choose only the general quality of the rendering (low, medium, high and ultra) and the level of multisampling, in addition to the usual possibility of blocking the number of frames per second at thirty or sixty. During game action FIFA 18 is nailed to 60 fps practically granite, to then see the value drop to 30 fps in the case of intermission animations, such as goal celebrations, positioning of the barrier and more. In terms of detail, it takes a very careful eye to notice the differences, especially if you take PlayStation 4 Pro as a yardstick. Note the support for the DirectX 12 libraries, alongside that of version 11: activating it, however, we do not have noticed notable differences. Attention to the usual management of ALT+Tab: playing online it is not possible to use the aforementioned key combination, or to click outside the game window if you have two monitors. The penalty is mandatory and provides for immediate disconnection from the game being played, with consequent defeat at the table. Even if it is certainly a little too aggressive, it is a measure developed to combat cheaters, a category which unfortunately finds more fertile ground on PC than on consoles for obvious reasons. The use of a controller is highly recommended, preferably Xbox as the key mapping for the DualShock 4 that we connected to the PC was rather wrong. In alternativa always exists the possibility of playing with mouse and keyboard, but it is a possibility to be considered only as an extreme.", "date": "2017-09-27", "grade": "9.0"}
