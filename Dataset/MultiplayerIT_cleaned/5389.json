{"name": "Gotham Knights", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gotham-knights-recensione.html", "text": "~Nobody wants to be Robin~ is not only a song, but also a precise concept, which is even more true in the context of a fantasy universe in which we are allowed to impersonate literally anyone. If you could play Batman or any of his historical sidekicks, what would you rather do? In this sense, there is no doubt that the new WB Games Montreal project starts from a risky bet. Yes, because in the world of Gotham Knights the Dark Knight is dead (and no, as absurd as the Arkham Knight ending sounds, it has nothing to do with it: the two games are set in different universes), leaving his protgs the task of protecting the city, to therefore become the Knights of Gotham finally reaching adulthood: this too is a concept that is very relative for superheroes, but so be it. A bet, we said, but is the WB Games Montral development team able to win it? We reveal it to you in the Gotham Knights review. Story: Batman is dead, long live Batman Gotham Knights, Batgirl talks to Agent Montoya The long introductory sequence of Gotham Knights starts from the end ... of Batman. We see the Bat Man engaged in a dramatic confrontation with Ra's Al Ghul, resurrected for the umpteenth time and never so dangerous. To the point that for the hero of Gotham there is nothing to do: defeating the opponent and preventing him from conquering the city requires an extreme sacrifice, and Bruce Wayne does not hold back. His disappearance clearly leaves a huge void, but even this eventuality had been foreseen: through a posthumous video message addressed to Nightwing, Batgirl, Red Hood and Robin, Batman asks his pupils to collaborate for the good of Gotham, provides them with a headquarters (the Bell Tower), a package of technologies state-of-the-art, but sufficient to carry out the mission, and of course the unfailing support of his faithful butler, Alfred. The story of Gotham Knights explores loss and rebirth, leaving the Dark Knight in the background and instead working on the memory that his friends (his family, indeed) keep of him, on the values he has handed down. Dick Grayson, Barbara Gordon, the revived Jason Todd and Tim Drake must mourn and find each other at the same time, through sequences that enrich the plot and which we found very well written. Here, the comics tradition teaches that the great authors are able to relaunch even the less interesting characters; and here there was a desperate need for a screenplay worthy of the game's ambitions, which takes precisely a handful of ~backers~, perhaps known to the niche of comics enthusiasts, but not to the general public, and gives them the role of protagonists in a desperate attempt to make up for the Bat Man's absence. Gotham Knights, Batgirl talking to the Penguin Has the difficult goal been achieved? In our opinion yes, given that the story of Gotham Knights manages to involve from the start and for the entire duration of the campaign, which we completed within twenty hours while leaving behind various secondary activities and the clear feeling that, having the time , it would be nice to replay everything in the role of each of the four characters. Obviously the bulk of the credit goes to the setting and the antagonists we will face: from Harley Quinn to Mr. Freeze, from Clayface to the mysterious and disturbing Court of Owls, but not only. Very well represented figures on the screen, thanks to a precise and impeccable direction, capable of enhancing the DC narrative universe, its atmospheres and its peculiarities in a truly convincing way, while coming to reiterate choices that still leave us a little perplexed. Structure: The classic superhero open world Gotham Knights, Batgirl glides from above Probably no one expected Gotham Knights to revolutionize the concept of superhero open world and in fact the WB Games Montreal title presents a traditional structure from this point of view: a freely explorable Gotham, divided into zones and districts which each have peculiar characteristics and, above all, they see the presence of different criminal gangs: from freaks to criminals, from inspectors to Claws, finally passing through groups of corrupt policemen. Wandering the streets we will be able to view on the compass, or through the inevitable Detective Mode , the presence of hostile units engaged for example in an attack, in a firefight, in a robbery of passers-by or a bank. We will then be able to stop and beat the criminals to ~solve the case~, gaining experience points and materials useful for crafting the equipment, but clearly the missions will be pmain them to return greater satisfaction. Gotham Knights, Nightwing aboard the Batcycle Gathered in the Bell Tower, the location that acts as a hub for the events of Gotham Knights, the four heroes will collect useful clues for the creation of dossiers that we will be able to consult to start the basic tasks of the campaign, which, as mentioned, revolve around the return of Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze and Clayface, as well as the discovery of the mysterious and disturbing Court of Owls: a secret society in which militate rich and unscrupulous people, determined to control Gotham by eliminating specific targets thanks to the murderous skills of the lethal Talons. situations occurs in a very similar way to Batman: Arkham Knight or Marvel's Spider-Man: our character enters the building on duty and - after a short loading - he finds himself exploring a new setting, perhaps with some puzzles to solve or with crime scenes to analyze, in the context of a sort of nice but decidedly accessory deductive minigame. Gotham Knights, Harley Quinn Navigation within the city takes place on foot, using a grappling hook and a gliding mechanism that changes according to the character (the cape for Batgirl, a glider for Nightwing, magic for the Red Hood and teleportation for Robin), but for long distances it is better to jump on the Batcycle, Batman's motorcycle that appears instantly when we recall it. By hacking some drones we will also be able to unlock the fast travel points to all areas of Gotham, making us transported to the place by a compact Batwing, so to speak. In this situation Arkham Knight did better, allowing us to quickly project the character after each grappling hook and to glide towards the goal, without always having to resort to the Batmobile. In Gotham Knights these mechanisms are a bit limited, and in general we only appreciated the solutions adopted for Batgirl, which is no coincidence that she is presented in all respects as the female version of the Dark Knight, costume included. The cooperative mode Gotham Knights, Robin patrols the streets of the city A group adventure like Gotham Knights could not fail to include a cooperative mode, open from the beginning to the participation of two players. Accessible from the main menu, co-op tracks the progress of the user hosting the game and allows you to tackle any mission, main or secondary, in pairs. Some aspects of this feature turn out to be edgy, for example you have to figure out independently where the other hero has gone on the map when you use fast travel, but in general it's a lot of fun to slap Gotham's criminals in stereo. Of course, the lack of interactions such as group moves seems to suggest that this feature is not really central to the experience, which somewhat betrays the starting concept of the WB Games Montreal title. Gameplay: A modified freeflow Gotham Knights, Batgirl fights with a group of bad guys On the gameplay side, the Gotham Knights experience obviously inherits the freeflow combat system invented by Rocksteady Studios for the Batman: Arkham series, patented by Warner Bros. and borrowed, so to speak, from Insomniac Games for Marvel's Spider-Man . The fights are fun, the impacts rendered well and there is an excellent variety in the repertoire of the characters, who each have different characteristics. Batgirl, for example, is a balanced and quick fighter, Nightwing highlights her acrobatic skills during the clashes, Robin behaves like a sort of ninja and gets married with stealth actions, while Red Hood launches himself with his head down, guns in hand, facing any opponent head-on. Unlocking skills requires overcoming certain challenges, in particular those belonging to the Knight category: these are basically the requirements that a defender of Gotham should always possess. Gotham Knights, Batgirl faces one of the big opponents As we said, there is an excellent repertoire available to the protagonists and above all they are granted the freedom to approach each situation in a different way. Entering a den, we will be able to proceed crouching, deactivate the safety devices and eliminate everyone silently (the stealth mechanics boast excessive tolerances, in truth) or fight head on, firing one blow to the right and one to the left, automatically covering distances as it happens precisely with the freeflow. Unfortunately, the developers have not maintained the maneuvers of capturing and eliminating from the grips, which in the Batman: Arkham series (as well as in Marvel's Spider-Man) they made it possible to thin out the enemy ranks by finding the right timing to take out individual criminals, having a lot of fun, but the role-playing implications add in this case an avalanche of costumes, aesthetic customizations but also weapons with elemental effects linked to fire, electricity, ice and corrosion. Gotham Knights, Batgirl interrogates a criminal The opponents that we will face are very numerous, with some factions that each include different types of warriors; but the boss fights in particular stand out: Harley Quinn, Dr. Freeze, Clayface and the other villains will involve us in truly spectacular, varied and fairly challenging fights, which the latter is absolutely not obvious. We will also find ourselves having to survive particular tests when we follow the traces of the Court of Owls. During our tests we used Batgirl almost exclusively, but just go to the Bell Tower to change characters and continue the story without problems. Of course, the game tries to keep us abreast of the updates unlocked up to that point by handing out objects and experience points for free if you switch to another hero, otherwise the progression system and its RPG implications would have put us in very unpleasant situations, grappling with opponents too strong for our level. Costumes and customizations Gotham Knights, Batgirl in one of many unlockable costumes There is one area in which Gotham Knights undoubtedly excels, and that is the fanservice. In fact, the protagonists have access to an enormous amount of costumes, each of which can be customized as regards the set of colors and the design of the mask, symbol, gloves and boots, naturally equipped with different statistics. Using the collected materials we will be able to build these sets and dismantle the ones we don't need, doing the same with melee and throwing weapons, the latter equipped with elemental effects that we will be able to exploit against certain enemies, as already mentioned. Then there is the question of the mods, which can also be dismantled and upgraded to then be assigned to the individual components. Graphics and sound: great art, little technique Gotham Knights, Nightwing and the Red Hood As you know, Gotham Knights does not include a 60 fps graphics mode and this undoubtedly represents a huge disappointment, given that unlike A Plague Tale: Requiem we are in the first place facing an action game, second result in a triple A production, with all the necessary resources to be able to implement a feature that owners of PS5 and Xbox Series X considered by now as consolidated. We can understand the decision to load the game visually and technologically to the point of making it impossible to run it at more than 30 fps, but beyond the lack of effects that can justify all this, the fact of not wanting to give up resolution to obtain greater fluidity continues to be incomprehensible to us. Even more so if the 30 frames are anything but stable: the WB Games Montreal title runs with difficulty, often slowing down even in a very conspicuous way. +1 A real pity, because on an artistic level a great job has been done in relation to characters and settings, enemies and animations (those of the absolutely spectacular finishers); and we realized it, never as in this case, thanks to the photo mode: every snapshot of Gotham Knights has the makings of the wallpaper, and you will spend a lot of time creating your personalized shots, thanks to the available options and beautiful filters included in the package. Above you can see some examples: what do you think? Finally, a few considerations on the sound sector, which can count on the one hand on a convincing, functional soundtrack, capable of accompanying in the best possible way what is shown from time to time on the screen; on the other on an Italian dubbing which in some situations appears a little too ~cartoonish~ (see Barbara Gordon) but knows how to make amends thanks to an always excellent level of interpretation. The only discordant note is an anonymous Batman: we would have liked to hear Balzarotti in those guises again.", "date": "2022-10-20", "grade": "7.8"}
