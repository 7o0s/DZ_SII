{"name": "The Sims: Fuori Tutti!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-fuori-tutti-2.html", "text": "Born and raised in Sim City. In Fuori Tutti, believe it or not, there is a story to follow with a lot of freedom, but which is the leitmotif of the whole game. The parents of the character you will create at the beginning of your virtual life have just divorced and the father, an evil rich man, is prowling all over Sim City foreclosing items from the homes of everyone who owes him. Your task will be to climb the heights of economic success until you are able to take revenge on the terrible parent, backed by a lot of friends and a mother perpetually in curlers and with a beauty mask. The description of the setting and story is deliberately ironic because irony is one of the winning factors of The Sims, which is nothing more than a great interactive soap opera, which entertains itself from the television. Man, woman, with the skin color you prefer, with the body that most resembles you, you can create your favorite among dozens of possibilities, being able to retouch him at the beginning of each game, also taking advantage of clothes and costumes gradually unlocked as the game progresses . This begins in the maternal home, from which, after a short tutorial that teaches you how to take your first steps and how to manage the baby's basic needs, you will embark on this daring social climb. A Sims, as perhaps not all consulates know, needs to eat, wash and have fun in order to remain operational and carry out the actions that will make him advance in his career. In fact, if he is always willing to watch television or go dancing, to study, look for a job or train his body, he must be in an excellent mood. The heart of the game consists in being able to balance all the elements that are part of all of our lives: friendships and skills, stimulated by regular nutrition, by a healthy, fun, but also rested life. The problem is being able not to let the days go by without having done anything good, without having lost too much money and having achieved the various objectives that are set to us in order to continue. Something new in the air? Under the sun of Sim City not many new things shine and this is the only criticism that can be made to the Maxis title, which is now a proven factory of good humour. Interacting with the new environments, which, let's remember, are no longer just simple homes, is stimulating and always presents new challenges, but, once the novelty has been overcome, the most mischievous will immediately recognize the canons of a game that has made school , but which has a few years behind it. Many new animations, objects to go crazy collecting and using, and many careers available to complete the game in a thousand different ways. However, the feeling remains that Fuori Tutti is aimed at an audience of diehard enthusiasts who already know what they want and to newbies intrigued by the global fame assumed by the Electronic Arts brand. It takes patience and the spirit of true voyeurs to get captured by the Sims and this chapter certainly doesn't change the cards on the table. More of the same, the British would say, but as long as you're having fun, it's all good. These Sims got cute The most relevant novelty of the Sims console debut was the introduction of completely 3D graphics, to the detriment of the old two-dimensional ones. Fuori Tutti continues this path, improving the engine which is stable and safe, albeit with some hints of crisis in the most chaotic situations. The dozens of objects with which the Sims can interact are rich in detail and the animations of the characters, the real protagonists of the game, are delightful and full of surprises. The new menus, typically inspired by Mac OS, are functional and perfectly calibrated to a graphical interface that has allowed a painless transition from personal computers to consoles. Having said that, no revolution and nothing to cry out for a miracle, but the overall appearance is now very pleasant without a shadow of a doubt. The sound is made up of a few airport waiting room music and a thousand sound effects, which accompany every action that takes place on the screen: from the Sims' grumbles, to their exlcamations for their little joys and disappointments. As in a small theater of poor art. Comment The idea behind the transposition of the Sims console works great: never too free to make the player feel lost, never too forced to suffocate the desire for freedom and limithave the sensation of being the promoter of the life of a creature to which, inevitably, one becomes attached. The only criticism that can be made of the Electronic Arts game is that, despite the various improvements, The Sims Out For All has more the substance of an expansion than a real sequel. Those who love the series will take it sight unseen, those who don't love it are unlikely to find in this episode a reason to change their minds. Those who, on the other hand, have never ventured into managing the life of a Sims have found the ideal place to make their first attempt. Pros: New environments, accessories and animations Improved graphics Simple and attractive interface Cons: No real innovations The world of Personal Computers and that of consoles have always been distant planets, whose inhabitants peeked at each other with circumspection and ill-concealed arrogance. In recent years things have changed a bit and if on the one hand cross-platform titles have proliferated, sometimes without criteria, on the other some software houses have taken the concept behind some successful titles, trying to adapt it to the user of the other playful environment. Maxis and Electronic Arts have made this attempt with the Sims and the conversion of the title, which has given the Canadian publisher the crown of number one in the world, has adapted to a style more suited to console users. Having abandoned the slight vagueness of purpose of the original, the structure of Sims has become objectives to be achieved in a constantly evolving family context. Where last year's debut took place in a series of increasingly large houses, this time the Sims are free to roam between houses and clubs, haunted mansions and art galleries. Everyone out, therefore, to secretly see the effect it has", "date": "2003-12-19", "grade": null}
