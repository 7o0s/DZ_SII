{"name": "Fire Emblem: Three Houses", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fire-emblem-three-houses-recensione.html", "text": "In recent weeks we have often told you about Fire Emblem: Three Houses, the new strategy with which the Intelligent Systems series, now close to celebrating its thirtieth anniversary, finally makes its debut also on Nintendo Switch. We told you about the origins of this brand that has been confined to Japan for a long time and we told you about our first positive impressions, Joy-Con in hand. Three Houses takes a different approach than previous Fire Emblems, forcing us to choose a house to side with, and this decision will have a fundamental impact especially in the second half of the game: we have decided to support Edelgard von Hresvelg's house of Black Eagles and this is the review of our first adventure in the Fdlan. At school with Byleth Fire Emblem: Three Houses can ideally be divided into two parts. The beginning is the same for everyone: the protagonist Byleth, male or female, thanks to a mysterious power conferred on him by a girl that only he can see, saves three cadets from the monastery of Garreg Mach, attracting the attention of the priestess Rhea who represents the Church and precepts him as a teacher. The first choice we will have to make determines the storyline that will unfold in the following chapters, even if the first substantial differences can only be glimpsed after a few hours of play. The three houses - the Black Eagles, the Blue Lions and the Golden Deer - are composed of only eight students each, but the smaller cast allowed the writers to better characterize each individual student. The way the story unfolds is very reminiscent of a Harry Potter film or novel because essentially every month something happens that develops the plot, often in the form of fighting. It is the calendar itself that reminds us of this. At the beginning of the month, we will be informed of the next task that we will have to complete in the last week, which guarantees us at least three weeks of preparation. The latter are a subtle interlocking game that becomes more and more elaborate over the hours, thanks to the introduction of new dynamics which on the one hand increase the number of activities we can dedicate ourselves to, on the other they force us more and more often to choose precisely what to do and when. It is all connected in a dense network of parameters: Byleth's teaching level indicates how many students he can teach directly and the latter can learn a certain number of lessons based on their level of motivation, which increases by offering them gifts or by answering correctly to their possible questions, or by carrying out particular activities around the monastery which, however, are limited by the aforementioned level of teaching. On the last day of the week we can choose what to do: we could fight and thus level up our students, or wander around the monastery and undertake the aforementioned activities which include, among other things, fishing and optional side missions, or we can simply rest to recharge the motivation of all students at once, sacrificing any other activity. At the beginning these activities are few, but as the chapters go by, more and more features are added that transform the unprecedented traditional RPG component into an extremely strategic structure. If desired, a player could even ignore the third-person exploration of the Garreg Mach altogether, but in doing so he would miss numerous opportunities to perfect his students and, at the same time, Byleth himself, not to mention that, with some very precise requirements satisfied, one can even temporarily recruit the pupils and teachers of the other houses. In short, the exploration of the Garreg Mach plays a very important role in the structure of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, but it must be admitted that in the long run it becomes a bit repetitive to run around the monastery, collect objects and find the students to which they belong. In the end, even the activities are always the same and you end up wandering around a bit too much without a precise destination. On the other hand, the day off allows you to establish a bond with the various characters in the cast: slowly, even the most banal dialogues begin to reveal some important details about the history of the Church and of Byleth himself, while a shadow creeps into the monastery increasingly threatening that wants to break the fragile balance of Fdlan. Mysterious masked knights, disappearing students, professors with no past, dark wizards around the castle plotting in the night... We have to admit that at one point we expected to see the good Professor Hanneman arrive in the sathe refectory, shouting: ~A troll in the dungeons!~. Despite this, the passing of the months allows us to outline more and more precisely the type of fighters we want to train. The new promotion system recalls the famous Final Fantasy Job System and allows the same student to change class repeatedly, provided that he has met the necessary requirements to unlock a new class by passing a real school exam. In other words, you can change your mind without incurring serious penalties, actually reinforcing the same student more by making him learn more skills or special moves belonging to different classes or weapons. With a little planning and a little cunning, unstoppable units can be trained. Let's take the good Caspar as an example. The hot-headed Black Eagles are especially good at hand and ax combat, which is why we've trained them in these arts to unlock classes like Fighter and Warrior. Eventually, we promoted him to Weapon Master with the Master Seal at level 30, turning him into an unstoppable brawler who crushes enemies with his ax and brass knuckle bonuses, but if we wanted to completely change direction we could also develop his skills in Reason and in the Sword to promote him to Fencer Mage. Fight for the Fdlan This freedom in customizing individual characters - which in any case requires a certain foresight, given that some units are more or less capable of certain weapons or schools of magic - is reflected above all in the second half of the adventure, when the fighting becomes more visceral and tighten. In case you don't know, even if Nintendo officially released this information in the trailers and during the Treehouse of the last E3, perhaps in response to the not exactly warm feedback received towards the apparently too childish school setting, at a certain point in the game occurs what is known in jargon as a ~timeskip~. The subplots that have slowly crept into Garreg Mach consolidate around the enigmatic figure of Byleth and explode in a crescendo of twists and turns, resulting in a five-year gap between the two parts in which the story is divided. Let's say that Intelligent Systems could have staged this turning point better, however the storyline changes drastically depending on the chosen house, branching out into different paths that lead to different endings. In short, Fire Emblem: Three Houses is an extremely replayable title, and even if in the end you will find yourself repeating the same activities to grow the various characters, their distinct personalities, different combat skills, variations in maps and objectives make the matches sufficiently different. Our game with the Black Eagles lasted about forty hours, but we played on the normal difficulty level, disabling the permanent death of the units, an iconic feature of Fire Emblem which, however, causes many problems for the timing of a review . However, those who prefer to risk losing their favorites forever shouldn't worry too much because Byleth has a power, called Divine Beat, which allows you to rewind time and undo the last decisions made in battle, perhaps to relocate a unit that we had wrong to move. The missions become progressively more difficult, offering intricate maps and increasingly aggressive and tough opponents. Monsters are an interesting novelty that make some fights particularly challenging: these creatures occupy four squares, beat like blacksmiths and completely regenerate their Life Points two or more times, before collapsing to the ground. It almost seems that the Battalions were designed to fight them, even if they will come in handy on completely different occasions. This new feature allows each unit to be associated with a handful of soldiers who will follow it on the field, guaranteeing various bonuses to the basic parameters. Battalions also allow you to engage without risking a counterattack, often activating additional bonuses: there are Battalions that heal in an area, others that paralyze enemies, still others that increase movement capabilities and so on. Choosing the right Battalion for a unit and possibly changing it if necessary, remembering to heal the soldiers between one mission and another, is very important and substantially influences the gameplay in two ways. Firstly, it guarantees another type of action that increases the player's possibilities in combat, as well as any strategic combinations since we can reinforce the attacks of the Battlesoni by tiling units on the map. Secondly, the Battalions add an ounce of spectacularity to a title that relies above all on the models and well-kept animations, but which leaves something to be desired as regards the scenarios and backdrops: the combat sequences, albeit spartan in terms of effects, they have a much greater impact when our hero of the moment attacks the opponent with a retinue of soldiers fighting behind him. In this sense, the new third-person view that zooms directly onto the map, allowing us to move the unit on duty freely and without the constraints of the grid, strongly reminds us of Koei Tecmo's contribution to development: it is more difficult to control and it risks some confusion with the Battalions nearby, but the visual impact is spectacular, even if true Fire Emblem fans will probably prefer the more traditional view. Three Houses is a visually refined and refined title, but there are some flaws in terms of optimization: it is probably the title that most stresses Switch in the Dock, where the console becomes noisier and hotter than ever, and which eats up the battery in portable mode , although fortunately the handheld returns an almost intact gaming experience and an image that is always clean and sharp in any situation. Five years later There would be so much to add on the gameplay. We haven't talked about Signs, which only allow certain units to wield legendary weapons, and assistants, which we can associate with units when we can't bring everyone into battle. We haven't talked about the Support system, an iconic feature of the series that returns with great fanfare with hilarious skits, some surprising romantic relationships and various advantages in terms of gameplay, but if we were to list every single feature that Intelligent Systems has implemented in its new title, however, managing to establish a balance that does not make the experience overwhelming, this review, which is already quite long, would become even more so. We therefore prefer to dedicate the last part of our analysis to the development of the story, returning to that leap of five years that divides the game into two parts. Let's put it this way: those who complained of being too youthful will have to change their mind. Obviously we won't tell you what happened and why, just know that those students you bonded with while wandering around the Garreg Mach... maybe that young girl to whom you returned the notebook in which she loved to write poetry between one lesson and another.. here those students could become your archenemies on the battlefield. And you will have to kill them. Because this is war and if you don't kill them first, they'll kill you or your kids. Sometimes you may convince them to join your cause, but more often you will be forced to kill those who have been your pupils. The brutal approach of the story, which mixes politics and fantasy in an elaborate plot in which, of course, everyone has their sacrosanct point of view and is ready to die to defend it, has taken us by surprise, and the merit is also of the excellent localization in Italian and the splendid soundtrack by Takeru Kanazaki. Perhaps Intelligent Systems could have handled some steps better, because we felt that some developments had less time than they deserved, but the structure of Fire Emblem: Three Houses is really clever, because with each game you will realize that you have known better the same guys you might have to face in battle. And so, we who started with the Black Eagles and immediately fell in love with the shy and awkward Bernadetta, already fear the moment when we might be forced to fight her for our lives. It should also be noted that some details of the whole story will not be clear to us until we have restarted the adventure supporting another house, which somewhat weakens the impact of some turning points in history, but capitalizes on the importance of undertaking a different path: in this sense, thanks also to the bonuses that are unlocked by finishing the game, the Intelligent Systems title proves to be a real gem that guarantees extraordinary longevity to anyone who decides to strip it to the bottom.", "date": "2019-07-25", "grade": "9.4"}
