{"name": "Europa Universalis 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/europa-universalis-2.html", "text": "The game system The wide range of possibilities offered to the player could disorient anyone, but within a few games you can easily become familiar with the system and literally get caught up in it. It all starts with choosing the game scenario (the most popular is the ~Grand Campaign~ which covers the entire game period) and your nation. You can choose any that was present at the beginning of 1419, so you will find Byzantium, France almost completely invaded by the British, Spain still divided between the various kingdoms, and so on. You can also choose the various African, Asian or American peoples, but clearly the beauty of the game comes from choosing a European nation: it shouldn't be so fun to take a tribe of Indians and wait a few centuries without doing anything before being annihilated. The whole world is organized into a gigantic map divided into various ~provinces~, the extent of which had some significance in that period. In each of these provinces you will be able to build a limited number of buildings (made available only thanks to technological advances), which represent only an abstraction of some concepts of the game (such as the evolution of civil and legal structures) and not a representation more detailed as it was for Civilization. From these provinces you can then hire your army, which is divided into three categories: infantry, cavalry, and artillery (not available at the start). Clearly the more territories you control, the richer and more powerful you will become, but the more time it takes to modernize your kingdom (and the more you will spend). In EU2 there is no objective to achieve (at least in the Grand Campaign, except perhaps to score more points) nor colonization ships to send to Alpha Centauri, your objective will have to be imposed by you. For example, by controlling Venice, you could decide to reunify the Italian peninsula by 1500, and if that weren't enough, to start the colonization of the Americas, perhaps by building a city called ~La Laguna~ in what would be Manhattan, and if that weren't enough, you could come seized by lusts for grandeur and you could try to re-establish the Roman Empire by unleashing a world war in the 18th century! The possibilities offered by the game are endless, but it certainly doesn't stop there. How to play? Everything takes place, as already mentioned, in a real-time system with pause: you could choose the speed with which the days will pass and pause when you want. At low speeds you will administer your nation, ~playing~ in the various stock exchanges, or by sending diplomatic emissaries to the various nations, forging alliances, diplomatic marriages, etc. The beauty ~comes~ during the war: sooner or later you will be involved, perhaps because you are part of an alliance, perhaps because you started it. Warfare in EU2 boils down to choosing where to send your armies while combat is automatically managed by the computer based on various statistical factors, such as technology level, proportion of forces in the field, general skill, terrain, etc. It may seem trivial, but you must remember that in EU2 you embody a sort of ~immortal ruler~, your task is therefore to command, then the soldiers on the front line will face the worst, while you wait in your very luxurious palace for the outcome of the battle.As for Alpha Centauri, here too you can operate a sort of ~social engineering~, a big novelty of EU2, which will serve to characterize your nation. You will have at your disposal a series of sliders representing certain characteristics such as the tendency towards aristocracy or plutocracy, whether you favor technological development or obscurantism, whether you are oriented towards colonization or not, the offensive doctrine in favor of a defensive one, etc. etc. Every ten years you can change one of these sliders by a ~step~, and slowly you will be able to make profound social changes. However, every change causes a loss of stability, that is, the characteristic that determines the state of order of your country: every point less will bring you closer to complete anarchy! Less stability also means less taxes received, high probability of revolts, difficulty in organizing the army, etc. etc. The diplomatic model Depending on your choices, you will have a certain number of emissaries available who you can send to embassies all over the world to quibble about various matters: as already mentioned, you can create military alliances or try to join some pact alreadyexisting, diplomatic marriages, economic pacts (you will avoid competing with each other in the stock exchanges), impose a state of vassalage or annex it. Furthermore, a novelty, you will be able to ~insulte~ other countries, trying to ~provoke~ them to declare war, or proclaim a sort of ~protectorship~ towards another nation, gaining a casus belli, standing up as ~sole defender of the faith~. and so on. We have named the casus belli: this is one of the cornerstones of the entire game. In fact, unlike Civilization, as it should be, war is not to be taken lightly. One should not declare war very frequently without having repercussions. To limit this, the concept of ~casus belli~ was introduced, a way of simulating both local and international ~public opinion~. What if the United States decides to invade the European Union? Probably the invasion would take place (!) but the world would surely be horrified by such an occurrence and it would certainly cause some serious repercussions. Difficult instead that someone bats an eyebrow (so to speak) in case the US decides to bomb some country linked to international terrorism. Europa Universalis 2 tries to simulate this mechanism, in fact if you were to decide to attack a friendly country, without reasons, which has the same religion as you and with which perhaps you have entered into a diplomatic marriage... well if you were to do so, you would fall into more anarchy complete! It is different if you decide to go on a ~crusade~ to defend Europe from the Ottoman Empire. The best thing you could do, therefore, is to try to obtain these casus belli: the simplest way is to make sure that the enemy has one or more provinces traditionally yours in his possession. Or you can ~insult~ another nation by making it gain a casus belli in the hope that it will declare war on you... There are many other ways (the protectorate, random events), but if we had to describe them all, this article perhaps it would no longer be a review but a manual! War Sooner or later war will come, and when it does, it will be pain for everyone. The discontent of the population will grow if the war goes on too long and this will lead to riots. Furthermore, your army is made up of men and these men are ultimately the inhabitants of your country (but you can still hire mercenary companies) and in fact each ~province~ offers a certain number of possible soldiers. Every year the young conscripts will be replaced, but in a moment of impending danger you will no longer be able to hire armies of thousands and thousands of people every few months as it was in the predecessor. As already mentioned, the battles mainly take place by moving your troops on the territory (or in the sea), while to conquer a territory you must first of all keep the city under siege and wait for their surrender (or directly assault the fort). After that you can go to the negotiating table and discuss peace terms. Each territory has a certain value and depending on the type of ~victory~ (or defeat) you may or may not ask for it in exchange for peace. In case of complete victory you will be able to ask for the vassalization of the enemy country, its religious conversion (in some cases), its complete annexation... Historical events and conclusions Another notable feature are the historical events that serve to make particular rather ~complicated~ situations ~happen~ that would not be possible with the normal game engine. For example when the kingdom of Castile finishes its ~reconquista~, unifying Spain, it will no longer be seen as ~kingdom of Castile~ in the game, but through an event, it will have the possibility of becoming ~the kingdom of Spain~. Or, in case of bitter riots in France, after the advent of Luther, the Huguenots could arise.... I hope you are realizing how difficult it is to expose the potential of the game given the enormous variety it offers! Europa Universalis II it is undoubtedly a masterpiece, the only game that has managed to oust Civilization from its throne.. it is no coincidence that it can boast the title of ~Strategist of the Year~. It's a game that given its extreme variety will offer you endless fun. Furthermore, around this game there is a very well organized ~community~ which ensures the development of mods and other improvements, even if the chances that the various mods are translated into Italian are less than zero. And in fact here there is a consideration to be made: the majority of Europa Universalis fans will already own the second episode, available for more than four years.three months, a truly unacceptable delay for such a product, which will certainly affect sales... But if you haven't played it yet, this is your chance! Historical events and conclusions Although in the review we have reported the images of the English version, the Italian version (translated the game and the manual), distributed by Leader, is also available in the shops. Europa Universalis 2 After months and months of waiting, the strategy game of the year for Multiplayer.it has finally been translated into Italian after being available only upon import. The first revolutionized the genre... and the second? Europa Universalis 2 starts from the very solid foundations built by its predecessor and goes much further, making EU2 that dream come true that all fans of the genre have been waiting for. How to define Europa Universalis 2? Except that it's a Europa Universalis-style game, EU2 has actually created its own genre: it's the first strategy game to prove to the world that ~real-time with pause~ is a better solution than turn-based. Basically it could be compared to Civilization as a basic idea, but the differences are so many. EU2 is set in a period ranging from 1419 to 1820, with the historical situation perfectly reconstructed down to the smallest detail so that the evolution of the games leads to much more realistic results than seeing Romans, Americans, French and so on compete for the construction of the pyramids.", "date": "2002-06-20", "grade": null}
