{"name": "Earth Defense Force 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/earth-defense-force-5-recensione.html", "text": "Earth Defense Force 5 is an amazing game, in the literal sense of the word. In fact, it is not normal for a series of videogames, which by now boasts a discrete niche of fans both at home and in the West, to be on the market for the third consecutive time with a substantially identical product: unable to propose new situations except in the missions more advanced, spoiled by the same defects as always and even weighed down in the initial stages by a slow and boring tutorial, which arguably curbs the desire to launch headlong into yet another battle to save the Earth. The franchise developed by Sandlot has stood out over the years for its videogame b-movie atmospheres, following from this point of view a bit what has been the history of Japanese television science fiction, which drew inspiration from American productions except for skidding inevitably in the territory of giant monsters and equally gigantic heroes called to fight them. In Earth Defense Force 5, established at home as the best-selling chapter ever, this last aspect is missing or is at least introduced in a limited way, in the form of a huge robot that we will be able to pilot in certain situations. For the rest there is everything: during the missions the screen is crowded with giant insects that seem to come out of the classic It Came from the Desert, and the overwhelming numerical inferiority in which our team finds itself stands as a sort of trademark of factory for the brand. The formula, very well tested, is in fact based on the waves: our task will be to eliminate all the enemies that invade the large map and resist until the end, so that we can move on to the next level and continue the plot of a campaign composed of over one hundred missions, to be played alone or in a cooperative multiplayer available both locally via split-screen and online, for a maximum of four participants. Story and gameplay If the action and the narrative sector of Earth Defense Force 2025 were re-proposed in a remastered version with Earth Defense Force 4.1, in this new chapter the developers have seen fit to start all over again with a real reboot, which however exposes us to events essentially the same as those we have already seen, with a single rather useless variant: the fact that the protagonist of the game is a civilian who suddenly finds himself fighting within the ranks of the EDF, an expedient which however does not prevent you from choosing right away any one of the four classes that fans of the series know well and which have not changed in any way compared to previous episodes. We will therefore be able to take on the role of a Ranger, moving on foot and initially taking up a machine gun and a missile launcher, or opt for a Wing Diver, a sort of jetpack-equipped Amazon who attacks mainly from above using a mix of light and heavy weapons. Then there are the Air Raider, a support class with conventional weapons and the ability to order air strikes towards specific targets, and finally the Fencer, an armored unit that during the first missions will test your patience due to the his incredible slowness of movement. By eliminating the aliens and collecting the boxes they leave on the ground (weapons, armor and health) we will be able not only to restore vital energy as needed, but also and above all to unlock new components for the arsenal, better energy cores and armor points that will increase the our defensive capabilities from level to level. Compared to previous EDFs, in this chapter we will be able to carry out a general progression instead of choosing a single character to upgrade during the campaign, given that the bonuses will be divided at least partially among all the classes. Once again, given the extreme cumbersomeness of the devastating Fencer and the lack of personality of the Ranger and the Air Raider (the latter however very interesting from a co-op point of view), we carried on the usual Wing Diver having fun targeting the enemy hordes with rapid fire but also with homing missiles or the very powerful Plasma Gun. The fact that weapon management is closely linked to the energy of the core that powers the jetpack makes this class agile and effective but at the same time the most vulnerable in certain situations: an aspect that balances the difficulty of the game, sometimes characterized by unexpected peaks , often and willingly exposes, especially in the most advanced stages. Playstation 4 trophies Most of Earth Defense Force 5's forty Trophies can be obtained simply by completing the game's lengthy campaign, asthe various completion percentages correspond to the same number of achievements. The few remaining achievements are unlocked by maximizing the armor of the four classes and performing support actions for your teammates in the cooperative mode. Weapons, enemies and technical realization As with the four classes, even the rich arsenal of Earth Defense Force 5 draws heavily on the previous episodes of the series, so much so that those who have already tried them will be able to proceed by heart in selecting the best equipment, unless they want to experiment different combinations and characters, thus using a new approach to situations which, however, as mentioned, tend to repeat themselves. We are talking precisely about a reboot, which means that we will relive the first attack of the invaders, the story of the media, the terrified civilians who flee into the street and the reactions of our comrades, initially haunted by the doubt that the attack came from a some nation hostile and unable to accept the reality of a large-scale alien invasion. There is therefore a very strong feeling of deja-vu and it is really a pity that the novelties of this new chapter in terms of enemies, vehicles and weapons are not introduced immediately, but rather require a few hours to enter the game, thus discouraging those who in practice he finds himself reliving situations that have already been widely experienced. It is all the more surprising how no modifications have been taken into consideration for the gameplay, nor a better yield of shots nor even less more sophisticated patterns as regards the artificial intelligence of both companions and enemies, really basic. The game's bestiary ranges from the usual giant insects to flying saucers of various types, passing through the huge ships that release hostile units to real kaiju. There are some new entries, but they are mostly variations on something already seen, as the entire graphics sector appears widely already seen. There is no doubt that Sandlot has decided to exploit the computing power of the PlayStation 4 to bring a huge number of aliens to the screen, making them fight within very large and often destructible maps, but despite this it is quite clear how the polygonal models and visual effects are very, very dated yet subject to camera blunders or even substantial drops in frame rate during the most chaotic situations. A completely similar speech applies to the sound, which boasts a poor level of interpretation of the dialogues in English, similar to what we used to hear quite a few years ago.", "date": "2018-12-10", "grade": "5.0"}
