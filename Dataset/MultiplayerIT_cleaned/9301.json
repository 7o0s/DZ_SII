{"name": "Monopoly Madness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monopoly-madness-recensione.html", "text": "If you feel a certain discomfort when someone pulls the dusty Monopoly off some ancient shelf at Christmas, it could be due to the subconscious knowledge that this international mainstay of family entertainment is a kind of hymn to unscrupulous capitalism and speculative real estate. . Or perhaps simply because you already know that you will be harassed with duties and taxes by the banking uncle who always manages to win over the entire wealth trust on a regular basis, between via Roma and Parco della Vittoria. This year, however, you could subvert the status quo and even have a chance to win (or simply finish a game, which would already be quite an achievement) by throwing everything into a racket thanks to this bizarre videogame reinterpretation by Ubisoft. A rereading that we discover in the review of Monopoly Madness. Title chosen not by chance, because this is truly Monopoly-based madness: if the presentation can make you think of a simple digital translation of the old board game, complete with Tycoon with tuba to welcome you on the first screen, soon there he realizes that the game is something completely different. Basically, it's always a question of buying properties and building on them in order to increase their value, but the way in which this takes place is completely distorted from the norm: this isn't a question of sitting quietly around a table, trying to keep what the mythical fake banknotes as much as possible in order, we must instead launch ourselves into the boarding, facing the opponents in a physical way and with no holds barred to achieve real estate domination on the various maps present. It is therefore not a videogame translation of Monopoly but a complete reinterpretation in a party game key, which after a moment of disorientation can prove to be damned addictive. Unleashed houseowners Monopoly Madness, a map seen from above It may seem strange, seeing how the action takes place, but the central core of the gameplay is based precisely on the purchase of land and the construction of houses, with the increase of these which determines an increasingly substantial flow of money . However, the way in which the purchase and management of real estate takes place is quite different from what one would expect from a real estate tycoon simulation: a series of crazy characters are launched within a map of your choice between different possibilities , made up of streets and city blocks that can be purchased and managed. The commands are based on the use of a sort of vacuum cleaner that allows you to suck up money, water and electricity from the map and pour them on land and buildings: in this way we can buy the various areas and evolve them with the construction of buildings. At unpredictable time intervals, the auction for the purchase of various land is triggered and we must therefore dash near these to place our bets, trying to burn the opponents with the right timing but also trying not to exaggerate with the expenses. The fundamental mechanic therefore requires you to suck up resources around the map and pour them onto the land, throwing money to participate in auctions or water and electricity (in this way taking up the iconic presence of the aqueduct and the electricity company) to make them evolve with the construction of new buildings capable of increasing the cash flow. Parallel to these basic activities, however, there are also disturbing actions and real clashes with opponents. This is because the whole game takes place in real time and there is never a moment's respite: to help us in the race towards the auctions, the conquest of bonuses or even ~steal~ the lands already conquered by the other players, it is possible to use different power-ups that add very arcade characteristics to the whole, allowing you to place obstacles on the roads, directly hit opponents or buildings or create diversions that can lead to the change of ownership of the land, adding characteristics of a real action game. Modes, maps and customizations In Monopoly Madness the unexpected are definitely felt There is a good assortment of game options between various modes and customizations, starting from an initial subdivision between the ~story~ - which allows you to progressively unlock the various game types and gradually discover their characteristics - the free mode which allows you to create games with rules of your choice and team play. The fulcrum of everything is obviously the multiplayer, present here both online and offline in split screen, but possibly it is also possible to play in single player with bots controlled by artificial intelligence in case you don'thave them available to fellow players, a rather inadvisable fallback option considering the not exactly brilliant AI. The basic core of the action remains the same, in principle: buying land and building houses, but to this is added a truly remarkable amount of variations, albeit marginal in terms of actual changes to the gameplay. Maps are also present in good quantity, but the presence of different obstacles and configurations for movement, complete with contextual elements such as timed openings, mobile bridges or railways with passing trains, do not provide truly consistent changes to the game action, which can be a bit repetitive, in the long run. Monopoly Madness has somewhat geeky characters In any case, the amount of content is considerable and, even if it is only cosmetic variations, fans of avatar customization really have plenty to experiment with: numerous different characters to unlock and further cosmetic modifications to be applied to these allow to increase the sense of progression with the continuous conquest of new rewards, within a very broad objective system. The matches are usually resolved in very short sessions, which can range from 5 to 10 minutes, always keeping the pace up and easily pushing one match after another, especially if we find ourselves with an assorted group of players and in the presence, as befits a party game. Crazy Monopoly Monopoly Madness features different maps and environments The operation of transforming an extremely classic board game into a cheerful and chaotic party game has been remarkably successful, also thanks to particularly apt design choices: Monopoly Madness recovers some elements of the traditional iconography of the old game and transfers them into a different context, where they make sense up to a certain point but still manage to maintain a link with their roots. The map seen from above, with the terrains that are colored according to the different owners, effectively recall the old base of the board game, while largely distorting its layout and functioning, as well as the presence of houses to be built and water and electricity to be collected as a link to the aqueduct and power plant. Some maps also have stations, albeit with a different function (here they serve to offer players shortcuts, so they can quickly move from one area to another). Despite the chaos that dominates the action, given that the matches are usually resolved in a matter of minutes where a bit of everything happens, the visual manages to keep the situation quite clear: the only problems, in this sense, are given by the possibility of confusing one's character among the others and the difficulty in using power-ups precisely in some cases, but confusion is an integral part of the gameplay in a multiplayer party game like this, so these are issues that disturb ~by design~ and on which there is little to complain. It should be noted, however, that Monopoly Madness is entirely localized and dubbed in Italian, making it suitable for very different audiences on this front too.", "date": "2021-12-23", "grade": "7.0"}
