After numerous protests from fans of Street Fighter and Marvel vs Capcom 3, who complained about a flood of small paid packages apparently extrapolated from the base game to be resold separately, the historic Japanese house has calmed the spirits with Resident Evil 6, for then start charging again with this Devil May Cry. But this time with a much softer and much less open to criticism approach. The latest DLC available from March 6 is titled The Fall of Vergil and first of all it comes after a completely free first DLC. Secondly, it can be downloaded at an average price lower than those applied by the competition. Last but not least: it is evident that this small portion of the single player campaign is independent of the base game, and therefore almost certainly developed after marketing. But will this be enough to be loved by fans? Fall and awakening of a soul The new DLC dedicated to the Devil May Cry universe is a small independent chapter placed chronologically ahead of the end of the base game, as if to act as a ~bridge~ for a possible future sequel but in which, instead of Dante, we have to step into the shoes of his brother Vergil. Regardless of the fact that ~history~ has never dominated titles such as Devil May Cry, the incipit would not even be evil: Vergil, defeated and fallen, is sinking into the abyss of limbo; a voice coming from an abstract and obscure entity tells him that he still has one chance: to fight against the still open wounds of his own heart, which no longer wants to beat, and to return to life. The story is not told with animated cut scenes, as usual, but through a series of ~semi~ animated drawings but with a beautiful graphic style. However, this factor highlights a certain speed in development and probably the few funds made available by the manufacturer. Xbox 360 goals As each DLC usually does, this too adds another 250 to the canonical 1000 points through 10 objectives to unlock. These are very simple achievements to obtain: you just need to complete the expansion at the maximum difficulty level (moreover a very feasible undertaking) to unlock them all and thus reach the threshold of 1250 total. Fight for life The feeling becomes more evident starting to play. The DLC consists of six levels, one of which consists of a boss, and two are carbon-copy, but must be faced with different powers available. In total that's about two hours of additional gameplay - not a lot. The basic structure of The Fall of Vergil is not dissimilar from Dante's adventure, being composed mainly of purely action phases, where in a succession of enemies on the screen with ever increasing difficulty, the rhythm of the game is broken with platform phases to face with the use of energy swords in our equipment. Vergil's armory is much less heterogeneous than his brother's. First, forget about firearms and related variations on the theme. Vergil can summon energy swords and throw at enemies, or attract them to him by modifying the function with the triggers of the pad exactly as Dante does. The only weapon available will be the Yamato sword and related angelic / demonic incarnations, upgrades obtained as you progress through the game and which include a fairly slow and cumbersome, but extremely powerful combo, but also short and fast blows. The combat system, already quite run-in and developed in itself, finds in Vergil a rather plastered and cumbersome protagonist, at times slow and much less fun than Dante, who had many more arrows ~at his bow~. Some attacks are too confusing: for example the main one of the angelic form sees us slide to the ground for a long distance without a ~lock~ on the enemy, and consequently we often find ourselves out of the game action and with a camera that goes crazy for let us see where the enemy we initially targeted is. The combos are as spectacular as Dante's, it is true, but often too disconnected from the basic attacks and the result is a slight difficulty in setting up a series of fluid and rapid attacks. In the DLC there are original locations, but always characterized by a certain anonymity (will it be the usual clear sky above our heads?) and by the recycling of many elements already seen in the basic adventure. There are four difficulty levels to try, all quite calibrated downwards, a factor that does not increase the longevity of this expansion beyond two hours, then dying very rarely. The bosses themselves are too simpleto be eliminated, we would have expected much more. Summing up, we would like to recommend this DLC only to super fans of the saga who want to delve into the story of Vergil or have a little more healthy destruction once DMC Devil May Cry is finished. Having a DLC, an extra piece of story or gameplay is never a bad thing. You just have to evaluate your own needs and our attachment to the saga. For all casual players, let's say that you could easily do without it as it doesn't add anything particularly significant either from a narrative point of view or from a gameplay point of view (indeed, it's a slight step backwards).", "date": "2013-03-11", "grade": null}
