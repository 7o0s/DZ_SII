{"name": "Twin Mirror", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/twin-mirror-recensione.html", "text": "Since the release of Remember Me in 2013, French development studio Dontnod has been trying to define its identity. Life is Strange brought him to the fore, thanks to a story that, although not without its flaws, left its mark. However, the subsequent ones, specifically Life is Strange 2 and the more recent Tell Me Why (Vampyr is not a narrative adventure, so we will leave it aside in this case), broke the idyll: too focused on the social issues underlying both, the narrative has been affected, leaving the idea that the magic of Arcadia Bay was just a stroke of luck. Now it's the turn of the review of Twin Mirror, Dontnod's latest effort that finally brings the studio back on the old tracks after a long period of absence following the announcement, mixing the narrative of the first LiS with some of the investigative mechanics of Vampyr and Remember Me: the result is a narrative thriller, which revolves around a journalistic investigation and brings the developers even closer to consolidating their style. The mix of the elements mentioned above comes to exploit and improve what are the greatest strengths of the team. History We closely follow the story of Sam Higgs, a former journalist who returns to his hometown of Basswood (West Virginia) after two years for the wake of his best friend, who died in a car accident. There are reasons why Sam has moved away, which we will not reveal to you since they are one of the many narrative turning points: it is enough to know that he is not very well liked and he himself, due to his misanthropic nature, does not intend to stay longer than necessary. The situation takes a different turn and what should have been a simple visit to pay homage to his best friend turns into an investigative thriller where reality sometimes gives way to Sam's inner world: as an incredibly pragmatic man, he faces in fact, analyzing each situation until obtaining the naked and raw truth, relying both on one's Mental Palace and on the so-called Him. it is part of him and often offers him a more human point of view, less rigid and framed than his nihilistic vision of the world. Opposing personalities, therefore, which put together work very well and give depth to the narrative. In his search for the truth, Sam interacts with different characters in a more or less in-depth way and it is here that the roots of the first Life is Strange are felt strongly: being a narrative game, communication is one of the fundamental points and where not all the inhabitants of Basswood enjoy an all-round characterization, limiting themselves to being spots of color in the background, there are some who emerge from the screen managing to be remembered both for name and for some peculiarity that distinguishes them, provided that we linger to exchange more talk than necessary. Where Dontnod's latest projects failed entirely to link the narrative context to the characters, often reinforcing one at the expense of the other, Basswood here becomes a small microcosm that would not be the same without its inhabitants: better said, in this case perceives their belonging to the game world and without them a probably different town would come out. Setting, plot and characters are therefore well blended together, even in the face of a rather limited overall duration by the standards to which Dontnod has accustomed us - or perhaps the perception is distorted by the fact that it is the first linear narrative adventure, without the subdivision into episodes. In some moments the development seemed a bit hasty, as simplistic and a bit clich is the case Sam is investigating, but in the end it emerges quite clearly that the narrative plot is an excuse to sink into the protagonist, shape it also and above all on the basis of our choices. It is not so much the story of Basswood, of his tragedy, as the path of rebirth (or stagnation, it really depends on you) of Sam who after two years of estranging himself from the world tries to find himself in that very town that forced to ~exile~. In all of this, he plays a fundamental role and despite being a character linked to his subconscious he manages to impose himself with a strength and at the same time a delicacy that has repeatedly left us uncertain about which decision to make. The gameplay From a narrative point of view, the gameplay is more or less unchanged compared to past experiences of Dontnod, with the only exception of the observations that Sam can have about any detail of the game world: these are very short nnotes under the element we are observing but they contribute to making us better understand the character and, although they are irrelevant, one always wants to know what Sam thinks about it. The real novelty is the Mental Palace, something that if you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes (and not only) needs no explanation: in short, it is Sam's inner world, the one in which he takes refuge when he wants to analyze a situation in the way as objective as possible. That extra quid, we would say, which generally allows him to always be one step ahead of the others, to the detriment of an evident estrangement from the real world. Since it is his mind and considering the fact that Sam is a very complex character, often afflicted by doubts concerning both himself and others, it is not uncommon that this peace, this inner rigor, can be strongly influenced by his state of mind In practice, the Mental Palace allows us to analyze a potential crime scene and draw the right conclusion by formulating hypotheses and dismantling them where something does not add up: in this sense it is not really possible to make a mistake, or rather it is not outside. While we are immersed in our reflections we can combine several scenarios until we find the right one and from there draw the deduction that will take us further in the game. A guided tour, in short, but perfectly logical if one considers the nature of the Mental Palace, exploited precisely to eliminate the improbable and to the point of leaving the only possible truth. It is therefore not really possible to proceed the investigation towards a dead end or a wrong direction, this also due to a limited number of characters which does not allow the spectrum to be broadened too much. What we liked is the fact that the use of this mechanic is never identical: the investigations, while adopting the same scheme, can also vary in the approach based on the state of mind in which Sam is - which is always guided from history but still remains a pleasant solution to live. Sometimes it happens that the mind turns against us, this is because Sam is constantly struggling to maintain balance, and push us to regain control through fragmented and lugubrious internal sequences that refer to a specific situation in the first LiS with memory. Development Overall, Twin Mirror elaborates and expands on elements introduced in previous games and, thanks to a more cinematic slant, presents itself as an engaging and well-structured interactive thriller in terms of decisions to be made. There are certain situations in which our choices will really make a difference both towards us and those around us: we tested it on two different games, the first on the stomach and the second aimed at making different decisions, and they are two paths came out, two Sams, different. Above all, the awareness emerged that there is no right and wrong with regard to Sam's personality, his development grows with us and our approach to the game world - the man who will emerge in the end is the sum of the our choices. The narrative plot, as we mentioned, seemed a bit rushed in some points but the choice of a rather simple story, a bit clichd, and limited in the number of characters is an accomplice. This leads to a duration that may seem reduced, and in fact it is compared to even the recent Tell Me Why, but when we realize that the plot is only a pretext to tell the character of Sam we understand that, apart from some expedient, lengthening it would only lead to stagnation of the narration. With its slight pacing defects, Twin Mirror nonetheless remains a very enjoyable story, strong in a multifaceted protagonist and an alter ego who at times steals the show with his charisma: a journey in the human psyche whose objective is, perhaps, to learn to accept oneself and one's weaknesses. Or raise your guard, fight them ferociously trying to identify an enemy who, in the end, is an unacceptable himself - thus reducing himself to looking for him in a blind mirror and aiming empty. Dontnod conquers again that narrative amalgam that made the first Life is Strange possible, demonstrating with Twin Mirror that he has returned to those tracks from which the previous two games had made him deviate, too concentrated on pointing the finger at a theme without considering which can no longer (similar to the use of a famous brand, as in the case of Avengers) be the only driver of the experience it intends to offer. From an artistic point of view, we have noticed some characters have a somewhat flat acting if compared to Sam and Lui, nothing that really affects the experience especially if we consider the presence of some as a simple side dish. The soundtrack is, ststrangely, the aspect that shines least and there was no particular trace that remained in our mind. Again, the levels of the first Life is Strange seem difficult to achieve. Finally, as far as animation is concerned, if we take Twin Mirror and put it in a general comparison with all the games that populate the market, it will certainly be defeated. Analyzing it instead in the microcosm of the Dontnod works, we note once again the steps forward with motion capture, which manage to give life to the inhabitants of Basswood and differentiate them just enough to make them recognizable. Once again not everyone enjoys the same care given to Sam but we are pleased to note that with each game the bar always rises a little more. A real definitive leap in quality would be needed, which perhaps could materialize with the next gen.", "date": "2020-12-01", "grade": "8.0"}
