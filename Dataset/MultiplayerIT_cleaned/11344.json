{"name": "NBA Smash!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-smash.html", "text": "If more or less accurate and more or less valid basketball simulations come out for PCs and consoles every year, the credit is also due to the good old NBA Jam. It is a Midway coin-op that was released in theaters in the early 90s: thanks to an immediate and spectacular arcade setting, with two-on-two games bordering on the absurd, it has conquered millions of fans around for the world and has been ported to all gaming systems. In fact, it has cleared a certain concept of basketball even among gamers, a concept that was taken up later but without obtaining the same results in terms of popularity. NBA Smash!, needless to go around it, is a bit of an NBA Jam clone: two-on-two matches, super shots, spectacular action, improbable jumps and so on. So has Gameloft managed to create the perfect arcade for mobile? Certainly the game developers have not spared themselves in terms of substance, given that from the start screen we can access four different modes: exhibition, tournament, career and challenge. The first sees us organize a single game with two teams of our choice from the thirty available, while the challenge mode is divided between dunking and long shots competitions. Clearly the tournament and the career are the fulcrum, giving us the opportunity to participate in long competitions that ultimately crown a winning team. Before taking the field, we'll have to decide the basic rules (the score to reach for victory, for example) and the players to use, so we'll be face to face with our opponents. The control system sees the joystick assigned to the movement, the 5 key which is used to pass and steal the ball, the 0 key to shoot or to jump in the defensive phase, while the * and # keys are used respectively to perform tricks or change character and to activate the super shot, available when the appropriate bar (located at the top of the screen) is full. The technical realization of the game is excellent, without a doubt. The players are no different, let's say we'll often see four identical sprites moving across the screen, but the animations are good in quantity and quality. Furthermore, the three available scenarios are really beautiful to look at, with the color tones that change radically from time to time and different moving objects in the background. The activation of the special moves is underlined by a flash of light and various kinetic lines, to underline the speed and power of the action, while each shot at the basket is re-proposed through a nice replay. The sound, as often happens, does not boast a great quality: the few music is discreet but leaves the time they find, while the effects during the games are few and far from appropriate. Finally, the control system responds promptly to inputs and never seems to ~get stuck~: not bad.
