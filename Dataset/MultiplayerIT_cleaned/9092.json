Developed by the French team Agharta Studio, the episodic series 1112 was one of these examples, but excessive difficulty, questionable design choices and too short an experience did not allow the first two published chapters to represent the excellence of iOS exclusives. indeed revealing themselves to be two rather mediocre games. However, despite the lukewarm reception from critics, the developers from beyond the Alps did not stop and satisfied the fans of the series by finally publishing 1112 Episode 3, a chapter which, at least in the hopes of many, can revive what is a praises the enormous potential. Louis who? After the New York parenthesis of the second episode, with its more or less chic clubs populated by fashionistas and slobs from the Big Apple, this time Louis returns to his Jalonsville, the small town that served as the stage for the first chapter of the series. Yet, in 1112 Episode 3 that quiet and monotonous agglomeration of neighborhoods is much more desolate, gloomy and degraded than we remembered, above all because of the winter, which filled the streets with snow and the clubs with drunks. Once again the developers have tried to help those approaching the series for the first time, including a summary with the most important moments of the previous chapters. Summary which, unfortunately, is too short, fast and superficial to fully understand what really happened and what are the links with the other characters, which should not be underestimated considering that some Jalonsville inhabitants have already been introduced and explored in past. Episode 3 opens once again with Louis who, struck by a strong amnesia, remembers absolutely nothing of what happened, although this time there is a void of several months to fill in his head and his girlfriend has decided to disappear mysteriously. There are very few innovations in terms of interface and gameplay: each screen hides elements that can be collected or interacted with, while the collected objects can be combined or recalled directly from the inventory. The dialogues with the other characters are rather linear, with the player having to try all possible answers to the dialogues to obtain clues or information capable of unlocking new questions. Unfortunately, however, once again there is no aid system, and often you find yourself stuck with no escape routes in seemingly unsolvable puzzles due to unclear clues or badly hidden objects in the scenario. From this point of view it is a real shame that Agharta Studio has not learned anything from the criticisms received with Episode 1 and 2, proposing a frustrating experience in too many points. Even the puzzles are not particularly clever, and although some mini-games try to introduce some variety, it must be said that not all are equally successful. On the other hand, nothing to complain about the artistic realization: those who have played the first two episodes will know well how much care is placed in the creation of the backdrops and characters, and many of the settings and screens of the first chapter have been completely redesigned, now colder, disreputable or devastated. The atmosphere is truly unique and in the midst of alcoholics and crazy old women who praise the end of the world, you meet more or less charismatic and well-groomed characters, ruined in some cases by an Italian localization not without errors or ineffective adaptations. Words of praise must also be spent on the music, and in particular one cannot fail to underline the excellent main theme, a melancholic piece composed by the French group Elie G & Brothers, capable of immediately projecting into what is the mood of the whole the adventure.
