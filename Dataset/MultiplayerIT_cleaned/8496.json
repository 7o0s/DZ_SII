The story of this DLC connects directly to the ending of the main game and offers an alternative and complementary version of the story that is virtually linked to a hypothetical third chapter that will surely see the light in the future. A couple of hours of pure action that will delight all the aficionados of the bat man. Violent punches It's true that two hours of gameplay aren't many, but in this (relative) short time that Harley Quinn's Revenge makes available to us, all the iconography and charisma of a character like Batman shines through, perhaps even more evidently and marked than in the main adventure itself. The story begins with an angry and vengeful Harley Quinn who - of course - blames the Joker's death on the bat, and for this it is her intention to make him pay at all costs. From the point of view of narration, the idea of flashbacks that show us how, in the role of Batman, the latter fell into an ambush by the bad girl of the moment and lost track of her is good. The real novelty, however, is the use of Robin as the main character with the young super-hero, hired by Oracle and Inspector Gordon, who is called to find his mentor wandering through the dangerous slums of the city. The map on which this action-free roaming takes place is very large, despite having been limited compared to the entire Arkam City, and offers a very open approach to carrying out the main mission which is to track down Harley Quinn and Batman. The city is filled with heavily armed criminal gangs that limit our mobility and make the main mission slightly more difficult than the main Arkam City adventure was. There are no secondary objectives, except for the mission to track down all thirty balloons with Harley Quinn's eerie smiley face drawn on them. There are no sensational novelties from the point of view of gameplay also because the purely action matrix did not need any tweaks. To tell the truth, however, there are some small new elements, for example, Robin is equipped with a special two-handed stick to be used both as a melee attack weapon and as a defense tool against ranged attacks by enemies, opening up like an umbrella and functioning as a sort of Swat shield. Robin is also equipped with stun grenades and, in addition to the classic grappling hook that allows him to flit from one building to another, even a powerful flying kick. Xbox 360 goals Like any self-respecting DLC, this Harley Quinn's Revenge also adds objectives to unlock and points to add to your gamertag. To be precise 10 objectives for a total of 250 points. These are actions that are quite simple to perform and that follow the plot of the story, so they are obtained without too much effort. The only tricky one is to find all of Harley Quinn's balloons scattered across the vast playing area, but the reward is 50 points. Continuity of events The best thing about this DLC is certainly the fact that it manages to maintain a certain continuity in the narrative, hooking up to the main Arkam City adventure and providing interesting ideas for a possible third chapter. It is not, therefore, an independent micro-story completely detached from the context, but an integral part of the main work. The development of Robin's character is also appreciable, fished out of the multiplayer and thrown into the fray with excellent characterization and independence. Although there are no upheavals in the well-tested gameplay, the idea of renewing the way of recounting events through flashbacks that explain how certain situations were reached is however valid. The vicissitudes of Batman and Robin fit perfectly in a staggered space-time context, giving the impression of a successful continuum. However, the plot is not shocking or particularly full of twists and turns, but follows the classic plot of the good superheroes against the evil ones (we let you understand who will be the winner, without spoilers), what convinces is precisely the ~way~ of telling it and spread it out through a couple of hours of fun. The ~open~ characterization of the adventure, combined with a good supply of weapons and nice gadgets, makes the game action extremely varied and leaves the player with the choice of how to approach the enemy, attack or defend. Bands can be bypassed by moving from adjacent areasEnts and stealthily hit them, you can face them openly with the help of the most powerful weapons, or attack from a distance: there is no single and valid way to proceed. Among the strengths of Harley Quinn's Revenge there is obviously also an amazing technical sector, but this does not surprise us at all given the beauty of the main game. The artistic direction, always masterful, gives us a Harley Quinn with a heavy make-up now poured on her face due to the tears spent for the beloved Joker, while her former henchmen have a standard uniform matching the look of the new ~ bad guy~. Ultimately it is a DLC absolutely to buy for all true fans of the Batman universe, with attention to all details even if rather short. For the latter reason, to be evaluated for all the others also considering that Harley Quinn's Revenge will be included in the ~Game of the Year~ edition to be released soon in all stores.", "date": "2012-06-15", "grade": null}
