{"name": "New World Order", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/new-world-order.html", "text": "Good versus bad? Well yes! It's always the usual speech: the world is divided between good and evil. Two sides, at this juncture, represent them better than others: on the one hand the ~Syndicate~, which is anything but an association of ~honest~ workers and on the other the ~Global Assault Team~, a handful of heroes called sued to counter the criminal actions of the bad guys. The main cause is always the same: money, which will make the world go around, but also a whole series of negative intentions, which have always been the favorite dishes of dishonest and unscrupulous people. However without going too far into the subject, in the singleplaying section we will take on the role of the most illustrious hero, a certain John Dobbs, who, like a lone wolf and along a whole series of levels, will have to be able to eradicate the bad faction, only thanks to the combination of his own skill combined with the usual dose of c ... er ... luck. As support, unfortunately only ~external~ (from the usual cowardly employees, in front of a monitor), we will have a portable electronic display, which connected to the satellite of the base, will send us the advice of the commander as we proceed in the levels . Let's say right away that it is the classic list of objectives to be completed (otherwise we run the risk of creating false illusions for possible buyers.). But let's get to the point, sifting through the news that New World Order, in its small way, has brought to the category. Ten kilos, precision and grade. Although apparently these words have no correlation, in NWO they are linked by a single thread, which will heavily affect our firepower. In fact, in the P3Int title, money and various gifts have been set aside for the acquisition of weapons, to make way for a system based on ~experience~ points. In practice, the equation is the following: ~(n. opponents killed/hit hits) + missions accomplished=experience points.~. The exp. accumulated will guarantee us the acquisition of ~grades~ (there are five in all: Private, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Major and Colonel) which increase proportionally to the damage inflicted on the opponents. As a result, as we progress through the career ladder, we will have access to the most ~deadly~ weapons. To ensure an accurate calculation, NWO defines the hit or miss conditions, using every pixel of the character's body. In this way the numerous bullets that graze the characters, wounding them slightly, do not count as hits. Instead, experience points are ~lost~ by damaging one's team and suffering personal damage (due to one's own or others' causes). Finally, the experience is reset to each map (only in multiplayer, while in singleplaying the ~career~ increases with the progress of the levels) or when you disconnect from the server. Apart from this, our load of weapons, including ammunition and objects, cannot exceed the total weight of ten kilos (ten thousand grams in the game). Furthermore, realistically, an excessive load will limit our agility and speed; therefore carrying a minigun, which alone weighs eight kilos but allows for superior firepower, will weigh on our movement more than a simple pistol, weighing less than a kilo but poor in inflicting substantial damage. However, it is possible to collect the weapons of the deceased from the ground, provided that you have enough ~Kg~ available for collection, otherwise it is enough to throw away the heavier weapon possessed, to make room for the new one. The Pros of NWO... Let's start with the graphics engine, which is one of the few on the market that takes full advantage of the technical advances brought about by the new generations of GPUs (Geforce 3 and Radeon 8500 up). The calculation of shadows and lights in real time makes a certain impression, especially the first times you see your own shadow projected onto the wall in an ultra-realistic way, to which other contour effects are added, such as the tiny glass pralines that they fall to the ground from the windows of the cars ~pierced~ by the shots, or the bursts of machine guns that ~shatter~ the wall covering into dust! All this, combined with the meticulous architecture of the maps, gives a superlative touch of class to the graphics, which in some places seem to be the result of a ~photorealistic~ rendering as shown therein. The graphic variability of the levels (a total of twelve, from which the twelve maps in multiplaying have been taken in full), also increases the visual joy, to which we can include the five game modes (Team Deathmatch, Escape, Plant The Bomb, Fallout and Hostage Rescue), including an additional one, equivalent to a ~cooperative~ of singleplaying levels played in multiplayer, which greatly increase the longevity and overall gameplay. Finally, the sound of the weapons, like almost all recent similar productions, is similar to the ~real~ counterpart, so close to total perfection. ... and the cons! Never seen so many bugs and defects in a product sold as a ~final~ version! Let's start with the most ~serious~ ones: your character often gets ~stuck~ in the most disparate parts of the map: near walls or crevices, the fender of a bus (!), tables, even on the side of the road! ALL maps, sadly, suffer from the same flaws. After several days spent testing the game thoroughly, it turns out that there is no map, let's say UNA, free from problems. There is no point wriggling, jumping or ducking to ~release~ our character; in the end The ~suicide~ button was one of the most used. Another problem: Bad clipping galore! Surface ~flipping~ is a constant of NWO. Just walk a little between the levels to notice this unsightly and ungainly graphic aspect. Other substantial defects are the overlapping of several shadows (usually of two or more nearby players) which create a dark visual artifact, which completely covers the surfaces. It doesn't affect playability, of course, but the flaw is there and it shows. Then the hardware requests, to run all the ambaradan, are nabobs: it is obvious that shadows and lights calculated in real time are ~paid~ dearly, but in NWO ultra-pumped configurations are mandatory to make it run properly, otherwise, either you are satisfied with a low framerate or you disable most of the innovative graphic ~goodies~, without which NWO is inferior even to products published years ago! The configuration interface needs a major overhaul. Apart from the fact that the ~always run~ option does not work (even if it is set to OFF, in the game you always run and to walk normally you have to hold down a key), the server settings are not stored, and you have to reconfigure each time half the world. In singleplay there is no save, unless you complete the level. Every time it cracks you have to start from scratch and take out an average of fifteen enemies, possibly with silenced weapons (they are all aiming like a Terminator, so it's not worth ~waking them up~!). This, of course, is not easy for anyone (I think even for the programmers themselves.). Imagine that just to pass the second level you will have to sweat the proverbial ~seventy-seven~ shirts, and more than once you will happen to reach the last opponent, who quickly and painlessly slips you like a thrush from twenty meters away with a barrage of AK-47s! In those moments the thought flies to the programmers who have excluded the save, and who will surely have deactivated to increase longevity (of course! You can't pass the levels!). Dulcis in fundo, the intelligence of the hostages... I've never seen anything more idiotic! Not even kicking them can you convince them to follow you: you beg them, you direct them, you retrace your steps over and over again and those few times they finally follow you or they get stuck on the stairs or they look at you from afar and you walk away! It's a pity that the shots don't go well, otherwise it would have been preferable, by far, to shoot them on the spot! Summing up, having ascertained the existence of this flood of problems, one wonders with what criterion the ~quality control~ department was able to classify NWO in ~final version~. The last patch released, 1.3, corrected ~gross~ defects, which improved, even if only slightly, the stability and speed of the game. But how many patches will still have to wait for the other defects? And will they ever be corrected? Conclusions. The conclusions seem obvious: even NWO, as it shows itself now, has lost the challenge against the stainless Counter-Strike. If on the one hand the graphics engine has added innovative aspects to the category, on the other it has shown such serious gaps as to create serious doubts about the good fortune of the title. It is inadmissible to publish a product with such a quantity of defects, most of which are so obvious as to leave you speechless! The software house on an almost weekly basis continues to churn out ~small~ patches (1.34 was released a few days ago), but at this rate a few months will have to pass for a serious and complete revision of the code. Final tip: dust off Counter-Strike, it's so much better! Premise Never as in the past year has Counter-Strike's primacy been so ~threatened~ by titles with a similar ~plot~. We started from Global Operations, which had poorly exploited potential and made even more deficient by limping graphics and ridiculous artificial intelligence- if played in singleplaying - which have sunk it bluntly into the slums of oblivion. Then there was the attempt of Tactical Operation: Assault on Terror, which from a free mod of Unreal Tournament, has turned into a paid stand-alone version, but little has been seen in addition to the beta version, of nothing inferior. Here too a tacky artificial intelligence and rose water simulated weapons, in fact, have contributed heavily to relegating it to a corner where only a strenuous - and small - group of enthusiasts considers it better than the impregnable Counter-Strike. Dunno, they're happy... Team Factor opened a small parenthesis, but it was immediately closed by a poor quality playability and a sleepy graphics engine, not very suitable for a game rhythm that still requires a certain speed, at which the meager workmanship of the hud is added, among the most ~unsympathetic~ of the category. It's still under a ~patching~ period and it's not said that it won't be able to climb a few steps in the rankings, but given its potential, we believe that Counter-Strike can sleep peacefully from the top of its throne for much longer. New World Order is the last pretender of 2002 in the category of semi-tactical First Person Shooters (remember that the ~deeply~ tactical ones have always been branded ~Tom Clancy~, which with the Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon series, maintains the undisputed primacy of the category, around which that Operation Flashpoint orbits, tending more towards ~simulation~ than actual tactics.). Will the Project Three Interactive title be able to conquer the noble position of the ~old~ Counter-Strike? Read on and you will know... ;)", "date": "2003-01-18", "grade": null}
