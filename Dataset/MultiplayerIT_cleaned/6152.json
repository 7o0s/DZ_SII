It may seem obvious, but in reality it is not at all. Outside observers often look at MMORPG expansions and frown when they look too much like the base game, as if expecting to see who knows what revolutions in graphics or gameplay. The truth is that, in the theme park MMORPG space, evolution fans care up to a certain point. They play their characters in a certain world and all they want is new thrills, new maps to explore, new items to find, new enemies to defeat. Of course, if you don't want to evolve, you must at least know how to reinvent yourself, and we are sure that Naoki Yoshida knows what that means: after all, it was he who resurrected Final Fantasy XIV with his amazing reboot A Realm Reborn. But when it comes to expansions, the boundaries to deal with are very thin, the risk of overdoing or doing too little is always around the corner and, with Heavensward, the Japanese producer has preferred to take small and cautious steps. The result may not be a groundbreaking expansion, but it sure is an excellent Final Fantasy. Heavensward isn't a groundbreaking set, but it's definitely a great Final Fantasy Up to the moon Watching the end credits roll after completing a mission of an MMORPG, one feels taken for a ride, especially if after those ten minutes, accompanied by the best tracks of the splendid soundtrack, there is also a very short teaser that anticipates the next developments of the story, a bit like it has been happening for some years with the Marvel superhero films. This choice, however, demonstrates that Naoki Yoshida did not treat Heavensward - and A Realm Reborn, before it - as a simple MMORPG, but as a real episode of the very famous Square Enix saga. Ironically, Heavensward, despite being a ~mere expansion~, is also one of the best exponents of Final Fantasy. In the very long cycle of missions that begins at level 50 and ends at level 60, fans will find the salient features that made them fall in love with the franchise: interesting and multifaceted supporting characters, twists that are anything but trivial, an unbridled fantasy with a sci-fi tip, new enemies, old friends, conspiracies, secrets and all the ambaradan. In our hands-on we anticipated something about the centuries-old Dragonsong War that afflicts the city of Ishgard and in which the Warrior of Light - which would be us - and his companions are involved after narrowly escaping the attempted coup of Ul'dah . Little did we know yet that the battle against the dragons of Nidhogg would take on, in the space of a few hours, an aspect and meaning very different from that of a simple invasion, forcing us to forge unlikely alliances and to dissect a legend that risked crumbling the culture of Ishgard itself. Our search for peace has once again crossed the path of the Ascians, the shady figures who plot the resurrection of their god Zodiark in the shadows and who now seem to want to get rid of us. In short, we really liked the story of Heavensward, also because Naoki Yoshida peppered it with quotations, drawing heavily on more than twenty years of Final Fantasy: it is well written, interspersed with spectacular non-interactive sequences and accompanied by a simply amazing soundtrack. The merit also goes largely to the localization in English, once again dignified and refined, in certain passages perhaps even too much: we would like to say that knowledge of school English is enough to understand the subtleties of certain dialogues, but this is not the case , even if it is more than enough to understand how the skills and the numerous descriptions work. Square Enix has also raised the bar with regard to dubbing, hiring some voice actors who have been able to give greater intensity to the most important characters. In addition, we also appreciated the choice to ~accompany~ the player with a fictitious party of supporting characters: it was a bit like playing a traditional jRPG, with our heroes traveling together and facing the most important battles as a group. In short, it is a pity that this splendid journey is sometimes confused in a jumble of boring and insignificant secondary missions: compared to the main quest of A Realm Reborn, that of Heavensward does not prevaricate at all, and this time there are no lavish banquets to prepare for prove themselves worthy to face Titan. Despite this, it is not even totally possible to devote yourself only to the main missions, since they could require a higher level than the one achieved: here the secondary missions and a whole corollary of activities come into play.which will surprise no one. One million jobs Unfortunately, the arrangement and structuring of the secondary missions remains one of the main weaknesses of Final Fantasy XIV, and at this point it is clear that it is a choice of the developer rather than a training error: Naoki Yoshida is not stupid, he is a big fan of World of Warcraft and its reboot has amply demonstrated this, but it persists in spreading even the simplest missions into far too many steps and comings and goings, forcing players to move from one end of the map to the other even just to read a few dialogues lines. There's nothing more frustrating than completing a mission after being forced to traverse a vast and complicated map like the Churning Mists multiple times, only to be rewarded with a handful of experience points and an armor dye. Unfortunately, the optional missions seem to have been designed as a pure and simple filler, or as an alternative system to gain a few more experience points when another Job is raised, and although some are real secondary storylines, in some cases even compelling, most part is just too repetitive and unnecessarily long. In those cases, as they say, the game isn't worth the candle... unless you want to unlock an Aether Current to fly or get your hands on a slightly more tempting reward than usual. In particular, the leveling seemed subdued between 55 and 60, when you literally spend hours looking for Moogles that are lost or that have gone hunting and become the prey: in these cases we have found that unlocking the flight helps not a little, also because the maps are so intricate that the continuous comings and goings on the ground would have been unsustainable. The new areas, however, are small masterpieces: the Sea of Clouds and the Dravanian Forelands, in particular, struck us for the bright colors and environmental detail during the day, and for the spectacularity of the atmospheric effects or lighting during the Night. In this sense, we must underline that the PlayStation 4 version we put to the whip has never given in even for a moment, not even in the most visually complex situations such as the FATEs could be in the presence of many players. To be honest, the latter was the rarest case ever: the grinding of FATE now seems to belong to the past, or to have significantly reduced, especially in the first half of the leveling. There are simply many more ways to collect experience points, such as the daily Duty Roulette in old and new (and beautiful!) dungeons, Hunts or Levequests. Nothing that the old players of A Realm Reborn don't already know: from this point of view, Heavensward adds practically nothing to the sample of content, and what was done before, is still being done now. The Job repertoire has expanded with the addition of the Dark Knight, the Machinist and the Astrologian, adding a new profession for each archetype. Here the donkey falls a bit, because one of the things that amazed us the most about Heavensward is the almost absolute candor of the code: we have not encountered practically any bugs or long queues or sudden crashes, everything went as smooth as butter since from the first connection. It is an important milestone for a game that, contrary to the tradition of the genre, has not had even one day of public beta. On the other hand, if there had been one, perhaps Yoshi-P and his collaborators could have analyzed player feedback and perfected the three new Jobs, as they struggle to excite the community. Despite this, remembering the drastic revamp of the Warrior operated a few months after the release of the 2.0 client, we can only be confident about their future, not to mention that the new Jobs start directly at level 30 and are also quite original, albeit fairly complex . For all the others, on the other hand, there is some adjustment, improvement or weakening to adapt to: we, for the occasion, hung up our toga, placed our Omnilex in the library and took on the clothes of the Dragoon. It felt appropriate given the theme of the set, and we enjoyed learning the new skills every two levels and playing around with the cool new rotation of attacks. The endgame dilemma Heavensward is the expansion of a vertically progression MMORPG theme park and therefore those credits that roll once the ~final~ boss is defeated are just scene. Just hand in the last mission of the so-called main scenario (which is titled after the game itself) to unlock various opportunities: two top-level dungeons for four playersi, to begin with, but also the Extreme versions of the two new Primals faced during the story (Ravana and Bismarck) and Alexander, the new eight-player raid that ideally replaces the now obsolete Binding Coil of Bahamut. As for the latter, Square Enix has significantly lowered the difficulty of the offer: the first wing of Alexander is slightly more difficult than the Crystal Tower, the old twenty-four player raid, but it is easier than the aforementioned Binding Coil of Bahamut. However, truly hardcore gamers will find their match in the raid's Savage mode, designed for the crme de la crme. One new twist, however, is loot, as players will be able to repeat bosses as many times as they want, but will only be able to win an item from each once a week, and these items are basically a currency to be traded for. buy the most prestigious equipment. In short, the layered endgame of Final Fantasy XIV has remained as it is, but it relies even more than before on a system of multiple currencies that we have found a bit confusing, not to mention that it pushes the accelerator on compulsive ~grinding~. Already access to the last dungeons of history is precluded to those who have not reached a certain average level of equipment (impossible without resorting to auctioning, crafting or luck in the penultimate dungeon) and then you have to deal with the requirements of the subsequent challenges, which reward with other objects or with a new currency, called Tome of Law, which allows you to buy the entry level endgame equipment that replaces the one acquired in the two level 60 dungeons, Neverreap and Fractal Continuum. The frantic search for rare monsters, on the other hand, rewards you with another currency, the Centurion Seals, which is used to... enhance the equipment purchased with the Tomes of Law. Bismark EX and Ravana EX keep the best weapons to face the enemies inside the gigantic living fortress Alexander, where the new currency they were talking about is located and which is used to buy yet another equipment. In this intricate progression of currencies and related purchases, crafting fits awkwardly, on which Square Enix seems to have lost its hand a bit. Don't get us wrong, that of Final Fantasy XIV undoubtedly remains the best crafting in the MMORPG market - even if that of The Elder Scrolls Online is very close to it - and represents a real game within a game, but the subtle intertwining of the crafting professions and of collection (the so-called Disciples of the Hand and Disciples of the Land) has become a little too tangled, and the materials required for the creation of the most precious objects also relies on mechanics that are a little too complex. The economy is in the grip of the most patient and determined players, who, however, will not lack satisfaction since they will be the only ones able to manufacture the potentially best armor and weapons ever, but also the new furnishings for the headquarters of their Free Company and the brand new airships. The latter are an addition that embarrasses the Warlords of Draenor Shipyard, frankly: members of the Free Company itself can collaborate in the construction of an airship of their own which can then be upgraded and sent on missions. Upon her return, she'll unload exclusive items and materials, complete with a logbook to read to find out how she fared and damage to repair and mend before sending her back on an adventure. The system is extremely complicated, but it says a lot about the emphasis that Square Enix has placed in the development of the Free Company, today probably the most elaborate and satisfying housing system in the MMORPG panorama. It's just a pity that it is a content essentially closed to casual players or to those who are not part of a Free Company, but after all it is an online multiplayer title we are talking about; despite this, a little effort would have been appreciated by the developer, perhaps proposing a miniature version of the housing, detached from the Company as the rooms of the good old Final Fantasy XI were, so that they can enjoy this aspect, and with the their times, even the most antisocial users. Considering the progress made in this regard, and the fact that it is a better Final Fantasy than many others, it is a compromise that we are willing to accept.", "date": "2015-07-31", "grade": "9.0"}
