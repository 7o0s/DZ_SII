Picross E belongs to the same genre, but with a completely different formula, the latest version of a series that has experienced its moments of greatest success in the West with the historic Mario's Picross for Game Boy and the more recent Picross DS. After the three-dimensional interlude of Picross 3D, also released on Nintendo DS, for the debut on the console that makes the third dimension its workhorse, Nintendo has chosen to return to the classic, indeed to the super classic, producing this Picross E downloadable exclusively from 'e-Shop at the price of 5 euros. Nothing more Little money, that's true, but by now the price range ~below - even by a lot - double digits~, is so crowded that this can no longer be taken as an advantage or rather an excuse behind which to hide shortcomings. Developed by the expert Jupiter team, Picross E obviously returns to propose a series of nonograms to be solved in the way that (probably) many already know well, i.e. by discovering a hidden image under a grid of small squares to be blackened according to the indications provided by the crosses of numbers in rows and columns. Much more difficult to explain than to understand, we assure you. The offer of the product in question is based on 150 total puzzles, a number more than sufficient to justify the 5 euros requested; and that the focus is all on the nonograms can be understood very well in the face of the simplicity and conciseness of everything that represents the contour, which in fact is truly reduced to the minimum terms. The graphic component and the menus could not in fact be simpler, without frills; the white, gray and blue color theme offers no distractions, and the division of the puzzles is clear and immediate through categories that differentiate them by difficulty. It starts from the very simple 5x5 with help and indications, to get up to the free 15x15, in which there is no type of support or suggestion. Even with the most complex puzzles, Picross experts probably won't find much difficulty, but the pleasure of solving a nonogram is always something special. Compared to Picross DS, the ability to zoom on the grid has been eliminated; a decision that involves some problems with the larger grids, since painstaking precision with the stylus is necessary in order not to risk fatally touching the adjacent square. A problem that is especially noticeable on the original 3DS screen, and partially mitigated by playing on the 3DS XL; alternatively, one could consider instead choosing the control system via the directional cross which, which can be activated at any time instead of the one with the stylus, offers an alternative much less subject to this type of drawbacks. The use of the two screens is extraordinarily traditional: the lower one houses the grid, while the upper one creates the image as the player blackens the correct squares. It is a pity that, although it is a digitally distributed product on a console particularly prone to connectivity, the possibility of offering new puzzles to be downloaded once the initial 150 puzzles have been completed has not been thought of; it would undoubtedly have been a welcome option and capable of extending a rather not exceptional longevity. But it is clear that Picross E was designed as a spartan product, dedicated to nonogram fans but with no intention of going to offer something more than the scheduled ~homework~. Even missing any evaluation or accessory gratification linked to the completion of a puzzle, thus also reducing any incentive to repeat those already solved. The 3D effect Picross E is probably one of the 3DS games less likely to include a three-dimensional effect, and in fact the only function that the console stick offers is to give a sort of depth to the ~room~ in which the image appears on the screen above. Stuff that can be said that is negligible is little, and immediate deactivation is therefore absolutely recommended.", "date": "2012-11-16", "grade": "7.4"}
