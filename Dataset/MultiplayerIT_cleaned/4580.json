We obviously reviewed it with a long article full of impressions and considerations, we then delved into every aspect of the first raid, the Leviathan, and of course we didn't miss out on some considerations on the game's PvP, the Crucible. Now that a month and a half has passed since the title's availability on consoles, we are finally ready to pass our judgment on the PC conversion: much more than a simple linear port, this edition is an incredible manifestation of attention and love from Vicarious Visions towards computer players. Obviously in this article we will not examine the gameplay, the plot or the aspects more related to the contents, but we will focus on the technical elements of the graphic sector and on the integration with Battle.net, the Blizzard platform where the game is distributed exclusively . Yes, you read that right: Destiny 2 for PC cannot be purchased and downloaded from Steam and perhaps this represents the first step towards the complete shift of Activision titles from Valve's digital delivery platform to the one developed by the house of World of Warcraft and Overwatch . The contents of this edition are identical to the console counterpart, including the raid, and already starting from the next DLC, The Curse of Osiris, expected by the end of the year, the synchronization will be complete. The graphic settings Let's obviously start from the most representative element of Destiny 2 for PC: the incredible availability of graphic settings capable of making the game extremely configurable. As it is possible to see from the video that we have inserted a little further down, this conversion allows a very high level of customization ranging from various settings for what concerns ambient occlusion, the quality of textures and shadows and even the separate level of detail as regards environments, characters, foliage and shadows of the vegetation. What does this last element mean? That Destiny 2 on personal computers allows you to set with maximum precision at what distance from the player the high resolution textures or the geometries of the elements with maximum detail are loaded, separating the variables unlike what happens for many titles where the level of detail is a single setting. There is also a series of settings related to post-processing effects capable of giving that cinematic feeling to the title, such as those that regulate the beams of light, chromatic aberration, film grain, blur in motion and effects wind visuals. However, there are four settings that are most noteworthy. Let's start with anti-aliasing, probably the only variable below expectations. In fact, the final version of the game only implements FXAA and SMAA: MSAA was completely lost by the wayside, which was instead present in the beta but generated an embarrassing amount of compatibility problems. We hope that Vicarious Visions' decision was to temporarily remove this effect with the aim of re-implementing it once adequate stability has been achieved. Then there is the HDR inserted perfectly since the first final release, provided of course that you have an adequate monitor. And finally there are a couple of specific settings for this PC version that well represent that love for the computer public we were talking about at the beginning of the article. First there is the field of view, the FoV, which can be set from a minimum value of 55 to a maximum of 105 with the default set to 85, ten points more than the standard console set to 75. This is the width of the player's field of vision. Conceptually it is as if you were going to set the depth of the focal lens: the more you increase the value, the greater the wide angle effect so as to be able to observe more elements of the scenery surrounding the observation point, obviously losing detail and zoom on what is in front to the weapon. By reducing the value, the lateral portions of the gaze are lost but frontal detail is gained. Specifically, the player will thus be able to choose whether to favor the central depth of field so as to be able to see the opponents in the distance, or whether to include much larger sections of the surrounding environment on the monitor. FoV at 105 FoV at 55 The other proprietary setting is supersampling, here called ResolutionRenderings. Destiny 2 on PC allows you to set the rendering quality from a minimum of 25% to a maximum of 200% of the resolution. What does all this mean? That if, for example, we have set 1080p as resolution, we will be able to force the game to render all the elements as if in reality our monitor were set from a minimum of 480x270 to a maximum of 3840x2160, the 4k. The engine renders this and then scales it to the actual resolution we set. Specifically, this allows us, for example, to have the graphic quality of 4k even if the monitor is not able to support this resolution or, conversely, to maintain 1080p even if the components of our computer could not allow us adequate fluidity reducing the number of pixels rendered. Obviously this is a setting to be handled with caution, on pain of a huge drop in frame-rate, but we really appreciated the possibility offered by the game. Too bad only for the pre-rendered cutscenes that always and only run at 30 frames per second, probably due to some pre-set value by Bungie during programming or depending on the actual implementation of the motion capture. Considering that Destiny 2 on PC amazes first of all for the unlocked frame rate which allows it to practically always reach 60 FPS, every time an interlude sequence of the campaign starts, the downgrade is strongly noticeable. Connection problems As is well known, Destiny has always been plagued by various compatibility problems with Italian connections, especially as regards the optical fiber. Destiny 2 is no exception. Especially in the presence of TIM Fibra and Fastweb Fibra using routers on loan for use it seems practically impossible to be able to complete the first mission of the campaign or enter PvP due to the various Cabbage and Weasel errors and constant disconnections. There are two possible solutions that the author of this article has experienced on his own skin. The first option requires you to log into your carrier-installed standard router to manually disable the firewall and DDoS protection that can be found in the meager settings menus. In doing so, if it is also true that the few protections granted by these hardware are lost, it is possible to continue in the missions and to experience ~only~ constant disconnections every 20-30 minutes of play. The second option requires you to purchase any separate ADSL/Wi-Fi router to connect to the one offered on loan for use using an RJ-45 network cable. The connection must take place via the WAN port of the purchased device. At this point you will have to enter the TIM or Fastweb router panel and manually disable the internet connection but not the fiber connection. So in your trusted router you will have to set up the internet connection with PPPoE protocol, enter alicewag | as login and password alicewag in the case of TIM and fastweb | no password in case you have a Fastweb connection and tell the router to automatically connect to each access request. In doing so you will have effectively bypassed the loan for use router which will only serve to manage the physical connection of the fiber while the firewall and NAT will be managed by the device you have purchased, giving you much more room for configuration and, basically, perfect access to your favorite games. There's actually a third option that seems to be very trendy: using your smartphone to set up a Wi-Fi hotspot via 3G or LTE network. It is not a solution that we would like to recommend, first of all for the consumption of data traffic and secondly for the ping which, very often, undergoes enormous peaks when the bandwidth is particularly saturated. Home is where Battle.net is The other characteristic element of this conversion is its intimate and exclusive link with Battle.net, Blizzard's digital platform. Destiny 2 represents the first video game not from the Irvine house to land on this system and obviously brings with it all those characteristic elements that probably convinced Bungie and Activision to choose this destination. First of all, the game finally implements a World of Warcraft-style text chat that can be activated by simply pressing the Enter key. However, it is limited since it does not allow you to talk to those around us but only and exclusively with members of the team and clan. There are also whispers to specifically contact any other Battle.net user since friend management is unified. Through a convenient in-game menu that goes alongside that of the map and destinations, we can see in an attimo which players are online, what game they are playing, invite them on the fly or examine their equipment and access clan-related functions. Everything is very fast and perfectly integrated, exactly as if it were any Overwatch or Heartstone, including notifications which, while maintaining the graphic style of Destiny 2, offer all the typical information of Battle.net. The friends menu An invitation Let's spend the last two words on the question of controls and more generally on the configurability of the gameplay of this conversion. Obviously not playing this sequel with a mouse and keyboard, given its nature as a pure and precise first-person shooter, is a sacrilege and also from this point of view the guys from Vicarious Visions haven't missed a beat. As you can see in the video of the PC settings inserted a little further up, everything is completely configurable starting from the position of the reticle which can be the same as the console version or specific to this conversion, its color and obviously not missing the full customization of the keys including the ability to aim, run and crouch by holding a key or in toggle mode. Among other things, it is possible to change the commands from mouse and keyboard to joypad on the fly: the configurations are separate and independent so as to really meet all the players. Also noteworthy is the work done by the developer regarding the recoil of weapons. If you use the classic PC controls, the effect will in fact be in line with what we are used to with all the other shooters on this platform, Call of Duty in the first place: we won't have to deal with the amplified effect that it is possible to experiment with the pad and which forces the continuous positioning of the right analog but, precisely to avoid excessive movements with the mouse, it will be essential to work up to in a very realistic and familiar way without any type of assisted aim ready to dampen the effect.", "date": "2017-10-31", "grade": "8.5"}
