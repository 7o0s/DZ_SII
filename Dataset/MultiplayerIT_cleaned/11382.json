This is the idea on which Kamikaze Robots is based, a decidedly original product baked by a team that has already demonstrated its ability to invent something new and fun in the mobile sector (see the absurd Crazy Penguin Catapult). In fact, Digital Chocolate is one of the companies that has been distinguishing itself the most over the past few months, both in terms of the quality of its intuitions and the technical quality with which they are able to package them. Kamikaze Robots only confirms this trend, introducing a mechanic that is as simple as it is effective. From the start screen it is possible to access a quick game or face the normal sequence of opponents, in a course made up of almost thirty races that must be overcome thanks not only to one's skill, but also to a series of upgrades to be purchased as you progress. wins. The rules of the game are very simple: our robot is ~kicked~ down a mountain and rolls to the finish line, following a perpetual motion that can be controlled by pressing key 5, which is the only key we will be called to press, absolutely. Using a sort of ~brake~ with respect to the rotation, we can make the robot land on its own legs rather than with other parts of the body, this is to preserve the armor (which would otherwise disassemble much faster) and to gain greater momentum upward. Since the aim is to cover a greater distance than the opponent and do it in less time, it is clear that we will not always be able to land in the best way, and indeed we will have to try to rotate the character as many times as possible, because rotation makes the next more powerful impact, therefore capable of producing a greater thrust. The robot literally tumbles and loses pieces along the way in a measure proportional to the resistance of its armor, this until only the chest and head remain: on the umpteenth impact, the chest explodes and ~shoots~ the android's head towards the last sprint, transforming it into a spectacular comet with a fiery trail. Each race hides a series of objectives to be unlocked, each of which earns us a certain number of points, which can then be spent to enhance resistance, rotation speed, the strength of the rebounds or the scope of the final explosion. The graphics of the game are excellent, from every point of view. The developers have done an excellent job in terms of optimization, so not only do we have well-drawn sprites, with smooth rotation and a plausible and spectacular impact response (especially the final phase, in which the head is shot off) , but also smooth and fast scrolling. Upgrading your robot also translates into a variation of its aesthetic appearance, which unfortunately does not occur with regard to the scenario on which you ~tumble~: the mountain always seems to be the same, and a change in the background or in the colors would have helped a lot. The action is effectively accompanied by some fairly catchy, but far from essential, MIDI music which lacks an independent volume adjustment. The controls are as simple as you can think of: a single button, which responds to requests immediately and in a very precise way.
