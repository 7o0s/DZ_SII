In recent years, other titles with considerable hype have attempted the same step, above all Warhammer Online and Aion, and all or almost all have quickly ended up being forgotten or have in any case seen their ambitions fail. This is because Age of Conan, while not entirely deviating from the concept ~I am a clone of World of Warcraft~ at the same time tried to differentiate itself from its competitor through a darker atmosphere, a more violent characterization and a more mature setting, characteristics on which also stood out an excellent combat system based on lunges, parries, cuts and combos, decidedly less repetitive than seen in other similar titles, as well as an unprecedented single-player component to act as a tutorial to prepare users for the game real. In any case, even Age of Conan has recently paid the price for the continuous growth of the genre and has gone through several moments in which the servers have seen a significant drop in participants, thanks also to the fierce competition, nevertheless managing to maintain levels of playability more than sufficient and being often taken up by those who had abandoned it to try this or that other new release title. I am a ripper, a slayer, a destroyer, a slaughterer. With the Rise of the Godslayer expansion, however, Funcom intends not only to maintain its large group of fans, but also to attract some new players, and the chosen strategy is less immediate than it might seem. The expansion offers a new area that can be freely explored and tackled, the Khitan, strongly inspired by the oriental world and divided into different provinces (Chosain, Northern Land, Kara Korum, Paikang) with an internal plot to be discovered, different factions (of which we'll talk about later) and all the corollary of new moves, combos and small or big additions that one expects from an expansion, but, unlike others, it does not present any new playable race (although it is possible to create a character of ~ethnicity ~ Khitan) nor does it raise the maximum attainable level. This choice, apparently courageous, however, must not be judged too quickly nor immediately crucified with the harshest criticisms because, first of all, it does not fall into the probability that the new player automatically feels ~disoriented~ and behind all those who are already well into the title and secondly it allows you to refine the experience of veterans without them necessarily having to wait to reach the new maximum level (or in any case get close to it) to fully enjoy the potential of the expansion. It is of course understood that in Age of Conan: Rise of Godslayer there are new game mechanics, in addition to the inevitable improvements in terms of balancing and technical sector: the most important is the alternating advancement system (or AA System) which allows players to learn moves and skills of other classes than theirs, freely using the points earned both in clashes with other humans (PvP) and against the persistent world of the computer (PvE), and obviously several new fighting styles are added to it ( including martial arts), new dungeons and mounts - the tiger and the wolf, which will be accessible after completing the related quests. Mine is strength, lust and power Let us now dwell on another aspect of Age of Conan that is offered to Khitai, whose different lands are shaken by terrible wars to take control of the Eastern Empire, and it is up to the individual players to decide which cause to marry and consequently face in the his name the adversaries (human or virtual) of his lord. In Rise of the Godslayer, in fact, the choice that the players make in tackling the hundreds of new quests that are proposed to them assumes a decisive function, since each of these influences the relationship between the hero and the various factions (12 in all), until the complete break with some of them in favor of others. Although it is not the first time that an MMORPG forces the hero to certain choices (in World of Warcraft you had to decide who to support in a centaur war, for example), in this case the choices of the players do not only affect the single faction , nor even less on the single province in which the clashes will take place, but rather on the entire land of Khitai, giving life to an evolution of the ~political~ situation that had rarely been seen in mmorpg, where usually there is a tendency towards total homogeneity in which the players repeatplay the same missions over and over again before moving on to the next area. Being favored by one faction rather than the other leads to various special rewards, which are more valuable the higher the degree of affinity with it, with special items and completely new sets obtainable only by being appreciated, which, consequently, obliges players players to face the expansion several times and with different characters, if you want to try all the possible objects included in it. I am the fangs of darkness, the claws in the night Graphically speaking Age of Conan has always defended itself well against the competition, also thanks to proposing a darker atmosphere and reaching levels of violence and maturity rarely seen in similar products. Rise of the Godslayer further improves the already excellent technical apparatus of the funcom title by adding a series of new effects and new details, giving full support to the most recent directX and graphics cards, significantly improving the quality of the models by inserting more details in the objects and armor and finally by inserting a long series of new animations and effects connected to the new combos and skills. As for the PvE experience, it remains undermined by the main flaw of persistent worlds, namely an AI of the various mobs generally reduced to the bone, which sees computer-controlled enemies ignore the presence of players a few meters from them, have no reaction to the sight of their comrades slaughtered a few meters away and use a head-on charge as the only attack strategy without any real coordination between the various combatants in case there is numerical superiority. While remaining firmly convinced that the soul of a title like Age of Conan (and not only that) is the clash between players, and that the importance of the behavior of the mobs is at least secondary, we are still waiting for a product that presents a perhaps a smaller number of opponents, but which give less of the impression of being little more than clones placed there to fill the space during travel between one land and another.", "date": "2010-05-24", "grade": "8.0"}
