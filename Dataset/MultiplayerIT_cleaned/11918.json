{"name": "Sega Rally - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-rally-recensione.html", "text": "Everything in Sega Rally is arcadey, not just the physics of the car. Little, indeed nothing, is granted to all that sampling of secondary modes seen in the most recent automotive titles. There is no buying and selling of cars, there are no test benches for self-taught mechanics, there are no customization possibilities, nor are there any livery editors. The number of cars available is also limited. In Sega Rally you just race. And it is done only at the minimum union of possibilities, and that is by embarking on a championship, challenging our times (and those of online users) in time trials, in quick races and playing multiplayer, via split screen or online. Machines and tracks for many, but not for all The Championship, queen mode of the title, takes place in three leagues, each corresponding to the classes of cars used. The first, the one called Standard, allows you to drive the official cars of the world rally championship with cars such as the Subaru WRX and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo. the Golf GT, while the last one, called Fuoriclasse, puts us at the wheel of great racing cars from the past, such as the Stratos, the Deltone or a Pegeout 205 equipped with a huge spoiler. Each league is then divided into several mini-championships of increasing difficulty (over three levels) which serve as a starter for the final race, which can only be reached after accumulating the necessary points. Machines and tracks for many, but not for all As usual, each championship won unlocks, in addition to access to the next league, various prizes such as cars, liveries and tracks on which to race in quick race and multiplayer modes. The tracks, given the arcade heart of the title, are not many, but they cover all types of surfaces. Without any reference to real locations, you run on African dirt roads (Safari), between gravel and hairpin bends (Alpine), between sand and mud (Canyon), in the middle of ice and snow (Arctic) and by the sea (Tropical) .15 tracks, plus a handful of reverse sections for a total of 23 runs. Driving and bouncing If the driving model is totally arcade also the environment in which you run denotes the same approach. Essentially the races take place in a huge tunnel, in which there is no possibility of going off the road, where it is impossible to cut a curve. As if on the sides of the track there were walls invisible to the car, in case of curves taken too far fluency, it will start bouncing from side to side just like a ball in a pinball machine without even losing too much speed. Furthermore, bouncing, even on other cars, helps us get back on track and after a bit of practice the wild support technique becomes a valid expedient to finish first. Sega clearly invites us to a cheerful and cheeky race conduct. Even the much-vaunted real-time deformation of the terrain has little weight on the ride, it should guarantee more grip but in the end you don't go beyond a few jolts of the view, also missing the rumble on the Sixaxis pad (present in the 360 version instead). It would all seem easy, but Sega Rally is distinguished by a fairly high learning curve, in which thanks to the machine's tendency to swing, the first games will be studied to become familiar with the control method which requires application and patience especially on icy and wet. Arcade or non-arcade, the first kilometers run test the nerves and good manners of whoever is playing. The artificial intelligence of the other pilots also contributes to raising the player's level of disappointment. Being an ~old-fashioned~ game, the other competitors also behave as if they were anchored in mechanics from some time ago. They always follow the same line, which is obviously the best trajectory, not giving a damn about everything else. Another criticism must be made to the strange way of understanding the coefficient of difficulty as you progress through the game. Since there are few tracks and cars available (all equipped with more or less the same physical model) and a complete lack of set-up and upgrade sections, the only factor that differentiates a standard race from a champion is the different top speed of the opponents and of the car chosen for the race, a decision that takes place only on the basis of aesthetic parameters and personal taste, given the total lack of a technical sheet that explains, albeit concisely, the differences between the cars. Besides the mud there is more Stopping here Sega Rally would seem like a game undermined by big problems. If you let yourself be totally taken by its naturearcade the game gives a lot of satisfaction, and finally returns a feeling lost since the first two chapters. Once you've learned to control the car, tolerate and exploit the imperfections of the physical and environmental model, you'll have a lot of fun, with frenetic races that keep you glued until the last lap. Obviously, those looking for depth, complexity and simulation rigor from this title should better turn to something else. The real flagship of the game is certainly a decidedly interesting graphic sector, in all its components. The game runs very fast and with sporadic and imperceptible drops in frame rate at 30 fps in a reconstruction of the environments and cars that has few equals in the most recent releases. The cars are beautiful to look at, rich in detail and even if they don't enjoy the implementation of the damage they get dirty with mud and earth like never before. In the same way, a puddle cleans up the car making it shiny again like at the beginning of the race. Besides the mud there is more The real-time deformation of the tracks is equally impressive. Although it counts for little in terms of playability, it is a feast for the eyes to notice the deep ruts that the wheels leave on the ground, especially in snow and mud races. Even this feature, however, is not free from defects. If the rich polygonal reconstruction of the environments is virtually free of pop-ups, the same cannot be said for the tire marks that magically load the textures as the race progresses. The audio sector is also of excellent workmanship, metal to underline our drifts but above all an incredible reproduction of the sound effects of everything that hits the car. Help from the net It is also right to talk about the possibilities that online gaming offers. Given the brevity of the championship mode and the lack of variety in the competitions, the challenges for up to 6 players are a real godsend, very fun, frenetic and with very few lag problems. Sega Rally therefore becomes the fair of bumper cars and low blows, with rear-end collisions and rams that reach their peak at the start and in the very first corners. In addition, the possibility of accessing the world rankings by entering your times, but above all being able to download the performances of the other players greatly extend the meager longevity of the Sega title. This feature is very welcome given that, having finished the single player and not wanting to try a damage-free version of Destruction Derby, you can try to climb the world rankings and in this perspective Sega Rally becomes a title on which the penny maniac second he can find a serious, fulfilling and long-lasting challenge. Comment Sega Rally perfectly embodies a precise concept of arcade game, with all the strengths and weaknesses that this means. Beautiful to see, good online, fun, but undermined by the very few incentives and game modes present. If you are looking for the spirit of the old Sega Rally, you will find it in this edition, otherwise, looking around, there are several proud exponents of the automotive genre, simulation and otherwise. Pro Arcade pure, fun and frenetic Technically good from all points of view Online lag-free Cons Not suitable for those looking for a minimum of simulation from a racing game Very low longevity, single player reduced to the bone Non-existent car physics Sega Rally is available for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The tested version is the one for PlayStation 3. It was the year 1995... Power is nothing without control. This could be the definitive slogan for the return of a great classic like Sega Rally. A thousand miles away from painstaking set-up practices and exasperated tuning, the Sega title is pure arcade. Choosing the car, the type of transmission, road or dirt tyres? Well, the rally can begin regardless. More than ten years after the first episode, Sega offers an almost nostalgic game, a title that takes us back to the (good) old days of smoky arcades and huge cabinets. Compared to modern rally simulators there is very little simulation, there is only mud, snow, sand and the navigator who screams the degrees of difficulty of the curves in common with other titles of the genre. As then, the game is all concentrated on drifting, on the ability not so much to keep the correct trajectories and brush the curves, as to know how to slide the car, that is, to make powerful turns in full oversteer.", "date": "2007-10-18", "grade": null}
