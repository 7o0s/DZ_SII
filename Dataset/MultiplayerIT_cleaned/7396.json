In this sense, the example of Blacklight: Retribution is emblematic, given that in some ways the shooter developed by Zombie Studios, already available on PC since April 2012, represents the most evil that can be hidden behind the apparent gratuity of the free-to model -play. Our Simone Tagliaferri amiably quibbled on the morbidity of the microtransactions present in the game, which from a certain point on puts us into practice at a crossroads; but rather than reiterating this analysis, we rather want to focus on the characteristics of this shooter and on what its prerogatives could be on PlayStation 4, also and above all from a future perspective. Yes, because the internal updating system makes Blacklight: Retribution a real work in progress, a constantly evolving project that lays its foundations on the solidity of some good ideas and which could introduce many others in a few months. With fins, rifle and goggles There are some tutorials to learn the rudiments, but in truth the experience is immediately simple and immediate, thanks also to a control system that incorporates that of the most important exponents of the FPS genre. The DualShock 4 triggers have finally allowed the developers to avoid alternative layouts for aiming and firing, so once we take to the field we will be able to activate the iron sight using the left trigger and shoot by acting on the right one, while the upper lats L1 and R1 will respectively serve to throw a grenade (or what we equip as a special weapon) and to activate an infrared viewer which scans the scenario and tells us the position of our companions and opponents. The only problem with this device is that while we keep it on we will be particularly vulnerable, and the enemies will not fail to take advantage of it. For the rest, the configuration of the main buttons is the usual (Square to reload, Triangle to change weapon, X to jump and Circle to crouch) and you run by pressing the left analog stick on its axis. Speaking of analogs, even in this situation the DualShock 4 cuts ties with the past and offers us excellent grip and excellent precision, without annoying dead zones. Ok, but the game itself? Let's say that the feeling is very reminiscent of Call of Duty, and it is absolutely not a bad thing: you travel fast, the action is frenetic, you shoot well and the weapons give good feedback. It was rightly thought to slow down the movements of the character while aiming, more markedly than in the Activision series, but in general the approach chosen by Zombie Studios works, is solid and can give satisfaction. Blacklight: Retribution is a solid and competent shooter with good ideas and a classic feel A lot of stuff, all for a fee So where does the proverbial donkey fall? As a good free to play, Blacklight: Retribution uses two currencies: a valuable one, which is obtained exclusively by paying with real money, and the other virtual, obtainable simply by playing, in variable quantities depending on whether you win or lose, as well as on the basis the number of kills and their type. In the initial stages this mechanism, which goes hand in hand with the growth of the character, works a little slowly and therefore you have to get used to the idea of being able to buy new equipment (moreover in time, not indefinitely - this possibility is reserved only for those who is willing to put his hand in his wallet) only after quite a few games, however paying great attention not to waste the hard-earned credits and extricating himself within an interface that is anything but simple and immediate. It is clear that in a few weeks the scenario will be different and a demarcation line will be highlighted between ~free~ and ~premium~ users, the fact is that at the present stage the odious ~pay to win~ element is no longer heard of a lot, that is, it is possible to play and place well in the end-game rankings simply by using the default equipment, without upgrades or anything else. The maps available at the moment, fewer in number than the PC version, offer a fair degree of variety, even if some old problems persist relating to respawning, which is sometimes carried out in the vicinity of enemy soldiers who, therefore, manage to kill us without even doing the effort to come and find us. On the modality front, the situationone is in the same way more than decent, in the sense that the developers have been able to combine a substantial offer with attention to matchmaking numbers, fast and effective after a few updates that fixed the slowness of the first days. Here too, however, something is missing, in this case the cooperative mode and some new competitive modes. We said that the game is a kind of work in progress, yes? We hope that this content arrives quickly as well. PlayStation 4 versus PC In addition to the defections we have just talked about, hopefully momentary, the PlayStation 4 version of Blacklight: Retribution unfortunately also suffers from a technical adaptation below expectations. The game itself lacks personality, and this is evident from the character designs, the decent but far from remarkable animation set, and the look of the scenarios. Some of the locations put beautiful ideas into play, especially in terms of vertical development, but there is a lack of a greater variety of situations. The problem is that on the Sony console this flatness is accentuated by an effect lower than the PC counterpart, as well as by evident drops in the frame rate, which goes from touching sixty frames per second to literally collapsing in some situations. Whether it's an engine or a netcode problem, the result doesn't change and there are phases that become honestly unpleasant. Fortunately, the sum of strengths and weaknesses still returns a positive value, the games follow one another pleasantly and the quality of the games (which do not require a PlayStation Plus subscription to work) is at sufficient levels, with latencies in the order of one hundred milliseconds and therefore largely bearable. We can't say enough good things about voice chat: when we happened to use it, the audio quality was terrible. Finally - but this is frankly a detail - the game does not currently support Trophies.", "date": "2013-12-18", "grade": "7.0"}
