{"name": "Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-z-the-legacy-of-goku.html", "text": "The game starts by presenting us with a sequence taken from the original frames of the animated series, mixed in a random way and without any use to understand the incipit of the story that will be told in the game. We therefore learn from the attached manual that Son Goku is visiting Master Roshi to present to his lifelong friends (Krillin, Bulma, Olong, etc.) his little son Son Gohan. Obviously, all those who know the main plot of the Dragon Ball epic know well what disasters are about to befall the lives of these characters and what serious turn the series will take from this moment on. Unexpectedly, an evil and key character bursts into the happy picture, who will push the story towards new narrative territories chosen by the author, revealing Son Goku's mysterious past. From this situation onwards we will really take over the reins of the game, guiding our alter ego through inhospitable lands in search of the kidnapped son, even going further (someone said Namek?). Immediately, the control system highlights some limits which, although annoying, can be overcome with training. The movements are woody and it seems to have to forcefully push poor Son Goku who suddenly seems to have lost all his agility; diagonal shifts are completely absent, forcing us to anachronistic and exasperating combined shifts alternating on the four directions (right, up, left, down). As for the attacks, the hero has a good variety of them, although at the beginning only punches and Wave Kamehameha are available. As we progress, experience points will allow us to expand our equipment as well as our ability to fly (initially very limited, useful for avoiding some obstacles). In the latter period the RPG soul of the title is enclosed (that is the ~evolution~ of the character, a prerogative of the genre), which for the rest remains only Action. Unfortunately, the flaws of the control system disturb the exploration not a little, but above all the clashes, which especially at the beginning are always resolved against us: the ~simple~ wolves that numerous inhabit the forests will cause more than a handful of unwelcome departures. Furthermore, pinpoint precision is required in the attacks, which otherwise will risk always failing and given the impossibility of diagonal movement, it is easy to imagine the simplicity with which one can succumb to enemies. Over time, the situation will improve and it will be then that you will be able to enjoy the gaming experience with greater serenity.BR> Fortunately, from a graphic point of view, the work done by the development team is pleasant and never subdued. Of course, the environments are often made with repetitive motifs, but the color palette remains varied and is effective in recreating the chromatic variety of the characteristic places of the series. Furthermore, in principle the characterization of the characters is effective, as are the animations (functional but nothing more). The sound sector, on the other hand, is really disappointing: a few, anonymous effects and a repetitive musical accompaniment will make those who expected the perfect transposition of the sound of the cartoon turn up their noses. As for the plot, we have already said that it broadly follows the one narrated by Toriyama, with the addition of some unpublished episodes. Unfortunately, our task will only be to helplessly witness the events, without them ever being able to really capture the player's interest (especially if you are a fan of the series). Searching for object X to deliver it to character Y is the most common practice. The rare animated interludes, assembled with the frames of the cartoon only make the bite more bitter and make you regret watching any episode of the series. However, one further final comment is required. We are certainly not dealing with a masterpiece, but certainly with a game that, for better or for worse, manages to bring most of the elements present in cartoons and comics to the screens of our GBAs. Dragon Ball has a strong appeal to a very wide age range (those who started reading the manga in eighty-four are now at least 24-25 years old), however, the adults who are still attracted to it will have remained few, so naturally the the ideal target is that of children and adolescents who have known these characters in more recent times. From this it can be seen that the efforts made in making this The Legacy of Goku can be shared if you wantthe title must be kept accessible to those who do not live on video games alone and in any case to younger players, who, even if they say they do wonders, a genre like that of RPGs cannot digest it very easily. However, this does not remove the note of demerit that I feel like giving to WebFoot Technologies. Pros: Characters recreated in a clear and recognizable way It may appeal to your Dragon Ball maniac children Cons: Unevaluable sound aspect Playability undermined by limiting controls Illusory RPG elements The Endless Saga This latest (chronologically speaking) Infogrames production for GBA is part of a group of three (the other two are one for GBC and one for PS2) who have the intention of reproducing the Dragon Ball universe again in a playful form. Over the years, in fact, there have been countless videogame transpositions of the stories of Son Goku and associates, especially between Super NES and PSX, generally embodied in two- and three-dimensional fighting games (always of dubious value). This time, however, the genre chosen by WebFoot Technologies is that of Action/RPG, currently overflowing and worn out, except for rare, illustrious, exponents (who said Zelda?!). Therefore, as for the inexhaustible and pedantic paper and animated series, another title dedicated to them claims to occupy precious space in our personal toy library. Will he have all the requisites to deserve such a prestigious position?", "date": "2002-07-15", "grade": null}
