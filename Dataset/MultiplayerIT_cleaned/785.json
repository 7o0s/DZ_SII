The first The Suffering, released in March 2004, was a little publicized game, around which no particular expectations had formed, and perhaps also for this reason it managed to positively impress critics and the public. One of the strengths of The Suffering was the highly horror and splatter setting, with a strong atmosphere that managed to keep the player constantly in tension. The Midway title was not reducible to a specific genre: in the first minutes the pace was quite slow and encouraged exploration, which thanks also to the possibility of playing in the third person made it seem like you had a real survival game in your hands. horror, then instead the action was the host and the game became a sort of action/FPS at times quite frenetic, at times a little more reasoned and exploratory. For those unfamiliar with the original story, the plot of The Suffering centers on Torque, a man sentenced to capital punishment for the murder of his entire family. While awaiting execution on Abbott prison's death row, Torque finds himself at the center of a real attack launched by mysterious creatures with monstrous features that kill all life on sight. one of the strengths of The Suffering was the highly horror and splatter setting, with a strong atmosphere that managed to keep the player constantly in tension Sometimes they come back the same as before! Thus begins a desperate escape to Baltimore, the hometown of the protagonist, which does not end before involving Torque in a web of devious conspiracies and paranormal experiments, with continuous links to the killing of his family. During The Suffering moral choices could be made, which always boiled down to helping or killing some non-player characters, and based on the moral alignment one had at the end of the game, one of three different endings was displayed (evil, neutral, good) resulting in a change in the plot, which could see the brute as an innocent victim of circumstances or as a ruthless bloodthirsty killer (keeping the original save of the first The Suffering also the opening sequence of Ties that Bind changes accordingly). After a brief flashback prior to the story of the first episode, we find Torque who at the end of his daring escape finds himself on the shores of Baltimore, and this is where this second chapter begins. Or continue the first? Horror to the second In this sequel, Torque must return to the places where his life took place before his incarceration, and come to terms with both Blackmore, who seems largely responsible for all the hell that has been unleashed, and of course with Doctor Killjoy, the mad scientist behind the creation of demonic creatures. Once again you have to choose whether to follow the path of morality, listening to the otherworldly suggestions of his deceased wife Carmen, or the other voice, the demonic one, and impersonate the unscrupulous butcher. The playability is almost identical to that already seen with The Suffering, and the plot is channeled on tracks resulting very linear, so much so that the only possible choices are those concerning moral alignment. In Ties that Bind we have chosen to adopt a realistic inventory system, so that now it is not possible to carry more than two weapons, and bottles of Xobium (the official ~medikit~ of the game) can only be collected when there is actually no power. As it progresses, the game increasingly loses its survival horror and action/adventure imprint, becoming almost completely a shooter, or more precisely an FPS, since if the fact remains that The Suffering can be played in the third person , it is much more comfortable and natural to use the classic first-person view most of the time. The fights with the enemies, which are now more tough and difficult to knock down, take place mainly at a distance, and the various monsters need slightly different approaches to the fight, since each type of creature has its own specific and original attack and defense characteristics . Unlike the prequel, the movements that can be performed by Torque do not change based on the view chosen, and now it is also possible to perform lateral somersaults in first person, very useful in hand-to-hand combat when you want to save ammunition (although they remain much more effective by playing in third person). in Ties that Bind we find all, absolutely all the clichs of the horror game elevated to power Horror to the second Also, with first person view and melee weapons, you don'tit no longer launches a single attack at a time but the same chained three-hit combos are available that we find with the other view. One of the not exactly ~FPS~ elements is the transformation: when the ~insanity meter~ bar (which increases with each killing of an enemy) is full, Torque can transform into the huge and horrid monster that often populated his delirious visions in the prequel . In this case the view is forced into the third person and weapons cannot be used, but three different (devastating) melee attacks are available. One of these, then, has its own personal ~experience level~ which, if increased, makes the move more spectacular and lethal. The transformation can be maintained for a limited period of time, otherwise life energy will be lost. The puzzles that Torque has to gradually solve (if I may venture the term ~puzzles~) are rather trivial and easily solved, but they have the merit of being credible and more or less realistic, avoiding those improbable forcings that often haunt titles of the genre . I reiterate what I thought while playing the first episode: if The Suffering were less shooter and more survival horror, if Torque was a little weaker and more difficult to defend (just like the characters of the s.h.), I think this videogame it would be the scariest ever created. In Ties that Bind we find all, absolutely all the clichs of the horror game elevated to power: oppressive atmosphere, dark environments, distressing music, extreme violence, blood everywhere, aberrant monsters that suddenly emerge, sinister sound effects, creatures from revolting appearance and, just to put the icing on the cake, continuous hallucinations and splatter visions. The Suffering never lets go, and keeps the player constantly on the alert, worried about identifying what is moving in the dark around him and hammered by the sudden and annoying visions from Torque's past. The longevity is good and there is also minimal replay value, but unfortunately there is no multiplayer mode. A little red here and there Even from a graphic point of view, that very strong sense of de javu that distinguishes the played aspect remains. In more than a year and a half, especially as regards the console versions, only small steps forward have been made; therefore considering the fact that the prequel was already not surprising in terms of visual impact, it can be safely said that Ties that Bind does not show all the famous part that it usually requires. Many objects and models have been recycled in full from the first chapter, and still others have enjoyed only insubstantial updates. Let it be clear, however, that we are not talking about a poor production. The character design of monsters and human characters still does its duty, and the animations of the creatures (a mix between motion capture and traditional) are excellent: the slayers in particular are made quite disturbing by their unnatural movements, exaggeratedly lanky when walking on two legs and similar to those of a spider when moving ~on all fours~; Torque can also boast his beautiful set of movements, a pity however for the absence of the old and very menacing slow walk (which recalled Kenshiro's gait), now replaced with a slightly more bourgeois one. The atmosphere is excellently rendered and the visual impact is very strong (perhaps even too marked at times). A little red here and there [C] To die in a stinking alley with a severed head. Things that de-capitate. Ha ha ha. Asphyxiating taxes, armed robberies, monsters hungry for human flesh: the shopkeeper's life is hard to find. really hard [/C] In general, the graphic style has a personality of its own, well defined, but certainly The Suffering: Ties that Bind does not shine for polygonal complexity, texture detail, effects and so on. Especially on PC, despite having the merit of running great even on low-power systems, the Midway title fails to hold a candle to the recent products of average workmanship nor with the best of one or even two years ago, while on consoles the qualitative gap is very small, but still present. In any case, to make you understand the lightness of the graphics engine, I can say that I tried the PC version with a smooth 9600 (video card whose performance is now below average) and the game played about 40 frames per second keeping the resolution at 1280x1024 and anti-aliased at 2x. The sound, think what a surprise, is also at the same level as its predecessor: excellent voice actors (original, the game is not localized in Italian), good music and average sound effects. Among the actors who lent their voices to the polygonal characters we can single out Michael ClarkeDuncan (who starred in The Green Mile) as Blackmore and Rachel Griffiths (Six Feet Under) as Jordan, the attractive, ruthless scientist. Cross-platform Ties that Bind is also available for Xbox and PS2, and to be honest I found myself much better holding a joypad rather than a mouse and keyboard, either because of the controls which are quite intuitive on consoles, or because the PC version gave me the impression of one of the usual ports characterized by a slightly rough mouse management (especially in the menus). On PS2 the 3D engine seems to be a bit more uncertain, and the Xbox version boasts both cleaner graphics and more defined textures. Otherwise, nothing special to report. Final comment The Suffering Ties that Bind brazenly re-proposes the formula that a year and a half ago led the first chapter of the series to be a small revelation in the gaming landscape, but unfortunately this is not enough to garner the same acclaim as it was then. Little or nothing has changed, and although the game is enjoyable and the horror elements work really well, Ties that Bind looks more like a set of additional levels than a real sequel, also showing an outdated technical sector and lazy game design and not at all innovative. Those who loved the first episode will certainly not be disappointed by this pseudo-sequel, the others might instead think of investing their savings in a different way, especially considering the very high number of great titles that will crowd the shelves of our shops between now and Christmas .Pros Excellent atmosphere Very strong horror character Fun even if without too many pretensions Cons Conceptually identical and technically very similar to the predecessor Very linear Graphically a bit dated Life as a convict is undoubtedly hard: little light, little space, bad company, ambushes under the showers and disgusting rations. Our friend Torque knows something about it, who by some strange coincidence does not seem to resign himself to life as a normal prisoner and carefully chooses only the prisons where, in addition to enduring the above, you have to deal with hordes of repulsive deformed demons that have come out out of nowhere who spend their time cutting off heads and quartering warders and convicts without discrimination of any kind. And think that even when he's out of jail, things don't change much.", "date": "2005-10-26", "grade": null}
