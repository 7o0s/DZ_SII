Now, however, a third contender is entering the fray, namely the present Your Shape by Ubisoft. Although based on the same fundamental concepts of the two aforementioned titles (ie contributing in some way to the user's physical well-being), the game is entirely based on the use of a USB video camera capable of detecting body movements. So let's see how this technology works, and if it adds something new to the genre. I look thinner on TV As we have mentioned, in Your Shape you play (or rather, you train) using the small video camera included in the package: installation is extremely simple, just place the device on top of the TV and connect it to one of the two USB ports present on the back of the Wii. The initial tutorial explains what are the fundamental conditions that allow the peripheral to do its duty: in addition to the physical space necessary to perform the exercises, good ambient lighting is required (but without too strong sources), the absence of other objects furniture in the frame and even a color of clothes that differs well from the colors of the background. Strict requirements, which if ignored cause malfunction of the video camera, whose job is precisely to capture the user's movements. Shifting our attention to the game, it should be emphasized that Your Shape presents itself in a decidedly ~professional~ manner: before starting actual training, the software requires the entry of personal data and some indications about one's physique, as well as to those concerning the standard of one's regular sporting activity; in addition, a virtual model of your body is created from which you can select specific parts on which to focus your workouts (game, arms, abs and so on). There is no shortage of a calendar and other useful tools to take account of one's progress, even if the peaks of meticulousness of a product such as EA Sports Active are not reached. Certainly compared to the title just mentioned, Your Shape enjoys greater ease of use: the Remote only serves to navigate through the menus, while every physical activity is carried out through the movements captured by the video camera. Forbidden to the lazy But let's actually see what's the gist of this Your Shape: every time you select an exercise, the screen is divided into two parts, the left occupied by the polygonal model of our personal trainer and the right depicting our image taken by the video camera. All you have to do is repeat the instructor's movements, trying to follow the right rhythm: the game, in fact, gives an evaluation of the user's performance which is mainly based precisely on the synchrony rate, unfortunately not always easy to achieve . The video camera supplied is obviously not a miraculous contraption, and it often happens that it does not perceive some movements or that it takes boos for fiascos. However, these are problems that can also be found in similar products that use Remote and Balance Boards, obviously relating to the need to keep the price of similar technologies affordable. Even with similar shortcomings, Your Shape can still be played quietly, and the various activities appear well studied and all quite rewarding. Compared to the main competitors, however, the Ubisoft title does not aim to be an all-round training system, but rather an effective and - it is assumed - fun method for focusing work on specific areas of one's body. An approach that inevitably tends to demean the outward appearance of the title a little: Your Shape boasts clean and functional graphics, but at the same time rather monotonous and repetitive, always when compared with Wii Fit and EA Sports Active. Even the sound accompaniment leaves something to be desired, especially when it repeats the same handful of songs too frequently. In principle, however, Your Shape proves to be a certainly useful tool for keeping fit in an original way, even if the fact that it is presented as a product aimed almost exclusively at a female audience could limit its catchment area somewhat.
