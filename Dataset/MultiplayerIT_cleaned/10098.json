If not a narrative element, ~time~ often becomes an element of gameplay or the theme of a puzzle, and regardless of genre, it is often a universally applicable concept, even if it takes a lot of cunning to make it interesting. rather than hackneyed. Echoshift in a sense succeeds in this difficult mission, adapting the mechanics and the peculiar visual style of Echochrome to an almost entirely new gameplay. Deja Vu Unlike Echochrome, Echoshift is completely two-dimensional. The developers of Artoon had the difficult task of applying a new mechanic to the fascinating style of Echochrome: time manipulation. In fact, we are already making a basic mistake. The player in Echoshift does not actually manipulate time, rather he collaborates with himself by exploiting the actions performed in the immediate past. Messed up, huh? It's actually quite simple. Each level of Echoshift offers a series of floors and corridors, sometimes connected by stairs, and the player controls a stick figure with a specific goal: to reach the exit. To do this, we have a few seconds available and there are obstacles in our path, for example a door to be opened by pressing a switch positioned elsewhere. Unable to reach the button and then return to the door to proceed before time runs out. But time must run out and at that point we can start over... while the shadow of ourselves performs the same actions as in the previous turn (or ~cast~). At that point it will be our shadow, our past self, who will flip the switch, and we will be able to pass. In short, the Echoshift concept is damn simple and at the same time it is open to countless uses and transformations to be applied in order to overcome the growing complexity of puzzles. I thought I saw In a short time the player will find himself managing multiple situations at the same time and taking advantage of multiple ~registrations~ to overcome the puzzles present in increasingly stratified and vast levels. The Artoon developers indulged themselves by inserting traps, trapdoors, synchronized doors, partially or totally obscured shots, boulders, trampolines and mobile platforms. There really is something for all tastes and the less ~replays~ you use to proceed, the higher your performance rating will be. Echoshift early requires considerable concentration, a lot of cunning and an excellent memory. Considering that there is also a time limit and the player must move quickly taking into account the fourth dimension, perhaps Echoshift seems to expect a bit too much in some stages, and being able to analyze them in advance only partially helps. Fortunately, the proposal of the puzzles is based on an intelligent grid system that allows us to tackle new puzzles following a practically personalized difficulty curve. Each puzzle solved unlocks others of varying complexity that we can tackle in any order: there are around fifty stages offered and Sony plans to release more via PlayStation Network. The common element is certainly the truly minimalist graphic style, essential and characterized by soft and relaxing colours: the result is very pleasant, as in the case of the musical accompaniment, light and almost hypnotic but never annoying.", "date": "2010-04-02", "grade": "8.0"}
