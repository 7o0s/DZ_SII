{"name": "Dead To Rights", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-to-rights-8.html", "text": "Fido, Come Fido! The game places enough emphasis on Shadow, Jack Slate's gorgeous dog. This big puppy proves to be a lethal weapon since he is able to instantly kill an enemy and bring back the weapon he was using. Sometimes you will also have to guide him in search of explosive devices relying on his nose. Too bad that in practice rather than a faithful companion it turns out to be a sort of very limited Smart Bomb. What is incredible is the fact that Shadow is a ghost dog! In fact, once called into question it will magically appear on the enemy and then disappear again into thin air once its action has been completed... Wouldn't it have been much more spectacular if a decently animated dog actively followed the action? A good idea that was decidedly misused. 1 Violence So much, we really see a lot of violence, very raw, very serious, almost natural in our cinematographic addiction. As much is also the blood that splashes from the bodies to remain to soil the floor. But why use all this violence? Why shed all this blood? First to avenge your father's murder. Later to defend your skin, because you are Jack Slate, policeman of a corrupt and black city where it seems that everyone, friend or foe, intends to blow your brains out. Left to you the task of being surprised by the all too specious and botched plot. DTR looks like a game supported by a very large and solid column, the third person shooter sections, a slightly smaller and weaker beam, the hit hit sections, and many robust and useful props, the various subgames. In what once would have been called multi-event and which we now call ~action game~, by guiding our alter ego we will have to cross a large number of locations, fully armed and aided by a convenient pointing system that can be activated with R, we will be called to kill a disproportionate number of enemies in very fast, fun and tense shootouts. But be careful, if in the first levels the caciarona speed will dominate, the more you continue - let's say from the cemetery onwards - the more the random component will give way to a healthy dose of tactics. You will notice it when on the tenth attempt to throw yourself into the fray without a minimum of knowledge you will get the tenth ~failed~ stamp. In fact, the game immediately offers a series of very interesting abilities. Do you want to disarm an opponent by killing him or leaving him alive to use him as a human shield until riddled with bullets he collapses to the ground? Do you want to jump into the void and, using slow motion, kill dozens of enemies before touching the ground? You can do all this, but also crouch behind a table and wait for the right moment to go out or take cover with a container or shoot with a sniper rifle. Before understanding and being able to put into practice which is the right combination of actions to overcome rooms and corridors, you will put a lot of sweat into it. Because your energy drops at a frightening speed and many times one shot is enough to knock you down, because the enemies are in monstrous quantities and very skilled in slipping into the most dangerous points or shooting you before you can understand what is happening. All this well aware that the enemies still have a certain ~artificial stupidity~ although it is well hidden. As in the best of target shooting, the target will appear when you least expect it. In DtR we exalt ourselves many times, we have fun like bad children, we curse with satisfaction. All trying to switch the lock's crosshair from green (I see it but don't catch it) to red (I see it and I can hurt it) to blue (it's dead!). To break up the action, which could become repetitive, we take care of the less exciting and refined sections of Picchia Picchia where with bare hands and with kicks and punches you are called to knock down numerous opponents. Namco knowing full well that these sections do not offer a very high playing depth, has put them in the right and not too high dose that allows you to find them confusing and superficial, but still fun and satisfying. Then there are a series of mini-games - which can also be played separately - in pure Track 'n Field style. Whether they are arm wrestling fights, having to make a lap dancer dance or defusing a singular bomb, they prove to be a very pleasant addition that is well integrated into the game structure by the unraveling of the plot.Bullets So far so good, but let's analyze some flaws. Let's start first of all from a slight repetitiveness of the game action which could lead to getting tired of continuously facing waves of enemies all the same and not very differentiated. In the sense, there are the policemen, the convicts, the clowns (!) and the superpolicemen of the Gac in dozens of clones all identical and animated in the same way. The feeling is truly that of shooting clay pigeons. To aggravate this feeling there is the fact that the locations all look a bit alike. Elements tend to be pretty similar whether you're in a port, prison, shipyard, or factory. Add to all the subdivision into ~rooms~ where different groups of enemies have to be faced several times and you will understand the reason for this criticism. However, this is more of a feeling since it has little influence on the still considerable variety of situations in which we find ourselves. Another defect is the lack of linearity in the increase in difficulty: it is said that the location after is more difficult than the one before but in hindsight it may not be a defect but a way to let you breathe! Instead, what could have been more implemented is the need to use the tactic which is almost held back by the need to keep the title in the Action genre, but even here it may not be a defect! In short, you can raise criticisms of the game structure only if you are clearly looking for a more realistic and less exaggerated genre. And beautiful women Technically the game comes with a nice and functional graphic sector but which never manages to hit the player. Some polygonal models are downright ugly and covered in ugly textures, such as the bare-chested protagonist for example. The appearance of enemies out of nowhere is not exactly pleasant, but perhaps nothing else could be invented given the speed with which everything happens, just as the various special effects such as water or explosions are not pleasant. In turn, the light effects are very old and the animations are most of the time worthless. Even the cutscenes are quite disappointing. I still mention some too daring chromatic combinations (the cemetery seems to have come out of a caricatured representation). On its side it has the fluidity and the number of enemies displayed at the same time. The sound does not remain in the player's head at all, the effects are only discreet, the ~snap~ emitted by the steps is very bad. The music on the other hand is not too noticeable. With over six hours of actual gameplay and the ability to replay it on a harder mode, it offers good longevity. Replay value could be high if you manage to get caught up in the desire to try new combinations of moves to get to the end. Comment If this title were to be rated for the fun and adrenaline it offers, it would certainly be much higher than what it achieved overall. The game structure is undoubtedly solid, the shootings are really fun, the difficulty makes you want to use all the various possibilities offered by the designers and to take advantage of everything the game scenario offers to get to the end of the mission. Perhaps one would feel the need for an additional dose of depth and a greater splash of tactics to make it a masterpiece, but it is said that a game does not necessarily have to be a masterpiece to have fun. Too bad for a not excellent technical realization that would have definitely needed more care. Pros: Fun, fast and full of cool elements Lots of different situations even if sometimes not very original Forces to mix action and tactics Cons: Little charismatic main character Only fair technical realization Sometimes tends to be repetitive Violence, bullets and beautiful women are none other than the foundations on which this Dead to Rights, Namco's latest effort, is based. Yes, because this game represents a fairly faithful videogame transposition of films such as ~Lethal Weapon~ or ~Die Hard~ and does nothing to hide it! On the contrary, it enhances its characteristics to allow the player to immerse himself in a fast and pressing series of adrenaline-pumping situations.", "date": "2003-11-11", "grade": null}
