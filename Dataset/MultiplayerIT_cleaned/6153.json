In short, we have seen even more absurd variations of the traditional Japanese shadow warrior, this one at least shares its original setting. However, this is not a new solution, given that To-Fu Fury is connected to a real series that counts already two chapters on mobile platforms. In short, there is this block of rennet and soy which is not known why it is also a ninja warrior, summoned by a spirit in the shape of a cat to take action. The aim of the game is to collect Chi energy spheres and gems, but above all to get to the end of intricate levels thanks to the incredible athletic skills of our pseudo-dairy friend, able to jump, launch forward at great speed, bounce off certain walls and attack on others, crawl along surfaces and even move self-propelled scenery elements, thereby dodging obstacles, attacking enemies, and progressing between platforms. The progression takes place following a very soft difficulty curve, with the game introducing each new element gradually and allowing you to better handle the protagonist and all his particular skills, as well as giving you the opportunity to become familiar with each new obstacle, but simply being able to reach the conclusion of the levels does not mean that you are advancing in the best way. In fact, for each section various parameters are recorded, concerning the quantity of objects collected, the time taken and the number of moves made and only by returning within the pre-established limits are the foreseen rewards obtained. This system amplifies the depth of the gameplay, opening the door to constant replayability given by the desire to improve one's performance from level to level. You will never look at innocent tofu the same way again after trying To-Fu Fury The tofu athletic The basic concept, as mentioned, is to reach the conclusion of the levels by exploiting the athletic qualities of the tofu, through a control system strongly based on the simulation of physics. Given his mushy nature, the protagonist is able to stretch, shorten and shoot like a projectile, sticking to most walls or bouncing off particular materials. The basic controls allow you to throw the tofu forward by ~pulling~ it in the desired direction or make it perform a parable by loading it backwards (similar to what happens with the Angry Birds slingshot), with variable trajectories based on the position of the finger on the screen and visible with convenient on-screen guidelines. By touching the touch screen with two fingers in the desired direction, however, it is possible to make the protagonist crawl carefully to overcome certain types of obstacles. These are the basic elements of the gameplay, simple to learn but whose mastery becomes necessary as you progress through the game, in search of ever better performances. At this juncture we must also point out some uncertainty in the control system, which sometimes does not interpret the input perfectly by exchanging the forward throw with the backward ~pull~, thus risking losing precious seconds or entire attempts. The physics simulation is generally implemented in a very positive way, also as regards the reaction of some elements of the scenario that can be moved, overturned or activated through contact with the tofu, with variations applied based on the trajectory of the launches in a very realistic way . In perfect Amazon Game Studios style, To-Fu Fury is impeccably packaged, with a graphics sector that is not very complex but cheerful and coherent in its humorous characterization, with a large amount of details present in levels that are also quite vast, enriched from the particular dynamic perspective that allows you to see them through different points of view, an element that is obviously much more evident by exploiting the Dynamic Perspective system of the Amazon Fire devices, but it also proves to be very pleasant on iOS-based ones.", "date": "2015-07-31", "grade": "7.8"}
