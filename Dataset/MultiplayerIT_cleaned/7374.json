In fact, for the debut of Ridge Racer on iOS several errors have been made, for example it was thought for some mysterious reason that the game could take advantage of an aggressive setting of in-app purchases and that a fundamental factor such as career mode didn't actually do much good. In short, practically everything that could be wrong was wrong. Four years later, so here we are talking about what looks like a new beginning for the franchise on mobile devices, starting with iOS and then landing on Android shortly. Ridge Racer Slipstream immediately stands as a faithful reproduction of the mechanisms that made the series famous; starting from the concept of racing several times on the same circuit, with a view to progression, passing through the inevitable controlled drifts, which allow us to tackle any curve at full speed and to charge the nitro bar, another characteristic element of arcade races branded Namco Bandai. In short, the developers of Invictus seem to have understood perfectly what to do with this new mobile edition of the game, probably because they are passionate about the historical episodes in the first person and eager to transpose both the merits and the defects in the best possible way. Ridge Racer Slipstream captures the spirit of the original Ridge Racer very well and brings it to mobile Riiiiidge Racer! Ten tracks and twelve cars may seem few if you compare these numbers with the astonishing ones offered by titles such as Asphalt 8: Airborne or GT Racing 2: The Real Car Experience. In this case, however, it's all a question of perception and combinations, inserting mirror versions of the tracks into the mix and organizing the races so as to induce us to tackle the same route several times, so as to memorize it and ~live~ it well before to move on to the next; moreover, experimenting with different stages of the competition and modalities, which alternate the inevitable head-to-head or elimination from the classic competition. Everything can be said about Ridge Racer Slipstream except that it has a short single player campaign, in short. Get ready to spend hours waiting for online multiplayer to arrive via an update. If Namco Bandai's production holds its own on the structural front thanks to a series of gimmicks, how is the gameplay situation? It is in this particular area that the experience really shines because, as mentioned above, it succeeds in the not simple task of recreating the sensations of the classic console episodes, offering us the same type of handling and an artificial intelligence of the opponents that at first could seem all too basic, but which becomes more cunning and insidious as events go by, so much so that we are forced to continually invest the money earned in upgrades and to exploit every possibility of getting an extra cue, such as the wake effect to which the name refers of the game. This system is assisted by a technical department that stands out for the definition of the cars and scenarios, with ~transparent~ loading and a not indifferent glance. There are some frame-rate drops during drifts, when the camera ~scrolls~ rapidly, but we are confident that this will be fixed soon. However, the weight of a production designed almost exclusively for the best performing devices remains: if you have an iPhone 4S, for example, you will hardly be able to obtain acceptable fluidity.", "date": "2014-01-02", "grade": "7.8"}
