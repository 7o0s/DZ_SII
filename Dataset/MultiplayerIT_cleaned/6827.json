Well, we were wrong. In our opinion, the artworks remain bad, but fortunately the in-game graphics make much better use of the license and render the difficult aesthetic union between birds and robots in a more than discreet way, also thanks to a detail, a fluidity and a impeccable direction, which manage to emphasize the most spectacular sequences (see the couple attacks in bullet time, but also the entry of Astrotrain) and to render well the impacts that occur when we blow up the usual green pigs. The ~plot~ in the background is clearly a pretext to transform the traditional angry birds, as well as a selection of bad piggies, into Autobots and Decepticons taken verbatim from the unforgettable Generation 1 of the Transformers, the one to be clear of the cartoons written by Marvel. Good and bad guys who find themselves having to work together to counter the advance of a powerful enemy, conquering or reconquering the territories of the map thanks to the completion of stages that have nothing to do with the traditional gameplay of Angry Birds, but rather introduce mechanics run & gun unreleased for the series. The action value of these sequences, the large number of characters (net of some licenses that purists might not digest, see Soundwave that transforms into a four-wheeled vehicle instead of a portable stereo) and a freemium approach that is by no means limiting contribute to create an immediate, fun and non-trivial experience. Angry Birds Transformers was a very nice surprise: a solid, fun and free run & gun game Much more than what you see The action of Angry Birds Transformers takes place in a side-scrolling context, with the character taking the field and proceeding to the right as hordes of robotic pigs shoot at him from the top of ~buildings~ composed of blocks of wood, glass or metallic. Not being able to dodge the blows, our task is to eliminate the enemies before they inflict excessive damage on us, by touching them on the screen to hook them with the scope (or by hitting the foundations of their shelters to make them fall) and resorting to the transformation into a vehicle to avoid the collapse of large stone structures, as well as special maneuvers useful for overcoming the most numerous gatherings. Choosing one robot rather than another depends on the missions and implies a different approach, given that each Transformer is equipped with its own weapon and has unique abilities: Optimus Prime wields his inseparable rifle that emits short bursts, whereas Bumblebee lands quick, focused shots, or there's the bulky, slow-moving Heatwave (from the Transformers Rescue Bot series), with its powerful energy blasts that land slowly on targets. The characters must be unlocked and upgraded by spending the coins collected during the campaign, while the precious currency, diamonds, is obtained by completing achievements and can be used to speed up upgrade operations and access to new levels. Its use, as mentioned, is not essential: a little patience and the aforementioned gold coins are enough to play for hours and hours without any problems. The picture drawn by Angry Birds Transformers is therefore that of a simple but non-trivial shooter, with a fair degree of challenge already after the tenth level of experience, very well done technically and capable of fielding more or less successful quotes, capable in more than an opportunity to snatch a smile from nostalgics.", "date": "2014-10-18", "grade": "8.4"}
