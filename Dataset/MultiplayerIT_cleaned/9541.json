And to immediately get into gear, the first episode, It's About Time, opens with the famous time travel of the dog Einstein aboard the very stylish car. However, the most attentive will immediately realize that the timeline is not that of the first film. The double-tufted dog (unwatchable, in our opinion) does not return from the mists of time, and Doc becomes transparent, only to then vanish into thin air. Only then does Marty wake up in his bed, and we understand that we are already beyond the film trilogy. What happens from here on has never been told before, even if the past mixes a lot with the present, and establishing where the film ends and the game begins becomes complicated. Just like in the film; to give a headache. This result was also achieved thanks to the participation of screenwriter Bob Gale, who wrote the film together with Zemeckis. And to make the game more authentic there is even Christopher Lloyd, who once again gave voice to the scientist Emmett Brown. Unfortunately Michael J. Fox, as many will remember, was struck by a serious and early illness: his voice was imitated very well by another actor. Seeing the expressive face of Michael J. Fox so well reproduced on the three-dimensional model of Marty McFly, therefore made us excited twice as much. But let's not forget that this is a game. Indeed, a video game. And it is from this point of view that It's About Time must prove that it has what it takes. Staging a video game In the new present, Doc has never returned from one of his time travels, and as a result Marty's father, George McFly, and Biff, another old fan acquaintance, are selling all his possessions to pay off the debts they the scientist has a contract with the county. Emmett Brown's laboratory is a museum of references and quotations, as is the rest of the game. But let's say that from now on anyone who knows the trilogy will feel taken by the hand by Telltale, as if the developers wanted to reassure him that they love the original film as much as he does. Once the first enigma has been overcome, the DeLorean with Einstein on board enters the scene again. Inside, Marty finds a message from his scientist friend, asking him for help from the past, where he is about to be assassinated by a distant relative of Biff. Marty, and us with him, must then travel to the Prohibition years and rescue Dr. Emmet. We skip over the details because we would reveal everything otherwise, but we anticipate that in the past Marty will collaborate most of the time with a very young Emmett Brown, who still has to resolve his oedipal conflicts and establish himself as a scientist. The idea is brilliant and the young version of the scientist, which we can constantly compare with the current one (in terms of the game) is very believable. This is yet another confirmation of how good the Telltales are at delving into the treasure of characters and situations of a license without distorting it or worse, trying to improve it. How many speeches - and how much history! - perhaps someone exclaimed at this point. Now let's start playing, for real. Press a key, it turns! The gameplay of It's About Time is typical of Telltale adventures, now so many and celebrated that it can be considered a trademark. So without boring you by telling you what you already know or what you can see from the pictures (it's all thirteen, no tricks and no deceptions) we however confirm the tendency to want to minimize the number of objects in the inventory and the occasions to use them. Just like in Sam & Max Season Three. But there were Max's powers to complicate everything, not even that here. In fact, finishing the game is a breeze, and you don't need to be a longtime adventurer to nonchalantly solve one puzzle after another. Simply offering a serious challenge is not among the prerequisites of this new series, it seems. Moreover, the story told is very short on its own. On the other hand, the puzzles blend into the narrative flow as never before, and this is a fact that must not go unnoticed: such a fluidity of gameplay and story has never been seen, without those clear divisions between animated scenes and game. Warning though: it's not ~like~ watching a movie, or ~interacting~ with a movie (quotation marks due: both things have never happened in a video game) but pRather, one gets the impression of helping to create the game on the run, although there are no alternative routes or different possible endings. It's just a successful and graceful mix of different languages. On the other hand with a talented writer and a cast of actors like the one mentioned, very little could go wrong from a presentation point of view. So keep this in mind: It's About Time, the first chapter out of a total of five to be released between now and the first half of 2011, is very short and very easy. If the absence of a challenge terrifies you and Back to the Future means nothing to you, then you know what to do.", "date": "2010-12-30", "grade": "8.0"}
