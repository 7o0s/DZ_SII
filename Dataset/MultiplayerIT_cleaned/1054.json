Blinx 2, like any self-respecting sequel, tries to correct the mistakes of its predecessor by enriching its game structure and improving its control system. History hints Blinx 2 takes us back to the middle of the age-old conflict between felines and pigs, engaged, as they were three years ago, in the struggle for control of time. The felines are its protectors while the Tom Tom gang, or the pigs, try to acquire power over the time stream in order to carry out criminal acts of all sorts. During the introduction, a lucky group of pigs comes across a gigantic time crystal, an element capable of concentrating and conveying the time flow, and the ringleader, blinded by the lust for power, causes it to explode. Obviously the destruction of such a large temporal node causes repercussions to the entire temporal flow, triggering nefarious and inexplicable events. As the Time Sweeper, an elite group of which Blinx is a member, we will have the task of saving the time continuum by recovering the fragments of the crystal before the Tom Toms do. Team platformer The first ~revolution~ brought by Blinx 2 consists in allowing us to edit and create a personalized team of time-sweeping cats and as a further addition we will also have to create and play a team of pigs who, lacking control over time, have specialized in space manipulation . The direct consequence of this choice, which gives us the possibility of aesthetically modifying our digital counterpart, is resolved in the absence of the main character in a title which, as we will see shortly, does not shine for its characterization. The game alternates the use of cats and pigs by interweaving the events of the two teams who, from time to time, will try to steal fragments of the time crystal from each other. Each faction has a base where to stock up on equipment and where to carry out training of all sorts. The trainings, which consist of mini-games based on the specific skills of the two factions, allow you to open new levels and unlock the availability of special items. A well-stocked shop will allow us to purchase the aforementioned items before each mission, using the coins collected during the missions. Pigs conquer space The frustrating time limit, imposed to finish a mission in the first Blinx, has fortunately been eliminated and the control system, it is undeniable, has taken a decisive step forward, getting closer to what one would expect in a platformer especially as far as it's about the responsiveness of the controls. In the guise of the felines, the combat system is almost identical to that of the first Blinx: using a large vacuum cleaner it is possible to suck in and store objects and then project them into the opponents' muzzles; obviously there is no shortage of special objects and temporal powers necessary to solve the puzzles and useful to finish off the most difficult enemies. In fact, thanks to their known agility, the pigs can crawl and hide in the shadows, avoiding unwanted clashes and stealing precious objects from the hated felines. Pigs conquer space Pigs, on the other hand, have a soporific slingshot and the ability to move through space through a portable hole. Even the Tom Toms can draw from a wide range of special objects and heavy weapons capable of solving the hottest situations, but the peculiarity of the missions entrusted to the pigs lies in the stealth component. In fact, thanks to their known agility, the pigs can crawl and hide in the shadows, avoiding unwanted clashes and stealing precious objects from the hated felines. Sore notes Despite the improvements Blinx 2 still fails to fully convince. The design of the maps belongs more to the action genre than to the platform one, allocating short stretches randomly scattered here and there to stunts, and the puzzles are directly linked to an object or skill made available in the immediate vicinity, consequently racking your brains for progressing is an incredibly rare occurrence. As if that weren't enough, through radio messages and warning screens, the game keeps us constantly informed of every situation, depriving us of the pleasure of solving any puzzle. Often the resulting sensation is that of performing mechanical actions that someone else has ordered us to perform. Often the resulting sensation is that of performing mechanical actions that someone else has ordered us to perform. Sore notes The end-of-level bosses do not detach themselves from the general picturewhich permeates the title limiting itself to being large monsters with more energy available. On certain occasions, Blinx 2 puts us in real deathmatches in which the teams of the two factions face each other in the open field, but the artificial intelligence is not up to par and is unable to manage the situation and no opponent is able to present a suitable challenge. Multiplayer what a passion Having eliminated the rumored Xbox Live support, the Artoon guys have decided to implement offline multiplayer as in any self-respecting latest generation platformer. Four players can challenge each other in the aforementioned deathmatch mode, much more fun once the artificial intelligence has been eliminated, but also negatively conditioned by maps without complex architectural elements and by weapons expressly designed for the single player. The second multiplayer component, potentially more interesting, is represented by the cooperative mode. Two players can try their hand at the story mode by facing it together and some puzzles actually change, requiring the cooperation of the two players to be solved. Unfortunately, in most cases, the game situations simply become easier, if faced by two, and do not present any difference compared to the single player; as if that weren't enough, some temporal powers such as the REC, which allows you to record an action and make a double come to our aid, become totally superfluous. A little expressive game From a technical point of view, Blinx 2 presents more complex maps than its predecessor, enriched by reflective surfaces and very well lit. The models, on the other hand, are somewhat spartan and the textures do not shine either by definition or by variety. The most serious flaw certainly lies in the characterization, already scarce in the first Blinx, and also lacking in this sequel. Enemies suffer from the same lack of detail and animations are limited in both variety and expressiveness. The dubbing does not help the characterization, limiting itself to attributing the tone of the contemptuous hero to the cats and confining the pigs to the role of stupid scoundrels. The soundtrack comes across as a series of generic techno pieces, uninspired and almost indistinguishable from each other. However, the dubbing in Italian should be underlined. Comment Blinx 2 arrives in stores with the task of redeeming the pretentious predecessor, but, despite the copious additions and the slight improvement of the control system, it fails to detach itself from a structure that is repetitive in the long run and devoid of variations worthy of the premises. The ingenious idea, linked to time control, has not been fully developed this time either, crushed by the weight of a platform that shares very little with this genre, but which is more reminiscent of pure action. Even the characterization certainly does not help, and makes Blinx 2 advisable for platform and action game enthusiasts willing to overcome the flaws in order to get a few hours of play. Pros: Three game modes: single, co-op and multiplayer Improved control system Cons: Too simplified Not enough characterization A platformer with too much action component A little over three years have passed since the launch of the first Microsoft console which, over time, has been able to build a noteworthy lineup, ranging, albeit with some difficulty, even among the genres most dear to the console population. But despite being able to choose between arcade racing, action, shoot'em up, sports, conversions, and while offering the possibility of playing online, Microsoft has always known it was missing in the genre that has always been the very flag of console gaming: the platform. Blinx, the first attempt by the US major to patch up this lack, is a strong feline platformer of the unprecedented idea linked to giving players control of time. But an idea is not enough and the lack of personality and dynamism in the control system have precluded Blinx from standing out even among the most banal platformers.", "date": "2005-01-21", "grade": null}
