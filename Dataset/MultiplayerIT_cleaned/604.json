Around the galaxy There is a wide choice of games, both for those who want to play alone against the computer and for those who want to challenge other players in multiplayer. Alone it is possible to face two distinct historical campaigns, one for the Rebels and one for the Empire, or different scenarios of galactic conquest. Galactic conquest is certainly the main mode of The Empire at War, the one in which all the game potential is deployed. The player is placed in front of a galactic map, with its various planets and permitted routes, and must simultaneously deploy troops on the field, produce new forces and discover new technologies. Each planet has an orbital and a terrestrial map, in the first one it is possible to deploy one's fleets and in the second one one's troops. Conquering a planet means first of all defeating the space defenses and then the terrestrial ones, this translates into two battles, one aboard spaceships and the other on foot or aboard vehicles. In both cases we will be able to deploy normal, special and heroes units, each with its own abilities and powers. Once a planet is conquered, it contributes to the amount of credits produced over time. Each planet also provides a certain bonus to whoever owns it. It's good to remember that, in the galactic map, the game is in real time and not in turns so, while planning, you need to always keep an eye on your opponents, who can attack at any moment. conquering a planet means first of all defeating the space defenses and then the terrestrial ones Around the galaxy An important thing to mention is that the two camps have clear distinctions from each other. The Empire buys technology by building research centers, the Rebels can only steal technologies from their opponents, so they are relegated to a tracker role. The latter, however, have the opportunity to peek at the enemy forces and know their position in advance, while the Empire is forced to use probes and spies. But the differences are also in terms of armaments, since if on the one hand the imperial forces have more homogeneous armies, the rebels can deploy more diversified units on the field. An example? The Rebels must build the fighters one by one, while the Empire automatically churn them out of Star Destroyers once they are engaged in combat. It is also true though that a squadron of x-wings is stronger than a squadron of tie-fighters. All this in the galactic campaign mode. If, on the other hand, we choose to play one of the two historical campaigns present, we will find ourselves projected into a more articulated scenario, where we will be able to closely follow the story that acts as a leitmotif for the various missions. Also in this case we will have a galactic map but the missions will follow each other in a linear way, while leaving us freedom of action and choice on which planets to conquer and how to manage the attacks between one mission and another. Also in this case we will have to defend ourselves from the assaults of the enemy. Unlike the other mode, this time the technologies will be driven by the evolution of the story. A shortcoming, certainly not serious, is the poor customization of the galactic conquest scenarios, which is reduced to the bone, in addition to choosing the starting credits, the initial and maximum technology level, nothing else can be done. You cannot choose which planet to start from or which forces and heroes to deploy. [C] Ackab's Home One finally collapses under our blows. Chewbacca in action: his ability to play! special allowed him to steal an enemy AT-AT and turn it against his comrades. The Millenium Falcon in the foreground, while giving us the a hand against the Empire. [/C] Petroglyph, who are they? Composed mostly of former Westwoods, Petroglyph is a team with solid experience and which boasts among its ranks historical videogame professionals. Impossible to enumerate all the titles in which the various members have participated but, among the best known, there are certainly the various Command & Conquer, Civilization 3, the ancient Eye of the Beholder (who remembers it?), LotR: The Battle for Middle-earth and Blade Runner. The more curious can go and take a look at their official website. Deep The combat system is based on a comparison table in which each unit is strong against some enemies and weak againstamong others, for example a squadron of y-wings is defeated by a squadron of tie-fighters but manages to easily eliminate an Acclamator-class star destroyer. Similarly for ground troops: for example, almost all Imperial tanks are vulnerable to attacks by plex soldiers, armed with rocket launchers, while they are a real scourge for normal infantry. This system, now tested by many other titles, forces the player to create armies that take into account every possible counterattack, thus favoring a balancing strategy of the units which, in doing so, are practically always re-proposed in the same way, preferring those that excel in the more common clashes, and creating a certain repetitiveness in this sense. Fortunately, the differentiation of the units of the two sides makes up for this fact a bit, still allowing you to use a certain creative breadth during the construction of the armies. [C] Asteroid fields and nebulae are nasty beasts for ships. There is plenty of room for maneuver. very narrow when there are so many obstacles. Imperial forces have just conquered a small country. Shadows, vegetation, footprints and reflections on the water. The maps are rich and detailed. [/C] the possibility of hitting the vital systems of the largest ships is a perfectly fitting idea that we can only applaud Deep The battles are well done, full of effects and details, the explosions are beautiful to see and the way the larger units break up is truly spectacular. The best, however, is given by the clashes in space, where the units really look like tiny models and seeing them swarm against the opponents is a little pleasure. The possibility of hitting the vital systems of the largest ships, then, is a perfectly fitting idea that we can only applaud. All this is enhanced by a first-rate sound sector, which reproduces the music and effects of the films in an extremely faithful way. Where the game suffers, however, is in the size of the maps, which are really too small and, in the case of the spatial ones, even too narrow and crowded with obstacles, especially considering that the battles take place in a plane and not in a volume. Having such strategic freedom available on the galactic map, one would expect to find an equally vast tactical freedom during actual battles, but this is not the case, since one almost always ends up favoring direct confrontations based only on the power of fire. If in space this is a real axiom, in land battles the player will be able to feel more creative by virtue of a more varied map design. where the game suffers is in the size of the maps, which are far too small Deep The game mechanics, during land or space battles, can be summarized in a few words. First of all, there is a team that attacks and there is one that defends, both field a number of units limited by a maximum value but, for those who attack, there is the possibility of calling any reinforcements present, while those who defends can count on garrison units, churned out in waves from the built structures (buildings, on the ground, or base, in orbit). Unfortunately, this system is not without its flaws. First, the player is not free to decide which units to deploy right away: in land maps, the computer decides which units to deploy, while the others remain available as reinforcements; in space maps, the limit is set to 20, so all surplus units are automatically left out, without allowing the player to choose which ones to keep and which not. Secondly, to this is added the fact that, on the ground, the maps often have obligatory routes that reduce freedom of movement. In essence, if on the one hand the fights are fun and adrenaline-pumping, on the other we would have had more pleasure in finding large maps in which more freedom was left to the player. Finally, let's spend a few words on localization. The game is entirely subtitled in Italian, so all the texts have been translated and there are subtitles in the cutscenes, however, as far as the voices are concerned, we are faced with a rather curious fact: the tutorial is entirely dubbed, while the rest not. Considering the quality of the original voice acting isn't that great, I don't know if we should be happy or sorry, but so be it. Goodness them. [C] Rain on Dagobah. Atmospheric events negatively affect troop performance. The ultimate weapon. What else to say? Sit back, popcorn in hand, and enjoy the show A grudgehe comes to say hello, how nice he wants to make friends [/C] Final comment So what do we have here? A classic RTS that had the most awkward parts of the genre cut away and was then stitched onto a larger rig. We have as a result a risky mix but with a good dose of novelty, but not without defects, such as the too small size of the maps and the limited freedom left to the player. Turning off the build mode during battles and eliminating resource gathering, for example, is risky, as a more traditionalist player might not appreciate the change. In this way, he forces himself to spend much more time on the galactic map than one might expect, but it is precisely the spirit of the game that pushes in this direction. The novelty lies in the fact that we can now think at a higher level, as true generals, and without having to submit to too many impositions. The strategic structure on which the game is based guarantees varied and exciting gameplay, completely distorting the value of what otherwise would have been just an anonymous succession of maps. Pros Long-lived and dynamic Cinematic and adrenaline-pumping battles Excellent strategic mix Cons Too small maps Flat space battles instead of three-dimensional Little freedom for the player during battles Summary of the previous episode As already widely discussed in the preview phase, the game mechanism of The Empire at War is simple and consists of two parts, one strategic and one actual combat. In the strategic phase we control a galactic map, where we will move our troops as in an immense chessboard, all rigorously in real time. Only in this phase will we be able to build structures and buildings and only in this phase will we be able to produce our units. We remind you that there are no resources to collect, except the money that will automatically enter our coffers depending on how many planets you own. When the two enemy factions meet, the combat phase ensues. This is where the actual clashes take place and since it is not possible to build units, we will be able to replace those lost in battle through a system of reinforcements, which can be called from the map.", "date": "2006-02-25", "grade": null}
