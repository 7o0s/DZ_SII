MachineGames has packaged a substantially modern shooter, which flirts with stealth, signs style clauses such as those of character progression and does not give up ticking many other boxes of that checklist through which the current conception of the genre is defined but which when it gets to the point it comes across as rocky, polished and characterful, thanks to the insightful integration of many of the 'old school' shooter precedents. The Swedish team has shown that it had a healthy education, coming up with the classics, but above all that it has not forgotten it, managing to preserve a far from faded image of what made a certain way of understanding the genre great yesterday for make it compatible with what we understand it today. In short, The New Order managed to capture the spirit of Wolfenstein in a new way and more generally of a heritage in which the genes of other tutelary names peep out, such as the Riddick with which it boasts a direct lineage and Half-Life 2. all supported by an imaginative force and a narrative pulse no less, able to re-read this umpteenth story of the fight against Nazism through kaleidoscopic lenses, capable of plucking many different strings in the right way, marrying the classic heroism all in one film piece war after the Second World War to reflections from conscientious objection, excruciating incursions into a dimension of extreme and dehumanizing cynicism up to the sweet decompression into spheres where to celebrate life positively and values such as empathy, friendship and love, shrewd references to music, cinema and pop culture but also meta-referential winks scattered here and there, sometimes in a viral way. And then, at the center of it all, he, a William BJ Blazkowicz perfectly son of these instances, a devastating extermination machine with never too many Nazis killed on his curriculum and never enough questions to ask. It is therefore not surprising that many have hailed the debut of MachineGames as one of the best titles of 2014 and among the indispensable shooters of recent years. What is a little surprising is that the Swedish software house continues to demonstrate superior level competence and sensitivity even on its second time, in packaging a stand-alone expansion, an eventuality in which it is easy to find yourself running out of ideas or remain firmly clinging to the own conquests, sounding tired and conservative, giving yet another proof of sparkling creative vitality. After the exploit of The New Order, has Blazkowicz been able to repeat himself with Wolfenstein: The Old Blood? Return to the castle The Old Blood is a prequel set in 1946 that tells the events immediately preceding The New Order, taking the player to where it all began: in the castle that gives its name to the series. The authors appropriately seized the opportunity to give the game a different characterization, capable of giving it the right dignity of autonomous experience. The artistic direction has become more ~classic~, typically 40s, replacing the bright and decisive colors of the original with a delicate and pastel range, which in some cases recalls the photography (not the rendering, mind you) of Dishonored. An elective affinity also suggested by industrial design, with machinery and infrastructure clearly inspired by the unmistakable work that Viktor Antonov did for Arkane and, before that, Valve. In short, MachineGames seems to have decided to bring Wolfenstein Castle back to life inspired by the Combine architecture, so strong is the feeling of finding oneself inside an archaeological pertinence of the Half-Life 2 Citadel in certain passages. But this is only one of the tones of The Old Blood, which plays in a brilliant and conscious way also and above all with the background of the fans of the saga who prepared the ramp for the launch of id Software and an entire genre into the stratosphere, starting from the emblematic access cable car to the manor in Return of Castle Wolfenstein, of which many other places, characters and salient features are reimagined. Among these there is no shortage of reference imagery, which wriggles free from scientific and technological issues to return to venture into another of the crazy but fascinating areas of interest in Hitler's empire: esotericism. A story with a supernatural flavor, therefore, that we don't forget to honor the founding father, Wolfenstein 3D, with the inclusion of a remake (this time complete) and to celebrate, in fun, the stable brotherhood with The Elder Scrolls, Fallout and Doom. And one does not forget to outline with due attention human parables similar to those that have helped to hearyes so much involved in The New Order, between supporting actors towards whom to feel affection and enemies towards which to establish a ferocious and heartfelt antagonism, compatibly with the development of a more concentrated narrative arc. Finally, clearly, there is still him, Blazkowicz, who loads this pounding shape-shifting burden on his shoulders, carrying it forward between tests of courage and signs of fragility, now proceeding like a steamroller, now staggering until he loses his balance and falls with a crash. to the ground, wondering if it's really worth getting up, before finding a strand of strength to try again. A figure capable of making one think, for the second time in front of the end credits, that if war is an unjust thing, it would be right for men like him to fight it. Thick violence The Old Blood could only confirm the great ambivalence of the gameplay of the original, often proposing problems that can be tackled by leveling the weapons or silently infiltrating the threats. Both aspects are presented in great dust, thanks above all to a splendid work in terms of level design, which seems to be the result of a scrupulous reflection on how to further emphasize the strengths of the game formula. The areas tend to be larger, more structured, more inclined to stratify on different levels or in the best cases all three, offering a huge amount of ideas for both families of practicable approaches. The interweaving of walkways, the corridors of the garrisons and the multiple digressions that can be prepared by swimming at the entrance to Fort Wolfenstein, the vantage points and alternative interpretations offered by the supporting beams of the Pantry of the Tavern or the interweaving of engagement distances and action planning of the Prison Pier. Then there are sections that manage to unfold similar qualities around a strong underlying idea, which appear as real declarations of intent on the quantity of cartridges that MachineGames still has to shoot before it can make any deja vu feel. This group includes levels such as the Caverns, with their perched spiral structure, the spacious suspended platforms leveled one above the other of the Cable Car Station and the cacophonous tangle of paths among the landslides of the Cemetery. In short, the studio founded by the former Starbreeze is confirmed as the team that best captured Valve's inspiration in giving depth to shooters with linear progression. A school of thought of which he is a valid observer also regarding the way in which moments not affected by the ~standard action~ are valued, treated by many today as useless spaces to be filled with cutscenes, setpieces or walks in radio connection, and which here instead are taken to offer playability with some gameplay twist (such as certain puzzles integrated into the stealth at the opening of the game), the Laderoboater (protagonist of the inevitable section on board a mech implemented in a much more versatile and satisfying way than the equivalent of The New Order) or the general attempt to keep exploration rewarding. Naturally, the Swedes also never miss an opportunity to offer more active than average narrative forms, of which they have been masters since the days of Riddick and The Darkness, among which the reinterpretation of a certain incognito scene of the predecessor who plays with expectations stands out of those who lived it. Unfortunately, not everything proves inspired in the same way. Some sections on the tracks could have been very well cut given how obvious, tedious, without anything to say, while a secondary boss of Chapter 4 is a real disaster of planning and execution: the rules for dealing with the situation that concerns him are not exposed in In any way, his movements break every two by three, except to recover on the player with blatant elastic-effects, and his attacks have an inconstant range and damage, even hitting by penetrating walls . Definitely the lowest point of MachineGames' young career. Crush the Nazi with the Potato Masher! The Old Blood comes with new trinkets and some new ugly face on which to apply them. The first is a pair of Pipes that can be exploited both in offensive terms and for exploratory purposes. Although you can also choose whether to use them combined in a single long blunt instrument or separated, complete with differentiated moves and environmental uses, ultimately they don't reveal much: as a fighting tool they end up fulfilling a function that is almost entirely superimposable to the knife, while their exploitation to scale walls, break certain walls orlaunching at speed on the cables is mostly predetermined, therefore not acting as a piece to make the action more versatile. If nothing else thanks to their introduction, a lot has been gained in terms of verticality in the structuring of the levels. Surely the Kampfpistole is more convincing, a revolver loaded with explosive shots that does exaggerated damage, managing to nebulize even entire opposing formations, of which one has the constant feeling of never finding enough shots. Also excellent are the Bombenschuss, a very gratifying and versatile bolt-action rifle, thanks to its hybrid optics, and the Schockhammer, forerunner of The New Order's Automatic Rifle with equally brutalizing effects. In addition to some bosses of which we prefer not to anticipate anything, except that fortunately they are spans more successful than the one mentioned above, the army of evil welcomes the entry of a couple of variations of the Supersoldaten, one that for reasons of autonomy does not can detach from the power cables and one more mobile but with the energy cells well exposed, which allows a more elastic and fine approach compared to the models to be broken through using a superior firepower seen in the predecessor. But the lion's share, at a certain point, goes to the Tremanti, closing the circle of references to Return to Castle Wolfenstein which enriches the recipe of the new Wolfenstein on several levels. These are enemies who, with their swarming, perfectly integrate that pressing of the spaces which represents the best value of the enemy artificial intelligence, going to play a role, that of the runners, able to keep the player on his toes further engaged in getting away with it in the territorial dispute with the Nazis. The nice thing is that they are also hostile towards compatriot troops, which places them as a variable to increase the emergence factor of the fighting, with the establishment of ~three-front~ struggles, not to mention that under certain conditions a regular soldier is converted back to Trembling, so it can be used to your advantage as a weapon or diversion. The design is completed with the Talents, present in a reduced form but not without some interesting innovations, among which we should mention Furious Reload (which allows you to actively act on the key to change the magazine by completing the procedure) and Quick Rotation (which combines a classic 180 large with automatic targeting of the closest enemy). Transfusion Composed of eight chapters, The Old Blood has a declared duration amounting to about half of The New Order. An estimate corroborated by our field test that at I am the Reaper! it took a good eight hours to roll to the end credits. In addition to the natural propensity of the game formula to be stripped several times, either to experiment with other action profiles with a new pass at higher levels of difficulty, or to track down secrets and unlock all the Talents, in support of the longevity there is also a very welcome Challenge mode, with which to face ten of the most interesting campaign scenarios ad libitum and be evaluated with a score. This is certainly the ideal addition to really dig into and improve on the gameplay, really enjoying it to the fullest, spurred on by the inclusion of detailed statistics and an online leaderboard. Nothing seems to have been left to chance even in the technical field, with the inclusion of a significantly higher number of Advanced Options. Too bad that, despite the efforts, this ends up being the most objectionable aspect of the package. Compared to The New Order, The Old Blood presents a more refined graphic sector, especially as regards the textures and the rendering of certain materials, associated with an artistic direction capable of capitalizing on the merits and mitigating the defects of the id Tech V with more continuity. Unfortunately, Carmack's latest discovery continues to prove to be a problematic technology, stuck between too many trans-generational compromises and commercial exploitation needs, unable to offer performance commensurate with the quality and amount of stuff moved on video. Stuttering and frame-rate drops are problems that have shored up our gaming experience with a slightly higher frequency than the already anything but oiled The New Order, also accompanied by unpleasant news such as the failure to display the pre-calculated interlude sequences and some sudden game crash.", "date": "2015-05-07", "grade": "8.3"}
