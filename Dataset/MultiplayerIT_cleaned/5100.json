Is your liver still gnawing at the world championship lost by Alonso in the Emirates in 2010? Well, finally you can turn on the radio and remote control the drivers from the wall thanks to Motorsport Manager. It is a management system that refers, not too covertly, to the only and deserving exponents of the genre, i.e. the Grand Prix Managers of ing. Edward Grabowski: Even the font used is very similar to the MicroProse games of the second half of the 90s. A management system has been awaited for a long time on the magical world of Formula 1 and, thanks to SEGA, the PlaySport guys, after gaining experience on mobile platforms, can show off a title in step with the times, albeit still a little unripe. Missing editors and licenses, there's a few bugs too many: even so Motorsport Manager is an excellent game No Hamilton no party Let's start immediately from the major sore point, namely the absence of the FIA license: this implies that the names of the pilots and teams mimic the real ones, as well as the tracks that do not faithfully follow those we all know. While a large community is already working to remedy it, the disappointment remains for the lack of an internal editor who can make up for the lack of Hamilton, Vettel and company. Once the low blow has been received, Motorsport Manager immediately manages to attract attention: after having created the customized version of Maurizio Arrivabene, there is a choice between facing a single race weekend, grappling with some situations preset by the developers (for the moment there are only two, but more have been promised) or face an epic world race, choosing between three increasingly demanding championships. Tier 3 is the European one, then we move on to what we would define as GP2 to finish with the premier class. There is no real level of difficulty, although it is obvious that by choosing the equivalent of Ferrari or Mercedes there will not be too much to deal with structures, sponsors and drivers, because those present by default are already at the highest levels. On the contrary, by choosing the very scarce Panther, a new Australian arrival, the challenge will become total, given that the mechanics are relatives of the team manager and the engine is that of his grandfather's Punto. Motorsport Manager adopts a very audacious rule that Ecclestone and Mosley would have liked to introduce a few years ago, namely a system of promotion and relegation to the next category, just like with football clubs. Each championship has a dozen teams and a personalized ~tracklist~, as well as a series of rules that differentiate it, even significantly, from the others. For example, in GP2 you can't get your hands on the engine, because you have to keep the one supplied by the parent company unchanged. Oldies but goldies The Playgames title owes much more than something to Grand Prix Manager: in fact, the structure is slavishly traced, with two main and complementary phases. On the one hand there is the management of the team which is governed via a desktop divided into ten menus, each with its own dignity, even if some screens are slightly redundant. It goes without saying that every item needs to be carefully monitored between races, although some, such as the HQ refurbishment, require less maintenance. Among the menus that are accessed most frequently, the development of the single-seater occupies the main place. There are six areas for improvement: drivetrain, suspension, brakes, engine, rear and front wing. A graph provides the degree of competitiveness of each component, in order to focus on the less performing areas. In principle, it is possible to play between the increase in performance and that of reliability, with one ramification to the detriment of the other, but ~borderline~ paths can also be taken which provide more conspicuous improvements in the face of possible irregularities which, in if discovered, they would lead to sporting and economic penalties as well as the ban on the developed upgrade. As development deepens, a range of bonuses opens up to combine: in the case of our Chariot (the equivalent of the Caterham) we have developed a dozen rear wings to get to climb only one position in the ranking, while at the same time the gearbox he stayed the same throughout the season, considering he was in the middle of the lot. We also have to manage the group of technicians who work on increasing performance and reliability, in order to obtain the best compromise for each element of the machine. Once completed, the new part can be fittedonly on one of the two cars, and this inevitably means that there will be a disparity in performance between the two squires in the following GP, with consequent risks of unhappiness on the part of those who have been excluded. DaSilva and Prosit This is where personnel management comes into play, an aspect that is certainly more in-depth than in Grand Prix World. In addition to any long faces due to preferences in technical choices, there are also interpersonal relationships to manage. If the second guide consistently obtains better results than the first, he could expect the hierarchies to be overturned, not to mention the difficulties of renewal if the team's performance is not considered up to par. Although only the pilots are endowed with the ability to understand and want, the bond they can create with the technicians is very interesting. Still in our example, Iker Vidal, the first Spanish guide, in the eleventh race had established an excellent feeling with his track engineer and this allowed him to unlock some modifiers, such as less engine wear, which otherwise would not have been accessible. On the contrary, the promising young Ebony Tyler, who took over in the middle of the season as second driver, literally sent her technician to hell due to a wrong strategy that made him lose the points zone in the final stages of the race. Still on the subject of human material there is the figure, taken a bit from Football Manager, of the talent scout. A feature that the programmers wanted to include on the plate but which turns out to be a little too weak, just as weak in general, is the whole negotiation phase: for example, it is not clear why a driver or a technician cannot be optioned so that he takes over the contractual expiry of the one currently under the team. Not even the contacts with the sponsors are entirely convincing: beyond the ~marketability~ of the team, influenced both by the media appeal of the riders and by the team's performance, we simply limit ourselves to choosing the company that pays the best, preferring those which, in exchange for the achievement of positions in qualifying and in the race (realistically achievable) give out objective prizes. However, the risk of finding yourself with a virgin livery is very low and this somehow facilitates the player's tasks since the income from the stickers is by far the most significant in order to survive. The social aspect could not be missing either: the e-mail inbox is flooded with reports of the race and tweets from fans, but also with more delicate communications, such as emergency management (the engine of the first drive leaks: risking retirement or invest a substantial sum to repair it? The game may not be worth the candle (for example if our wheelbarrows always occupy the last positions of the grid) or political decisions. From time to time changes are proposed to the technical and sporting regulations (changing the layout of a track to make it slower, reintroducing supplies, rewarding who gets the fastest lap) which the player is called to vote on and which also heavily influence the way to play in the following seasons. Lights (green) and shadows Once the administrative procedures have been done, the most awaited weekend finally arrives. At the beginning of the game, the length of the races can be decided, so whether the distance covered should be short (on average 10 laps per GP), medium or complete, a choice we encourage to explore all the facets of Motorsport Manager in depth. In this case there are slight differences with the real F1, mainly aimed at making the action more engaging. There is only one free practice session, lasting 20 minutes, during which it is necessary to explore the most suitable set-up for the drivers who will provide feedback via radio communications. Furthermore, the aspects on which to focus must be decided: for example, by riding for a long time in the race configuration you can get bonuses for Sunday, just as by always using the super soft tires you will have a benefit in terms of durability. The fact of having to go on trial and error to guess the best set-up, combined with the limited amount of time available and the modifiers that are unlocked by turning, makes this phase, usually devoid of bite, engaging. More disappointing were the qualifying sessions, characterized by a single 12-minute session: no traps and a lack of immediacy of the hud which prevents the gap between the drivers from being immediately clear. The only diversion is represented by the launch lap, in which the pilot must literally be commanded, indicating how much to press on the gas via a sliding bar, so that fkidneys and tires are at the ideal temperature once on the pit straight. Once the starting grid has been established, the strategy must be decided and here the grosser shortcomings of the PlaySport title emerge: in fact, a pit-stop table cannot be planned in advance, but they must be managed only and exclusively in real time, and the thing it becomes even more annoying when you have to deal with the fuel to take on between one stint and another. Before starting the engine, in addition to a last desperate chance to alter the balance of the car, you have to choose the bonuses obtained during free practice: you can then proceed with the starting grid. The action gets really interesting when the red lights go out, because the pilots can be controlled via two driving strategies. On the one hand we find aggressiveness, divided into five levels, which in the face of faster tire degradation offers better performance and at the same time increases the risk of errors; on the other, one of the four engine mappings must be set, aware that the ~magic~ one for overtaking consumes a tanker and subjects the Formula 1 components to greater wear. During the race, however, the drivers will provide indications that may or may not be accepted: there are those who will ask to push harder even if the petrol level is below the threshold, those who will press to change the tires prematurely. Systematically ignoring complaints can lead to a break in relations, especially if the strategy turns out to be wrong. At a certain point, not only will he not want to renew with the team, but in the following races he will refuse to respond to orders, preferring to act on his own mind. However, the balance of the driving style seemed a bit too cumbersome: perhaps it could have been lightened a bit by simplifying some combinations. Pit stops are the queen of the race: looking down on your drivers can be interesting, but seeing them recover in the time table is definitely more so. In Motorsport Manager, as in reality, undercutting could lead to climbing some positions, but miracles are not to be expected if the car is too slow, while real sensational results can be achieved by knowing how to exploit the arrival of the rain. In any case, the continuous evolution of the track (even if retirements and accidents are a bit too few, only five in the entire world championship we competed in) does not allow for any kind of relaxation: the race must be monitored from start to finish, more speeding up the moments of apparent calm. Engine... graphic The action is taken from a helicopter flying over the tracks: the care with which they have been reproduced is commendable, a little less the zoom level which does not allow you to appreciate the liveries of the single-seaters too closely, which are in any case excellently done. Each track is rich in detail and in almost all of them you can recognize elements of famous tracks. Unfortunately the price to pay in terms of hardware is quite demanding (the system requirements are not very reliable), even if a recent patch, providing the possibility of a 2D view, has expanded the fleet of cars that can afford to run Motorsport Manager . AI is probably one of the finer points where the most bugs focus. First of all, the gaps between the cars widen in an incomprehensible way: it often happens that a car manages to disappear at the exit of a curve and then be overtaken at the end of the next straight. Also check the lap times based on the engine mapping, because the rule according to which more power corresponds to less time is almost frequently broken. The trend of the gap between one driver and another is also too schizophrenic: understandable in the initial stages, much less during the continuation of the race, when it happens that drivers with destroyed tires continue to gain on those who have just changed them. It is absolutely not all to be thrown away: these imperfections, which were the most predictable at the time of launch, are under scrutiny by the programmers who have promised prolonged support, and as confirmation a couple of patches have already been released that resolve anomalous situations. However, the fact remains that, net of a series of behaviors to be perfected, the tension during the arc of the GP always remains high, above all because one must always be ~on the spot~, ready to change decisions already made on the fly. The level of satisfaction for having obtained a sixth place with the worst car on the grid, thanks to perfect timing during wet qualifying and an equal number of fans", "date": "2017-01-03", "grade": "8.0"}
