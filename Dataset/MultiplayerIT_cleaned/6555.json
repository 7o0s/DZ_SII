An undoubtedly negative premise for anyone who has reached the saturation point with respect to one of the most inflated genres of the mobile market, now re-proposed hundreds of times well beyond the tolerable limit. From this point of view, the choice of the Canadian Snowman team represents a sort of gamble, even more so considering that it is not a free title, but proposed for 1.99: probably too much for the casual user still fond of this type of gameplay but now hopelessly addicted to freemium logic. Yet, overcoming beliefs and preconceptions, those who appreciate mobile gaming could find these few pennies the best spent on the App Store for a long, long time. Alto's Adventure is undoubtedly one of the best games of this beginning of 2015 on the App Store The most distinctive element of Alto's Adventure that captures the attention and fascinates from the very first moments is undoubtedly the aesthetic component: Snowman's work is in fact an endless runner set on snowy mountains and alpine panoramas, to be crossed quickly in a descent breathtaking on your snowboard. The artistic direction has been entrusted to the English artist Harry Nesbitt, who has done an extraordinary job moving away from the inflated pixel art and preferring a minimalist, clean approach based on pastel colors and clear and pronounced geometries. Let me be clear, in any case nothing extraordinarily original, but with a truly incisive depth and personality. The descent always starts from the same small village, a handful of houses more than anything else, but develops successively in a different way every time thanks to the procedural generation system of the terrain: each game in Alto's Adventure is therefore unique, destined never to be repeated in the same way as the previous one. An element that guarantees freshness, but which is literally exalted by Nesbitt's work: one passes between trees, rocks, slopes and ravines, simple buildings, ruins, rows of colored flags and lit bonfires, with the mountains illuminated by the rays Of sun. Or caressed by the soft light of the moon. Or hidden, rendered almost invisible by a sudden violent storm, revealed only by glimpses of lightning. In fact, in Alto's Adventure time flows dynamically, cyclically from dawn to night passing through a red sunset, literally transforming the appearance of those splendid settings just described. The effect is that of putting before the eyes a beautiful and refined, elegant toy, capable of attracting simply by its appearance. It is clear how Snowman has decided to concentrate many of his efforts on this component, and the attention to detail also reinforces this conviction: the animations, the details, the small nuances make every descent a real pleasure. The gameplay component is perhaps less surprising, but also carefully studied: as previously mentioned, it is an endless runner, with a formula very similar to that offered in the past by the very popular Ski Safari. In Alto's Adventure, however, everything is much more convincing and balanced, above all thanks to the fact that it is a paid title with no in-app purchases. Thanks to this choice, the developers were able to guarantee well-defined, clear-cut mechanics, not subjected to distortions such as paywalls or timers of any kind. In Alto's Adventure you basically have to worry about getting as far as possible while avoiding obstacles. This basic concept was then enriched with a scoring system with relative rankings that is linked to the recovery of one's escaped llamas (yes, llamas), the collection of coins and a basic but intriguing trick system. The latter allows, by pressing anywhere on the screen, to activate a backflip: the happy landing - far from obvious - allows you to temporarily increase your speed and equip yourself with a shield for a few moments. Each closed trick graphically determines the lengthening of the protagonist's scarf (homage to Journey), which also guarantees a practical function once the spectacular wingsuit is obtained. Not to forget the two types of timed bonuses that can be collected during the descents, in the form of a magnet and a feather, which respectively allow you to collect coins more easily and overcome any obstacle. In addition, the developers have also integrated an intelligent system of objectives, which contributes substantially to adding further stimuli: in essence, these are three ~tasks~ to be performed for each level (recovering a total blade, performing precise tricks, collecting a number ofi coins, etc.). Once completed, you move on to the next level, with a growth that in practice allows you to unlock other characters to control, each with its own precise characteristics both aesthetic and in quality with the board. In such a positive picture, perhaps the only criticismable element of Alto's Adventure is the soundtrack, composed of a single song: while very pleasant and well integrated into the context, its inevitable repetition for dozens, hundreds of times at each descent cannot generate sooner or later a rejection effect.", "date": "2015-02-19", "grade": "9.0"}
