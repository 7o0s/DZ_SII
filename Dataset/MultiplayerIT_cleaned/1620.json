{"name": "Project Zero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-zero-3.html", "text": "An atypical survival horror The Challenge of Tecmo The graphics sector of Project Zero suffers from a slightly too dated setting, the legacy of an all too faithful conversion from the original, released quite some time ago, for PlayStation 2. The technical changes compared to the version for black monolith Sony are limited to some more defined textures and a slightly greater polygonal detail, which gives even more charm to the already evocative environments. The transparency of the ghosts and the light effects are very beautiful, which greatly help to increase the suspense. I surpass the sound sector and, if you have a Dolby Digital system, you will be able to hear even the smallest, as sinister, crunches inside the house. Sneaky. The music, typical of the Japanese style, is equally spot on. An impeccable job. Project Zero is almost totally aliasing-free and also the loading times are shorter than the version for the Sony platform, thanks to the use of the hard disk. The controls are intuitive, the layout of the keys ensures an unexpected feeling from the very first moments of the game and there are no difficulties even in the most complex situations. Longevity is ensured by a large and intricate map to be explored and, as in all survival horror, the difficulty level can be selected from three different possibilities: easy, normal, difficult. Progressive the difficulty of the enemies who, progressing in the game, will be increasingly intelligent, ever faster, ever more resistant. But with a good dose of cunning and cold blood, our Miku will be able to knock out even the most difficult opponents. An atypical survival horror Comment Since the first rumors leaked by Tecmo Project Zero had fascinated me, and seeing that finally another software house was trying to compete with the 'untouchables' of survival horror had aroused strong hopes in me. And the wait paid off well. From the first moments of the game the tension is high, there is no shortage of moments of pure terror and the atmosphere is fantastic, also thanks to an absolutely sublime audio sector. As already mentioned, the only regret concerns the graphics engine, not adequately improved compared to the PlayStation 2 counterpart. A hand from Itagaki and Team Ninja would have been very useful. Pros: Beautiful atmosphere and plot Excellent audio sector Not suitable for the faint of heart Cons: Technical sector not at the highest levels An atypical survival horror Surprisingly, Tecmo, who has given many hours of pure entertainment to players all over the world thanks to the Dead or Alive series, has ventured into the development of a survival horror. In this genre, which has always been dominated by Konami with Silent Hill and by Capcom with the Resident Evil saga, Tecmo has managed to demonstrate that it is an eclectic software house, able to successfully engage in genres that are completely new. Many ancient legends speak of ghosts that roam inside old ruins because in the past they were victims of appalling massacres, but legends are not always simple folk tales, sometimes it happens that they contain a small part of the truth. Just like in this case. The story that sees us as protagonists, in Project Zero, tells of a medieval villa called Palazzo Himuro, where the souls of people sacrificed during macabre religious rituals live. And Miku, the young Japanese girl our alter ego in the game, will find herself having to explore the sinister mansion, in search of her brother who disappeared during the search for a famous writer. Obviously Miku is not just any girl, otherwise what video game would it be?, and she discovers that she possesses paranormal powers and is able to capture the ectoplasmic manifestations of the Himuro palace through the use of a particular camera inherited from her mother. After experiencing the events that befell her brother in a short, playable introduction entirely in black and white, she moves on to control Miku. The game offers the classic survival horror elements: to continue it is essential to collect various objects, fight against the sinister entities that infest the Himuro house, and obviously solve the inevitable more or less logical puzzles. The clashes with ghosts contribute to bringing a breath of fresh air, decidedly different from those seen in Resident Evil or Silent Hill, thanks to the original weapon at our disposal, or the camera, which helps to give a sense of annoying impotence to the gamer. A little curiosity, Miku in the Pal version of the game nShe won't be wearing the classic Japanese schoolgirl tunic, but more Western clothing.", "date": "2003-06-17", "grade": null}
