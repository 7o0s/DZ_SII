Despite this primacy, the transalpine software house could not resist the temptation to try their hand at the Unreal Engine, and the result is the Wild Blood here which, under a very glossy presentation, actually hides the ~usual~ action game in third person .. . Mixed blood Gameloft draws a fantasy setting from the deck for its latest effort, staging a not too convincing reinterpretation of the story of Lancelot, the absolute protagonist of the adventure: back in Albion, our hero finds his land invaded by demons, invoked by the wicked Morgana who has deceived King Arthur by exploiting her resentment over the affair between her first knight and Queen Guinevere. Nothing more than a pretext to justify a sequence of action-packed levels derived from God of War and seasoned with a character enhancement system that distantly resembles that of Infinity Blade. Difficult to see something new in the playful horizon of Wild Blood: progress is marked by continuous fights with enemies, occasionally interspersed with trivial puzzles, sections in command of fixed positions and the collection of gold and objects left by corpses or chests scattered in around Albion. A classic setting that unfortunately does not find comfort in a completely adequate control system: Lancelot's movements via the virtual analog stick appear not very reactive, as well as the basic functions (attack, special shot and dodge) delegated to the on-screen keys arranged on the right side of the display. Add to this a rough handling of the camera to say the least, with the view that never manages to follow the action well and constantly requires to be adjusted through manual touches, and it is clear how Wild Blood doesn't start off exactly on the right foot. The considerable amount of content inserted by Gameloft within the product intervenes to put a piece of it: beyond the good duration of the campaign (which can be completed in just under ten hours), the versatility of Lancelot in using three different types of weapons - broadsword, double axes and bow - with a relative set of moves for each of them, as well as the wide range of skills to buy and upgrade by spending the gold collected during the adventure. Too bad that these excellent intuitions end up getting lost in a game action that is too trivial and repetitive to be able to excite, penalized by a flat and monotonous level design and by enemies who go fishing among the most abused styles of the genre. Again, it seems that the developers have preferred quantity to quality, combining the already substantial single player component with an online multiplayer mode that seems to have been thrown into the pile just to make up the numbers, considering how confusing and not very fun it is. In the end, Wild Blood turns out to be what was feared since its announcement, or a product that finds reason to exist almost exclusively as a function of its sumptuous graphic creation. From this point of view, we can only commend the work of Gameloft, capable of exploiting the Unreal Engine in an excellent way, offering vast and detailed scenarios to the eye, covered with defined textures and embellished with truly excellent light effects, all while managing to maintain an absolutely stable frame rate: it's not a work without flaws (the polygonal models of the characters are a bit angular and the animations not exciting), but it's really hard not to be fascinated by the cosmetics of the product, especially if displayed on the latest model of iPad.", "date": "2012-09-12", "grade": "6.5"}
