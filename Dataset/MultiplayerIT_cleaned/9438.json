The magic formula that marked the success of Angry Birds seems to recur almost unchanged in Tiny Wings, despite the fact that the German developer Andreas Illiger seems to have referred more to Solipskier than to Rovio's goose that lays the golden eggs. What then, needless to do it on purpose, we always talk about birds. The protagonist of the game is in fact a small bird born unfortunately with too small wings, but who managed to find an alternative way to realize his greatest dream: being able to fly, touch the sky and follow the sun by flying over islands and seas. Volaareee, oooh Let's face it: the formula ~run as far as you can and overcome obstacles~ is now widely cleared in arcade games for iPhone and iPod Touch, and most of the time we are faced with simple clones of Canabalt. However, Tiny Wings manages to be original thanks to a mechanic based on the pressure of a single finger, but which has little to do with Adam Saltsman's game. Given its handicap, the main bird's only way to fly is to slide down the hills and use the bumps in front of it as if they were ramps; once in the air, just hold your finger down on the touchscreen to weigh down and dive, and then let go just before tackling a jump. The result is obviously a game in which the player's coordination is essential: to maintain one's speed it is necessary to fall on the downhill side, and tapping the touchscreen at the wrong time risks causing the feathered alter-ego to get bogged down on a hill for several seconds . In Tiny Wings you can't waste time, since the sun sets faster and faster: so you have to jump quickly from one island to another, avoiding stopping so as not to fall into a deep lethargy once the night has come. It is an idea that is clearly inspired by the unknown indie game Wavespark, but which Illiger has managed to enrich thanks to some well-chosen ideas and an audiovisual realization with an indisputable charisma. And it is precisely the aesthetic taste of the German developer that makes the difference: after all, the graphics of Tiny Wings are simple, but thanks to the care in the color combinations, the pleasant artistic filters and goodies such as the parallax backdrops or the leaves for aria manages to offer a very rare visual experience in games on the App Store. Not to mention the menus, the chosen font or the tutorial illustrations, where nothing is ever left to chance, so much so that you hardly notice the lack of support for Retina Display. The music is pleasant, catchy and relaxing, but it's the sound effects that draw a line in the sand, with the little bird's exclamations, squeals and cries exuding an infectious sense of joy. The shape of the hills, moreover, is generated in a procedural way, as are the colors of the various islands, offering each time a game that is never the same as the previous one. Unexpectedly, the achievements integrated with OpenFeint represent an equally interesting, functional and never predictable element. From time to time, three different objectives are offered to the player to complete, the completion of which rewards him with a new and flashy nest for the feathered protagonist: this little gadget does nothing but add an ever-increasing multiplier to the score, proving to be essential if you want to hunt for records. The user is thus encouraged to play in an alternative way to unlock all the objectives and obtain the best nest, although a future addition of new nests, and therefore higher multipliers, could frustrate the efforts of the players who, today, have sweated seven shirts to reach the top of the standings. The achievements are still quite fun and original: one of these challenges you to play a game with the iPhone facing upside down, while another requires you to touch the clouds a certain number of times. However, the lack of additional modes or alternative options with which to pass the time takes care of clipping Tiny Wings' wings and not allowing him to fly as high as Angry Birds; like Canabalt, the game offers a very pleasant pill experience, perfect for passing the time but lacking in terms of the amount of content offered.
