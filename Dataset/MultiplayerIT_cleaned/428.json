{"name": "Metal Gear Acid 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-gear-acid-2.html", "text": "Snake, is that you? The story of Metal Gear Acid 2 distances itself considerably from that of the chapters on the home console, effectively creating a parallel universe that also involves the characterization of the characters. The most obvious case is undoubtedly Snake himself, outlined with a rather distant personality from the one we are used to knowing; too talkative, a little naive and strangely sentimental, in our view at the end of the day it has very little to do with the tormented and gloomy hero who has gathered fans all over the world. This aspect is undoubtedly linked to the ~comic-book~ style adopted by the programmers, which is reflected both in the aesthetic component and in the plot; the latter sees Snake, recovering from amnesia, forced to infiltrate the Saint Logic Inc. complex to steal files and thus save the lives of a group of his friends. Soon, however, it will be discovered that the real goal lies in blocking the plan of a mad scientist, intent on using a Metal Gear to launch a nuclear attack. The unfolding of the events proceeds in a rather flat manner and without major twists, revealing itself - we repeat - extremely different from the canons to which the unattainable Kojima has accustomed us; in this case it seems to be faced with a sweetened and trivialized version of the franchise, and not in the ~real~ world of Metal Gear. Unfortunately, everything suffers the weight of the absence of dubbing, an integral part of the atmosphere and characterization of the characters; Acid 2 relies solely on text, and often appears overly wordy and long-winded. The picture of the sound closes in a negative way due to a soundtrack far from the majesty of the productions of Harry Gregson-Williams, instead relying on anonymous and not very appropriate techno songs. From a technical point of view, as already announced, the Konami production relies on a comic style abandoning the classic realistic one which was also adopted in the first Acid. All this through the use of the ex-fashionista and now decidedly less popular cel-shading, accompanied by a particularly bright if not, to stay on topic, acidic color palette. A pleasant result in some respects (the settings), less so in others, such as the polygonal model of Snake which appears a bit stocky and not too graceful, an expression of a character design that is not exactly the best of life. All in all, however, Metal Gear Acid 2 finds one of its greatest strengths in the aesthetic aspect, original to the right point and functional to the gameplay. The snake plays cards The game mechanics largely follow that of the first episode, albeit with some substantial changes and improvements. Everything basically revolves around a deck of cards available; each single card (apart from rare exceptions) can be used to perform the action represented in it, or converted into movements to move the protagonist on the square grid. Since it is a turn-based strategy, the actions must be managed carefully on the basis of the available action points, as in the best tradition of the genre. While starting with a rather basic and limited deck of cards, as the adventure continues it is possible to spend the points accumulated thanks to the successful completion of the missions in the purchase of other cards, or entire sets. As if that weren't enough, the same points can be used to ~boost~ the individual cards, increasing their effectiveness and potential but also the price to pay to activate them. In reality, the upgrade system is not entirely convincing, since it is a bit cumbersome and not very immediate. Even the management of the deck itself, once the number of cards starts to get substantial, becomes demanding to the point of often preferring the option for the automatic creation of one's own deck. Compared to the first chapter, the management of the direction of the character has been made more streamlined once the movement is completed, which can be changed for free as well as the standing, stretched out or crouched position. New and equally not linked to the expenditure of action points is the possibility of hitting enemies via CQC, to temporarily stun them and thus be able to escape from intricate situations; as in all the games in the series, as far as possible it is always preferable to go unnoticed, giving vent to all the stealth skills learned over the years and chapters on living room consoles. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is not particularly refined, since they rely on rather basic patterns and respond to the player's actions almost always limiting themselves to attacking him head-on; moreover, as per traditionnor, even after being hit, they find nothing better to do than return to their normal tasks in case the search for the infiltrator is unsuccessful. Among the most interesting innovations, the greater variety of mission objectives must also certainly be mentioned; in addition to having to eliminate the enemies present in the levels, it may in fact be required to activate devices, open grates, doors and gates, or interact with computers and so on. The presence of a second usable character, on which we prefer not to dwell so as not to spoil the surprise, also adds an extra pinch of salt to the overall package. Without a doubt the greatest oddity of Acid 2 lies in the presence of a mode called Solid Eye which, through the use of a pair of 3D glasses contained in the package, allows you to enjoy the game and the movies (taken from MGS3 and beyond) in a pseudo-three-dimensional version that is so old-fashioned and, above all, quickly creates devastating headaches. There is also a multiplayer section, actually not particularly attractive, together with Arena mode in which it is possible to fight with a series of bosses to obtain rare cards. Comment Metal Gear Acid 2 is a sequel that limits itself to polishing and correcting some aspects of the predecessor, without however distorting a game mechanic destined to divide lovers and detractors quite clearly. However, we cannot help but think that the turn-based strategy formula often and willingly appears limited by the management of a single character, making everything less profound and satisfying than what a sometimes forced complexity of the game structure might suggest. Although care is also evident in the creation of the product as a whole, it is impossible to deny how Konami production is far from the majesty of the main series, appearing on the contrary as a simplistic and sweetened ~interpretation~ of the background studied by Kojima. All in all, therefore, Acid 2 is a valid title, but one that is simply based on foundations that are not brilliant enough to leave a mark on the PSP play offer. Pros Pleasant new graphic style Fairly stimulating Good improvements over the predecessor Cons Limited management of one character Poor artificial intelligence Does not fully reflect the feeling of the series When Konami first announced that an exclusive episode of the Metal Gear series was in development for PSP, owners of the Sony portable console couldn't help but feel a sinking heart, daydreaming of a new mission from the legendary Snake that adapted to the potential of the handheld and perhaps revealed new aspects of the intricate and exciting story imagined by Kojima. However, the initial enthusiasm was destined to decrease considerably once the real nature of the product in question was discovered, entitled Metal Gear Acid, which used the universe of the main series, however, shaping it around a turn-based strategy game mechanics based on cards. A courageous choice, which however did not finally succeed in fully convincing; despite a less than exciting debut, Konami has decided to focus again on the franchise, producing a second episode which is arriving on European soil these days.", "date": "2006-06-23", "grade": null}
