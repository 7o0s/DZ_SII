{"name": "Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/age-of-empires-iii-the-warchiefs-recensione.html", "text": "The buffaloes are on the move The expansion brings some new features to the original title, without upsetting its contents. Newly introduced civilizations share numerous buildings, units, and powers. Iroquois and Sioux tribes have a tribal council rather than a home city. One of the main novelties introduced among the natives is represented by the special ~bonfire~ structure. Around the bonfire, the inhabitants can gather and dance to obtain precious bonuses, which can be earned through the joint prayer of the population gathered around the fire. Depending on the type of dance selected by the player, the tribe will receive particular benefits. Some dances affect the production of resources and the speed of extraction, others on the production speed of units, still others generate special warriors. The Natives also have the ~Stealth~ ability that can make some units invisible to most enemies. Another very useful skill is the one that allows you to exploit the animals guarding the treasures as your own units, this skill is called ~Friendship with nature~. Let's examine what's new In terms of enriching the offer of the original title, this expansion boasts the addition of 6 new maps: the Northwest Territories, California, the Painted Desert, Araucaria, Orinino and the Andes. The main addition to European civilizations is represented by the Saloon, a building that allows you to recruit deadly mercenaries to deploy among your ranks. The Native Embassy instead allows you to directly train the units of the allied native populations, without having to resort to the Trading Post expedient as was the case in the original title. Among the special units that can be recruited at the Saloon are the Fucilieri (light infantry units with muskets), the Helmets (Italian leaders, heavy cavalry units), the Ninjas (mercenary spies, with powerful and silent attacks) and the small Bombarda (unit of heavy horse-drawn artillery). among the new options for European civilizations is the Revolution. Once you reach the fourth era (the Imperial one) you can choose to give up the final stage of evolution to attempt a revolution Let's examine what's new Among the new options for European civilizations is the Revolution. Once you reach the fourth era (the Imperial one) you can choose to give up the final stage of evolution to attempt a revolution. This solution allows you to have a significant military boost, converting all civilian units into militia, but severely limits technological development, practically constituting an excellent weapon to unleash in a single massive attack. However, the revolutionary choice hardly leaves room for a second attempt, since after the first powerful attack the technological gap with the imperial enemies would be devastating. The Revolution also converts the cards of the mother city deck into only four cards to be used for the decisive attack: Gatling Cannon (powerful progenitor of the machine gun), Colonial Militia (the production of inhabitants of the city center converts into militia recruitment, producing very combative units), Battleship (mighty warship) and Strong Tank (mobile unit that allows the construction of fortresses). The single player campaign features 15 missions and continues the story already started with the original title. The story of the Black family continues. Two new generations will be confronted in the final conquest of the new world. Nathaniel Black son of a native mother and a European father and his nephew Chayton Black, will be the protagonists of this campaign. The European forces also move against the background of a story based on the figures of these fascinating characters. Colonel Kuechler represents the strong and authoritarian Hessian power on American soil, General George Washington and General Custer are instead called to represent two of the most complex and exciting historical periods of the first century of life of the United States of America. Conclusions In essence, the expansion fully fulfills its duty by giving greater depth to the original title and deepening the aspect of the Native Americans, which was, without a shadow of a doubt, fundamental in that particular historical juncture. While not altering the gameplay (and this is what one hopes from an expansion) the new title guarantees greater longevity and greater depth, adding numerous new units and strategic aspects (the Saloon and the Revolution above all) capable of mixing up the cards and to re-propose new game schemes, also in terms of multiplayer games. The online community will in fact have to deal with the new features and study new winning strategiesthan in the light of the important innovations introduced.

A custom The release of an expansion is now a consolidated custom of the Age of Empires saga since the first title. The appointment could not skip with Age of Empires III, and punctual as a Swiss watch, after exactly one year the expansion peeps out on the market. Completely localized in Italian, the new title (which requires the presence of a copy of the main title to be executed) is inspired by the events of the conquest of the new world, already faced in Age of Empires III, to focus on the life of the natives of America in the tumultuous years of the conquest of their territories by the Europeans. to the numerous factions already present in the original title are added those of the three main native powers, with the civilizations of the Iroquesi, the Sioux and the Aztecs To the numerous factions already present in the original title are added those of the three main native powers, with the civilizations of the Iroquesi, the Sioux and the Aztecs. In truth, these three populations were already present in the first title, playing the role of supporting characters in the main story. The expansion allows you to experience the game with these three new populations, expanding their possibilities up to equating them to the other populations already present, with the possibility of building their own settlements, cities and having their own army at their disposal. In order not to leave a gap in the row of supporting actors, these three populations are replaced by three further supporting populations, introduced for the occasion (in the role of supporting actors, the Huron replace the Iroquois, the Cheyenne, the Sioux, the Zapotecs and the Aztecs). In addition, four new minor tribes have been added (for a total of 16, compared to 12 in the original game): the Klamath, the Apache, the Navajo and the Mapuche.", "date": "2006-12-15", "grade": null}
