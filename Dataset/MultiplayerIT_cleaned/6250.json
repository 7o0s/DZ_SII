It is an unusual choice, but let's start from the audio sector as the music and themes of each feature film will be an integral part of the gaming experience, unfolding throughout the narrative arc of the four films revisited in the light-hearted key of TT Games productions. If precisely the sound sector stands out for its artistic quality, underlining each scene with the same intensity as the films, a note must also be struck regarding the dubbing. And it's out of tune. The voice actors of all four stories are very high profile and in the case of Jurassic World even the same as the film you find at the cinema, but inexplicably they do a mediocre job. In their partial defense we say that they may not have had any animated scenes in front of them, only an audio track to be replaced with their voice, but the fact remains that the result is not pleasant at all. Not only are they unable to point out the twists and turns, but trivially also any other dialogue seems taken out of context to the point of cutting off some of the irony of many sequences. Rather, lovers of the brand created by Steven Spielberg will be happy to know that the original scripts have been faithfully reproduced, albeit with some slight changes and by reducing superfluous parts. Instead, it is necessary to congratulate the developers for the extreme refinement of the narration and for the comedy, capable of drawing a smile on the mouths of players and spectators. In at least three of the four films proposed, we leave it to you to find out which ones, the plots seem successful to the point of being better than their cinematic counterparts. LEGO Jurassic World allows us to go through the four films with a renewed ironic verve No expense spared here It seems that John Hammond, deus ex machina of Jurassic Park in the narrative universe of the series, has also done things big for the graphics engine. It's not the first time we've seen the latest version of TT Games software in a LEGO title, but in this case it seems really perfect to give prestige to a game we tested directly on PlayStation 4. The reproduction of the environment, which blends a tip of ~realism~ with the distinctive animations of the characters, gives the impression of being in the presence of a diorama built with a box of the popular toy. The water gushes as if it were in front of the eyes, giving the idea that it flows naturally, and the models, shaders and textures of plants, mud and the rich fauna of the islands we cross are also very accurate. The bricks and models that act as an interactive scenario reflect the light, giving the surfaces a deliberately plastic appearance. Punching each object, observing it disintegrate into the pieces that constitute it, is not only a requirement to continue the plot but becomes part of the fun. As well as a fundamental appendix to access side missions or hidden areas. The exotic beauty of these places has the power to enchant but can hide pitfalls, in this case in the form of simple bugs. We repeatedly got stuck in some areas of the scenario, without our counterpart being able to move anymore and with the obligation to reload from a previous checkpoint. Nothing too frustrating since you will reach a checkpoint every ten minutes or so, but there are not a few ~quicksands~ with no way out that we have stumbled upon. And statistically we imagine there may be others in which to end up trapped. TT Games is aimed at children, young people and families gathered in front of the TV, and this must be taken into consideration to frame a gameplay that as usual will not tantalize those looking for complex, extreme challenges. You never die, but if this should happen due to a fall on deaf ears or for having received too many blows, you break down and reassemble instantly, returning immediately to the scene. Playstation 4 trophies LEGO Jurassic World includes 50 trophies, which are actually quite simple to collect. In addition to those related to the story, you will have to return to places already visited as the other characters, to complete the remaining challenges or access initially inaccessible places. Isla Sorna vs. Isla Nublar The portion of the game that follows the plot of the blockbusters has a duration slightly longer than that of the films themselves, for a total, if played at breakneck speed, of about ten hours, scarce to be able to say that the various chapters have been completed. After the prologue we find ourselves aboard the well-known helicopter that takes us to Isla Nublar. Once landed we have thepossibility of taking two different directions. If we go right we get on the monorail which takes us to experience Jurassic World, direction immediately unlocked. It is obvious that, if you have not yet seen the last chapter in the cinema, until you have seen the film you should avoid getting on the train, because all the main events are reported in detail. Those who take the road to the left instead find themselves retracing the classic trilogy, the chapters of which can be unlocked in sequence. The puzzles and situations useful to get out of the tangled events in which you are entangled are almost always solved in the same way, just with a little shuffling of the cards to give a minimum sense of variety. But don't expect anything completely new. After the playful clichs present in the first feature film, you will know exactly what to do in all the others too. You control one character at a time, chosen from a range of possibilities among those who are experiencing a given scene. Each has some unique quirks that allow the team to emerge unscathed from a seemingly hopeless situation. Once a level is completed, we have the opportunity to replay it with other protagonists not strictly related to the chapter in question, in order to access areas otherwise impossible to reach, complete the collection of bonus items and even enjoy some races aboard the vehicles offered by the park , in challenges against time. In short, everything as usual, but it seems to never stop entertaining.", "date": "2015-06-23", "grade": "8.0"}
