{"name": "Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/untold-legends-the-warriors-code.html", "text": "Nothing new about the western dungeon The Warrior's Code actually distances itself from some of the less successful elements of the first episode, starting with the plot that forms the backdrop to the action, no longer relegated to the role of thin glue between one mission and another. However, this is not enough to make the storyline of the SOE product a masterpiece of originality and complexity, on the contrary: everything revolves around the classic figure of an outcast protagonist who decides to fight against an evil empire, but at least there has been an improvement in this sense . The aforementioned hero can initially be selected by the user from a list of five different characters (after all always attributable to the warrior-ranger-magician categories and variants of the case), customizable by name and for some details such as color skin tone or hair style. Slightly more elaborate in terms of style, The Warrior's Code is also more elaborate in terms of the technical sector, starting with a cosmetic that is undoubtedly among the strengths of the SOE product. Framed from an isometric view (unfortunately not rotatable at will), the graphics of the title show off fairly complex and convincingly animated polygonal models, enriching everything with lighting effects at the height and a finally richer level design. This is mainly thanks to the abandonment of the formula of randomly generated dungeons, which made the playful structure of a product objectively boring which, due to the inherent characteristics of the genre, already tends to become repetitive in itself. In fact, even The Warrior's Code, even with all the improvements listed so far, does not differ much from the prequel in this sense: the action of the SOE title is resolved for the most part in a frenetic button smashing of the X key, delegate attacking with the primary weapon. Amusing at first, the play structure of the game reaches a threshold of excessive repetitiveness far too ahead of its time, and provided you are not a real fan of the genre, the opportunity to abandon The Warrior's Code after even just a couple of levels is far from remote... Gray code The major criticism that should be addressed to The Warrior's Code concerns the almost total inefficiency in the application of new features that could potentially have enriched the gameplay of the SOE product. Starting with the variety of attacks made available to the protagonist, uncomfortable or accessories to the point of setting them aside in favor of the basic saber. Therefore, the availability of long-range weapons is rendered essentially useless by a camera that is very close to the action and which prevents you from hitting enemies from afar. Again, the chances of making charged and opportunity attacks (which allow you to inflict additional damage to opponents caught off guard) offer far too slight advantages compared to the button smashing we talked about earlier. The only exceptions to the rule are represented by the various spells that can be unlocked with level-ups and by an unprecedented feature that allows the temporary transformation into a very powerful beast when the indicator of essences collected from defeated enemies is filled. But they are too fleeting variations of a really limited and repetitive play mechanic, which finds a minimum of respite thanks to the multiplayer modes of the SOE product, which can be used both locally and via the internet. These are divided between a battle section for up to four players (consisting of deathmatch, capture the flag, last man standing and team variants) and an interesting co-op option to tackle the stages in the company of a friend. Although the latter is by far the most attractive, the other part of the multiplayer still performs its duty worthily, if only as a small antidote to the story mode routine. That same routine that ultimately ends up condemning The Warrior's Code to a barely sufficient evaluation. Comment Although improved in certain elements compared to its predecessor, Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code remains a substantially anonymous action rpg, both in style and in play structure. Anyone with a minimum of such experience will have no trouble recognizing in the SOE product a whole series of limits and clichs typical of the sector, highlighted in this case by a gameplay capable of offering very few acute notes. With few distinctive elements - moreover often poorly implemented - The Warrior's Code ends up being a truly suitable choice only for those who desperately need a bit of portable RPG action. Pros Good technical realization Convincing online modes Some improvements over the prequel Cons Excessive gameplayvery monotonous and repetitive Almost no original elements Several poorly implemented features The first action-rpg to see the light on PSP, the original Untold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade certainly didn't know how to make the most of its natural leadership in the sector: characterized by a rather bland style, a practically absent storyline and monotonous dungeons randomly generated, the SOE product did not appear convincing, ultimately proving to be attractive only to true fans of the genre. Now, the same development team tries again with a sequel, entitled The Warrior's Code, which promises to have learned from the mistakes of its predecessor: let's see if it's true...", "date": "2006-07-28", "grade": null}
