{"name": "Neutron-X", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/neutron-x_a.html", "text": "Discovered in the early 1930s by the English physicist James Chadwick, the neutron is a subatomic particle with no electric charge, which together with the proton (of almost identical mass) forms the nucleus of the atom. It is an element that cannot live its own life and which, taken individually, decays within a few minutes, which together with the lack of charge has made it really difficult to identify. HeroCraft's new puzzle game does not provide us with scientific details on what the neutron is and what its characteristics are, in any case, but limits itself to offering us thirty stages in which we will have to exploit the balance between neutrons and protons to make all the nuclei explode atomic. The rules of the game are simple: in each stage we will have a limited number of neutrons (visible in the lower part of the screen, on the right) to ~shoot~, and depending on the square hit we will obtain a different effect. In fact, launched towards an empty box, our neutron will form a third-level nucleus, which therefore needs two ~solicitations~ to explode. Thrown at an existing core, on the other hand, it will detonate it or lower its level. It is therefore necessary to keep in mind the configuration of the nuclei on the board, to understand where to strike and with how many neutrons. The explosion of a nucleus projects the same number of neutrons in the four cardinal directions, which in turn can hit nuclei and thus trigger a real chain reaction. It is possible to solve the stages by spending all one's neutrons, perhaps in an inelegant way, or to find the perfect strategy every time, the one that does not waste anything and allows us to obtain the maximum possible score. The levels are unlocked as we complete them, for a total (as already mentioned) of thirty small puzzles that can take a few minutes or much longer. The game offers the possibility to undo the last move using the left function key, even if it is a questionable feature: given the small number of possible actions, it is often better to restart the stage directly to look at things from another angle. The controls are very simple and are based mainly on the d-pad for moving the pointer and on the 5 key for launching neutrons. As per tradition for the genre, the technical realization of Neutron-X does not cry out for a miracle or use cutting-edge graphic solutions. We have the scoreboard, always the same, and an interface that is at least legible and well organized. The core sprites do have some animation and the ~explosion~ effect looks well done, but it's all about the action, nothing more. A similar argument can be made for the sound sector, made up of not very incisive MIDI music without an independent volume control: deactivating them will not weigh you down at all, on the contrary. PRO Good number of internships Appetizing for fans of the genre Simple and immediate AGAINST Very poor and repetitive graphics Mediocre music Very limited, sometimes frustrating", "date": "2009-03-18", "grade": "S.V."}
