Often there is not even the gameplay in the strict sense to be evaluated, given that we are limited to reading texts illustrated by some accompanying images that try to render the emotional states told in different ways. Sometimes you want to bring out a little of Cesare Segre in us and start doing literary criticism, but then we realize that it would be inappropriate in a similar context and we limit ourselves to trying to make you understand what you are forehead and because we have expressed a certain qualitative judgment. The problem arises again with each new review, between us not only of visual novels, that is when we become aware of the fact that the classic formulas with which we compose the articles could be inadequate to make what we find ourselves trying. For example, describing eden* we should talk about a visual novel in which you read well-written dialogues that can be scrolled automatically or by pressing a key. The rest falls within the chaotic search for a false objectivity in the universe of the subjective, i.e. trying to quantify the unquantifiable. Reading eden* we tried to imagine ourselves younger and less disenchanted, looking for stories that could give us something more than easy entertainment, bones that could become part of our lives, accompanying us as a vivid experience for the rest of our days. It's a beautiful dream that art can teach us about life, or that it can even be an alternative to it, especially when we find ourselves within those consolations that are missing in reality. One of the greatest difficulties of every human being is imagining himself at an age that is not his own. We have memories of what we have been and perspectives of what we would like to be, but it is difficult to push a memory beyond that very thick barrier that separates it from life. The adult version The version of eden* that can be purchased on Steam is the one for all ages, i.e. from which the erotic scenes have been cut or censored. Going to the official website of the western publisher, MangaGamer, it is possible to purchase the version with adult content, called eden* PLUS, which includes nudes and sex scenes. Unlike other visual novels, in eden* the version for all ages does not pay much for the cuts made, so it is still very enjoyable, even if in certain situations it is quite clear where the dialogues are going (in bed, let's say so) . Compare Now, apart from the beautiful drawings of the minor studio, more female than male, and apart from the equally beautiful soundtrack, we tried to imagine ourselves as teenagers in front of this splendid love story lived on the brink of an imminent apocalypse that will wipe out the entire planet Earth. It wasn't a harmless exercise, because if the point of arrival is the same, changing the starting point has changed the entire route taken. By placing eden* alongside any other visual novel with mediocre content compared to its target audience, its quality is understood (for example Sakura Spirits will do just fine). The idea of subjectivity is misleading because many do not see the limit of the difficulty of expressing those variations that we have all inevitably experienced. If we take an average visual novel with the usual characters living out their school dramas by haggling their feelings through choice phone calls, and we don't read it from a who-should-recipient perspective, we can't actually determine how eden's story and characters are different, with their dramas of modular scope that touch on more universal problems, despite remaining anchored to a certain reference target. For a forty-year-old, the judgment on the game can only arise from an evaluation of the more technical and ephemeral aspects of the entire work, because it risks being impermeable to the deeper ones, which now only affect him tangentially. The old reviewer would limit himself to applying a trade to a material much more alive than it appears, in which eroticism and the restlessness of change are masterfully mixed and are not limited to proposing trivial solutions as done elsewhere. This is to make you understand that even if the visual novel is a genre with very limited mechanics, it is still possible to find in it a depth that goes beyond that of productions with a much more complex gameplay. Just rely on those who can tell a story, instead of being the standard-bearer of a genre at all costs. In short, buy Eden* and you won't regret it, because it ista of one of the best visual novels recently translated into a western language. We have reviewed eden*, a really interesting visual novel.
