Literally biting the asphalt or the dirt road, paying no attention to track marshals, regulations or flags: this is the spirit that distinguishes lovers of extreme racing games, and this is essentially what Uber Racer 3D offers. Escape for oil Despite the innumerable variations present for all platforms, obviously including the App Store, the charm of a violent and ~rude~ race at the right point finds a more than deserved outlet in the title developed by the guys from Mad Processors Games, thanks above all to the simplicity and immediacy with which it is possible to immediately master the vehicles supplied. Obviously, like any good self-respecting driving game, at the beginning the cars available are rather slow and awkward but, thanks to the accumulated victories, it is possible to start a painstaking upgrade work on your vehicle (according to the classic parameters related to speed , acceleration, handling and resistance) or aim to save money for the purchase of new cars, which will become available as the story progresses. In fact, the Career mode represents the main fulcrum of the gameplay: structured with daily races selected from a calendar, it is made up of 31 days, during which different types of events will often overlap (normal, timed, elimination races). Reaching the podium is a necessary but not sufficient condition for accessing the subsequent sections and unlocking new content: what really matters is in fact the oil won, the only commodity of real value in a now devastated world and a uniform unit of measurement to indicate the number of victories and the level reached. Oil is also the indispensable currency for the purchase of upgrades or new machines and the quantity obtained depends directly on the placement: as a consequence, it is essential to win many races to have more purchasing power, often making it necessary to repeat them several times, until the achievement of the coveted gold trophy. From the point of view of behavior on the road, the cars of Uber Racer 3D generally maneuver in a credible way, respecting the common laws of physics; occasionally, however, especially in the presence of even small irregular ramps, the vehicles seem to take less probable trajectories, too stiff or, on the contrary, with excessively marked rebounds. Of course, by its very nature from a racing game of this type one certainly does not expect meticulous simulative behavior, however even playing with the spirit predisposed to the ~MotorStorm~ (to cite perhaps the most famous exponent of the category as well as an undeniable source of inspiration), it is clear that some flaws are certainly present, even if not such as to undermine the playability and fun at the base. The tracks are characterized by various settings always with an apocalyptic theme (deserts, ruined cities, dry tankers, etc.), with alternative routes and hidden shortcuts, able to favor the lap time compared to the normal trajectory also indicated by the indicators (if activated ); the car models are then well made, with clear references to the Steam Punk style and a color palette tending towards rusty brown, perfectly indicated given the decadence that distinguishes the game setting. The controls are precise and promptly respond to solicitations, both using the accelerometers and the more orthodox touch arrows (even if for non-~pianist~ thumbs they turn out to be slightly small), while technically speaking the work done is truly remarkable, above all thanks to the beautiful plays of light and shadow and the textures are generally of good quality. Too bad only for the excessive popup effect, really annoying as well as objectively not very justified: if it is true that the graphics engine is certainly of good quality, the environments, also due to the context chosen, are certainly not rich in side elements such as burden the entire game engine in such a serious way. A few notes instead go to the sound effects, in particular to the roar of the engines: although the developers boast of having collected real samples from different types of engines, the result obtained is unfortunately an unpleasant sound and not close to the good promised. Last note of merit finally to the support of Game Center, with unlockable achievements and online rankings without a real multiplayer locally or via the internet, not yet implemented but certainly desirable.
