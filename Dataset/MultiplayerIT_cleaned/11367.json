From Silent Hill to Resident Evil, including Alone in the Dark, their work and the passion instilled in the project have attracted attention to independent Chilean productions. The result is a game that is certainly imperfect from a technical point of view, in particular in the game videos, but no less worthy because what it succeeds in brilliantly is precisely the key aspect of survival horror: the atmosphere, dictated by very well-kept settings touching on genre clichs, and puzzles. It's been a while since we stopped to think about how to proceed, both in terms of what to do at a given moment and in solving a puzzle itself, and this made the approximately ten total hours of gameplay very engaging. The monster design itself is interesting, with aberrations of various kinds that cause problems not only due to their nature, but also due to the environment in which they find themselves, but we will elaborate on this aspect later. They are creatures that swing between Resident Evil and Silent Hill as inspirations, leaning more towards the latter at times. Before moving on to the actual review, a couple of specifics: the developers recently updated the game to implement one-button map view instead of selecting it in the inventory and they illuminated the area where the protagonist is ( feature absent when we played it); moreover, if you are curious to play it, but English is too tight for you, it has been announced that the Italian localization will be added upon request and thanks to the support of the publisher PQube. There is no exact date yet, but it will arrive. So let's discover this interesting horror in the review of Tormented Souls in the PC version. The Horrors of Wilberger Hospital Tormented Souls, Wildberger Hospital offers creepy sceneries and atmosphere The story opens with the protagonist, Caroline Walker, who receives a mysterious letter from Wildberger Hospital signed by John Doe: inside she finds a photo of two little girls. Looking at her, she is seized with a twinge in the head and the not too veiled threat that accompanies the photograph does not reassure Caroline. From that moment and for the following weeks, the girl will continue to suffer from insomnia or nightmares, until at a certain point she decides to cut the matter and visit the Wildberger Hospital. At night, as always happens when you want to deal with a potential threat. In truth, the time of day wouldn't have made a difference, for Caroline is stunned once she enters, and when she comes to, naked in a bathtub hooked up to strange machinery, she finds that her eye has been taken out. Who attacked her and why is not known but the priority at the moment is to leave the hospital (which, in a clear homage to Resident Evil, is located inside a majestic villa): noble intentions but not easy to apply , both because Caroline still wants to get to the bottom of the story to get rid of her nightmares, and because the building suddenly comes alive with nightmare creatures intending to kill us. From this moment begins our night of horror, in a development of events that touches on various clichs of the genre, but still manages to make itself interesting in its plot, also motivating us to look for documents, thanks to which we can shed more light on events that have roots much deeper than you think. The ending itself, Tormented Souls having multiple conclusions based on some of our decisions, although I hesitated a bit, still manages to come full circle and give all the answers we were looking for. In this it is more Silent Hill than Resident Evil, even for several narrative aspects that we will not talk about. Mentioning these two cornerstones of horror, we specify, is not for an unfair comparison, considering the abyss that separates Capcom and Konami from Dual Effect in terms of budget and workforce, but to give a concrete example and easily reconnectable to the clear sources of inspiration that have allowed this Tormented Souls to take shape. Old school but with a twist Tormented Souls, one of the creatures that haunt the hospital As a good old 90s inspired survival horror, Tormented Souls has most of the staples of the genre: typical settings like hospital, sewers, graveyard and dungeon complexes of sorts, fixed camera, andpuzzles, many of which bizarre enough to refer us to the effort made to overcome certain sections of past video games, a disturbing atmosphere that plays on the soundtrack and ambient sounds, often confined spaces in which to fight, resources that are not too scarce but not even within reach - provided not explore every corner really well. In this, she fully captures the essence of the period to which she refers, however the developers have taken the liberty of softening some rigidities of time: Caroline can move at three hundred and sixty degrees, without the so-called ~string~ tank control~, and during combat is able to make a small leap back to escape enemy attacks. She's not a foolproof move, but she can still prove to be a lifesaver in a critical situation. Also, beyond the automatic targeting of the enemy when he is in range, Caroline will lower his aim in case he is shorter than normal or we have wounded him enough to knock him down without killing him yet. As far as exploration and puzzles are concerned, the puzzle solving screen borrows from point-and-click, allowing you to select and even manipulate objects without constantly exiting and re-entering the puzzle itself: a small improvement, but one that significantly improves the quality of the life of a game that, we won't repeat it enough, has the 90s as its main source of inspiration. Exploration and puzzles Tormented Souls offers a very satisfying variety of puzzles Tormented Souls, we anticipated it, focuses heavily on puzzles and the way they are constructed, succeeding in making us think to understand which direction to take or how to solve a particular puzzle. They are undoubtedly the most successful elements of the entire production and, despite having small suggestions on how to solve them, they still remain cryptic enough to make us set the gray matter in motion. They can be of various kinds, from codes and passwords to keys to be changed according to the door to be opened, up to games of logic or knobs to be turned in the right order. In short, the developers have drawn from a large pool of possibilities and implemented them logically within the game. All accompanied by some occasional journey into the ~parallel world~, that is a distorted reality, but hand-in-hand with what we are experiencing, to the point that actions carried out within it have repercussions in the real world. There is no real abuse of this mechanic, which we will find dotted here and there and forms the basis for solving some puzzles. Very appreciable as a whole, especially since it's not always obvious when to use it. As for exploration, backtracking is king. You will move from one area to another of the villa so often, visiting and revisiting them, that you may end up no longer needing the map to move - a map which at the beginning proves to be essential for identifying paths that perhaps escape the eye, or simply find the connections between the various rooms. Above all, it is said that an object found at the beginning of the game should be used shortly thereafter: without spoilers, after the part that had been included in the demo and arrived in the atrium we found nitric acid shortly thereafter , which only proved to be useful halfway through the experience (not to mention the lock). Tormented Souls takes the right amount of time to build the puzzles and doesn't make everything as immediate as it may seem. Clues on how to proceed are often hidden in the documents, so exploration is essential as is a careful reading of them. Tormented Souls, the inventory is divided into convenient sections The inventory is not limited and is, above all, divided into comfortable sections: objects, where all the elements to continue the game are kept; resources, in which we find weapons, a lighter (main source of light), ammunition, treatments and tapes to save the game; files, where instead the collected documents are collected, in turn divided by type. This makes everything more manageable, without taking anything away from the survival horror experience: the ammunition remains well dosed and the weapons, above all, we have to unlock them personally. The only ones that are given to us by default are the nail gun and the crowbar (useful for finishing off the enemies on the ground avoiding wasting shots), the rest is to be gained by thoroughly exploring the villa and we assure you that, despite being weapons valid, nail gun and crowbar by themselves will get you nowhere. Combat and gunplay Tormented Souls, Caroline has a way to defend herself from the aberrations that haunt the hospital As you may have understood, Caroline is not defenseless against thecreatures that inhabit the villa. Whether it's with long-range or melee weapons, there's always a way to get rid of them: the gunplay is decent, but not optimal, especially with the nail gun that takes the place of a gun without really being one, while it improves with the rifle pump, as long as you can find it. The latter is able to knock any enemy to the ground in one fell swoop (or slow them down, in case they are too strong), giving the possibility to finish them off with the crowbar or go around them, but ammunition is quite scarce and one must consider when they are worth consuming. In general, however, each enemy has a threshold within which, hitting him with the nail gun, he is knocked to the ground and remains stunned for a few seconds: the number of shots required varies according to the type and learning it also allows us to better manage the fight, knowing when and what risks to take. To enhance and make some phases more difficult, then, there is the question of obscurity. Some rooms in the house are immersed in darkness, or too dimly lit, and this leads to two main consequences: first, if you leave the lighter in favor of a weapon, total darkness will prevent Caroline from using it; secondly, quite simply, one dies. You got it right, staying too long in the dark will cause Caroline to get pulled away by something, leading to an instant game over. You have to keep this in mind while exploring, otherwise you risk running into very unpleasant situations. We really liked this approach not only because it makes some rooms puzzles in themselves, but also because, despite being fully armed, it still prevents us from defending ourselves by forcing us to desperately search for alternative light sources, while being chased by creatures of sort, and above all limits in any case the combat area to the illuminated one. Technical and artistic sector Tormented Souls, the technical sector is sometimes imperfect but the atmosphere returned is excellent We close the review with some notes on the technical sector. The indie nature of the game can be seen, especially in the cutscenes that don't do justice to the rest of the game (but we can understand the decision to invest the budget in other more important aspects) and in a not exactly brilliant dubbing, but beyond this Tormented Souls offers a smooth experience that has never encountered crippling bugs or slowdowns. In some cases we have had an enemy buggy and always be knocked down by our hits with the crowbar, something we still thanked and benefited from, however it was two sporadic cases out of all those encountered. Caroline is a bit animation stiff when running, again it's not something that detracts from the experience - we've always been able to get around enemies easily and generally manage her movement smoothly. There are overall margins for improvement, but the work done by the two developers is still commendable. Especially from an artistic point of view. Caroline may seem like a fish out of water, with those clothes, but the whole setting is very accurate and manages to convey all the feeling of anguish that Tormented Souls sets out to convey. The shots are well chosen, to suggest the idea that something could happen soon, or maybe not, and the use of jump scares is limited to the right amount. The soundtrack, with its unpredictable ups and downs, helps build the atmosphere leaving us on edge even when, in the end, there was no reason to.", "date": "2021-09-06", "grade": "7.2"}
