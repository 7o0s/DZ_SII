Ten Little Sailors To prevent those who have already read the book from knowing exactly what will happen inside the game, the development team has adopted some licenses on the plot and on the original setting, but still under the watchful eye of Agatha's family Christie, current holders of rights to the writer's works. To ensure that these licenses also had an author's signature, the development team welcomed Lee Sheldon, for those who do not know already screenwriter of URU: The Ages Beyond Myst and the TV series Charlie's Angels and Star Trek , which he gladly accepted being a fan of thriller books. The plot of the game sees the protagonist, Patrick Narracott, tasked with accompanying ten people to an island in Devon (called Shipwreck Island, a name a program) to the home of Mr. U.N. Owen, mysterious host of the group who has instructed the two servants, including among the ten, to welcome and settle the entire group inside their villa. However, due to sabotage to his boat, Narracott too is forced to remain against his will on the island, where soon what was supposed to be a semi-vacation turns into a nightmare: in a record recorded by Mr. Owen, all are accused those present (except the protagonist) to be responsible for the murder cases connected to them in the past and through a macabre nursery rhyme they are all threatened with death. It will therefore be up to our virtual alter-ego, unexpected guest also for the murderer, to investigate the matter in a race against time, trying to make sure that as few victims as possible are claimed. The decision to insert an eleventh character within the story is linked to the need to have someone who is ~detached~ from the story and who therefore sees the situation from the outside, a bit like a director's video camera or a a writer. One of the opportunities for collective meeting Three sailors have failed The most important discussions are held around the dining table. important Ten Little Sailors Even the nursery rhyme is very similar to the original version, but for reasons related to the setting of the game, the sailors have been chosen instead of the little Indians. As far as the continuation of the adventure is concerned, we obviously do not say anything so as not to spoil the game for those who have never read the book, but we can say that there are four endings available plus the original one written by Christie, obtainable through some choices that will be made near the end of the game. Even those who already know the literary work will therefore be able to get some pleasant surprises thanks to the intervention of the development team on the original plot. A race against time Although the protagonist almost immediately assumes the role of investigator within the group confined to the island, it is soon realized that instead there is no possibility of solving the mystery through investigations, but simply all the elements to which Narracott comes into possession contribute to move forward in the development of the plot: let's therefore forget any meticulous inspection of the bodies or detection of particularly decisive clues, given that the detective work will be reduced only within the dialogues, where for example we will ask the characters where they were at the time of the crime or who they think is the murderer, all however linked more to the acquisition by the gamer of plot elements rather than clues to the identity of the mysterious murderer. It would also have been nice to introduce a deeper dialogue system that went beyond ~ask all possible questions and say goodbye~. For what has been said so far, despite his efforts, Narracott will always remain behind the unfolding of events, remaining powerless in the face of the murders until the final epilogue, trying in the meantime to shed light on the story and to find a way to leave the island. An example of point and click The dialogue system A nice interlude with the use of the flashlight in the dark A race against time The puzzles that we gradually find ourselves solving are on average quite pleasant and quite logical, except for the necessary exceptions such as the one where you have to find the batteries for the flashlight, which could steal a lot of time from even the most hungry graphic adventurer of the Earth. One of the nicest features of this game is precisely linked to the puzzles, namely the non-linearity: in fact, during the story we are faced with fundamental events, for which we must necessarily go throughget to the end of the adventure, but from time to time we also have the opportunity to undertake secondary puzzles that offer the possibility of knowing more information about the plot or the characters present on the island. Not solving this type of puzzle will not affect the continuation of the story, which will therefore be possible to complete even without completing one hundred percent of the puzzles in the game. As for the graphical interface we are in the presence of the very classic point and click A race against time As far as the graphical interface is concerned, we are in the presence of the very classic ~point and click~, with the mouse cursor changing shape every time it passes over a point of particular interest on the screen for Narracott and therefore also for the gamer. The inventory is simple, functional and very roomy and can be opened by pressing the right mouse button: inside it is also possible to disassemble or combine objects in our possession in order to obtain new things to use properly. The only criticism that perhaps can be made to the developers is that very often our character's pockets will fill up with quite useless stuff and it is not impossible that some objects we have collected remain to keep us company until the end of the adventure without ever coming back to us useful . In addition to the inventory, like any self-respecting investigator, Narracott will pin down in his notebook all the writings he deems of particular interest, so as to re-examine them later if the opportunity arises. In terms of longevity, despite the commendable initiative of the alternative endings and secondary puzzles, we are certainly dealing with a product that will keep us glued to the PC very little, especially when compared to other titles of the same genre: in fact, after completing the first time the story in just under ten hours (rounding up) in my opinion there will be few people who will still want to explore the island and learn new details about the plot. The place for unexpected (and unwanted) guests But what a beautiful expression! The present young lady will have the a certain influence on Narracott, and more Technically speaking From the point of view of graphics we are faced with ups and downs: the first are in fact represented by the entire setting of the game, with great attention to every detail of the house and the island, just as the weather effects are reproduced very well by the game engine. game that impresses also for the graphic effects related to water. The main protagonist is well modeled and his animations are very pleasant, but he is the only one with such luck among the various characters: especially those who leave the scene first are in fact a bit too neglected both in the realization of the model both in that of the textures, not to mention the animations, which are decidedly insufficient. The soundtrack of this game is one of the best in the genre: to begin with, we have a very engaging soundtrack, which contributes to the creation of that closed and forced atmosphere for the eleven protagonists to be on the island. The dubbing is then of excellent workmanship, especially as an actual interpretation, even if the dialogues are sometimes a bit sparse, but given the criticisms received by the Anglo-Saxon version precisely due to the level of the voice actors, it is certainly appropriate to praise those who have dealt with localization in Italian, also present in the form of subtitles as well as speech. Wanting to nitpick in the audio sector, the main theme could be excessively recurring for some, even if on balance this could also be a choice of the developers to create the gloomy atmosphere of the game. The sound of this game is one of the best in the genre The butler will be there for you. he the killer? We will very often find the judge and the doctor playing billiards Image taken from the introductory movie, very nice The mother of all yellows In this box we are not referring to Matt Groening's wife but to the extraordinary creativity of Agatha Christie, of whom Winston Churchill said ~she is the woman who, after Lucrezia Borgia, has lived the longest in contact with crime~. Born in Devonshire on 15 September 1890, among his titles we remember in addition to the one in question in the review of this game also Murder on the Orient-Express, Poirot and the Four and Curtain, all starring the character Hercule Poirot.But how can we forget also Miss Marple, another character fruit of the English writer's imagination, which appeared for the first time in La Morte nel Villaggiobooks have sold a total of more than a billion copies in the English language and a very close number in all translated languages, where within English literature it is second behind Shakespeare. Final comment And none remained is a very good graphic adventure, which however will probably fail to establish itself in the Olympus of its genre, especially when compared to the very large license it can enjoy. If on the one hand we have a compelling plot as only Agatha Christie can do, puzzles on the whole that are quite pleasant and a terrific sound system, the reverse of the medal consists mainly of the poor longevity and insufficient graphics, which therefore affect the final evaluation that could have been much higher with a little more attention from the developers. Summing up, the game is recommended both for fans of Christie's novels and for fans of graphic adventures, even if the majority of those to whom the title, once finished (because you will finish it anyway) could be found among the latter given the texture), it will leave a bitter aftertaste. Pros Superb storyline Pleasant interface Very atmospheric Cons Underwhelming graphics Not long-lived The most classic of mystery books Published in 1939, ~And There Were None~ has above all as regards the original title a certainly singular story: initially called ~Ten Little Niggers~ by Agatha Christie, it was later titled ~Ten Little Indians~ thus trying to adopt a more politically correct, but even this choice turned out to be wrong and so it was that we moved on to ~And Then There Were None~, a title that was also used in the first Italian edition and then changed to ~Ten Little Indians~ up to the present day, proceeding practically the opposite of the original version. Putting aside the vicissitudes related to the name of the book, we are certainly talking about one of Agatha Christie's greatest masterpieces and one of the most beautiful and engaging mystery books ever, if not the first of the aforementioned list, which nonetheless includes numerous titles born from the genius of the English writer. It is certainly strange that the video game industry, so attentive to influences from other types of entertainment, has for years and years been disinterested in this genius, given that many works by Agatha Christie could make a great impression if adapted with knowledge within a video game. However, in the near future, things could change thanks to The Adventure Company, publisher of acclaimed adventures such as Still Life and The Moment of Silence, which has decided, through the AWE Games development team, to embark on the project E Non Ne Restase None and then, it is rumored, to produce new adventures drawn from the works of Agatha Christie in the near future if this first experiment were to be successful. The premises are all there, let's see if both fans of graphic adventures, always hungry for new titles to play, and readers of the mother of detective stories will be satisfied with this game.", "date": "2005-12-30", "grade": null}
