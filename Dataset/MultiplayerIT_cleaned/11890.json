{"name": "SWAT: Target Liberty - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/swat-target-liberty-recensione.html", "text": "The SWAT series has fascinated fans of the genre from all over the world for many years now. Characterized by a good dose of realism and a certain completeness in the gameplay, combined with the undisputed charm of this special department of the American police, the series developed by Sierra Entertainment has in fact indelibly marked the history of this type of game. After the PC, the ~platform~ on which the product originated and developed, it is now the PSP's turn to host a new episode of the saga, with a title created specifically for it, thus exploiting its controls and ~concept~ of portable console. In this sense we immediately say that SWAT: Target Liberty, this is the name, has a game system that can be briefly defined as a successful middle ground between the ~playful extremisms~ (understood as realism and completeness of the controls) of its predecessors that appeared on computers and greater immediacy, necessary, as mentioned earlier, given the characteristics of the Sony ~portable~. But before we get into the technical details, let's take a look at the plot. New York is one of the largest, most immense cities in the world. And as often happens, crime grows exponentially with the size of the population. Robberies, murders, drug dealing, terrorists ready to carry out attacks, there is something for all tastes. To deal with the most agitated or high-risk situations, SWAT agents are usually sent by the US government, whose task is to free any hostages, foil attacks, arrest drug dealers and eliminate enemies. To accomplish all this, the gamer is placed at the helm of two small groups formed in turn by as many men, who can be commanded separately, so as to be able to plan different types of actions combined between the teams. More action The structure of the game is quite classic, apart from the view that switches from first to third person, with dynamic 3D isometric framing (the cameras rotate and zoom according to the moment) which is so reminiscent of some old SuperNes titles. In practice, the purpose of the adventure is to complete tasks of various kinds related to each other by some movies and the storyline, minimizing our losses and those of civilians, and remaining very cautious in dealing with the areas of operation (no ~ramming~ so to speak). Before each mission there is a briefing where the actions to be carried out are explained to the user through a tactical map and some information. Once at the center of the action, the player immediately begins to appreciate the qualities of the title. In fact, the commands used for team management are quite intuitive. Each of the two groups can be selected using the square button, while with the triangle you can interact with doors, hostages and terrorists. Through the back buttons, however, it is possible to activate special targets where to direct, guiding him, a companion, while with another button the pause is called up and the menu appears. From this icon menu you can then select every type of possible and imaginable action to have your men perform based on the situation in which the team is involved, and which range from the possibility of cleaning a room from hostile presences (enemies or explosives) to the actual raid inside a barred building. Multiplayer Alternatively, you can also get to the heart of the action by controlling an agent or a team of two directly via controller, as mentioned above. The actions that can be performed in these situations are many, despite the limited number of buttons on the Sony portable console: arrests, knockdowns, raids by breaking down doors and windows, handcuffings and in general the whole ~repertoire~ of this special department can be replicated at the perfection. In the event of a firefight, the game benefits from an enemy locking system, sometimes a little confusing in the most chaotic phases, but certainly very effective and of great help. Especially in Multiplayer. Four players with as many copies of the game and the same number of consoles can in fact play cooperatively on the local Wi-Fi network, collaborating with each other in the fight against crime. Peculiarities of this mode: a system that randomizes the position of the opponents and the extension of the levels, so that you find yourself facing ever new challenges. From a purely aesthetic point of view, SWAT can be appreciated for the good level design of the settings, not very detailed but still of decent workmanship considering the type of game, as well as the light effects and animations, although we have seen better on PSP. The sound is beautiful, full of realistic effects and good dubbing with a lot of language that is a little ~strong~ but quite normalconsidering the situations in which the agents of this department are forced to face more or less on a daily basis. Comment SWAT: Target Liberty is one of those titles that despite some small flaws manages to win the interest of the player, at least for a while. Graphically nice, the title produced by Sierra and developed by 3G Studios manages to combine the realism and almost total control typical of the original PC series with the immediacy and style required for a portable console. In short, the transition from ~simulator~ to ~action~ in terms of gameplay is more suited to the user of a portable console, even if we would have liked more depth and above all a more articulated artificial intelligence. Pros: Simplified but effective gameplay . Always fun missions. Great variety of situations. Cons: Uploads a bit too long. Shallow. Enemy AI to review.", "date": "2007-10-26", "grade": null}
