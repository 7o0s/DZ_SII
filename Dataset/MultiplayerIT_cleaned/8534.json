The idea is to take the top-down RPG dungeon crawler and decline it in the style of the bullet hell shooter, seasoning everything with a considerable attention to the progression of the characters and the search for loot, giving a certain depth to the whole. There's a lot of room for storytelling, with the story serving just as a pretext and kick-starting the action: there's the usual evil king, in this case called Solomon, who has decided to destroy the magical areas they protected the realm and open the passages to a dark dimension, giving the green light to an invasion of monsters and aberrant creatures. All this to say that, as usual, it's our turn to ~save the world~, without going around too much, eliminating assorted enemies and bosses within a large number of progressive levels. My Heroes Dungeon Raid catapults us into various ~dungeons~ characterized by various environments, made up of interconnected levels which are essentially arenas in which furious clashes with enemies take place, to be eliminated to clear the way up to the final boss. mechanism repeats practically constant and is based above all on the progression of the characters and on the search for the loot, which is then the basis of the gacha mechanism present inside. The latter, instead of unlocking new characters, focuses exclusively on weapons and equipment, also linked to new special abilities, therefore a system of ~summoning~ new content that could be considered less nagging than the classic one focused on characters, but which however, it has its downsides. Between shooter and RPG My Heroes: Dungeon Raid contains five character classes, here we see the Mage The launch of My Heroes: Dungeon Raid looks like the classic one of a RPG dungeon crawler with a medieval fantasy setting, but things practically change within a few minutes, staging rather crazy environments and enemies and above all a dynamic shooter that places it in a style and setting all its own. The fundamental feature of the game is the presence of five classes from which to select your character (Ninja, Priest, Ranger, Mage, Warrior) who remains linked exclusively to these five initial models but can then be upgraded and customized in an enormous amount of ways. This takes away the pressure of the search for new fighters but applies it to the constant progression of the protagonist, so the balance is always rather dubious, as regards the gacha elements within it. The gameplay is somewhat reminiscent of Enter the Gungeon and there is no doubt that the Reality Squared team was inspired by this in building the game, however it is characterized by a simpler construction in terms of game mechanics and the variety of situations , clearly more moved to the grinding and growth and personalization of the protagonist. In arenas shot from above, we find ourselves moving the character while firing at enemies, having to manage a number of elements on the screen, including stray bullets, spells and various creatures, which closely resembles the Japanese school bullet hell shooters. My Heroes: Dungeon Raid, a screenshot of the gameplay between shooter and RPG Each ~quest~ sets us three objectives to complete, based on which different rewards are obtained and there are really a lot of them up for grabs. In the heart of the action, the game is a real frenetic chaos, which manages to keep us glued to the screen for those few minutes required to finish the individual levels, even if there is always something overly simplified in the basic mechanism. The controls and the movement of the protagonist combine to give the idea of floating through the screens, which can lead to poor precision or the lack of the ~sensation~ of hitting or being hit. These sensations are perhaps underlined precisely by the graphic richness that explodes on the touch screen of smartphones: between bosses, special shots, summons and various animations we are witnessing a real feast of sprites and pixels, certainly as spectacular to see as it is confusing in terms of gameplay, however very pleasant in audio-visual terms .", "date": "2022-03-06", "grade": "6.8"}
