{"name": "Resistere!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93101-resistance-3-resistere.html", "text": "Four years have passed since the tragic entry into the scene as the protagonist of Joseph Capelli, the Chimera have definitively conquered our planet by killing 90% of the human population and reducing the meager pockets of resistance scattered over the Earth to despair. These few survivors live underground, in emergency shelters fueled by the illusion of being able to still live a normal life by escaping the alien patrols and recovering food through small raids outside. Resistance 3 opens in this way, making us breathe the acrid smell of drama, of a practically lost war, showing us with all the strength of pain, the lonely situation of a desperate man for whom it is not enough to have found a wife and feel worried about a sick three-year-old son. Because Capelli is a dishonored soldier who will never be able to forgive himself for having murdered Nathan Hale, the worn-out hero of the series created by Insomniac exclusively for PlayStation 3 in cold blood, and will find himself thus involved, as one might expect from a final chapter of a saga, in a battle fueled only by desperation in an extreme attempt to block the advance of the Chimera. And rest assured if for some reason you haven't played the first two chapters because Resistance 3 introduces the player to the universe with an extremely accurate synthesis especially from an artistic point of view and the inevitable references to previous titles, starting with a couple of supporting actors who come back for the occasion, they can easily be overcome without risking not understanding some parts of the plot. All this wasted history If anything, the problem lurks in a narrative canvas which, despite having exceptional premises and while immediately involving the player in an intense story and initially narrated with great cinematographic and artistic skills, soon begins to fall apart, becoming increasingly rarefied and less stimulating, going to lose thick, indeed disappearing completely, in some parts of the game and then returning with the inevitable fireworks at the end of the game. In this sense, the taciturn and decidedly not very expressive protagonist, that Hair that the player will command and that it was really very difficult for us to impersonate, does not help either. Instead, it goes a little better with the secondary characters who sometimes accompany Joseph, in particular Dr. Malikov who in this third chapter returns, even if they all soon prove to be barely hinted at, little specks who enter and leave the scene without leaving footprints in the plot. And we also feel like praising the good duration of the campaign: in a period in which first person shooters suffer from a hasty and always very approximate single player, Resistance 3 stands out for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted gameplay at the second level of difficulty, the one normal (with a fourth level that is unlocked after the game is finished). A story that will see us cross America on an almost coast to coast journey from Oklhahoma to New York where Capelli will have to assault and destroy a Chimera tower responsible for the slow but constant cooling of the Earth and capable of also acting as a space gate. thunderstorm to the homeworld of the alien assailants. A decidedly long journey, made up of 20 chapters and extremely varied in terms of scenarios. We will see everything from urban areas to forests, from alien bases to human prisons, from disgusting sewers to claustrophobic mining tunnels. All the classic first-person shooter settings are here and from this point of view the game certainly proves to be very derivative and full of clichs by not introducing anything really new but taking full advantage of the tradition of this generation's FPS. If you think of any environmental situation or level typical of a shooter, you can rest assured because in Resistance 3 there is. Except only for a classic level in a vehicle controlled by the player. Among other things, to return to the subject of the plot, a very large part of the game will see our protagonist completely alone at the mercy of the aliens, without any possibility of having a chat with someone and consequently without any interesting progress in the plot. In these long junctures, the title strongly derives from survival horror and in some cases it will be able to keep you in suspense thanks to very dark and tense atmospheres with great skill. Back to the past Where Resistance 3 works perfectly is in its first-person shooter gameplay. After the digression made by Insomniac with the second chapter, this third title represents in all respects a leap into the pastof the saga thanks to the recovery of mechanics much more in line with those of Fall of Man, progenitor of the series. First of all, the automatic regeneration of life has disappeared, the usual common thread of all shooters of this generation in favor of a circular energy indicator which must necessarily be restored by hand by collecting the various green ampoules scattered around the scenario or left on the ground by some enemies. Combat in this way, while not losing in the frenzy and chaos of the action, gains a lot in terms of tactics and management of the shelters scattered on the ground. In many cases the pathos evoked by having two or three notches of energy and having to break into a room with the risk of being killed with a couple of shots is felt and becomes practically mandatory for the player to study the elements scattered on the ground in search of that bright green that allows you to quickly identify the medikit. At the same time we have a throwback also for what concerns the management of weapons. Resistance 3 offers twelve during the entire campaign that the protagonist can take with him without space limits. Their management takes place via the triangle button which allows both to alternate between the last two used if pressed quickly or, by increasing the pressure time, a radial menu appears superimposed to allow the selection of all the paraphernalia by pausing the gameplay . Each weapon, with the exception of a hammer that you pick up mid-game and is more suited to hand-to-hand combat, has a particularly inspired and original alternative fire mode. We go from the explosion of the bullets of the Magnum or the tracer bullet of the Bullseye already seen in the past, to the grenade of the carbine or the jet of air under pressure of the cryogun capable of shattering previously frozen enemies with normal fire. The variety is enormous, thanks to the partly human and partly alien paraphernalia and the fighting styles change completely from one weapon to another. Furthermore, as if this were not enough, each weapon is enhanced with use through two additional levels that passively modify the strength of the bullets rather than the style of the viewfinder, sometimes adding features to the fire mouth such as the bayonet on the carbine. The result is absolutely unprecedented for those accustomed to the FPS of the last three or four years and stimulates great tactical management of the clashes. The ammunition is in fact rather limited and especially at higher difficulty levels it becomes a fundamental requirement to study the type of enemy and its positioning in order to use the best weapon during the battle. A couple of shots from Auger to flush out the most sheltered enemies, a few bursts of carbine for the enemies that start to approach and then a handful of shots from Rossmore, the shotgun, to flush out the Chimera hidden around the corner. The involvement is enormous and the sense of satisfaction once the area is cleared is remarkable despite an artificial intelligence of the enemy that is not exactly of the highest level. Stuffed aliens can be seen in the middle of the rooms and often the tactics they use to surround us are approximate and too easy to deal with. From this point of view we would certainly have expected a greater challenge and we also note a certain stinginess in the use of grenades (four different types are encountered) on their part. Last note for the bosses: few, decidedly uninspired and dominated by really dated encounter mechanics because they are still based on the usual weak points to hit and adequately highlighted by special bright points on the screen. Not really credible for huge enemies capable of wiping out entire villages in an instant. Playstation 3 trophies The game offers 59 trophies including the inevitable platinum. Then we find only a golden one that is unlocked by completing the campaign with the superhuman unlockable difficulty level. Then there are four silver trophies that are earned by completing the game, collecting all the newspapers scattered throughout the scenario, upgrading all weapons and playing in cooperatives. Then there are 54 bronze trophies ranging from the classic collectibles linked to various numbers of enemies killed to the overcoming of some key points of the plot, to the particular use of paraphernalia. All together passionately? Resistance 3 obviously also offers a competitive and cooperative multiplayer component. In both cases with big differences compared to the past of the series. Let's start from the cooperative which allows this time to play the entire single player campaign in two players both in split screen than online. In the latter case, however, it is not clear why it is possible to only invite friends and not play with the first one that happens. Full gearbox also for the competitive one which is now dangerously close to the standards of the genre. A class system remains (only four this time) each with specific skills that can be called up during the game respecting the classic cooldown. The automatic regeneration of energy returns and in addition there are the killstreaks that can be activated when you kill increasing series of opponents without losing your life. Basically, compared to the past, however, there is a level experience system that allows you to earn points that can be spent to unlock the paraphernalia and additional skills. The result is, as usual in these cases, an initially rather unbalanced multiplayer when with your character with limited weapons you face people who spend whole days unlocking game elements. In the long run, however, the situation tends to normalize, leaving plenty of room for excellent configurability of your avatar and offering a good variety of play styles. In terms of game modes we have the classic free-for-all and team deathmatches, capture the flag and two more complex modes: Breach where you have to destroy or defend a certain objective and Chain Reaction which offers gameplay focused on capturing and maintaining certain points of the territory. In all cases there is a limit to sixteen players at the same time and it is possible to choose from about ten maps, mostly revised and modified versions of those seen in the single player. In short, the change in gameplay is enormous compared to the second Resistance and it is certainly something that must be taken into account: if you appreciated the massive numbers of the prequel and the style of play that was determined, here you will be faced with a very more standardized and probably less original but in the opinion of the writer, more tested and stimulating in both the short and long term. It is important to point out that at the time of our test we had already had to download two different patches, both of which weighed over 600 MB and to date there are not sporadic phenomena of lag while the engine seems to show too much flank to some slowdowns, even conspicuous in the presence of many opponents on screen. Furthermore, Resistance 3 is the first Sony title to require an online pass, in this case called PSN Pass: a code included in the game package that must be redeemed in the PSN Store to allow access to the multiplayer component. Mmmmm... If from an artistic and design point of view the work done by Insomniac is absolutely exceptional and is very evident in the cut of the interlude scenes, breaking cleanly with the past style of the series, in purely technical terms the product fails to do that leap forward which in our opinion is essential for a first party title. Resistance 3 is rather dirty and generally not very detailed with the excellent variety of scenarios that clashes with their rather sloppy realization. There are plenty of textures with rather low detail as well as character models which also appear rather static and woodenly animated. However, the weapons and various special effects on the screen are saved which contribute to making the more substantial clashes alive. The frame rate is certainly good, but only in single player where, despite the large number of enemies on the screen, it always manages to be very stable. The management of the lights is just good with a barely perceptible environmental HDR and decidedly far from the sacred monster of PlayStation 3, Killzone 3. There are not a few occasions, among other things, in which we have noticed the lack of shadows on the characters, probably to keep the fluidity of what is shown on the screen is high. Resistance 3 supports 3D and can also be played entirely with the Move. In the first case we cannot make a judgment not having tried it on compatible televisions, while as regards the additional peripheral, we have noticed a very reduced sensitivity even by acting massively on the settings which translates into a rather low reactivity. Element that weighs enough in the most agitated situations and that forces us to advise against this control mode to better experience the gameplay of Resistance 3.", "date": "2011-09-12", "grade": "8.7"}
