{"name": "Diablo II Lord of Destruction: il male  tornato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction-il-male-e-tornato.html", "text": "My beautiful CdRom reader, turn and install... This I thought, while in my little head I tried to take stock of the situation. Last year, day after day, a big title called Diablo 2 came out and sold something like 3 million copies. A frightening figure, a sign of a truly widespread popularity on a global level. As it was easy to predict, such a marked success is immediately followed by another, with the release of this expansion pack that will give us our ~daily bread~. Let's see what Chef Bill Roper and his entire crew at Blizzard have cooked up for us. Let's sit comfortably at the table, open the first packet of breadsticks and with a snap of the fingers let us bring a menu. The fifth act. What? As? But wasn't it finished? Nein, nada, niet. There is more. We were left with Diablo's four bones showing off on the floor, while finally we went to the infernal furnace to destroy the second soul stone (the first, Mephisto's, we had destroyed just before presenting the bill to the red beast). But who is missing? And above all... why does the saying exist ~all good things come in threes~? Simple... the lands of Sanctuary are not completely purified yet, there is still a rompiBaal around... erhm... oops. I was saying, the third brother called Baal managed to escape by recovering his soul stone, and is serious about pursuing the perverse purpose of taking control of the portal between heaven and hell, precisely Sanctuary. By doing so he will be able to channel all the souls of the dying down... to his home. Thus begins the battle to end his existence. And the climb to Mount Arreat also begins, a snowy and inhospitable land that acts as a refuge for the bad guy. You find yourself thrown into the middle of a war, as the forces of evil try to crush the barbarian populations of the north. A truly apocalyptic scenario! Although in hindsight act five is about as great as the third, there are things to explore. The aspects that support this thesis and that immediately catch the eye are certainly the graphics and the quests. Graphically we are at the state of the art of 2D friends, with new implementations such as the much requested video resolution of 800x600 (with the 19 inch I almost went out to dinner with pixels) which allows us to see more around us, and better . From the ~weight~ point of view in terms of performance, let's say that the requirements are raised a little, but all in all it is very playable all the same. In addition, the aesthetic work is enriched by an even improved detail of the details, with explosions, falling snow, redesigned trees and much more. As you enter the game, you will reach very ~inspired~ places, one above all the top of a mountain, from which you can see the ruins of the village from which you started down the valley, in a riot of parallax. Huh? Big word? Perhaps for newbies who have had little to do with 2D it sounds strange, but for someone like me who hung out on Megadrive or 16 BIT systems it was a party. In essence it is the effect whereby the background of the screen moves with you, at a reduced speed proportional to the distance. More beautiful to see than to discuss... Plus the quests. There are six of them, and the fact that some of them come out of that typical repetitiveness of the original game stands out... one above all the finding of a kidnapped person, and his cure with a magical potion. The environment feels more alive however, with a few more things to do than the usual point and click, which however remains the hallmark of D2. The types of monsters to face are different and well characterized, of absolute effect is the Siege Beast which with its enormous tonnage blocks your way spitting fire and flames, and which welcomes on its shoulders a tiny and very mischievous being who commands it. The 2 new classes. Two more classes? Yes! And we are at seven. This is a big dose of new gameplay injected into Diablo2 as these two new characters are completely different from each other, and fit neatly between the other five classes. Above all thanks to the fact that new skills accompany them, driving us crazy to better plan the growth of the character's ~skill tree~, so as not to waste even a precious little point given to us by the game. The Druid A physically tall character with an apparently closed-in character, the Druid is the one who bases his knowledge on a harmonious fusion with the nature itself around him. His skills are divided into (Shape Shifting, Evocation, Elemental Magic). With Shapeshifting he is able to mutTake your own shape and take the form of a wolf or even a bear! By acquiring unique abilities related to the animal he has transformed into. He can also summon spirits, vines and animals which respectively give him passive benefits but little physical contribution in battle in the case of spirits, the vines attack the enemy directly and are supernatural beings and the animals, alone or in herds, which instead can be called in the form of crows, two types of wolf and the grizzly bear. Finally he is able to cause disastrous atmospheric phenomena to occur around him, and which strike enemies in the form of tornadoes, rains of flames, frozen breaths and the infernal (Armageddon). The Assassin And here is the Nikita of the situation, the silent angel of death who has hands AND feet registered as unconventional weapons at the Sanctuary police station. His skills are divided into Martial Arts, Discipline of the shadow and Traps. The Martial Arts tree is certainly very inviting, with an array of special moves and strikes to finish off your opponent. By ~charging~ one of these moves, devastating effects can be obtained not only in terms of damage, but with moves worthy of a John Woo film. The Shadow Discipline possesses psychic powers derived from concentration and directly affect strength, degree of attack, etc. In addition, there is a projection of itself, similar to an advanced version of the Amazon Valkyrie. The Traps tree logically consists of the possibility of placing traps and devices that can damage the enemy while we are at a safe distance. I greedy for objects?! But when ever... ...and instead I think we all will be a bit, given the abundance that awaits us. If in Diablo2 we amuse ourselves with an almost infinite multitude of objects whose characteristics are generated at random, now we have more meat in the fire. This is not bad, if we think of the fact that much of our success in the game is due to the equipment we wear, in addition to our skill. The main changes concern the introduction of specific objects for each class, and usable only by it. An example? The barbarian class will have special helmets that only he can wear or the amazon will have specific bows. The so-called ~crafted items~ (with orange writing) have been introduced, the result of our experiments with the Horadrim cube and the elite class of objects, available only in Inferno difficulty. Ethereals are super-powerful objects that have a major handicap: they cannot be repaired, and therefore are unusable... unless another object is found: a particular rune that makes them indestructible. Runes? Yes, there are also them, which suitably ~socketted~ (inserted) into the slots of objects in a correct order and number, will vary their characteristics until they become truly unique. And then many other things, many have been added! Shields, new unique items, new Kits (green color) that will be easier to complete. All in the name of the largest bazaar ever seen! But where do we put all this goodness? But of course in the trunk, which has doubled in size! No more inventories crammed with stuff, but space management much more comfortable! Another noteworthy feature concerns the famous mercenaries that can be occasionally enlisted in the city: this time they also enjoy their own equipment and characteristics just like you and ... hear hear ... they grow in experience and level and they can accompany you throughout the game as long as you want! If they die they can be ~resurrected~ with all their gear and experience points! Phenomenal... if you don't find people around to play with (I doubt it) here you are partying yourself! Do I throw money away or not? I say yes. For two simple reasons.. one obvious, for all that listed above, which is not cheap at all! Practically a must. There's not much to say guys: in my opinion the sense of completeness (and here I return to the second basic concept that I mentioned at the beginning of the article) that Diablo reaches with this expansion is now definitive, I feel that now it has the right touch to settle on a another level of himself. There is a more subtle reason instead. The element that should make you think is whether all these features are really all flour of the huge Blizzard sack, in the sense that it is certainly the study of user feedback that has led them to these improvements. The needs not satisfied by the original title find fulfillment here and, in fact, who will not buy the eexpansion will literally lag behind. A character can in fact be ~converted~ in the expansion... this means that anyone who does not follow this procedure can no longer play together with his friend who has chosen to upgrade the character for the expansion: ergo a compulsory purchase for the vast majority majority of users. But given the facts and the final price, which should be within reach of almost every pocket... unseen purchase for the fanatical owners of Diablo! The third wheel There are two basic concepts that I would like to express. One I say now, the other at the end of the article. The first is: social relationships. How many times have we heard that the human being is an individual naturally predisposed to be with others? Many. And it's true. But there are times when the joy of letting go of the walk in progress for once (but also not caring if it's sunny outside, etc.) takes over. What happened? Have we suddenly become a kind of single-celled being sitting in a chair gazing at our apathetic existence? Absolutely not! We are simply weighing the Diablo 2 expansion pack in our hands, and with a satanic grin (grin grin = satanic grin noise) we crack our fingers, and almost without thinking we carelessly turn off the cell phone.", "date": "2001-06-30", "grade": null}
