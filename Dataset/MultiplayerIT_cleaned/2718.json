It is a discussion that we have already done by introducing the review of the first chapter, but in fact it is still valid because in the meantime no particular novelties have emerged in this area: with the exception of the historic Nintendo Punch-Out, which this game is clearly inspired by, and a few other examples, boxing seems unable to be represented in the form of a video game with a certain regularity, probably precisely due to the complexity of the fights, their technique and the rhythms that have very little to do with beating wildly on the keys. From this point of view, Prizefighters 2 does a good job of showcasing the particularities of the sport, even if in the ring the action is clearly very arcade-oriented. At a quick glance, the reference to Punch-Out seems obvious: also in this case the matches are faced with a particular shot behind the boxer, which is a distinctive feature of the Nintendo game, with the possibility of delivering different types of blows and the obvious focus on the timing between attack and defence, but there's also something very technical about Prizefighters 2, which makes it almost a simulation in some respects. It's all quite simplified and made particularly digestible, as befits a game that must be enjoyed on mobile platforms, but the management of the boxer and the gym, with managerial elements applied, makes this title something deeper than it might seem from a simple look at the action in the ring. From this point of view there is also a substantial distinction to be noted: the game is distributed as free-to-play but you can switch to the Premium version with a single in-app purchase of 3.50 euros and only in the latter modality it is possible to access all the different management features related to the gym and the organization of matches. It's a good solution that allows for a gradual introduction, with a very thorough trial of the basic mechanics through free access and no hassles related to micro-transactions (it is possible to buy additional money to invest in the gym but it is not essential, considering that which is already obtained by playing) and then move on to the complete experience calmly, through a single purchase and without mechanics that affect the balance through in-app purchases. The eyes of the Tiger The fact that the graphic style takes up the classic pixelated 16-bit tradition does not mislead, because this is not a simple arcade game of little thickness. The attention to detail and the completeness of the contents are evident right from the character editor: we can choose the name, nationality, fighting style and basic characteristics of our boxer and then act on numerous aspects of the aesthetic customization, before launching ourselves into the climb to success. The aim is to start from the amateur circuits and win matches until you move up in category and become more and more famous, managing different aspects of the fighter between one match and another, trying to get to be ~the greatest of all time~, through a long road that accompanies the growth of the protagonist. In the ring, we find ourselves controlling the boxer with some commands positioned on the screen, with a solution that is not exactly ideal but still functional, considering the reasoned and tactical rhythm of the clashes. On the right of the screen, a series of buttons correspond to all the basic boxing moves including jabs, jabs, uppercuts and various combinations as well as special shots to be unlocked and refined with training and experience, with the different duration of pressure corresponding to a different power of the blow. On the left side, the same key pattern corresponds instead to parries and evasive maneuvers, to be implemented by choosing the right timing. The gameplay is all played on the observation of the opponent's movements, which can suggest the incoming moves allowing us to adopt the right countermeasures in the fraction of a second allowed, between dodging, guarding, counterattacks and attacks. In the meantime it is necessary to keep an eye on the boxer's energy and stamina, trying to inflict as many blows as possible to aim for the KO or victory on points. Outside the ring, the managerial components help organize different aspects of the boxer's career. The difference between the free version and the Premium is largely based on these elements, with the latter opening up a series of wider possibilities forthe organization of matches and leagues, as well as the ability to import and export leagues with the community, more customization options and a greater amount of saves. In both cases, however, we find ourselves fixing the dates for the matches, trying to choose the opponents wisely and organizing the time between one match and another with a series of training sessions that are able to develop the characteristics of the wrestler without tiring him too much or making him leave the parameters of the category in which he is.", "date": "2020-12-26", "grade": "7.5"}
