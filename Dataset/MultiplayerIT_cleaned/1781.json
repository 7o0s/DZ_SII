{"name": "Hitchhiker", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hitchhiker-recensione.html", "text": "We approached the Hitchhiker review with a bit of perplexity, after all the now well-known genre of the so-called walking simulators is not exactly very popular on mobile. The reason is obvious: we are talking about mostly narrative experiences, with very limited gameplay, which require a generally distant use compared to that which can be had on the move. Doubts that accompanied us for the approximately two and a half hours necessary to complete of the adventure, which can certainly count on traits of originality that should not be underestimated and on the possibility of making different choices to unlock at least a couple of alternative endings, but also on rhythms that many users could consider excessively slow and constricting. History Hitchhiker, the first character we'll deal with in the campaign. The story of Hitchhiker takes place within five chapters, narrated through the dialogues that the protagonist entertains with the people who gave him a lift. Mysteriously deprived of his memory, unaware of where he is going and why, the hitchhiker we take on will listen to the stories that are told to him from time to time, interacting wherever possible. In short, what we are offered is an experience different from the usual, characterized by a road movie-style atmosphere but also and above all by variations on the theme that have all the appearance of an exercise in style, a curious mix between creative writing and comics in which the progression is marked solely by the dialogues, very well played, of his characters. Gameplay Hitchhiker, a simple puzzle during our second ~run~. As expected, there's a lot to hear in Hitchhiker and a lot to see too, in the form of the bizarre suggestions evoked from time to time by our companions, but very little to play with. The gameplay, in line with the walking simulator genre, is reduced to the bone and in this case we won't even have the opportunity to freely explore the scenarios, limiting ourselves to observing them from the windshield of the car that transports us. We will be able to move the view as we wish, using the touch controls (be careful to increase the sensitivity, however: the default one is really too low) or a Bluetooth controller to select any answers to give to our interlocutor, as well as examine some objects present in the car or outside, scattered in the landscape that surrounds us. Hitchhiker, one of the ~alternative~ sequences that we will see in the game. There are two drawbacks that stand out. The first is that the timing of the narration is forced: it is not possible to speed up the dialogues in any way, which means that to play with Hitchhiker it will be necessary to dedicate a certain amount of time and attention to what happens on the screen, as mentioned without the ability to do much. The second is that the interaction with objects is triggered almost automatically, simply as we try to move the camera in the desired direction, and this gives rise to many wrong inputs. When the latter translate into the selection of incorrect answers compared to the ones we wanted to provide, obviously some frustration arises. Technical realization Although in terms of polygonal construction the world represented in Hitchhiker is rather simple, with some too many pop-up phenomena and animations that tend to repeat themselves, stylistically the game certainly has its own personality and manifests it in particular in some moments of the story. The most valuable part of the production, however, lies in the sound sector and in the many dialogues present, spoken in English but subtitled in Italian (not always very well, some blunders can be noticed), very well interpreted by a cast of capable actors who add value to the project.", "date": "2021-04-01", "grade": "7.0"}
