We are born, we grow up and in the end we end up underground: it is the ~circle of life~, a happy expression that has always summarized the parenthesis of human life on this planet. But are we really sure that it is a circular movement? Does it go back to square one, when the death of an individual gives way to the birth of another being? For the developers of SelectaVision, perhaps it would be more correct to speak of a ~straight line~ than a ~circle~. Minabo - A walk through life is exactly this: a journey through a single existence; a common thread that links the birth of the protagonist to his death. What matters most, of course, is the journey itself, with all the series of social relationships that it is possible to intertwine (or reject) along the way. It is a surprisingly original production, very curious also in the choices of the artistic direction, which has not always convinced us but which we will certainly still remember in a few years. What follows is therefore the review of Minabo - A walk through life, based on turnips, friendships and many existential questions. A life on the go A Minabo turnip shortly before birth No time to enter your name on the screen and here is a small turnip sticking out of the ground. Initially he is not even able to walk: he therefore limits himself to crawling, with improbable upper and lower limbs completely similar to those of human beings (but in a work of fantasy we have forgiven worse). In these first moments it is only possible to relate to one's parents, seeking affection, dialogue, physical contact from them; they usually respond positively to our stimuli. But time is running out: soon the turnip will be ready to stand on two legs and run around the world, meeting other similar ones, talking to them, proceeding ever more rapidly. Minabo - A walk through life, as the name suggests , is a life simulator; in this sense, it does not need a real lens. It is more of an experience than anything else: the player is interested in seeing what happens when he interacts in a certain way with some characters, how his alter ego changes over the years; what happens to the others present and what death, finally, the protagonist will have to die. The developers declared, at the time, that in Minabo it would not have been possible to live two lives in exactly the same way, and it is true: because a single badly asked question to a certain character is really enough to trigger a chain reaction. Intervening on the links of this chain, imagining what could happen and trying to modify subsequent events: perhaps the true ~playful~ heart of Minabo lies in these actions. In fact, the main structure does not present any plots, but a simple articulation in missions necessary to become familiar with the title. The first of all, for example, asks to obtain - before death, it goes without saying - at least three friends, a stable love relationship, and possibly to pass on to a better life once the age of forty is reached. In fact, it is also possible to die much earlier or much later; not having friends at all or having too many; fall in love with a partner or opt for the most unbridled polygamy. Minabo's only limitations are really those imposed by player choices and a relationship system that really isn't quite as intuitive at times as it should be. Relationships are everything (or aren't they?) Parents are important, but Minabo also allows pets The gameplay of Minabo - A walk through life is very simple. By holding down the B command on Nintendo Switch, the turnip walks automatically; he can do it fast or slow, and this affects his life. By running, various passages are accelerated, it is possible to speak with fewer people, in short, one lives energetically up to the moment of departure; but proceeding more slowly you can enjoy all the possibilities offered by the route. Along the way, you will meet countless other turnips, of all genders, starting from the same parents: by selecting these turnips with the right stick, it is possible to interact with a series of three different options: Physical Contact, Confidence and Welcoming. If the relationship is successful - and this is unfortunately very often linked to the random factor, expressed as a percentage - then the protagonist turnip improves in that specific aspect of her personality. If it doesn't go well, she will be disappointed. Slowly, she will thus begin to forge an unrepeatable personality: the alter ego will become extremely sociable or very introverted; it will be a turnipdare or always ready to console others; she will be able to live love stories in a proactive way, or will abandon her partner after a very short time, and so on. Minabo's gameplay taken in itself is extremely interesting, because no choice is as obvious as it might seem: by interacting only with one of the two parental figures, for example, we have seen the second one deteriorate much more quickly; with a series of wrong answers we have decreased its life expectancy. Even the relationship of turnips with death is worthy of anthropological studies: because the protagonist can react to the strong disappointments of existence - and it must be the player who chooses it - in different ways, from ferocious anger to serenity. A wedding demands its ritual, even on Minabo Relationships with others, therefore, are everything. But the choices are not so obvious and the gameplay is not even too intuitive. Too often we find ourselves in certain situations (few friends, many hostilities; or vice versa) only for a series of completely random wrong interactions - it is possible that all approaches with other turnips have given negative results simply because the randomness factor ~has decided~ that it had to be like this. To allow greater freedom, accessories have therefore been introduced, the hats, which can modify the parameters of the protagonist, making him more attractive in love affairs, or a perfect antisocial (in which case no one will approach you and you will be free to live in solitude ). However, how can one fail to see the forcing of such an introduction? Furthermore, many other aspects of Minabo give the idea of a production with limited content: the backdrops are fascinating and well-finished, but also extremely repetitive; the possible interactions, on balance, are always a handful; the mission system is more of a pretext than anything else, given that the real main mode consists of the free game; there are no serious ideas that encourage any form of progression and, above all, on Nintendo Switch we have repeatedly encountered bugs that completely block the title, forcing us to restart the game from the beginning. This last problem will certainly be solved soon, but it is not a detail that can be overlooked.", "date": "2023-04-28", "grade": "6.0"}
