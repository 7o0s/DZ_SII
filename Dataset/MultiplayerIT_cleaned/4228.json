In short, from Exogini to Pokmon, there is a common thread in the desire to capture and collect a wide variety of more or less monstrous creatures, perhaps revealing a man's inclination towards the control of powerful and mysterious beings to be accurately catalogued. Pokmon GO has managed to exploit this mechanic by adapting it in an original way to the mobile context and the imitations have not been slow to appear, of course. An example is provided by this Jurassic World Alive, which derives many characteristics from the phenomenal Niantic title and associates them with another great and historic passion of young and old: dinosaurs. The mechanics are the same as Pokmon GO, with some interesting variations: it involves going around the world (or around the neighborhood, being very careful not to violate other people's properties or end up under a car) looking for dinosaurs, appearing within a map represented exactly like the one in the Niantic game, with data derived from Google. Near a dinosaur it is possible to start the capture procedure, from which it is possible to obtain a certain amount of DNA corresponding to the species of dinosaur in question in order to then be able to reproduce and evolve it within one's own collection. We are therefore dealing with two distinct phases: a more ~action~ one focused on capturing and a more reflective one that allows you to enhance and observe the dinosaurs, with the possibility of taking photos and videos of the lizards but also putting them to the test in PvP fights . The possibility of applying augmented reality to the photographic mode also allows for amusing results given the excellent integration between the computer graphics of the creatures and the real backgrounds that can be applied to them. Let's catch them all The mechanics of capturing is quite different from that of Pokmon GO: when dinosaurs are found on the map, it is possible to start hunting even from a certain distance, thanks to the use of the drone. Instead of throwing balls, it's about shooting darts from the drone at the creature on the ground, trying to hit the moving target precisely. The more precise and numerous the blows are struck, the greater the amount of DNA collected at the end of the session, with this which, once a certain prearranged quantity has been reached, allows the ~capture~ or rather the reconstruction of the dinosaur inside an incubator. Initiating a capture session requires having enough energy to fly the drone (represented by a stopwatch reaching zero) and a sufficient amount of darts, both of which can be earned in-game, recharged, or obtained through various supply points that are located around the map that work similar to PokStops. However, it is clear that this constant need for energy and darts ends up favoring the micro-transaction system which is obviously very intrusive into the fabric of the game. To learn more about the system, different types of darts are also proposed, such as the tranquilizer that blocks time, allowing you to hit the target for longer. There is a good amount of species present in the dinosaur catalog (currently around 100, but probably increasing) and they appear regularly within the map, although obviously with different frequency depending on the rarity and the consequent value of the animal. By collecting further DNA samples for each species already captured and investing a little in-game currency it is possible to evolve it obtaining various increases to the parameters of health, speed, damage and armor, while mixing the DNA of some particular species it is possible to obtain hybrids particularly powerful fantasy. The statistics of the dinosaurs come into play especially in PvP clashes, which stimulate the upgrades of their specimens in order to become increasingly competitive, but also in this respect the micro-transactions significantly simplify the action making the game, at least concerns this sector, dangerously close to the pay to win dynamic. The presence of prize boxes and random supplies that can be purchased only confirms this impression, even if it must be said that the single-player game suffers less from this compulsive buying tendency.", "date": "2018-05-31", "grade": "6.7"}
