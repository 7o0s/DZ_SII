It is therefore a ~reduced~ edition, in terms of dimensions and mechanics, compared to the one we reviewed a few months ago, but in the same way enjoyable and fun. You should all know the story of the film by now, and if you haven't seen it, we suggest you do so as soon as possible, given the quality of the product. In a world made entirely of LEGO, Emmett is a builder like many others, who wakes up every morning wishing everyone a good morning and goes to work smiling. One day, however, his life is turned upside down by the arrival of a girl who claims to know the way to restore the bond that once united the various ~dimensions~ of plastic bricks, and Emmett will have to play a key role in this plan. . Together with characters such as Vitruvius, Batman and even Unikitty, we will have to face fifteen zones, for a total of forty-five levels, which broadly follow the plot of the feature film and offer the usual gameplay of the LEGO series, with various environmental puzzles to be solved using peculiar to each element of the team, passing from one to another by pressing the icon at the top left. The iOS version of The LEGO Movie Videogame is confirmed to be rich, fun and long-lasting False start The first impact with the iOS version of The LEGO Movie Videogame is unfortunately not the best, due to the bad control system activated by default: a sort of RTS-style gestural solution that often and willingly understands whistles for fiascos, and which automatically sets at game over in the sections where you have to pay a minimum of attention to where you put your feet. Fortunately, it is enough to access the side screen of the options to replace this obscene system with a more traditional mix of virtual analog stick and buttons, which proves to be precise and quite reliable, even if the lack of automatic repositioning of the stick can sometimes result in incorrect movements. Having become familiar with the controls, which do not differ from the console versions of the various games in the LEGO series, one can therefore concentrate on the environmental puzzles typical of this franchise, on the fights and on the alternative sections in an endless runner style. The internships are quite short and therefore lend themselves to rapid and impromptu use, as well as to a certain degree of replayability, also due to the presence of achievements to be unlocked by performing certain actions or respecting particular timing. To act as a glue to the missions we find sequences taken from the film, subtitled in Italian (too bad they are not those of the Italian version of the feature film), which undoubtedly represent a pleasant bonus together with the possibility of unlocking as many as ninety different characters. And here some attempt to monetize comes into play, because it is true that The LEGO Movie Videogame costs 4.99 euros on the App Store (therefore a price above the average for the Apple platform, yet much lower than the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo versions 3DS of the same game), but to get certain minions you have to collect credits in not always plausible quantities. Hence the inevitable in-app purchases to unlock some extra characters more quickly and take advantage of their abilities to activate otherwise inaccessible devices. Beyond this parenthesis, the experience offered by the game is undoubtedly traditional and does not stand out for its originality, but it is confirmed as enjoyable and fun, however, offering a minimum of more challenge than usual, given that when game over occurs you have to start the internship all over again. The technical realization is excellent as regards characters and foreground elements, with lots of details and beautiful animations, but the very wide view shows the side to not exactly convincing backgrounds and an excessive miniaturization of the context.", "date": "2015-01-27", "grade": "7.5"}
