That is, let's analyze the elements that make up the game in question: a group of huge half-naked body builders with a strong passion for dance (including a polar bear and what appears to be a woman) find themselves running like desperate people in pursuit of a thief of ~proteins~ in a jar, who in escaping breaks through a series of walls through which the pursuers must pass assuming the correct posture to adapt to the shape obtained in the hole. This picture alone is enough to make us understand the level of nonsense reached by the game, but we must also add the particular characterization of the characters and the surrounding graphic elements, as well as the highly caricatured animations of the protagonists. So we find ourselves choosing our hero between a black man with a duck on his head, a polar bear in his underwear, a French gentleman with a mustache - among others - who will have to launch himself in pursuit of football players, aliens or androids in overalls close-fitting, while in the background countryside populated by improbable animals or crowded urban scenarios alternate. It goes without saying that the sight of all this concentrate of pure Japanese demented humor can only elicit several laughs, and it is precisely this particular characterization that raises the fortunes of a game that otherwise would have had very little to say, even if offered at the modest sum of 500 Nintendo Points. Even starting as an arcade arcade, complete with a special cabinet and peripherals in the shape of weights to be moved to assume the right poses, Namco Bandai has practically perfectly transferred the same contents within WiiWare, exploiting in this case the potential of the Remote Control + Nunchuck configuration. The result is at least a guaranteed laugh, even if we cannot speak of a properly enjoyable game. A mad march Whether you choose the multiplayer mode or the single mode, the structure of the game does not change: after selecting your avatar among the 7 crazy possibilities offered, we find ourselves at the end of a sort of steroid love train which, depending on the scenario chosen at the beginning, it will go through cities, countryside or space bases. In fact, the march starts after a malefactor (be it an American football player, alien or android) unduly takes possession of a jar of protein powder, launching himself into a desperate escape chased by body builders. The thief, running, destroys walls and other obstacles by passing through them and leaving shapes of different shapes: the player, chasing him, will have to adapt to the shapes in question in order to cross the obstacle without wasting too much time. It is therefore a question of assuming different poses by moving the Remote Control and the Nunchuck according to four basic settings, which follow the classic positions of bodybuilders. There are very few seconds to identify the right position to carry out, under penalty of losing a unit of stamina, at the end of which the game over obviously starts. The marching companions are progressively eliminated from the race and when you are left alone against the thief, things start to get difficult: the pace undergoes a sudden acceleration until the final battle, in which we find ourselves furiously shaking and Nunchuck to reach the enemy and eliminate them with a group tackle. The multiplayer mode instead takes place as a sort of endurance in which the level has no end, taking place along a sort of rainbow that passes through the clouds and revolves around giant bean plants and with the players taking turns trying to get as far as possible. far as possible. However, since these are turn-based games, it is easy for the multiplayer to be discarded in favor of the richest single, perhaps played alternately by several users, however the presence of only 3 levels does not play in favor of the longevity of Muscle March. If we add to this the frustration given by the very little reaction time granted to the player in the most difficult levels and by the Remote Control and Nunchuck motion detection problems that seem to plague the game, it becomes clear that this title has some big gaps in terms of gameplay .", "date": "2010-04-06", "grade": "6.5"}
