Although the idea is by no means new in the world of video games - just think of works such as Braid or the now ancient Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time - this choice is unusual in the genre to which this product belongs. As fans of old school titles will already know, Super Time Force was developed by Capybara Games, a Canadian software house that in the past has stood out for projects such as Superbrothers: Sword and Sorcery and Critter Crunch, both of which have landed exclusively on iOS devices. The Ultra edition arrives on Sony consoles a few months after the update carried out on the Xbox One version, which last April had introduced - free of charge for all users who already own the original product - other Challenge levels, a new Ultra Force mode and new Gamerscore achievements. At the moment the Ultra edition is also an integral part of the PlayStation Plus Instant Gaming Collection for the month of September, and can therefore be downloaded free of charge for all those who are already subscribed to the service. Super Time Force Ultra is frenetic but also tactical and offers many interpretations Playstation 4 trophies Super Time Force Ultra is supported by 34 Trophies and of these we have five gold and six silver. Much of it is related to completing the campaign or executing specific attack techniques. A well-matched team The improbable events narrated in the game begin in Philadelphia in 1987, when the experiments carried out by Dr. Repeatski open the door to time travel and start an invasion by robotic troops known as Blounbots. Just to deal with this threat, Repeatski creates a super-trained special unit and decides to call it The Super Time Force, giving himself the goal of going back to previous eras and rewriting history to his liking, with the aim of improving the present and eliminate the dangers. To put a spanner in the works is Dr. Infinity, who intends in every way to avoid repercussions due to the change in history. The crucial feature of this game rests on very peculiar time management and rewinding mechanisms, which draw a clear line of demarcation compared to the canonical 2D shooters we have always been used to. Through this structure it is in fact possible to carry out one's own raids and strategically rewind time in key moments, letting the actions already recorded take their course, while at the same time further attacks can be prepared from different strategic positions. This solution is called Time-Out and allows you to save a member of your team by progressively rewinding the scene, a bit as if you were in front of a recorded tape. To expand the spectrum of alternatives there is also the Team-Up function, which in specific moments allows you to merge the current character with the ghosts of actions already performed previously. Through this operation, power and fire techniques can be doubled, but also a cumulative number of lives can be obtained which can guarantee a better chance of surviving longer. Moreover, a balancing act has also become necessary through the preparation of a timer which must not run out before the completion of each stage, combined with a reduced number of rewinds. As was pointed out by the guys from Capybara, the original intention was that the rewind following the death of a character would automatically bring the player back to the beginning of the level. The developers soon realized that, by doing so, the experience would be excessively frustrating and punishing and would also have negative influences on the design of the worlds and bosses. In short, the decision to include greater freedom of choice and tactics has certainly benefited the production, also making it more understandable through a ~trial and error~ mechanism that appears essential to properly get in tune with such a fragmented and layered gameplay. Just like in the original version, the initial team that makes up the Super Time Force is made up of three elements, equipped with heterogeneous abilities. While the massive Jean Rambois is dedicated to heavy weapons, the slender Aimy uses special projectiles that ricochet off the walls and, when loaded, pass through the walls. Finally there is little Shieldy, who uses a shield to both parry andto fight back. In addition to the three basic members, in the course of history it will be possible to obtain further agents, who will have to be brought to safety within some levels and then enrolled in their ranks. Among the bonus characters of the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita editions there are also some nice new features, including the Journey avatar and the in-game reproduction of Shuei Yoshida, president of SCE Worldwide Studios. The six worlds that must be visited cross the most diverse eras, going from the prehistoric period in which dinosaurs were still present up to the contemporary era, also passing through the myth of Atlantis and the medieval era. The peculiarity of the proposed experience is certainly to be rewarded and it is no coincidence that at its inception the game was evaluated positively by critics. The mix of frenetic action, along the lines of classics such as Contra or Metal Slug, blends in an original way with the strategic essence that underlies the space-time alteration, through which the planning of the following move and the management are also enhanced. of resources. Nonetheless, there are also some more or less obvious defects, which cannot be ignored. First of all, the difficulty in managing the movements and jumps with respect to addressing the blows, a dynamic that creates many annoyances in the phases on foot but which proves to be even more uncomfortable in the segments to be covered on board a jet-pack. Secondly, reservations have emerged regarding the balance of the characters and their different specific weight, which can lead the player to use some more than others, to the detriment of variety.", "date": "2015-09-04", "grade": "8.0"}
