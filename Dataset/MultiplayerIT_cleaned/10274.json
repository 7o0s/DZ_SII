Roughly anyone who has remotely followed the development of the film has in mind the setting of the film, or an alien planet to which a human is sent in the role of one of its inhabitants, however, the blue humanoids called Na'vi. Although the setting is the same, for the game it was chosen not to follow the plot of the film version, precisely so as not to affect its vision in the face of the subsequent release of the game. So here is that the result, from the point of view of the narrative, becomes quite dull and not very incisive, limiting itself to acting as a glue at the various levels. On iPhone, Avatar is essentially an action game with large doses of combat and platform sections; in reality the game designers have made an effort to offer as much variety as possible, and the levels are in fact full of alternative sections with furious sliding down from the branches of the trees, fights with the bosses, sections in flight, villages to explore and so on. Unfortunately the basic gameplay is not able to support such interesting efforts in this sense, since it brings with it some unpleasant defects that compromise, at least in part, the overall quality of the title. Above all the management of the camera, fixed and therefore impossible to modify by the player; this entails numerous problems of evaluating the perspective and framing the objectives which can prove to be dramatic especially during some particularly demanding sections of platforms or during fights, where perhaps one finds oneself being attacked by enemies who have simply disappeared from the default view. Frustration is therefore around the corner, and the infinite lives and the generous checkpoints distributed along the protagonist's path help little. Even the combat system denotes some shortcomings, more generally linked to its excessive simplification; whether you use a rifle or a bow or a stick, all you have to do is tap the attack button repeatedly to be able to get the better of your opponents. The very linear and uninspired level design therefore makes the progression not particularly pleasant; Avatar therefore seems like a game destined to focus more on quantity than on quality, and the considerable length of the adventure is symptomatic of this observation. Where, on the other hand, the Gameloft title earns a rather convinced promotion is in the technical component, thanks to a 3D graphics engine capable of grinding a good number of polygons with discrete agility, so as to recreate a world full of details and colors. Certainly some weaknesses such as the inconsistent quality of the textures or the dancer frame rate catch the eye, but this does not change the overall quality of the product that much.
