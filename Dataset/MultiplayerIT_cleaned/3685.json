{"name": "Close to the Sun", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/close-to-the-sun-recensione.html", "text": "Close to the Sun whose review you are reading is the latest creature from Storm in a Teacup, a talented Roman team that we know for their undeniable ability to outline particular and engaging atmospheres. And these are precisely the pillars on which this hybrid between survival horror and sci-fi adventure is based, a disturbing first-person journey aboard a majestic ship, the Helios, created by Nikola Tesla to host legions of scientists committed to improving the world. Tesla himself, the digital counterpart of the famous inventor and physicist, shaped the modernity of the alternative past of Close to the Sun with his inventions bordering on the revolutionary and the terrifying, on the one hand created to lead humanity towards a better future but on the other, destined, perhaps inevitably, to be dangerous. And it is precisely the harmful effects of an extraordinary discovery that drag Rose Archer, the protagonist of which we play, on the huge scientific ship, in the footsteps of her younger sister, a brilliant scientist who was involved in a mysterious accident. Hybrid soul Close to the Sun, set in an 1890 full of extraordinary futuristic machinery, owes much to Bioshock, for some a digital symbol of Art Deco and for others perfect for the definition of dieselpunk, and it is an evident debt in the style, in the colors, in the lights and in the plot itself, centered around a utopian society of scientists fleeing the smallness of the modern world. The initial sequence, among other things, seems almost a tribute to the 2K Games title that we find several times crossing the huge vessel that houses the entire adventure, a cemetery of mangled bodies and memories within which only a few move survivors, some prey to madness and others destined to end up murdered by strange presences before our eyes. But the plot takes a very different path from its source of inspiration and the gameplay, even in first person, follows a path that does not include powers, weapons or firefights. The protagonist, the journalist Rose Archer, is not a fighter and neither is she destined to become one over the course of ten chapters that mix mechanical and environmental puzzles, exploration and sudden escapes, the only remnants of action from a first-person adventure that arises halfway between a survival horror based on scare jumps and a walking simulator. A soul, the latter, which manifests itself through evocative environments, writings, clues and remnants of a past which manifests itself to us through mysterious visions made of energy. Then, from time to time, the rhythm suddenly changes. An accident, a jump, a shadow, the appearance of an implacable threat that forces us to flee. Brief moments of action that alternate with more staid moments, perhaps too dominant in the first phase of the game, which however leave room for a universe made up of clues, pieces of newspaper, letters, posters and collectibles to look for in environments that can be rather large, comprising an entire district of the town built in the bowels of the gigantic Helios. And it is here that the details of the surrounding world emerge, a past that is partly real, as emerges from articles such as those on Jack the Ripper, and partly invented between diplomatic incidents, kidnappings and remnants of a clash fought with spies between Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. In all of this, the attention to detail is evident and gives depth to an already suggestive setting. But the atmosphere is not always enough to fill the gaps: some sections of the ship are visibly less well-finished than others, several puzzles are so easy as to be almost superfluous and sequences such as the race towards a huge coil that emits lethal discharges are made rather approximately. But this applies to many situations in which the narration, however central, leaves the door open to flashes of action that usually see us engaged in fleeing from madmen or strange creatures made of energy or calculating the time so as not to end up burned or electrocuted . The main problem we find in the rigidity of the protagonist and in the mechanics of overcoming obstacles that force us to click with the pointer in a certain point to activate the animation that allows us to pass over barricades, slip into tunnels or activate switches. And this approach returns a cumbersome and unnatural action, even if in any case capable of retaining its usefulness in increasing our heart rate which in some situations risks slowing down too much. An engaging work The more or less effective alternation between scare jumps, escape sequences and moments of exploration marks the rhythm of a game thatto work it relies on time both in substance, made up of a continuous alternation of accelerations and braking, and in the plot. And the latter exploits temporal anomalies not only as a function of key events in history but to populate an almost deserted ship with intangible manifestations that allow us to find out what happened in an area before our arrival. Some visions belong to a past before the Helios disaster while others are closer in time, but whatever their nature they play an important role in the game economy, functioning as clues and fillers useful for populating a deserted ship, the protagonist of an experience that in the first chapters is far too slow. Then, as the finale approaches, the dialogues increase, the narrative condenses and the experience becomes more exciting, losing a pinch of mystery which is replaced by apocalyptic glimpses, huge machinery and dramatic twists. And towards the epilogue, a marginal issue for most of the experience, it finally becomes the protagonist, at least for a few sequences, until it gives shape to the finale that crowns the relationship, lacking in great depth but effectively achieved, between the two sisters Archer. Of course, from the first sequences we would have expected something more from the temporal dimension, with a greater presence of time and its crossroads in the game and narrative mechanics, but the story works and we don't miss a couple of science hits perhaps not particularly original but effective. And this thanks to the work that Storm in a Teacup has reserved for involvement, starting with the renunciation of the graphic interface in a game that guides us through the considerations of the protagonist, the suggestions of the allies and the figures of energy. The ten chapters that guarantee an average longevity, to be commensurate with the price of course, and destined to grow by exploring the various rooms in search of collectibles and details. The experience, it must be said, is rather linear and is destined to end with a single playthrough, but in some situations the illusion of a certain opening is there, the details abound and the exploration is pleasant. Some environments, it must be said, suffer from less detail, from a visible repetitiveness of some assets and from choices probably linked to the limits of production, decidedly evident in the case of the models and animations of the creatures that chase us. But there are moments in which amazement wins among huge halls, a spectacular theater and generators surrounded by lightning that produce reflections and refractions everywhere, highlighting a good use of Unreal Engine 4. Let it be clear, we repeat, there are limits and in some cases they are obvious, to the point of being annoying if you don't accept the inevitable compromises related to production values, but the developers have done a good job of hiding them, giving us an enjoyable adventure, provided you appreciate a mix that doesn't allow none of the parts to emerge, topped off with a quality Italian dubbing, fully playable in maximum detail on a GTX 1650 and supported by an effective ambient soundtrack. All already available exclusively on the Epic Games Store and destined to arrive, in the near future, also on PS4 and Xbox One.", "date": "2019-05-02", "grade": "8.0"}
