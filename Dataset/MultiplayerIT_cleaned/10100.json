In fact, since 2011 the Redmond software house has accustomed us to playing a new chapter of the famous racing game series every year. Every year until 2018 - 2019 if we want to include Forza Street in the pile, but perhaps it would be better to pretend it never existed - because after that date something must have broken in the iron alternation between Turn 10 Studios' Forza Motorsport and Playground Games' Forza Horizon. And when in the summer of last year, in the midst of all the noise associated with the various announcements and reveals of the new generation of consoles, Microsoft had made us glimpse a very first teaser of the simulation chapter, we would have bet any thing about a Forza Motorsport release (8) right at the launch of the new Xbox Series X and S. But the reality was quite different: 2020 did not see any Forza arriving on the market and it was up to the Playground Games guys to put a patch (and what a patch!) interrupting the tradition. Just 3 years after the previous Forza Horizon we therefore found ourselves in our hands a new disruptive chapter that kept us glued to TV and monitors for the entire duration of the intense and compressed review session. Buckle up because now we will try to explain to you in this review of Forza Horizon 5 why this fifth installment of the arcade series deserves to be played for as long as possible. Forza Horizon: The Arcade Series A beautiful car in one of the urban environments of Forza Horizon 5 Let's start from the basics with a quick summary of the key elements of this series. Horizon is to all intents and purposes the arcade soul of the Forza saga: where Motorsport focuses on simulation, on track driving with the sole aim of shaving tenths of seconds at each lap by finding the best set-up for your car, Forza Horizon responds with a caciarone open world where what matters is the driving experience and fun behind the wheel, leaving aside any worries about tuning, times, tires or any other element that could affect driving performance. Now, let's be clear, with this we absolutely do not want to say that Forza Horizon is easy and trivial to play given that at the base of the title there are clearly races, events and competitions where finishing first is a predominant element, albeit not a fundamental one. And at the same time the tuning, the management of the mechanics, as well as the boundless love for ~car porn~, are always present despite the strong arcade nature. However, it is clear how the focus of the Horizons is very different and distinct from Motorsports and, with the due distances and measures, could be more reminiscent of the late Need for Speed and Burnout more than the various Assetto Corsa, Gran Turismo and Dirt.Forza Horizon 5 is therefore presents as an open world of vast dimensions, entirely set in a condensed reinterpretation of Mexico, where the player will find himself moving seamlessly from the asphalt of the tracks and roads to the uneven terrain of mule tracks and hilly paths, to the damp loam of the jungle, to the sand of splendid tropical beaches, up to the dark gravel of the Gran Caldera volcano which dominates the entire playing area. Head-to-head on rough terrain in Forza Horizon 5 Every square meter visible in the game can be reached on board a car and, as is the tradition of the series, all this abundance of routes will be perfectly amalgamated in a credible and realistic scenario, enriched by small towns, cities, villages, rural buildings, courses fordable waterways and even ancient ruined Aztec temples. If the blue coast of Forza Horizon 2 amazed you, the rich Australia of Forza Horizon 3 involved you and the rainy Great Britain of Forza Horizon 4 fascinated you, know that this fifth chapter really represents the perfect sum of everything Playground Games has been able to bring up to date on consoles and PC. The change of director from the historic Ralph Fulton to the very young and likeable Mike Brown has obviously benefited this spin-off series which, from chapter to chapter, has been able to improve: from given the completeness of Forza Horizon 5 it is truly emblematic and while having to maintain a minimum of reserve on the variety of multiplayer and on the future structure of the various seasons of additional content, the so-called Festival Playlist, in this chapter it seems that a truly balance has been reached perfect between guided events, progression and number of freely performable activities. Countryside In Forza Horizon 5 you can optfor the inside view We repeat it once again: Forza Horizon 5 has the typical structure of open world action adventures. This means that the player has a freely explorable map that encompasses the various biomes and, in addition to being able to roam the streets freely in search of collectibles to collect or human opponents to challenge, the fulcrum of the game is in the myriad of activities that we can reach, activate and play. Despite being a racing game it is in fact always evident how much Forza Horizon is inspired by that archetype of open world that we are used to seeing in other genres: the title does not immediately throw us against a ton of events that risk only to overwhelm the player, but it does so progressively, with a range of possibilities that gradually widens according to the time available to the player and the ways in which he usually explores the map of an open title. From this point of view, the fifth chapter of the Playground Games series really seems to have treasured the main criticisms of the 2 previous episodes which turned out to be either too dispersive or, on the contrary, excessively guided. Here is a mix that seemed particularly successful and above all very stimulating to keep the player glued to the pad for as long as possible, making him perceive an adequate sense of progression, but without ever making him feel locked in a golden cage. A street race in Forza Horizon 5 The structure of the campaign is in fact very clever and directly linked to this freedom of execution granted to the player. At any time we will be free to carry out any activity among those unlocked, repeat those already carried out previously to achieve new records or complete some bonus objectives or try to challenge other players in multiplayer competitions; whatever our selection, the game will reward us with recognition points. Consider them a sort of prize for the approximately 2000 objectives in which all the interactive elements of Forza Horizon 5 can be disassembled. Complete any race? You will be able to unlock the related achievement and earn a certain number of recognition points. Do you explore a certain area or find a certain graffiti or monument? Other achievements and recognition points. Do you unlock a certain number of cars or do you focus on customizing liveries or mechanical components? More achievements and recognition points. Basically anything you can do in this Horizon has some achievement that can be unlocked and this will give you recognition points. Every time you reach a certain number of points, you will have access to a new sticker that you can literally attach to the 6 tickets that make up the Forza Horizon 5 campaign, called the Horizon Adventure, and which represent the 6 macro-categories of activities that you can first unlock and then play in the game. To go into detail: there is the Horizon general stage which is where the game starts, road racing, dirt racing, cross country competitions, stunts and street racing. Each of these categories has its own ticket and each ticket has 3 or 4 stickers which usually unlock a very particular exhibition, such as the race against a freight train or a challenge with some jet ski pilots, or thematic stories to episodes that will allow you to follow real stories divided into episodes, such as a career in Lucha Libre or as a stunt for a famous actor who is not very good at driving. There are also particularly long and intense races that will take you around the Mexico of Horizon and, of course, the first sticker will always unlock the type of race that gives the ticket its name. Some cars in Forza Horizon 5 are convertibles The peculiarity is that this progressive unlocking will be completely in the hands of the player: we are given total freedom to choose how to earn recognition points as well as the option in our hands to opt between unlocking a new ticket to enable new challenges or purchasing an additional sticker for a previously unlocked ticket to activate additional exhibits or side activities. 'is a stimulus that is not limited to the simple desire to complete all the icons that appear on the map, but a purpose is perceived, a path to follow if you pass us the metaphor. At least until you complete the whole adventure, at which point there will still be dozens of activities to do and hundreds of achievements to unlock. Just for information, it took us about 25 hours dedicating ourselves for a long time to many secondary activities for the sole sake of completing them and possibly replaying them, perhaps to reach the first position. But it is clear that everyone will have their own personal experience with this Forza and it is easy to imagine that many players will quickly reach 100 hours without having seen the total content on offer. Online and multiplayer Preparations for a multiplayer Horizon Tour in Forza Horizon 5 The generosity of Forza Horizon 5 can also be seen on the multiplayer front. As per the tradition of the series, our navigation in the open world will be enriched by the presence of other players online. We will see them whizzing through the streets of fictitious Mexico, we will be able to challenge them and even talk to them through Forza Link: a system of verbal emoticons that we will be able to configure and then recall using the digital cross to have a minimum of interaction with those around us. Once inside then in the various competitions, we will have the usual Drivatar system managed by artificial intelligence and built according to the routines and specificities of our friends and the players met in the game. Moving on to the actual competitions, we can divide this Forza into 4 different multiplayer experiences. First of all there are the Horizon Tours: a cooperative activity that can be carried out with up to 5 players, basically friends or belonging to the same club (the guilds of Forza Horizon) and which involves the participation in a handful of competitions that will go carried out one after the other and whose ultimate goal will be to position itself at the top of the ranking by beating the other Drivatars. You sign up, there's a time limit for setting up your car and you start the races in sequence. Another head-to-head between very different cars: anything is possible in Forza Horizon 5 Another introduction is Horizon Arcade - a sort of random event that triggers for a limited time on the main map. Compared to the Tour Horizon does not include registration and matchmaking: the activity takes place directly in the open world involving all the other players connected in the area who will thus have to compete to reach a certain score before the round ends. In case everyone has contributed enough, we will move on to the next round and so on until the final recognition is reached. We will be free to leave and resume the Arcade at any time simply by moving away from or re-entering the area of interest for the activity. Then there are 2 other multiplayer components which instead provide for the use of the internal Forza menus, interrupting the game for a few seconds general flow of the game. The first activity is Horizon Open which allows you to join on the fly, through matchmaking, specific playlists of races on various terrains, drift competitions or 2 special exhibitions: the arena which through some variables can turn into a capture the flag or into a king of the hill and the eliminator which is Playground Games' take on modern battle royale instead. 72 pilots find themselves in a dedicated instance of the open world and through the honking of the horn you can challenge each other in small and rapid competitions: whoever loses ~dies~ and his upgrades pass into the hands of the winning pilot. It is also possible to recover car parts by wandering around the map and clearly there is no shortage of the external perimeter which shrinks over time forcing players to find themselves in an increasingly constricted game space. Last but certainly not least, is the Rivals mode, the only asymmetrical. This allows you to select a circuit and a specific class of car to embark on a competition based exclusively on lap times. Yours are recorded and another player can choose to challenge them at any time thus becoming a rival in an attempt to surpass that score and move up the official leaderboard to position themselves among the best rivals of the month. Preparations for a multiplayer challenge in Forza Horizon 5 Clearly it is too early to launch into discussions regarding the balancing and effective replayability of all these modes in the long term, but what we feel like saying in the review is how much Playground's competence and ability to offer is to be appreciated an extremely multifaceted multiplayer and perfectly blended into the open world structure of Forza. Even those who will choose to avoid multiplayer activities with knowledge of the facts will very often find themselves attracted by the possibility of joining an Arcade that may have started up a few kilometers from where they are and, at that point, the mere fact of being involved in a caravan", "date": "2021-11-04", "grade": "9.5"}
