The reason is easy to imagine: the control of Iranian oil wells. Historians attribute to those years the beginning of the decline of Iran which will lead to the revolution of 1979, with the exile of the last Shah of Persia, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the rise to power of Khomeinism, with all that it entailed . 1979 Revolution: Black Friday, tries to tell those days, but does it in an original way, at least for the videogame medium. The style chosen is that of TellTale-like adventures, i.e. in which the game mechanics are completely put at the service of the narrative. The player takes on the role of photojournalist Reza Shirazi who, having returned to Iran after having lived in Europe, wants to understand the reasons for the political situation in his country, on the verge of revolution. To do this, he gets involved in the events taking place and tries to tell them through his photographs, but ends up being exploited precisely because of them. But let's slow down and talk about the game system, which as you may have already understood from the word 'Telltale' is not particularly complex. For most of the nineteen chapters that make up the adventure, we are asked to make dialogue choices, which alternate the development of the narrative sequences. In some chapters we will take direct control of Reza to explore places and take some pictures. Each photograph unlocks a card that provides information on real events and allows you to test the historical reconstruction work carried out by the authors. Many of the photographs taken by Reza are in fact inspired by those that populated the newspaper reports of those days, both in the subjects and in the shots. In addition to the photographs, Reza can interact with some objects, always well indicated, to obtain other information. Finally, some sequences are real QTEs, i.e. interactive films that require pressing the right button (indicated on the screen), at the right time. Fortunately there aren't many and they can be overcome quite easily. We reviewed a particular title, which impressed us very much: 1979 Revolution: Black Friday The many Irans In short, from the description of the game system you should have recognized the Telltale matrix of 1979 Revolution: Black Friday, although the development team's goal is radically opposite to that of the American developer's works. There are not many cases of video games that have taken charge of telling the story. Someone will surely think of some strategic ones among the most demanding and well-finished ones, but it is not the same thing. iNK Stories has not simply used a historical fact of Iran to build a video game around it, but has tried to make us witnesses of what happened. Reza is a particular character, in a certain sense neutral with respect to what is happening: he is Iranian, but in the years before the revolution he did not live in Tehran. He knows Europe (he comes from Paris), has a western culture and does a job, that of the photographer, which naturally leads him to have to choose where and how to look. This is why it is the perfect pivot around which to rotate the debate on the motivations and methods of the revolution, but it is also the strongest image of a people who do not want to be associated only and always with religious obscurantism and want to make people understand world that, despite the impositions of the regime, before those unfortunate twenty years Iran was a modern country, even in its customs. To prove it, iNK Stories does not hesitate to let the player find period documents, all rigorously authentic, such as a series of home movies that show Reza's family immersed in a daily life made up of dance parties, short skirts, days at the beach or go to the countryside. Apparently these are superfluous additions, but they are not, because they enormously enrich the background against which the story is told. Tea without pastries 1979 Revolution: Black Friday is a profound title, particular in the choice of what it tells, but universal in its ability to stage dynamics and contrasts that unite all humanity. Of course, there are more successful characters, such as the torturer, and others less successful, such as some of the revolutionaries, but it is the general picture that is particularly convincing. However, it is true that some defects can annoy. For example, the beginning of an interactive movie was placed right at the exact moment in which a certain input needs to be given, with all the complications involved, while it clashes a bit withnarrative coherence the fact that the protagonist may die on certain occasions, given that the whole story is narrated by him. However, some situations could be handled differently and still be effective. Let's take an example: in one of the opening chapters a particularly fetid character offers us tea. It seems like an innocent action but the game asks us whether to drink it or not. Only after having made our decision are we provided with a card that explains the value of the tea offer in Iran and that of its possible refusal. In short, we confess that, being ignorant of Iranian culture, in order to make more conscious choices, we had to finish the game twice to first get information on some of the events (it's not very long anyway, so no problem). Expressive eyes Technically 1979 Revolution: Black Friday gets away with it, at least if we take it for what it is: a very brave independent production. Sure, some 3D models aren't the best and have slightly off details: especially the eyes sometimes seem like they're about to pop out of the characters' sockets. Nothing dramatic and, assuming you don't find yourself playing with a triple A, you soon end up not paying much attention to these trifles. A more significant flaw is the way the act of photographing is handled, which is very frequent throughout the adventure. Instead of simulating a real camera, a kind of minigame has been created: at the bottom of the screen is a fake exposure bar, on which an indicator runs. All you have to do to get a good shot is press the action key as the pointer passes through the center of the bar. It is certainly a simple and immediate system, but just as surely something more could have been done to simulate one of the most decisive gestures of the adventure, which is thus not very incisive. It would have been better to leave the burden of framing and shooting to the player, to make everything more natural. It will be for the next title.", "date": "2016-04-19", "grade": "8.3"}
