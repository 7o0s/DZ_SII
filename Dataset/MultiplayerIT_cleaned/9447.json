Even in Germany in the 1700s. But the executioner Heinrich still couldn't know it, especially when he lowered the heavy ax on Gretchen's neck, accused of witchcraft on a sad gallows. But that's the past, now reduced to an obsessive rush of flashbacks that only fuel feelings of guilt. A few years have passed, we are still in a dark and menacing medieval universe, populated by demonic creatures, magic and twilight landscapes. We find the wiry Heinrich, but he is very different from how we knew him. Little reassuring complexion, scars everywhere and a monstrous scythe extended towards the bad guys. We soon discover that our little dainty hero can't die, even if completely torn to pieces by enemies, just frantically pressing the A button will bring him back to his feet. As if that weren't enough we find a revived Gretchen, on the other hand with a witch everything is possible. This unlikely couple's paths come together for a dual purpose, Heinrich is cursed and must find a way back to mortal life, Gretchen has some unfinished business to settle. From here on out every goal will be achieved by four hands. Because I have you This in a nutshell is the preamble to Knights Contract, already guessed from the title itself, it is an action adventure based entirely on cooperation, whose ferocity is bizarrely mitigated by an atypical sentimentality. The Japanese software house Game Republic, former author of Folklore, is certainly not new to experiments, and from the first minutes of the game it breaks a heavy taboo, putting an invincible protagonist in the player's hand. The sense of omnipotence is brief though, the punishing side, and essentially what offers challenge, is represented by Gretchen's vulnerability. Our task is therefore to safeguard her safety, just as an efficient bodyguard would do, and if necessary restore her health bar by picking her up. In this situation it is impossible to carry out any offensive action, so the only thing to do is to run away from dangerous situations. Gretchen is not exactly a fool, her nature as a witch allows her to perform a variety of elemental magic, but her true offensive power comes from the combination with Heinrich's scythe. With this unusual fusion, the classic special moves are justified, which the protagonist would not be able to launch, but by recalling a specific magic with the back keys, a series of combinations with devastating effects are activated. We go from ice traps, picturesque beheadings or savage quarterings, and the same is true for the protagonist. It is not uncommon to see Heinrich completely torn to pieces during a fight, not before ending up in a state of daze that can be mitigated with the usual routine, or the wild pressure of the pad keys (unnerving in the long run). The downside is that in this condition it is not possible to protect Gretchen, and the poor artificial intelligence that manages it leads too easily to her death, and consequent Game Over. Xbox 360 goals 1000 player points divided over 50 objectives are waiting to be earned. We have a little bit of everything from collecting a certain number of souls, from 10,000 up to 100,000, to those related to completing the main story. The most challenging and full-bodied is the one that requires the completion of the game in the Witchslayer difficulty level, you will be rewarded with 40 points. Happy hunting immortals! I would, I would not ... The game continually tries to mix the cards on the table, placing enemies capable of parrying any frontal blow, and which require elusive maneuvers very similar to what has already been seen in the Bayonetta combat system, although much less refined. Added to this is a non-linear structure of the levels, played on the counter-times. It is not uncommon to find yourself in boss fights in the middle of a chapter, such as coming across real labyrinths, where a somewhat confusing exploration structure is proposed in the objectives. The inventory has timid RPG elements, with the possibility of investing the souls of fallen enemies to enhance spells and unlock new ones, nothing that hasn't already been seen in similar and better products. Each chapter ends with a clash with mighty enemies, which in the final part require the passing of sequences based on specific pad keys. In short, the infamous quick time events of the typically Japanese school, even these poorly implemented since failing leads the player into inconvenient situations, with the boss having recovered thepart of his energy and the obligation to repeat the sequence. An extremely frustrating routine, even if partially reduced by the fact that the keys to press are always the same. Knights Contract demonstrates an undoubtedly troubled gestation starting from the suffocating presence of films, functional to the narration, but really excessive in length and frequency, of extremely embarrassing quality and grafted into moments that violently interrupt the fluidity of the action. All in all, the technical sector is passable, with a good use of effects, normal mapping and pleasant textures, despite some drops in the framerate and an artistic direction that is certainly not inspired. It turns out to be a mystery how the cutscenes are so cheesy in comparison. A pity, since the story is also pleasant to follow, in some ways original and with characters that can be appreciated.", "date": "2011-02-28", "grade": "5.5"}
