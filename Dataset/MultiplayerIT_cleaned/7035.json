He started attracting attention early on with a Kickstarter fundraiser that exceeded all expectations, raising more than $38,000 of the $17,000 requested, all thanks to a thousand backers, a testament to how excited the project is. tastes of the most refined players. In order to better manage the development of the game, John Warner, head of the project, has decided to divide it into three chapters, which will be distributed at a distance of time from each other. What we are going to review below is the first chapter, dubbed in English with Italian subtitles. About four hours of intense gameplay, with a plot that concludes its narrative arc while leaving us on our toes. The protagonist of The Fall is ARID, the artificial intelligence of in a space suit that activates immediately after the human being inside the suit loses consciousness. The goal of A.R.I.D. is to find medical care for the host of the suit, which he must protect at any cost. A.R.I.D. he controls the suit, so he can move his host's body and decide what actions to take. The luminescent visor masks the face of that sleeping human being, of whom we only discover his name and military rank. A fascinating perspective, which opens up many questions as A.R.I.D. confronts itself, its limits and the artificial intelligences it meets along the way, evanescent synthetic personalities that confront us with the eternal dilemma of robotics: can a computer develop its own conscience? The Fall could very well be a very good written science fiction story. Luckily it's a video game, which with its refined writing doesn't make us regret the written page, and thanks to the naturalness with which action and story are mixed, it envelops us in an atmosphere that only the bright pixels of the screen can evoke. The Fall is one of the best products of the independent industry. The Fall is a logic adventure about an artificial intelligence questioning itself Thought and action The Fall is spread over two levels of play. The more immediate one of action, with the hero walking, running, jumping and fighting, and the one of interaction with objects, which takes place as in a point and click graphic adventure. The beam of light diffused by the flashlight attached to our gun illuminates sensitive areas of the screen, next to which a brief description of what they represent appears. In some cases they are objects that we can collect. By combining objects and sensitive points, or using the suit's abilities, we have to overcome obstacles in the form of puzzles. These are excellent examples of narrative-motivated environmental puzzles. We have never felt compelled to solve an arbitrary or surreal problem. And above all, every puzzle solved offers an immediate reward, because it advances the story and opens up new explorable areas. Regarding the difficulty of the puzzles, be prepared, because The Fall requires a lot of attention and lateral thinking to solve. Solving a problem often requires an approach somewhere between that of The Secret of Monkey Island and Metroid, the two inspiring titles of the project. Hybrids of this type rarely work in practice, but The Fall succeeds naturally, and also for this reason it is an atypical experience in a market that seems forced to constantly quote itself. Moreover, contrary to what happens in graphic adventures, if we sit still for a while mulling over a puzzle, the fact of being able to walk around with the freedom of movement of a scrolling action game lightens the mental effort. Especially thanks to the personality of A.R.I.D. dubbed by a convincing female voice, and to the dark and ironic lines of text written by John Warner, which illuminate even the simplest actions with meaning. Wait to enter the test area and you will understand what we are talking about. You will find yourself with a devilish grin from the sharp staging of the ideas and their sinister implications. A mind that is anything but dry The suit controlled by A.R.I.D. has advanced features, such as camouflage and gun activation. Unfortunately we cannot access it at will, because the artificial intelligence does not have the necessary permissions. On this point one of the most controversial passages of the game develops, because A.R.I.D. voluntarily endangers the life of its guest so as to force the systems to activate the blocked functions, thanks to an emergency protocol. This choice, which A.R.I.D. will always justify as necessary in order to proceedtowards medical resources, will be challenged by the mysterious antagonist of this first act of the game. Until the final twist, which comes after a series of touching events that lend themselves to different possible readings. The Fall is a refined gaming experience. The dark and disturbing sci-fi setting dialogues with the texts and with the game actions. Each character is carefully voiced, A.R.I.D. above all, who stands out as one of the most compelling and multifaceted ~female~ AIs in video games. The fights are very simple, with a cover system that you can enter and exit in time to kill your enemies. There is also the possibility of performing silent kills from behind, but the mechanics remain at an elementary level, suitable for the type of game, which needs to alternate the pace of the action without triggering a long cycle of death and rebirth to overcome a fight. The only drawback of The Fall are the controls. Already with a joypad it takes a while to get used to maneuvering the suit and interacting with the environment, if you are then forced to play with a keyboard, you may miss a few groans of intolerance. The subtitles in Italian, on the other hand, are the final touch that we didn't expect, and we are happy if they will allow The Fall to reach an even wider audience. Only on a couple of occasions have we seen English texts pop up by mistake. A flaw that will probably be fixed with a patch. Anyway, no big deal. The difficult thing will be being able to wait for the second act of the game. Because we don't see sci-fi titles on the horizon that can compete with the atmosphere and intelligence of The Fall.", "date": "2014-06-30", "grade": "8.8"}
