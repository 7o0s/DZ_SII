{"name": "Boom Blox - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/boom-blox-recensione.html", "text": "Last July, the announcement had created a mix of amazement and interest: Steven Spielberg and Electronic Arts together to create a certain number of games, with the famous director in the role of creator and project supervisor, at least on paper. The first fruit of this unexpected collaboration is Boom Blox, a puzzle game for Wii aimed at the most transversal audience possible and, as we will see, excellently made. The project takes advantage of the increasingly significant trend of the genre to rely on the extensive use of physics in order to solve the many proposed scenarios. An approach that proves to be doubly successful, allowing on the one hand to involve the player with simplicity, asking him to exploit the same Newtonian laws that govern his daily life to his own advantage, and on the other to count on a large number of variations and possible applications. In Boom Blox the hundreds of levels proposed are based however on the intensive exploitation of a couple of skills - throwing objects and taking others - and on the presence of some special blocks - explosive or with special physical and chemical characteristics - to be combined in order to make the as quickly or with as few strokes as possible the structures of increasing complexity present on the screen. Not a brilliant but tantalizing idea which, added to the amount of options inserted, returns a result full of fun. Blocks, love and fantasy That the developers have raised the rectangular parallelepiped as the inspiring muse of the entire work can be seen immediately, without having to destroy the constructions proposed in the various stages, when before anything else one is asked to decide which alter ego to make one's own: the choice go from a hen to a monkey, without forgetting penguins and puppies, all rigorously designed in an angular, square way; nothing decisive anyway, given that the decision only affects some aesthetic aspects. Far more significant is the presence of two different modes designed for the single player, with Explore characterized by a series of levels divided by objectives or specific types of blocks, and Adventure which instead seeks to unite several different dynamics by binding them from a slender uninspired plot. For both, upon their completion, the Challenge variants will be unlocked which differ from their basic versions for a greater complexity of situations and difficulty of completion. Whether you decide to start by solving puzzles built with bomb-bricks, crystal ones to be ruined on the ground or any other type, Boom Blox exalts thanks to the frenetic speed with which to complete each assigned task, perhaps repeating it several times to optimize your score and try to earn the prestigious gold medals. It could happen that you are able to attract someone to the sofa while playing, perhaps intrigued by the gameplay setting or by the repetitive and hypnotic soundtrack, and in that case all that remains is to show off the excellent multiplayer sector, the flagship beyond all expectations of this Boom Blox. Also in this case the scenarios are too many and too different from each other to receive an articulated treatment, but it suffices to know that starting from many of the ideas used for the single player experience, it has been possible to create a hundred of both competitive and cooperative levels for a up to four players, real-time with four wiimotes or turn-based with just one, as the case may be. The only real discordant note, if it can be defined as such, is perhaps an excessive ease perceivable by the more savvy players who in broad strokes could advance without encountering difficulties, if not marginal. The editor you don't expect Technically Boom Blox is a mix of good and less exciting things. If on the one hand physics is the absolute protagonist, proving to be precise and coherent, on the other hand the models and textures on the screen hardly prove to be up to the best productions for Nintendo Wii, not to mention that in situations with multiple objects in movement, or in correspondence with the most spectacular explosions or falls, various slowdowns do not fail to turn up one's nose. Well the commands that with just two buttons on the wiimote allow you to move the camera and interact by throwing or taking the blocks, respectively with B and A. Finally, the editor is the best you could ask for in this sense, with all the objects used by game designer plus others inserted as a bonus, available to the user and his imagination so as to be able to create any type of level, from the more traditional ones to variants of famous games - checkers is offered as an example, chess and the like are can be created in just a fewinstants  then shareable with friends via Wii-Connect 24. Steven and video games Boom Blox is the first in a series of titles that EA and Steven Spielberg are planning to produce through this collaboration. Nothing is known about those to come, except that one of these should be an action game, but it is worth remembering that the director of The Duel and Indiana Jones has already been involved in similar operations in the past: his is the idea at the base of the Medal of Honor series and always his is also that of the justly less famous The Dig, a forgettable 1995 adventure for DOS and Mac OS. Comment Fun and long-lived, immediate and profound, Boom Blox is a title that was missing on the Wii and that will be able to delight all owners of the white Nintendo house, who regardless of age will find hundreds of good reasons, as many as the levels, to complete this puzzle game full of ideas and strong in a physics engine of remarkable workmanship. Both, single and multiplayer, have been designed and built to squeeze the most out of the simple starting setting, with the latter in particular which will be able to fill the evenings in the company of friends and carry on the now traditional conviviality promoted by the console.
