It is a managerial game designed expressly for mobile devices and characterized by a basic philosophy that is the Japanese one, in many ways distant from ours: you can see it in the reactions of players and the public to certain situations, in the accuracy of our reports assistant and in a whole series of facets that you will not fail to grasp during the games. The system asks us a few questions before letting us begin our journey as club owners, trying to understand what kind of team we have in mind to create and what our ambitions are, and then makes sure that the team matches those expectations. We will therefore find ourselves taking over a company doomed to bankruptcy, bringing new liquidity into the coffers in concert with a commercial job for the search for new sponsors and with the basic job of scouting for new talent to introduce into the workforce, be it of young beginners, experienced athletes or international stars. We get a little lost in the folds of the many dialogues and contextual menus, but in reality the gameplay of SEGA Pocket Manager is simple and immediate, and in its own way takes up the mechanisms of traditional productions, like Football Manager 2019, even without come to offer the same level of precision and accuracy. Gameplay and structure From the main screen of the game it is possible to access the section dedicated to scouting, which works through the use of one of the many available currencies (cash, gold coins, tickets, etc.) but which, especially at first, proves to be very generous and allows you to put together a good group of players in a very short time, effectively creating an already fairly competitive team with which to fight for the transition to the top category, if that is the path you are following. Then there is the section relating to the effective management of the team, where substitutions are decided, the form and it is possible to select individual athletes to possibly subject them to targeted training, which can improve their skills and unlock new, spectacular skills to use on the field. Further options are accessible only after a few hours, but what matters most of all is obviously the calendar of events, from which the next match can be kicked off. Select a simple strategic setup among those available (play defense, prioritize goals, give everything in the first minutes, etc.), you move on to the simulation of the match, which can be enjoyed in its entirety, speeded up at various levels or simulated in the round of a few seconds, the latter choice which however practically takes away all the pleasure of watching the excellent three-dimensional graphics engine in action with ~chibi~ version football players, which give life to engaging actions and finalizations of great visual impact. The official FIFPro and Japanese league licenses guarantee a certain number of real clubs and players, but SEGA Pocket Club Manager at the moment does not yet include our league: a lack that for some could be a big problem, but which in no way undermines the enjoyment of the experience. Rather, it is the freemium model adopted for the occasion, which leaves a lot of freedom in the early hours and in the first championships, to then present the inevitable bill with an increase in difficulty that does not go hand in hand with the progression of the team and therefore pushes towards monetization. Nothing very serious, you still manage to go ahead without paying, but you have to put in a little more effort and at that point the enthusiasm could wane.", "date": "2019-04-26", "grade": "7.8"}
