{"name": "Empire: Total War - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/empire-total-war-recensione.html", "text": "The guys at Creative Assembly have always known how to read gamers' minds, perhaps because they share this great and common passion with them: after making us experience and relive, far and wide, the classical period (Rome: Total War) and the medieval (Medieval: Total War), it was really time to change the era. In fact, trying to perfect the last chapter of the saga would have meant simply introducing graphic improvements and some slight changes to the gameplay, bringing everything closer to a restyling than to a real new game. The developers have therefore preferred to take the more difficult path, namely to revolutionize a genre of which they are the creators themselves, given that the name Total War is synonymous with a certain level of quality and certain game mechanics, refined and complex, but not boring for that. Before throwing ourselves into the analysis of this new chapter, for the sake of completeness we prefer to make a brief point of the situation for all newbies: the main peculiarity of the Total War saga, which began way back in 2000, consists in the fact that the turn-based (Civilization style) are cleverly amalgamated and integrated with real-time skirmishes (here the predecessors are many, from Ground Control to Age of Empires), asking you to manage your empire both from the point of view of macro-management, therefore building construction, recruitment of units and positioning on the game map, both from a tactical point of view, facing your opponent directly on the battlefield, passing from two dimensions to 3D, from turn-based structure to real-time. The reason for the success of this saga should not be found only in the high general quality, but much more simply in the fact that the developers have managed to save both the goat and the cabbage, entering the good graces of both patient lovers of turn-based strategy games, both of the most frantic fans of real-time titles. The evolution of the species (and it's not Spore!) As we said, the migration from the Middle Ages to the eighteenth century was not possible simply by removing armor, swords and castles and replacing them with rifles, cannons and forts, but the developers wanted and had to review the game mechanics, trying to preserve the structure as much as possible original of their title. Starting from the same strategic map, no longer limited to Europe alone, but extended to practically the rest of the world: you will therefore be able to move your troops between the Old and the New continent, without disdaining a little visit to the Asian regions. In addition, however, to the expansion of the game map, the developers have also overturned the management of the regions: while in the previous episodes a region was essentially governed by a more or less imposing city, in Empire: Total War this approach to Risk to favor a more likely one. You will find local resources on the regional territory, around which you will have to build increasingly complex improvements to increase your income and obtain other bonuses, in addition to the mother city, the possession of which will determine the control of the region, but in addition there will be a series of settlements which, depending on your government, can grow and evolve from small and insignificant villages into large and important cities, bringing to your empire interesting returns in economic terms and beyond. You will, of course, be free to influence their development: a village can host a foundry or a fish shop, thus increasing regional revenues, or a college that will speed up scientific progress or, again, an inn to make the inhabitants of that region happy. The strategic map is therefore enriched with many other elements to take into consideration and the management of your empire, especially if and when you decide to expand it, will take you quite a long time, requiring meticulous attention to each region under your control: unlike of Medieval 2, where the difficulty of making ends meet was a challenge for real accountants, in Empire: Total War all management has been made much simpler, despite the introduction of new elements to administer, so much so that during all our tests we have practically never had financial problems, even on the highest difficulty level. On the battlefield Like it or not, sooner or later, you will find yourself having to deal with another military power and it is here that the Total War series has made its fortune: every time you start a battle, be it land or sea, you will be called to manage Ofyour troops in the field, transforming what until now had been a strategic title into a game of pure tactics. In Empire the clashes follow the same guidelines as the Total War series, with some interesting new features: first of all, the scenarios are much richer not only in static elements, such as fences, buildings and low walls, with which you can interact directly to obtain advantages tactical (such as greater protection from bullets, for example), but also a decidedly richer terrain morphology, with hills, small hills, vast plains and woods. This greater variety will allow you to choose from an infinite number of new possible tactics, making each battle unique: depending on the composition of your army and that of the enemy, you can choose whether to face him in an open field on the plain, or prefer healthy urban warfare between the houses of a village, or even opt for ambushes and quick attacks with units camouflaged in tall grass or trees. The introduction of firearms, and their rapid diffusion, has also completely changed the way of tackling battles: while in Medieval 2, essentially, everything boiled down to hand-to-hand pileups, in Empire the vast majority of clashes it will take place over a distance, with hundreds of infantry pelting each other with musket shots. This radical change in gameplay, which will impose completely different tactical choices to those to which the series had accustomed you, will immediately make you understand that it will no longer be just the amount of troops deployed that will make the difference, but especially their ability. Science Technological evolution has always been important in the Total War series, but in Empire it really represents a fundamental aspect: get ready, at the beginning of the game, to see your musketeers massacred by the more traditional weapons of the natives, such as arrows and axes, while if fight on European soil and you'll find yourself commanding militias who trudge along in unison and take minutes to reload their weapons. The keyword that will haunt you throughout the first few rounds of the game will be disorganization and inefficiency, in which only the number of your soldiers can make a difference and, very often, you will witness disastrous defeats against the Native Americans. But, as you make discoveries in the military field, your armies will increasingly take on a professional and organized appearance: just to give two examples, the ~line fire~ technology will allow you to also fire the lines following the first, guaranteeing higher rate of fire, while the study of the ~square formation~ will secure your general and, at the same time, allow your troops to fire in all four directions, so as to avoid the risk of being attacked from the sides or from behind. All technologies, divided into military, productive and social research, will have to be researched in special buildings called colleges, one of the possible evolutions of one of the aforementioned villages: the larger the college will be, the greater the number of famous scholars who will work there. the lower the number of turns you will have to wait in order to make a technological progress. The importance of being the most technologically advanced was already a very important factor in Medieval 2: Total War, but in Empire it is absolutely fundamental: by deploying better quality units you will no longer have to worry about being numerically inferior, but you can focus only on the tactician of the clash, both on land and on the sea. Finally! Speaking of sea battles, all the previous chapters of the Total War saga provided for an automatic resolution of naval battles which made creating a fleet with which to dominate all the seas absolutely secondary (and not very fun). One of the great innovations introduced by Empire: Total War is precisely the possibility of taking part, exactly as if it were a land battle, in battles between ships. Given the vastness of the game map, which covers three different continents, the need to have a fleet capable of ensuring a peaceful transport of your troops across the various oceans has become absolutely necessary: now, through the various shipyards scattered in your regions, you can choose from a vast selection of battleships, taking care to create fleets as heterogeneous as possible. In fact, the choice of always and only opting for flagships or fifth-rank ships, with very high firepower, but very little manoeuvrability, would make you decidedly too vulnerable against a small swarm of barque, much less powerful, but decisivemuch faster. Once a battle has begun, in addition to choosing the arrangement of your ships, you will have to worry about assigning them a target (and in this way the artificial intelligence will manage the fight), or directly command your ships, choosing direction, speed, possible maneuvers and you'll also have control of the cannons on both sides, so you can decide the best time to open fire. As happened in reality, naval battles often resulted in a ballet in an attempt to bring the opposing ship against the wind, approach laterally and bombard it continuously and then, once the crew was decimated, proceed with the boarding and capture of the ship. The naval battles are undoubtedly very interesting and represent a nice breath of freshness within the saga: we must admit that, when the ships involved in battle begin to be a large number, it will be impossible for you to carefully administer all your vessels and more than once you will forget to issue orders, leaving your ship motionless in the middle of the ocean. Despite this large-scale management problem and some historical inaccuracies (ships being boarded can continue to shoot cannon fire at each other, for example), naval battles are absolutely fun and enrich the Total War saga with a new, interesting element: being the first experiment of Creative Assembly we feel we can forgive these mistakes, confident that through patches and future chapters of the series, the naval battles component will also be further improved. Some flaws Notwithstanding that Empire: Total War is one of those addictive strategic titles, which will hit you with the ~one more turn~ syndrome, it must be admitted that it is not free from defects, however: the most serious, according to our point of view , is the excessive simplicity of the whole game. While in Medieval 2: Total War the maximum difficulty level represented a real hell, where not a single turn passed in which some nation did not declare war or suffered some sudden enemy incursion, in Empire the discourse changes completely. Even at the highest level of difficulty we have never had problems in land or naval battles, even when we were in conditions of clear disadvantage, both in terms of numbers and technology: the problem is essentially attributable to a decidedly too little aggressive artificial intelligence and who does not know how to make the most of their strengths, while on the strategic map it all boils down to playing against decidedly too passive opponents. More than once it has happened to be able to declare war on a nation, conquer a region and then ask for a peace treaty, so as to be able to reorganize our troops in complete tranquility and avoid their counterattack, which surely would have led us to lose the region acquired. We are aware that this, despite being a problem of some relevance, can be easily solved with a patch, but at present it represents a significant drop in the level of challenge and it will be unlikely you will have problems dominating the map after a few dozen rounds , then imposing his will on any other nation. The other major downside are the loading times when starting a battle or when you have to go back to the strategic map: even on top-of-the-range computers, the game pauses for a good minute before allowing us to continue to play, which represents an annoying interruption that slightly breaks the rhythm of the game. Longevity In terms of replayability, Empire: Total War offers the classic Campaign mode, where you will take control of one of the many nations available and you will have to conquer a certain number of regions to win the game, but you can also try your hand at a single adventure player that will make you experience the story of the first English settlers landed in America, up to the war of independence and the relative foundation of the United States. Each nation will start with a different economic and military situation, with the consequent need to develop different strategies: playing with the British will allow you to count on a strong and well-established economy, with a consequent decidedly interesting military situation; instead, playing with the state of Venice or that of Savoy will be much more problematic, since you will count on a single, single region and you will be surrounded by enormous superpowers, all interested in annexing you under their control. The multiplayer then proposes the classic game modes introduced in the series and already present in the previous one", "date": "2009-03-05", "grade": null}
