Since the launch of the Nintendo game, Piazza Coloropoli has been a lively hub full of activities and shops on every corner. On one side is the Atelier Celenteron, with tables outside and T-shirts in the window, you can buy new gadgets at the Macal shop or redo your paraphernalia at Armand's shop; on the opposite side it is possible to spend time in a games room, peek into the Coloropoli News television studios and buy drinks and snacks at the Gamberto kiosk. In a driveway there is the shady headquarters of Ursus & Co., while in the middle a large number of Inklings exchange messages and drawings, show off their equipment, and party during the Tenta Cool concerts. To attract the curiosity of many, however, there was a small empty area, a dead end without any use and which stopped in front of a mysterious subway. That that area would have been the entrance to the first paid DLC ever made for the series was an increasingly consolidated theory among fans, but that the Octo Expansion was such a rich and fun additional content was by no means a given. One dlc in shrimp The fact that Nintendo had already planned the theme and the setting of the DLC for some time can be guessed from how perfectly the Octo Expansion fits into the world of Splatoon 2. Accessible from the subway in Piazza Incoloropoli, the expansion allows you to explore the underground of the city aboard a train and in the role of an Octoling (the historic rivals of the Inklings), unlocking new stops and gradually discovering new underground lines, for a total of eighty levels extremely varied in terms of challenge rate, objectives to be completed and gameplay ideas. It was already known that Monolith Soft and some level designers had a hand behind the shrines of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but it is even more evident when tackling certain levels in first person. A recurring challenge asks the player to lead a huge 8 ball to the end of the course, using it to solve more or less elaborate puzzles, protecting it from enemy attacks and carefully dosing the ink shots so as not to make it fall from the platforms. There are levels that must be completed with a limited amount of ink, others in which you must never get hit or where you can defend a position, up to more ~creative~ scenarios in which you can replicate small sculptures by destroying crates with precision surgical. Finally, certain challenges are based on already known multiplayer modes - such as Bazookarp and Mobile Tower - while the bosses are more elaborate and difficult variants of those encountered in the original campaign. Although the challenge level is higher than usual, the Octo Expansion provides some help for those who need it: the underground lines are branched in such a way that it is possible to leave a particularly difficult level pending and continue following alternative routes; each scenario can usually be faced by choosing between different weapons, while after a certain number of game overs it is possible to ask for the help of Alga and Nori and jump directly to the next station. The journey is full of little surprises, and in the final stages the game transforms and wedges stealth sequences and spectacular boss battles in between. In short, those who were dissatisfied with the single-player campaign of Splatoon 2 will find in the Octo Expansion a much richer, more varied and demanding experience, capable of introducing new characters and answering numerous curiosities from fans: what happened to Number 3 after the first Splatoon? Where does the rivalry between the Inkling and Octoling come from? How were Tenta Cool born? The underground setting also allowed Nintendo to give the DLC a very particular mood. In stark contrast to the colors and liveliness of the surface and the countryside in Valle Polpo, the atmosphere of the Octo Expansion is more dark and mysterious: the subway passengers have an almost disturbing design, and the aesthetics of the levels go perfectly with the new retrowave soundtrack. If compared to the amount of single player content, the additions for online play appear rather poor, with about fifteen new equipment and the possibility of playing as an Octoling (although the aesthetic customizations are very limited in this case).", "date": "2018-06-24", "grade": "8.5"}
