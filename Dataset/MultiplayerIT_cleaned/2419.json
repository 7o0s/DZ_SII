{"name": "MechCommander 2: The MechWarrior Game of Tactical Command", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mechcommander-2-the-mechwarrior-game-of-tactical-command.html", "text": "The technical aspect... Apart from this little observation, as you may have guessed your job will be to command your squad of mechs in various missions, which certainly sounds interesting and indeed it is (provided you have nothing to say about the setting .. otherwise I could have cheer you up with many conspiracy theories according to which in the dark meanders of secret American laboratories we study prototypes of ~Mechs~ to be used in reality!). At your disposal you will have a 3D engine in which the position of the camera can be positioned as you like, choosing the tilt and zoom. Unfortunately, if you place the camera parallel to the ground, you will notice how the horizon distance is really close thus making this type of view useless: you will therefore have to opt for a classic view from above, perhaps facing the direction in which your mechs have to go . The graphics are nice overall but I expected much more, not to mention that it has the courage to shoot (when the situation on the screen gets complicated) on an AMD 1200 MHz with GeForce 3. As you can see from the images, the Mechs do not they are so well defined... many look like poorly painted cardboard boxes. Despite all the landscape (albeit very bland and uniform) offers a fair level of interactivity: all the structures can be destroyed, some even by walking on them (rightly so: controlled robots where the lightest weigh around 30-40 tons), such as the barricades or the trees. The sound effects are average, while the dubbing (English) is of poor quality: as already said, it's normal people who are talking, don't expect much. ...and the gameplay! In the game you will have to face a series of extremely linear missions within a campaign where the only opportunity to deviate from the tracks will be the choice to complete or not the secondary objectives. Each mission has a certain ~Tonnage limit~, the limit of weight that your dropship will be able to support. Clearly this varies from mission to mission, needless to say that this limit will increase as you progress through the game, to drastically decrease in some missions where the game tries to make you understand in a kind way what type of mech you will have to use without making you feel too stupid. In fact this aspect will require some planning to be done before proceeding to the actual mission. You will therefore have an interface that will allow you to choose which mechs will participate in the mission (you can also buy new mechs and sell those recovered in previous missions: in fact you are mercenaries, at the end of the missions you will be paid and you can use the credits in various ways ..). In the briefing the tactical officer will also advise you on what type of mech to have in your squad. You can also customize your mech: this is in fact one of the aspects for which the Mechwarrior saga is known. Those who have played it will remember the ~Heat~ factor of the game, in fact each weapon when used generates heat that will be dissipated by the devices of your mech. The faster you shoot, the more heat you will generate and if this exceeds a certain value your mech will ~turn off~. Anyone who has ever tried to drive a car will have had it turn off (well at least in the early days). Here are the situations that can occur are similar, only that in the game you won't have angry drivers intent on playing against you to turn the car back on ASAP... if in the game your mech shuts down, it's because you were shooting, and if you were shooting there was obviously some enemy nearby. On the contrary, the latter will be happy to see how your mech shut down, but I doubt he will wait for you to turn it back on! If you have followed me in the speech, you will remember how this is a characteristic of the MechWarriors, in MC2 instead there is nothing comparable, in fact the HEAT of MC2 is a simple heat limit that the Mech can bear: the armament of your mech must therefore generate an amount of heat that it can handle (otherwise the game will not accept your changes to the configuration of the mech). As you may have understood, in the game your mechs will be able to shoot without respite, because they will never shut down, which is a big disappointment, as that feature is one of the reasons for the fame of the MechWarrior series. After deciding which mechs to use, you will move on to the pilot assignment phase: these have a sort of ~experience~ which will allow them to acquire various special abilities (some may becomeare experts in the use of short-range missiles, others in the use of sensors, etc. etc.). This is all very nice and somewhat X-Com-like in setting. Mech Power Up Detected! The missions that you will face are quite varied (you can imagine them: destroy the base, capture that structure, intercept the convoy...) and moreover they can also be faced thanks to the help that your headquarters will offer you. As already mentioned, in the game you will have a certain amount of credits for each mission that you can use in various ways, for example you can call in an aerial bombardment, place heavy artillery or even call in a salvage craft that will make a recently destroyed mech operable ( providing you with the relevant pilot). The evolution of the missions is quite linear, but unfortunately there are few ways to achieve the same goals. For example, usually you will have to disable the turrets, to do so you can launch missiles towards the generator to disable them or you can use a hopping mech, which taking a running start will make a big jump over the wall of the enemy base landing near the building and capturing it within a few seconds (which will cause the turrets to pass on your side, which will start shooting at the enemies). Which is fun the first time you do it, but eventually it repeats itself and starts to tire. To keep the interest alive there will be the discovery of new war technologies from time to time, or the rescue of some particular pilot. The game seemed very simple to me, especially if you use infinite ammo (which completely changes the way you play, especially if you've played MW). Furthermore, the AI gives a worthy display of its lack of intelligence, when for example it happens that an enemy mech stubbornly attacks one of your mechs. Perhaps the enemy mech is one of those that can only attack at short range, while your mech is at a much greater distance. If you try to keep the ~victim~ mech at a safe distance from the enemy, your other mechs will be able to circle the enemy within walking distance and slaughter him well. In fact, if the enemy mech is ~stubborn~ on one of you, he will start looking for it, not realizing that he cannot shoot the mech because it is too far away, and ignoring those within his range because they are different from his goal. Overuse of tactics like this can clearly ruin the game. Playing it, I enjoyed seeing the Mechs fighting each other, in fact fortunately they don't stay still, but try to move and make ~circular strafe~ on the enemy and other similar movements, which is very nice to see. Mech fights are the most fun the game has to offer, and if you play it it will be mainly for this reason. All in all Mech Commander 2 is a good title, fun if you like Mechs and everything that revolves around them, but unfortunately far from being a classic. Fortunately, the game setting makes it different from the usual RTS, in fact you will soon learn to get attached to your pilots and customized mechs. In any case, the recently released demo will remove your last doubts. Battletech, this stranger Who doesn't know the MechWarrior saga? This is one of the most successful boardgame transpositions in the history of video games! If my memory serves me right (because I played it myself a long time ago, thanks to a middle school friend of mine who introduced me to the universe of RPGs and strategy games), it all started with the board game ~Battletech ~ of the FASA. This is a ~party~ game in which two different teams of ~Mechanized Warriors~, i.e. giant robots as tall as a 3-4-storey building, faced each other on a battlefield. The game consisted of massacring each other, taking into account the roughness of the terrain and the characteristics of your ~Mech~. Clearly it was not as simple as it may seem as your Mech suffered various effects depending on where it was hit. If a shot to the chest pierced the armor it could for example destroy your gyroscope, preventing you from moving, while a well-placed shot to the arm could make it jump (and you can well imagine that usually the various weapons were positioned on the arms.. no arms, nothing weapons), and so on. Subsequently, the various Mechwarriors came to the PC, real simulations of futuristic battles aboard these mechs. A few years ago a title that has not remained in history saw the light of day, that MechCommander: a sort of spin-off of the genre (except for the first MechWarrior, a title that I've never had the good fortune to see.. however, I read the solution, and judging from it it seemed like a sort of graphic adventure..) in where your task was to manage an entire team of Mechs in their own enterprises, while in MechWarriors the simulation was individual. After a few years, Microsoft (which became the rights holder of the series) tries to have its say. The game sees you in the role of a commander of a group of MechWarriors called to restore order on the planet Carver V, where the tension between two ~Houses~ (Steiner and Liao) is growing. The game coming from a boardgame, has a very detailed background with a very long history. The evolution of the game is instead told through ~snippets~ of news and talk shows from 3063, of mediocre workmanship: the actors, respectfully speaking, all seem caught in the middle of the street, evidently the casting could not have been very strict. Not to mention that the cutscenes fail to communicate the spectacularity of the situations they talk about. Imagine hearing about battles between gigantic robots from Bruno Vespa in Porta a Porta or from Santoro... (there is also the classic global pundit commentator, ready to have his say).", "date": "2001-08-14", "grade": null}
