This is the case of Warhammer Quest 2, which arrives on iOS devices and more than four years after the first, excellent episode; and it does so despite the closure of the original development team, Rodeo Games, whose components (or at least most of them) have found themselves working in the new Perchang studio. We are talking about a much more sophisticated sequel from a technical point of view, which in fact adopts polygonal graphics instead of the old 2D approach, thus allowing us not only to pass from the (ugly) top view to a much more spectacular three-quarter camera through the simple two-finger drag up, but also enhance the detail and animations of hostile characters and creatures. Visually, the game therefore benefits greatly from the transition to three dimensions, but also from the representation of the world map in a diorama style, a very clear reference to the theme song of ~Game of Thrones~. Then that navigating the map itself appears a little confusing at first, well, that's a shame we're willing to forgive Warhammer Quest 2. Unusual alliances At the base of the usual structure made up of increasingly large and dangerous dungeons there is a plot that sees two powerful commanders in constant struggle, Captain Marcus Hammerfall and the dark elf Meharva Darkshade, forge an unusual alliance to face the advance of the forces of Chaos, who aim for the complete destruction of the world. During the initial phase, our party will be composed only of these two figures, specialized respectively in hand-to-hand combat and in spells from a distance, but during the missions we will be able to free powerful warriors held captive by the enemy and see them join the team (or recruit them in inns), until composing a shortlist from which to select the four members of each expedition. What the game tries to clarify right away is that casual management of the team will inevitably lead us to defeat, which means that not only will we have to pay some attention to the balance of our warriors, avoiding polarizing ourselves towards solutions that are valid only for specific situations , but also to the very approach to the fights. The enemy creatures, ranging from giant spiders to minotaurs, from rats to ghouls, will in fact deploy a certain degree of cunning and will not fail to target us from a distance or to damage us using fire and poison. During each turn we will therefore have to move and attack, positioning the team in the most sensible way to respond to any offensives and avoiding leaving wounded units at the mercy of the enemy, perhaps using spells or healing potions to close the wounds in view of a new clash. The experience fielded by Warhammer Quest 2 is as solid as and more than that of the first chapter, thanks also to the introduction of a series of extra facets that add further depth to the battles, while the basic campaign (to which it can possibly be combined with a paid expansion of 5.49 euros, with the Reikland region) proves to be long-lasting and demanding, with many secondary missions in which to pursue the growth of your party. However, the interface should be improved: the purchase of new objects, bound to specific classes, proves cumbersome as there is no reference to the current endowment as well as to the characters who could actually take up the new instrument (indicated only with acronyms, in the chaos of classes available), with the result of wasting money on a two-handed broadsword that maybe no one will be able to use or that doesn't boast a higher effectiveness than the one we already have. We also found a glitch concerning the audio effects, which sometimes play late compared to the action, while on the soundtrack front there is very little to complain about: the music is ~epic~ at the right point and accompanies in the best way our shipments.", "date": "2017-10-28", "grade": "8.5"}
