{"name": "Syberia: The World Before", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/syberia-the-world-before-recensione.html", "text": "There are articles that you simply never want to write, especially those in which you feel you are the victim of a particular emotional involvement, due for example to the love you feel or have felt for a certain author, a feeling that inevitably ends up distorting your judgment . In other cases, like this one, what is holding you back is having to ascertain that once you have written, you will ideally put an end to an experience that has shaped you and, in part, defined you because, despite never ending up on the cover of some glossy magazine, Kate Walker has always been an important female role model, which the gaming industry should have looked at more carefully: a woman who escapes from the destiny imposed on her by family and society, pursuing the dream of another human being, in the dramatic and poetic search to bring back that repressed ego that can only free her. After all, the tension towards movement, understood in the highest sense of the term, has always had it in her surname and her destiny can only be to never find a definitive landing place, like a nomad. Kate Walker is the purest embodiment of the vision of the recently deceased Benot Sokal, who has always put the theme of travel at the center of his works since he began writing video games in the late 1990s. He probably would have wanted to abandon her after the end of the second Syberia when, having gained the self-awareness she lacked and brought Hans Voralberg to her destination, she finally had to redefine herself as an individual, therefore without an author to move her, finally choosing who to be. He couldn't do it, probably because his later games hadn't been as successful and he needed her not to succumb to the market. Syberia 3 started from the awareness that Kate was no longer a New York lawyer, but a woman who had seen mammoths in a legendary place, traveling with an old man in the throes of severe dementia and an all-too-human automaton. His wandering through inhospitable territories, imbued with magical realism and surreal beauty, had to take a new direction and it did, but it was evident that some of the original inspiration was missing, almost as if Sokal was sorry to have to lead it once again. He too had to take a new direction and redefine his work and, above all, his character. It was not for nothing that at the end of the third episode, he had left Kate suspended in a limbo from which it was hard to see a possible happy ending, as if he himself was uncertain of his final destination. The review of Syberia: The World Before is therefore not only the text accompanying a vote given to the fourth chapter of a long-standing series, but also a way to tie the threads and understand how far Sokal managed to take Kate before die, and how he tried to tell it from a new point of view, this time more intimate and personal, finally going to dig into his past. A story between past and present Syberia: The World Before tells of the inexhaustible restlessness of Kate Walker The direction taken by Syberia: The World Before is so different from that of the third chapter that the prologue is all about blowing it away. Kate is a prisoner of a group of nostalgic Brown Shadow, a group similar to the neo-Nazis, who hunt for buried treasure using political prisoners as slaves. In short, the woman manages to escape and resume her journey, which will lead her to the city of Vaghen, the homeland of the other protagonist of the game, Dana Roze, to whom Kate is linked by relationships that will be clarified in the course of the adventure and which represent the very core of the story. Initially Kate does not know anything about Dana, not even her name: she is only on the trail of a woman who looks very much like her, depicted in a drawing she found in the carriage of an abandoned train in a hidden shed in the mine where she was held prisoner. The player, on the other hand, was able to guide her in the prologue, making her play the Vaghenian hymn in the music square, where some automatons from the Voralberg industries form a choreography of bewitching beauty. Dana's story is dramatic From here begins a story that alternates sequences that take place in the present, starring Kate, with others that take place in the past, starring Dana. Piece by piece the general picture is revealed, introducing other characters on the road, such as the mountain guide Leon, a figure who will become key in the story, the waitress, then leader of the resistance Leni, daughter of the owner of a mountain refuge where Dana works for some month, Junta, a director who recalls the historical figure of Leni Riefenstahl (director much loved byHitler), of which she declares herself a friend and many others, including some returns that we are not talking about so as not to spoil the surprise, but which you can easily guess if you have played the previous Syberias. Note that some of the characters mentioned even become playable in some sequences. Gameplay The mechanical puzzles are well made In terms of gameplay, Syberia: The World Before is a narrative-driven graphic adventure, in which the player guides the characters in the hunt for documents to read, secondary characters to talk to, and items to collect and use with other items. Classic puzzles are actually very simple and hardly keep you engaged for more than a few minutes. Probably less experienced players with the genre will have a few more difficulties than ours, but I don't think their playing time will go beyond the little more than twelve hours it took us to get to the end credits. In addition to the classic puzzles, there are some mechanical puzzles, which require a little more effort than the others. For example, a stove must be reactivated by regulating its temperature, or an automaton must be opened to take a message hidden inside it, or troops must be placed on a map. There really is nothing impossible, but some are quite demanding, they require you to carefully read the available documents, to exploit all the clues and above all, they are useful to see well-conceived mechanisms in action, aesthetically and technically. The most interesting puzzles, however, are the ones that require you to jump from Kate to Rose in real time. Usually it is Kate who finds herself in difficulty and who uses the knowledge learned with Rose to move forward, such as some access code that is inaccessible in the present, or the location of a hiding place. Amazon offer SYBERIA 4 - THE WORLD BEFORE Deluxe Edition - - PC 49.99 See Offer It should be noted that, in addition to the main objectives, the game also offers secondary objectives, completely optional, which serve to obtain more information about the characters or the places where you are, as well as lengthen the adventure a little. It is precisely the latter that prompt an intensive exploration of the scenarios, leading the player to go in search of all the points of interest, even the less visible ones, and to converse with all the characters. The points of interest are managed in the manner of Syberia 3, fortunately post revision of the interface: so there are icons that appear on the interactive areas when Kate approaches and on which the drawing of the action key appears when they become actually usable. Some might feel the lack of a command that shows all the hot spots at once, as happens in other graphic adventures, but it must be said that the maps are usually very small and that, therefore, with a little attention it's really hard to miss something along the way, except when the icons appear on very light areas, making them practically invisible (it doesn't happen often, but it does happen). In general, both using a controller and with a mouse and keyboard, we didn't have much difficulty moving the characters and making them interact with each other or with the scenario. After all, we are faced with a title with a fairly slow pace, which can be forgiven for some small inaccuracies from time to time in reading the inputs, fortunately never compromising. A living city Vaghen is a splendid city If in terms of game mechanics Syberia: The World Before does not offer big surprises, as it was reasonable to expect and as it was also understood from the demo, from the point of view of environmental construction and visual style it does an excellent job, which is impossible not to read as a kind of testament of Sokal, if only for chronological reasons. Vaghen is a splendid city where art nouveau mixes with the refinement of the mechanical figures of the Voralberg industry, creating streets of inescapable charm, made up of small shops full of objects of all kinds, small newsstands full of newspapers, bars and restaurants frequented by locals and tourists, impassable metal gates, abandoned towers, dilapidated buildings and others that seem to come from a remote and forgotten past. There is also an automated tramway that criss-crosses the entire urban fabric, allowing Kate and Roze to go from one place to another and admire the beautiful Alpine mountains that surround the houses (and which will play a role in them decisive way). The result is so convincing from a purely descriptive point of view that one feels pleasure even just visiting the city in an epidermal way. Syberia: The World Before is full of documents to read Also, observeBetter still, you notice the details from which the all too plausible story of this imaginary place inevitably emerges. In the narrow streets and squares of Vaghen, Sokal managed to engrave the inexorability of time and the madness of men, leaving the wounds caused by the dramatic events that form the background to the whole story wide open and which recall the Nazi persecutions without too many mysteries against the Jews. Some of the places you visit during the game are incredibly beautiful and expressive, such as an old cemetery that looks more like a labyrinth, or a mountain hut, which hides more secrets than it appears at first glance. If we want, the weakest elements are the human models, which inevitably reveal the production level, certainly not triple A, as well as the animations, which are not always perfect. A rather obvious thing for a product that does not aim to be a blockbuster, but we think it is a technical aspect in which, despite everything, there was room for improvement. Finally, a particular applause goes to the soundtrack, composed by Inon Zur, truly incredible in his ability to connect with the game both emotionally and expressively. Conclusions Would it make sense for the Syberia series to continue without Sokal? Overall Syberia: The World Before is a good closure of the events of Kate Walker. In reality, the ending leaves open the possibility of seeing new adventures, but would it make sense for the series to continue without its author? Besides to go where? If we want the essence of the protagonist it is to be found in the inexhaustibility of her demand for adventures; in the incessant desire for new dreams to pursue. Each answer corresponds to a new question, in a rhizomatic game of why that can never end, except with death itself. And death, like it or not, has come. Thus, just as its author was sucked out of nowhere, she set off on a new adventure, which doesn't necessarily need to be told. After all, we like to imagine it like this, perpetually traveling and looking for new destinations. Pretending to continue pursuing her no matter what would be a mortal sin.", "date": "2022-03-16", "grade": "8.2"}
