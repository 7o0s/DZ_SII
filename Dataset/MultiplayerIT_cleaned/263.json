{"name": "Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dirge-of-cerberus-final-fantasy-vii.html", "text": "Cerberus Although atypical from a playful point of view, Dirge of Cerberus does not fail to narrate a plot in perfect ~JRPG~ style, conceived by Square Enix respecting the original adventure, without disastrous poetic licenses that justified its existence: instead of telling a choral story before or before the battle with Sephiroth, Square has decided to explore one of his most successful and loved creatures, the dark ex-Turk Vincent Valentine, a monstrous cyborg with a dark past and enviable charisma. Contacted by Reeve Tuesti, the true identity of the Caith Sith puppet who had caused quite a few problems for Vincent and his associates before becoming a precious ally, our protagonist finds himself celebrating the rebirth of the Edge country in his own way: three years have passed since the fall of the Meteor that devastated Midgar and slowly the world is returning to normal. And yet, mysterious disappearances of human beings in Junon and suspicious movements in the shadows indicate that a new threat is lurking: Vincent will find himself involved in a battle against the terrible Tsviets super-soldiers, and will have to come to terms with his past and with what in which he was transformed by the evil Hojo. The decision to focus this sequel to Final Fantasy VII on the figure of Vincent, who paradoxically was an optional character in the original, turns out to be quite successful: we already know more or less everything about the other protagonists, Vincent has always been the most mysterious and complex character both visually and character-wise. Although not particularly long or complex, the plot treats both the story of Vincent and his enemies with care and is of good quality. Shooting Fantasy VII Since the first photos that appeared on the internet, Dirge of Cerberus has not failed to fuel an ever growing skepticism about its realization and the sanity of Square Enix: translating the video game sequel of its most famous franchise into a shooter is not exactly a brilliant idea, however original. The inexperience of the softco in the field is noticeable from the first moments of the game, but it must be said that Dirge of Cerberus is not actually the disaster that many expected. The main problem probably lies in the initial awkwardness of the controls, which actually persists for several hours of play, and which can be circumvented using the mouse and keyboard, absolutely accessories: Dirge of Cerberus is a product designed primarily for use via a joypad , the problem is that the latter is not suitable for the game. Once you get used to the controls and learn to use the lock-on and targeting system, Dirge of Cerberus becomes a little more enjoyable: more than a shooter, Dirge then reveals itself as a sort of action-game, in which Square has mixed various playful elements caught here and there. The most interesting element is certainly the possibility of modifying one's arsenal at will and in many ways: by finding the appropriate items around the stages, or by buying them in the ~shop~ accessible between one mission and another, it is possible to change the characteristics of Vincent's weapons, in order to always have at least three interchangeable at any time to adapt to the situation. Starting from the initial automatic pistol it is possible to obtain a slow but devastating rifle, a machine gun, ~magic~ pistols, sniper rifles with lots of zooms, and many other versions of the same weapon. The possible customization is enormous and is really the ace up the sleeve of Dirge of Cerberus gameplay. The most interesting element is certainly the ability to modify your arsenal at will. Shooting Fantasy VII Vincent also associates other combat skills with the use of firearms: in addition to punches and kicks at close range, Vincent can use Materia to cast the relative spells on enemies, using the canonical Magic Points bar. Materia can be found or purchased, and if there are any, you can only equip one at a time, forcing the player to choose carefully which Materia to use on a mission: in reality, magic does not play a fundamental role in Dirge's gameplay, the indeed, its use is often negligible. Another ability of Vincent is to use special items to transform himself into a devastating creature for a few seconds: Final Fantasy VII players will surely recognize the Limit Break that characterized the protagonist in the '97 JRPG, and that in Dirge of Cerberus it is an often desperate resource, since the opportunity does not often present itself which implies a necessary use. Aside from Vincent's war assets, Dirge of Cerberus offers little variety: missions are linear in concept although sometimes requiredthe exploration of the environments in search of keys or switches, but it all boils down in the end to a continuous crossing of bullets with enemies, however lacking in artificial intelligence, often concentrated more on shooting than on escaping our own shots. This is combined with the inconvenience of the jump, which instead of being a useful evasive maneuver turns out to be an awkward action that often confuses the action and the camera: the latter in fact is completely manageable by the player, but when it automatically adjusts to the movements by Vincent often ends up choosing the least comfortable shots for viewing enemies and the surrounding environment, making it a real feat to precisely choose your targets and a possible escape route. After Advent Children The quality of the computer graphic movies in Dirge of Cerberus does not envy that of the feature film dedicated to Final Fantasy VII marketed last year: design and direction actually recall those of a film, and as per tradition Square Enix reveals itself as the queen of these interludes not interactive. The actual polygonal engine, on the other hand, does not make a miracle cry, but considering the nature of the game, one is pleasantly surprised by the constant frame rate and the almost total absence of slowdowns even in the most agitated phases, in the presence of gigantic bosses and explosions in profusion. The polygonal modeling of Vincent and his enemies is extremely well done, the textures are detailed and despite the omnipresent aliasing one is pleasantly surprised by a very satisfactory visual quality, especially in the cutscenes that expose the plot. An even deeper steampunk atmosphere hovers than in the original Final Fantasy VII, with a really spot-on design especially of the enemies. The dubbing is excellent, with a precise choice of voices, and the soundtrack is very good, even if not particularly memorable: in general, the musical tracks accompany the action without becoming intrusive and maintaining the right rhythm, often quoting melodic passages from Final Fantasy VII, sometimes remixed to adapt to the new chapter of the saga. It's not the first time that Square Enix has flaunted its versatility and its desire to reinvent itself (who said Tobal and Ehrgeiz?) but every fan of Final Fantasy VII can't help but wonder if it was necessary to flaunt just one of the games most beloved in history. The basic idea is good and original, but the softco has tripped over its inexperience in the field, creating a mix between a JRPG and a not too convincing shooter. Dirge of Cerberus is pleasant, and fans of the saga will find an incentive to play it in the excellent plot to find themselves alongside their favorites, all the others will collide with a very uncomfortable control system, a flawed camera and a sometimes annoying linearity. The alternative endings, the bonus game modes and a copious amount of secrets try to lengthen the discreet longevity of a title that once its story is told, will end up on the shelf, probably not close to the esteemed progenitor. Pros Clever idea Good technical realization Intriguing plot Cons Too linear Awkward control system Unbalanced difficulty, mediocre longevity Final Fantasy VII was certainly the most famous exponent of the first polygonal RPG generation, and probably one of the best-selling and best-known titles on the PlayStation market. Ten years after the launch of that seventh Final Fantasy in Japan, the adventure of Cloud Strife and associates is still today idolized, revered and loved by millions of gamers: thanks to the powerful script and some of the most beautiful fictitious characters always, the Square Enix masterpiece has managed to establish itself in the collective imagination as few others had managed to do, often establishing itself as a term of comparison for practically every title of the same genre. Square Enix's project to exploit this franchise took the gaming market by surprise, mostly due to the variety and quantity of proposals: even today the plan of the Japanese softco even appears a little ridiculous, as well as risky. First an ambitious (and successful) film for the big screen, in computer graphics, to tell the continuation of the story that began on the PlayStation; then a prequel for PSP and another for mobile (!), then this shooter Dirge of Cerberus, while everyone is clamoring for simply the remake of the original masterpiece. And while the rumors persist and the producers deny it with little conviction, we find ourselves again fighting the bad guys in and around Midgar, in the role of none other than the gloomy Vincent Valentine.", "date": "2006-11-20", "grade": null}
