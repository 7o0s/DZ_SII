Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. By now decidedly inflated, the Farmville-style casual management genre continues to gain acclaim both on the App Store and on Google Play, and Kingdoms & Lords is only the latest interpretation of this strand. The Gameloft title puts a small kingdom born from nothing into our hands, allows us to make it grow and increase its population, then to defend its borders by fighting the invaders on duty before their troops get too close to the city. Everything is positioned in a classic medieval fantasy framework, in which our actions are moved by the inkling of a greater threat, in this case the return of the Dark King and his lust for conquest. Will we be able to resist his fury? We will discover it mission after mission, through a decidedly tested structure in which very little is entrusted to our real ability and all we have to do is follow the instructions given in the icon of the quests: build this or that building, produce a certain material, train this type of soldier, expand your territory, visit your neighbors and eventually go to war. The latter aspect is a recent conquest of the genre to which Kingdoms & Lords belongs, and certainly has the merit of increasing the variety compared to management dynamics alone. The fights take place according to a purely strategic pattern, but they immediately reveal themselves to be rather simple and lacking in depth. The units at our disposal, in fact, must be deployed on the field and can attack an opponent chosen by the enemy party in turn, without however being able to stop if their vital energy is too low, which automatically translates into a massacre in one who has more resources wins. A small variation on the theme is provided by the presence of magic cards, which can be purchased using diamonds (the real currency of the game, the one that can be purchased with real money) and which allow us to recover health, multiply the attack power of the team and so on. Coins, diamonds and shields As mentioned above, the gameplay of this new freemium produced by Gameloft certainly appears well tested and puts us in front of the usual interface, with a three-quarter top view and the buildings that produce every so many coins and shields to collect with a touch. In this regard, we have finally found a good precision as regards the touch controls, which allow us with a good approximation to act on the desired building or icon, which instead often did not happen in the previous casual games of the French house, with all the consequences of the case. The ~freemium~ speech appears not too invasive, it is in fact possible to play without problems in a completely free way, without putting a hand in the wallet to purchase extra diamonds, even though having to limit our sessions to a handful of minutes every hour or two to way of depletion of energy points. What, on the other hand, seems inexhaustible are the missions, which are continuously renewed according to the mechanism of achievements, trying to stimulate our curiosity and keep our involvement high. In short, Kingdoms & Lords does not shine for its originality but convinces, a pity only for the technical sector: the mix of anonymous design and jerky animations did not excite us at all.", "date": "2012-09-29", "grade": "6.6"}
