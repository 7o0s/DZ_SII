{"name": "Besieger recensito", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/besieger-recensito.html", "text": "Stories of Vikings, Cimmerians and mischievous sisters Besieger's single player mode is divided into three different Campaigns. First we will meet Barmaly, leader of the Viking people who, traveling in search of a sword with magical powers, will find himself having to counterattack an unexpected offensive by the Cimmerian people. Subsequently we will take on the role of Korin, the deposed king of the Cimmerians, to stop the mad thirst for power of Mara - his usurping sister - and try to restore peace to a Kingdom now devastated by wars and wicked magical creatures. Clichs, quotations and clichs abound in Besieger's plot, after all we realize that most players are very little interested in the ~casus belli~ and instead immediately rush into the middle of the fray. And yet, we are sure of it, spending a little more money on a screenwriter who, in addition to being able to write, also knows how to devise innovative and compelling plots would be an intelligent and profitable investment. At least, the common thread that exists between the approximately 40 game missions almost always has a logical and plausible sense. The game is entirely translated into Italian, including speech. The quality of the localization is excellent and certainly does not regret the English version. The Multi Siege Besieger provides a multiplayer mode that will allow us to compare ourselves with up to eight other players. We will be able to host games on our computer or look for others through the now ubiquitous GameSpy Arcade support. No BattleNet style ladder then. There are 4 different types of game: Classic Deathmatch, Capture the Artifact, Siege and Battle. Nothing particularly innovative therefore, except for the Siege mode which consists in opposing two players facing each other: one besieged and one besieging. However, the experience is always fun thanks to the stable and fast netcode. Build to destroy. Besieger is a real-time strategy that unbalances the formula of the genre (Collect / Build / Fight) on the front of the more purely constructive / destructive component. In fact, very similar to what was seen in Stronghold, the most spectacular and choral missions will see us grappling with the construction of real fortified citadels and at the same time searching for the fastest and most destructive way to penetrate the walls of the opposing fortification. Just like in Warcraft or Battle Realms, the concept of a hero is introduced in Besieger. Certain units will therefore prove to be strategic if not even fundamental thanks to particular special skills and the strength grown on the field through experience. The growth of the heroes, however, at least in some cases, appeared too easy and oriented towards giving birth to units of too great power. The ~minor~ troops themselves will be able to improve their characteristics (represented by a number of stars above the status bar) by killing and destroying enemy units and buildings. Just like in Warcraft or Battle Realms, the concept of a hero is introduced in Besieger Build to destroy. If the conditions for a series of epic and stimulating campaigns are all there on balance, we regret the bad algorithms that regulate the paths of our troops (called, in jargon, pathfinding) and their reaction to external events. More than once we will not be able to get all our soldiers into that given passage or lose control following an attack action not requested by us. The developers have in fact tried to introduce elements of realism in the dynamics of movement, the troops cannot pass through each other or even worse, through walls. Unfortunately, if the starting point is interesting, the realization was not the best. The queues and traffic jams that we will see on the field will remind us more of the queues in the post office on our doorstep than of frenetic and ferocious battle actions. As is now a must in titles of a certain caliber, the slopes and reliefs are of real strategic importance. Attacking from below will prove to be a real suicide, otherwise placing our towers on the tops of the hills will make them fearsome defense tools. In the same way, for each group we can decide the movement formation (phalanx, wedge, column, etc.), if desired, we could also define customized configurations. The resource management system tries to differentiate itself from the classic RTS scheme, the population itself in fact proves to be an imported wealth for the purposes of the entire game economy. Each house automatically provides a certain number of men (there are 5 by default), each of these men can be converted into a soldator (by sending it to the appropriate barracks) or used to build or gather resources. In this way we have tried to overcome the unconditional massing of troops and the related ~rush~ tactics that are easy to adopt in other titles. In this way, however, it becomes uncomfortable and cumbersome to change the balance between the various types of fighters. In fact, if we want to train new archers, but we have finished our number of men and we don't want to remove further manpower, we will be forced to select part of the other troops we have surplus towards the reference barracks, in order to transform them into civilians, and therefore redirect new units to the building that trains archers. Viking technique. Besieger's graphics aren't spectacular, but are always functional and have a good atmosphere. The entire graphic style may recall that of the third Warcraft while not reaching those peaks of excellence, at least on a purely artistic level. Technically, however, the years of the Blizzard title are felt and Besieger can count on a proprietary graphics engine capable of exploiting all the latest features of DirectX 9 even without the latest generation hardware. Among the more advanced features we point out the possibility of playing in decidedly large levels, Terraforming of the terrain in real time and the implementation of a dynamic Level of Detail algorithm - in technical jargon LoD). Thanks to the LoD the graphics engine is able to increase or decrease, depending on the number of objects representing the scene, the precision with which the polygons are represented, in this way it is possible to represent the game world without the need to implement the classic and overused fog effect. The game view is fully customizable, both in terms of zoom level and viewing angle/direction. The game has a number of predefined views, unfortunately many (if not all) of these are often inefficient. And they force the player to distract his attention from the ongoing battles. As already mentioned, the game is able to manage a large number of objects on the screen, this can be seen in the richness of the scenarios, in the breadth of the same and in the large number of fighters and units that can be involved simultaneously in our military operations. The maximum graphic impact is obviously during sieges and the planning of one's citadels, apart from the aforementioned unit management problems, the sense of satisfaction in seeing our fortifications grow or in deploying one's siege forces is always very great. Comment Besieger leaves a bad taste in the mouth. It's not a bad game and will satisfy many fans of the genre, yet it fails to excite. Many missions are boring, others a few imaginative, still others simply useless and without personality. One therefore has the impression of little attention to detail. Technically, the title is flawless, able to run in a more than decent way on almost any type of hardware and in any case capable of offering the player vast and detailed scenarios. Too bad that the game view is sometimes confusing and unaccustomed. After all, it was since the time of the second Age Of Empires (if we exclude Strongohold, of course) that the game dynamics associated with the construction of one's own fortress and the conquest of the opposing one were not exploited. Too bad - again - that, in the current state of things, problems of management of the troops and above all of their path make this experience only hinted at and indeed almost frustrating. In short, the boys of Primal are postponed to September, waiting for a new masterpiece of the genre there are dozens of other RTS ready to satisfy your cravings. Only to be had if you have already played them all or if the ~fort~ aspect of the game particularly appeals to you... with all the necessary reservations though. Pros: Solid and versatile graphics engine Explore game possibilities (that of sieges) so far only hinted at in the classic RTS Cons: Problem in managing the A.I. Balancing of units to be reviewed Game interface sometimes too cumbersome It certainly cannot be said that the RTS genre is experiencing a period of brilliant splendor, although the panorama regularly presents new releases - especially inspired by the Second World War, the general public still finds it difficult to uninstall the great titles of the past from their Hard-Disks , like the still unsurpassed Warcraft 3. The Muscovite developers of Primal Software simultaneously with the development of the still little-known Action RPG ~The I of the Dragon~, seem to have drawn the initial inspiration from the Blizzard masterpiece to offer us a Strategy in TimeRoyal po set in the middle of Norse mythologies: Besieger.", "date": "2004-08-11", "grade": null}
