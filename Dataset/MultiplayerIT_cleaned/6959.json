And so 22cans was born, the development team that as a first work created the incredible troll Curiosity: What's Inside the Box?. Molyneux's intent was clearly to get people talking about himself and his team rather than making a quality mobile game, so all the old fans of the Dungeon Keeper, Fable and Populous father had to wait for the release of Godus, the second title of 22cans, in Early Access on Steam since last September, in order to verify the team's capabilities in relation to what, on paper, had all the appearance of being an innovative project in the genre of divine simulations. We can say without fear of contradiction that right from the start the experience appears more dynamic and stylish than the average, characterized by a very pleasant graphic design and capable of introducing relatively original features, such as the possibility of shaping the terrain to ensure that the men can go where there is building land, then automatically begin to build a shelter gradually more complex and advanced, and then aim for an expansion that can take place through two distinct dynamics: the first is that of the control of special bonfires that in fact they increase the interactive surface of the scenario; the second is represented by shipments by ship, with real Lemmings-style puzzle games to be completed within a time limit for the conquest of new lands. All with a view to constant evolution, which crosses various historical periods to introduce as many types of situations; but which at the same time requires, at least in the mobile version, very long waits or the adoption of a shortcut, represented specifically by in-app purchases. To be the brainchild of Peter Molyneux, Godus seemed like a too ~normal~ freemium Godus as a porcus The ability to edit environments is rendered in Godus much like Photoshop's ~smudge~ tool, although using it on an iPhone screen results in a degree of precision often less than what it would take to finely shape the layers of earth so as to build ~steps~ for humans and allow them to move from one area to another. The problem becomes particularly evident during the puzzle-style sections we mentioned earlier, given that in this situation one cannot act calmly: the ~adventurers~ must reach the temple on duty within the time limit, in otherwise we will lose the whole group and we will have to wait for the generation of new individuals to be able to make a new attempt. The traditional missions of casual simulations are identified in this case with cards to which stickers must be applied and which, once complete, allow you to build larger houses, shape barren land, build on previously inaccessible areas and so on. Other cards should instead be used in the Lemmings-inspired stages, and allow the troops to proceed faster or ignore certain obstacles. Beyond the modification tool and the different interpretation of the quests, all the other elements of Godus fall within a norm made up of long waits for our people to produce the faith necessary to fuel the various activities, faith which constitutes a bit the currency virtual game and which can be purchased in the inevitable packages thanks to the use of the precious currency, diamonds, which can be obtained via in-app purchase. Seen in this light, the title of 22cans not only appears too ~normal~, but it also seemed to us to be fairly slow in progression, losing sight of the undeniable potential linked to the evolution of the people and, consequently, the ideas that were supposed they would distinguish it from the various Farmville and Clash of Clans clones.", "date": "2014-08-19", "grade": "6.5"}
