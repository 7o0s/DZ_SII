There is no more banal and overused phrase than this, to describe what can be expected from the curious game recently released on the digital stores of the iOS and Android mobile platforms. The icon itself leaves no doubt about what the developers aim to attract users' attention to a product that combines the two favorite pleasures of us males, at least according to the most common adages: roaring engines and skimpy damsels. Behind the sexy looks of the protagonists, there is little variety in Drift Girls Drift for life For a game that makes the ~sexy~ factor its strong point, the first impact isn't exactly the best: once the application is started, a female voice with listless and not at all sensual tones mutters a couple of sentences in English, followed by a substantial download of the necessary data; in this waiting phase you have the opportunity to admire the cars present in-game, all replicas of famous cars, or the irrepressible curves of the female protagonists that can be conquered with drift shots and expensive gifts. The game, in fact, is divided into two distinct sections in which you have the opportunity to flirt with one of the aforementioned damsels or take part in Fast and Furious-style races; to proceed in the adventure it is necessary to participate in both activities in order to unlock better and better upgrades. Let's start by saying that the racing part, unfortunately, is decidedly underdeveloped and most of the time leaves a bitter sensation in the mouth: the car practically drives itself and the player is asked to maintain a certain number of engine revs at the start and select which direction to steer. In fact, to perform a perfect drift, just press the button corresponding to the direction of the curve at the exact moment in which the car is on a kind of bar placed on the asphalt, and then release it when exiting. As the story progresses, the difficulty of the tracks increases and in the same way the opponents are increasingly fierce, therefore it becomes vitally important to conquer new cars and spare parts that allow you to increase the statistics associated with the car. If at the beginning the impression is that it takes very little to dominate a race, from a certain point on it becomes clear that to be successful you need to own a vehicle equipped with the best tuning parts. There are two ways to get these improvements: race endlessly or spend (real) money to buy them in the store. Unfortunately the chances of receiving that essential turbo as a gift to give a boost to speed on the straight are very slim, so be prepared to shell out good money if you intend to maximize the performance of your car. Technically, however, the game defends itself well with fairly detailed models and settings that, although they don't make you cry for a miracle, aren't even ugly to look at. Time for conquests Future Casanova, this part is dedicated to you (dirty guys) since in addition to the track, our protagonist must also conquer the hearts and generous curves of the many girls in the game. Each of them has its own personality and it's up to the player to decide the most appropriate place to approach them: whether it's a visit to the zoo, a walk in the park or a romantic dinner in the best restaurant, the goal is always just to get them infatuated and pass a night of fire with them. Unfortunately, even in this case the mechanics underlying the game are too simplified and it all boils down to the usual two or three actions: visit the mall for a gift and a gallant outing in a place of your choice. The only reason to waste time with the irrepressible damsels - other than seeing them in a bathing suit - lies in the knowledge that they bring extra experience points to your car; every conquest off the track translates into better characteristics of your car and more chances of winning even the most difficult of challenges. It is certainly not one of the most exciting games on the iOS and Android stores and the cause lies mainly in the underdeveloped gameplay both in the driving and in the conquest phase, both unconvincing from many points of view. It is not difficult to understand the target that the developers have aimed at and surely there will be someone who will be able to appreciate the title but, frankly speaking, if you want to see some girls in bikinis you should point the mouse on Google and look for the latest photos of Megan Fox, than waste your time with this app.", "date": "2015-07-04", "grade": "5.5"}
