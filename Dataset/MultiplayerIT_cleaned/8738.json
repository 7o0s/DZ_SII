We are talking about Rayman Origins, an extremely colorful and beautiful two-dimensional platformer that, as the title suggests, tries to revive the series by offering consolidated and balanced mechanics in its parts. The game developed by Ubisoft offers a simple plot, focusing solely on the gameplay: the world in which the title is set was created by an entity known as the Bubble Master who, disturbed in her sleep, began to give birth to nightmares that they have turned a scenario upside down which obviously will be up to Rayman and his companions to bring back to its original splendor. With the clear intention of making the title accessible to anyone, the developers (including the legendary Michel Ancel) have preferred not to give a precise temporal location to Rayman Origins and give a more light-hearted image to the protagonist and his companions. A delightful graphic style An intention that is perfectly reproduced on video by a graphic design designed with absolute mastery and always cheerful, colorful and lively, which reaches its climax in the excellent sprites of the characters. Even on the Sony laptop Rayman and associates are perfectly defined but above all they are animated to perfection, with movements worthy of a cartoon and which often and willingly are enough by themselves to convey the humor of which the product is imbued. The PlayStation Vita screen does the rest, offering exceptional definition for a laptop and perfect cleanliness. The end result would be indistinguishable from high definition consoles were it not for the lower resolution and lower detail backdrops, but even with this difference Rayman Origins is a sight to behold and plays extremely well, thanks to near perfect fluidity and excellent response to commands. Also because it is a title that leaves a smile on your face thanks to a very inspired level design both in terms of variety of settings and as regards the actual structure of the levels: there is no risk of getting bored with the Ubisoft product when every single stage that makes up the adventure offers one or more different elements from the one that precedes it, whether it's visual solutions or real gameplay building blocks. Between deserts dotted with tribal drums to bounce on, icy wastelands seasoned with watermelons, limes and orange slices, fiery scenarios populated by devils cooking curry and even sections in pure scrolling shooter style, Rayman's unique style returns here in its maximum splendour. An important part is also played by the sound sector, strengthened by a series of irresistible music and effects that are always up to the task. From a more strictly playful point of view, we can say that Rayman Origins does an excellent job of remixing: the first levels act well as a tutorial by inserting the key elements of the gameplay in small doses, but the same abilities of the characters are distributed little by little, with the double advantage of ensuring a good feeling of progression to the adventure and not confusing newbies. This aspect is immediately reflected in a control system that couldn't be simpler: movement, jump, run and attack are the only inputs that the user has to memorize, with the advanced moves that are inserted without altering this perfect balance . The response to the commands is perfect and the presence of the physical keys of PlayStation Vita allows you to play the title without any compromise from this point of view. Playstation 3 trophies Rayman Origins features the same 40 trophies available on the other versions, of which 4 are gold and 6 silver, plus hidden ones. Much of it is unlocked simply by progressing through the game, finding a certain number of cages, eliminating enemies or rescuing captured fairies. Some, on the other hand, are a little more interesting and can only be obtained in particular levels, which will push the player to return to already completed stages several times. the sky gets always more blue In any case, although simple, the game is by no means trivial and will also appeal to platform purists who will have their work cut out for them to complete all the (many) levels of the adventure, discover the secrets scattered in each stage and thus obtain the evaluation maximum, unlock and complete the diabolical bonus sections and still make available the numerous alternative costumes for the charactersthe. In fact, the player must obtain medallions that allow access to the ~secret~ levels and complete the game one hundred percent. Medallions that are obtained by finishing the levels with a certain number of Lums (the alter egos of the typical platform coins) and replaying the levels to complete them within a certain amount of time. The PlayStation Vita version of Rayman Origins is therefore, in the same way as its older brothers, a little jewel that exudes love for a genre that is now almost forgotten, and which proves capable of giving hours of entertainment both to those who have been waiting for the return of man for years eggplant, and to those who did not even know of its existence. However, there is a rather important lack compared to the home console versions, namely that of local multiplayer. Let me be clear, the title is very enjoyable even on its own and it is less immediate to have two PlayStation Vitas within reach than two pads, but the cooperative created that alchemy and fun impossible to obtain in singles, forcing them to collaborate more to bring finished levels and added that extra bit of challenge and competition to tracking down extras and collecting Lums. If we want, it made the title more affordable, given that when one of the protagonists was killed it turned into a bubble that can be burst by the companions to immediately put him back into the game, while in the PlayStation Vita version it starts immediately from the last checkpoint. Having said that, Ubisoft has introduced a couple of additional features to partially remedy this shortcoming, first of all additional collectibles that allow you to unlock some very beautiful graffiti to look at, the ability to change the width of the view via the touchscreen and finally the Ghost mode, which using the Near application allows you to send and receive replays of the times used by other users, in such a way as to face their ~ghost~ to beat the time in a very similar way to what happens in racing games .", "date": "2012-02-21", "grade": "8.8"}
