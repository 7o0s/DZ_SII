{"name": "Madden NFL 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madden-nfl-2007.html", "text": "Rules Precisely for this reason and for all those who are poorly prepared in the field of American football, we have thought of briefly summarizing the fundamental rules and terminology of this sport and, more precisely, explaining how to play it. Unlike football, but also rugby, in American football the attacks take turns, so based on the game action we can send two different formations onto the field: the attack or the defense, both made up of 11 elements. If we are in attack, our goal will be to make a goal (touchdown), or to bring the oval ball into the opponent's area through the run or a series of throws; the touchdown is worth 6 points. The playing field is divided into yards and, in order to reach the opposing area (endzone) we have four possibilities (downs) to travel at least 10 yards. If in the 4 attempts we manage to cross the 10-yard mark, the ball will remain in our possession and we will be able to continue the attack in the hope of reaching the endzone, otherwise we will lose ball possession. To avoid risks, if at the end of third down the offense fails to reach ten yards, the special team is called into the field where one of our players, based on the distance, will kick the ball or as far away as possible (Punt) , so as to make the opponent's next attack more complicated, or if the distance allows it, he will try to hit the opponent's goalposts to score the field goal, which is worth 3 points. Obviously, the defense instead has the task of preventing the opponent's touchdown. To do this, we must try to get the opponent to fourth down, in order to force him to hand over the attack action to us; even better would be to take possession of the ball by intercepting a pass or recovering it if it gets out of hand (fumble), without forgetting the direct tackle of the opposing quarterback (sack). Options and modes Along with all the official teams of the National Football League, Madden 2003 included a large number of historic formations of the past such as the 1985 Miami Dolphins or the 1990 Los Angeles Raiders, just to name a couple. But if the numerous teams made available are not enough for you, you can easily create your favorite training starting from scratch, choosing the name, the city, the stadium, the colors of the uniform, the logo, up to the creation of every single player who will go to fit into the huge list of rosters in the game. This year more than ever, Madden 2003 offers a large number of options and modes that can be selected from the main menu. The very useful Practice mode will allow us to perform all kinds of actions as many times as we want, both in defense and in attack. We recommend using it a lot initially in order to better assimilate the diagrams and familiarize yourself with the control system which, at first glance, may seem difficult. Totally new is the hilarious ~Mini Camp~ mode which consists of facing and overcoming a certain type of predefined training sessions in different fields of NFL teams. The players will wear their training uniforms, but the funniest aspect of the ~Mini Camp~ is the possibility of using the equipment used by the real teams, such as the large foam bags that simulate the opponents to avoid during the actions. At the end of each test, we will be assigned a score with which we can win one of the 3 medals up for grabs: gold, silver or bronze. The ~2 Minute Drill~ mode instead consists of game actions that take place during the last 2 minutes of a game, or in the hottest phase in which everything usually happens! In ~Football 101~ instead the workouts will be accompanied by an explanation from John Madden himself. Before trying the game action, in fact, we will be explained in detail how it should be carried out and in which circumstances it is preferable to apply a selected game scheme. Below there will first be a preview of the action performed by the CPU and then it will be our turn. At the end of the test, Madden will comment on the performance, providing us with useful advice. There is not much need to dwell on the exhibition mode, in practice it is a single friendly match in which we will only have to choose the 2 formations and play. Far more developed is the Franchise mode, which allows us to participate in 30 consecutive NFL seasons. An infinity of time in which we will also have the opportunity to select our game strategy, to buy and sell players, greet the ~old~ players who retire and enlist new recruits frominstitutions from the university, or we can choose to play only the games, leaving out the management part of the game. Obviously the goal of each season is to get to the legendary SuperBowl. The amount of options available in Madden 2003 is truly embarrassing, so much so that it is really difficult to list them all. Learn to play Madden The numerous practice and training modes present offer an excellent opportunity to better learn the Madden 2003 game system. In practice, before each action we will have to choose the type of training and then the scheme we want to perform. A small menu on the screen will show us the movements that the players will make and all we have to do is try to execute everything perfectly. For example, during an attack phase, if we choose to make a throw, our receivers will be marked by some symbols that correspond to the joypad keys. Based on the key pressed, the ball thrown by our quarterback will go in the direction of the chosen player. Before starting the action, through the c-stick we can observe the trajectory that the receivers will execute. Worth noting is the always excellent AI of the opponents, which obviously changes based on the level chosen, but it's always nice to see how the CPU adapts perfectly to every game situation, without making silly decisions. Technique The technical realization of Madden 2003 is among the best ever for sports titles despite some slight imperfections. The most spectacular aspect is undoubtedly that relating to the animation of the players. The naturalness with which they move on the pitch both during the pre-match warm-up and during game actions is truly exceptional: it is almost impossible to count the number of movements that each individual player makes during an action. They are so many and always different from each other that everything seems to come to life and the illusion of being in a football game on television is strong. The replays are photorealistic, through which you can better appreciate all the details on the screen, the stadiums are also excellent, always crowded with exultant audiences in the stands and people on the sidelines such as coaches, reserves, referees and cheerleaders. Even the sound department of Madden 2003 is, as always, a very well-finished aspect. Fantastic commentary entrusted to the legendary John Madden and his colleague Al Michaels, probably the best ever created. Impossible to quantify the number of sentences and dialogues that the two pronounce during a game. The sound effects are also excellent, especially those relating to the clashes between players and the numerous shouts they make during the games. While browsing the menus, music that varies between hip-hop and rock will keep us company with songs by famous artists including John Bon Jovi. Comment Madden 2003 proves to be a winning title again this year, very close to perfection. It is not a simple update of the previous edition but, thanks to the large number of additional modes and options, the purchase reasons are more than justified. It is a title of the highest level, which over the years continues to refine more and more. Without a doubt it is one of the best interpretations of American football on consoles and for lovers of this wonderful sport there really should be no doubts about the choice. Too bad for the total lack of localization in the menus, all in English. Otherwise it's really hard to find fault with a game that is practically a perfect simulation of American football. The only weak point of Madden 2003 is undoubtedly the little following for this sport in Europe, where football lives almost exclusively. Pros: Perfect simulation of American football Lots of modes Excellent AI Technically brilliant The top for fans Cons: All in English Not very attractive for those who don't follow this sport American football fans, the long awaited moment has finally arrived. Like every year, EA Sports gives us an appointment with its Madden NFL, which has long been considered one of the best football simulations in the world. Madden 2003 is the latest in a long series (13 to be exact), but unlike many other titles, the series has always stood out for its high level of playability and simulation of a certainly ~difficult~ sport to understand and appreciate lunge for us Westerners. cConsidering that every year in the United States the EA Sports title sets record sales and is positioned for a long time at the top of the rankings, it would not be a bad idea, for those unfamiliar with this sport, to learn the rules of the game, which they are much simpler than they may seem. By doing so, you would have the opportunity to take home one of the most beautiful sports games on consoles, as well as find a very valid alternative to the usual football games.", "date": "2002-11-29", "grade": null}
