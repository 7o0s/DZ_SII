The point in favor of My Horoscope is undoubtedly the possibility of obtaining a totally personalized horoscope: not only the date of birth is enough, but the exact time will also be necessary, in order to be able to calculate the sign and the ascendant . Astrological consultancy unfolds in two large categories; in the first, ~Astroconsulting~, it is possible to find out what the day holds and find advice on how to organize it. Not only that: here you can also learn about your biorhythm and the influence of the different lunar phases on your life. The second section, however, is the classic horoscope based on the date of birth. This can be achieved with a general and overall view, with both visualizing one's own constellations, but also focusing on two key topics, work and love (with the possibility of calculating the couple's affinity). The horoscopes presented have the advantage of being very detailed and precise: the salient passages are highlighted and, where necessary, accompanied by explanatory graphics. Furthermore, we are faced with a very technical description, with great emphasis on the typical elements of astrology (not just magazine chatter, in short); in this way, the real objective of the game emerges: to bring the player closer to the astrological world and to help him understand the zodiacal dynamics, also through a simple and well-ordered interface. Astrology students My Horoscope does not offer itself only as a personal astrologer, but also as a real master, to learn all the tricks of the trade! A special section of the game is in fact dedicated to the so-called ~academy~, a didactic manual with detailed lessons on the world of astrology. It starts with the ~neophyte~ level, with basic notions on the zodiac and the planets, passing from the ~student~ course to then arrive at the ~master~ level, in which topics for real experts are addressed and the keys to understanding the zodiac symbols. Each level is organized into 10 chapters, at the end of which it is necessary to carry out a small exam made up of quizzes and single and multiple choice questions in order to move on to the next chapter. This section, in addition to being very interesting, is objectively well structured: each chapter is divided into small paragraphs and the most relevant passages are presented in bold and accompanied by images (also useful for passing the barrier exams). Once the peak of astrology has been climbed, the player will only have to face the great final challenge, the exam with a capital E: twelve questions concerning all the chapters addressed in the three courses, upon passing which one can truly say that he has understood the mysterious mechanisms of the stars. Leisure time If, as in school days, the need for recreation is felt after lessons, here is My Horoscope offers an area dedicated to recreation and relaxation, always with an eye towards the sky! There are three games proposed; we start with ~Astrocouples~, the traditional memory revisited in the zodiac theme: the rules are always the same (with an effort of memory you have to trace the pair of identical figures) what changes are the images in question, the symbols of the zodiac and the planets. The second solution proposed is ~Spezzastella~, a real puzzle. Finally, the inevitable sudoku, or rather ~Zodidoku~, renewed in graphics: it is the classic puzzle positioned this time in the center of the zodiacal map (which makes the resolution slightly more insidious). Although the three mini-games are characterized by a great variety, also as regards the difficulty levels (three for each of the games), the playful section still represents a rather small portion in the dynamics of the title. At first the application of the ~zodiac~ theme to some classic games arouses the player's curiosity, but then it turns out that in reality we are dealing with old acquaintances, not too engaging. Furthermore, the lack of a ~left-handed~ option makes it annoying for left-handed users. Perhaps on balance, if you feel the need to take a break from astrology for a moment, it would be better to seek relaxation elsewhere.", "date": "2009-08-07", "grade": null}
