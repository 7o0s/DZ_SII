As we had already reported in the proof of the preliminary version, the intent of the developers with this package is clear: having probably understood, from the feedback received with the first chapter, that the micro-package approach had rather tired the most passionate users, with this maxi-DLC a drastically different path has been taken, trying to offer a much more substantial amount of content, against a price that is not low but still quite adequate for the offer. Inside the Dominion Biosyn Expansion we find a full-bodied campaign, the Chaos Theory mode and obviously various new creatures to add to the parks: in practice, a real expansion from the past. The move was also particularly strategic for the exploitation of the launch of the new cinematographic film, which allowed the creation of a real videogame tie-in capable of connecting directly to some events of the film. In short, there is a deeper narrative intent in this DLC, complete with cutscenes and cutscenes to tell the story of InGen's rival company and the new possibilities it offers within the game, including additional potential and, obviously , further risks and possible disasters, with the intention also of revealing new events related to the film Jurassic World: The Dominion. The protagonist of the expansion is Biosyn, an antagonistic company of InGen known above all in the books by Micheal Chrichton, but destined to have an important role in The Dominion. After the failure of the theft of frozen embryos in the first Jurassic Park, Biosyn is now ready to build its own park by exploiting the failures of InGen and a series of exclusive technological innovations that have obvious repercussions also in the gameplay. Biosyn park Jurassic World Evolution 2: Dominion Biosyn Expansion, the new setting The Campaign, which requires us to build a new generation park using Biosyn technology, is probably the most characterizing element of the expansion, although it is then destined to leave room for the other modes once the narrative part is exhausted with the progressive introduction of the biggest news. In any case, let's start from this in evaluating the characteristics of Dominion Biosyn, since it could present itself as a real new chapter in miniature. The basic systems of the game are the same as in the main chapter, but the new company brings with it several new features, starting from the appearance of the standard structures up to the presence of elements that involve some slight but significant variations in the gameplay loop. Some of the new creatures of Jurassic World Evolution 2: Dominion Biosyn The first characterizing element is the Research Complex, a futuristic construction semi-camouflaged in nature, which acts as the nerve center for all the park's research and development activities, and represents a building in constant evolution. Most of the structures to be built and manage reflect those already seen previously, although they all have a new aspect given by the architecture chosen by Biosyn, more advanced and with low environmental impact than those seen at InGen. However, some have variations, such as the new observation towers, the invisible fences that significantly alter the glance and the underground hypersonic transport system, which changes the logistics and requires further planning below the earth's surface. These aren't huge changes, but within an expansion they still manage to offer innovative elements that revive interest in the game and push you to face a new Campaign almost as if it were a new chapter. New gameplay structures and dynamics The Research Complex which is at the base of the BioSyn park The order in which the actions take place is not very different: it is always a matter of creating a central part of the park with the buildings dedicated to dinosaur research, the response and recovery centers, the paleontological medical ones as well as the structures assigned to the extraction of amber, synthesis and incubation of creatures, obviously up to the fences and all the elements related to the observation and control of animals. There are all the options seen in Jurassic World 2 but with aesthetic differences, and that is enough to make them important variants in a game of this kind, olthree to some functional changes such as the aforementioned invisible fences, the new observation towers and the new electricity management system, beyond the hyperloop which represents a nice but perhaps underused addition. The element of greatest interest is probably the amber mine, from which it is possible to obtain new genome fragments for various species of dinosaurs, by extracting the legendary mosquitoes stuck in the fossilized resin. The mine is structured in progressive levels and requires huge investments to unlock its various parts, as well as specific teams involved in the recovery of specimens, but it is an interesting enrichment of the standard dynamics of sintering creatures. Jurassic World Evolution 2: Dominion Biosyn This part is added to the production chain which includes the research of the individual genomes for each species as well as the possibility of modifying each of these with hybridizations in search of new characteristics, requiring further levels of management and control of the scientific personnel employed. In principle, the new additions fit perfectly into the game fabric built for Jurassic World Evolution 2, making this an expansion perfectly integrated into the original concept. After the first phase of building and learning the dynamics, the second part of the Campaign obviously focuses more on the action, with various disasters deriving from the events of the film which must be remedied by relying on the accumulated strategic and management skills. chaos theory Dominion Biosyn introduces Dimetrodon for the first time Particularly interesting is also the new mission present within the Chaos Theory, also focused on the film Jurassic World: The Dominion. In this case we are dealing with Owen Grady's remote ranch, which finds itself having to become a refuge for various species of dinosaurs in the wild but subject to poaching and indiscriminate culling. In this case, instead of the usual gradual planning that accompanies the construction of the park in the Campaign or in the Sandbox mode, we have to face various problems by exploiting some resources that we find in the field, adapting the structures and improving them so that they can accommodate the largest possible amount of creatures and trying to keep them healthy and safe. In this case, structures and dynamics derive more directly from those of the main game, but like any other ~scenario~ of Chaos Theory all the events are built in order to represent a sort of survival challenge, with fragments also scripted so as to offer situations different, such as the need to have to control groups of dinosaurs with specific calls to try to move them en masse from one place to another, just in ~Grady style~. New dinosaurs and environments The Pyroraptor, one of the new feathered dinosaurs featured in the expansion Of course, some new dinosaurs could not be missing: among these we find the Therizinosaurus, the Pyroraptor and the Quetzalcoatlo, new species unpublished in the series which also finally present the much requested plumage that emerged from the most recent research on paleontology. Among the novelties there are also great classics unjustly overlooked so far such as the very ancient Dimetrodon, the oldest species of all those seen so far in the series, in addition to the enormous herbivore Dreadnoughtus and Gigantosaurus, a large carnivore that exceeds in size and structure even the T-Rex. The latter is also obviously present and indeed confirms itself as a star in the game by obtaining two exclusive skins including a feathered one, as well as new aspects also applicable to the Dilophosaurus and the Parasaurolophus. Dominion Biosyn's graphics are obviously based on the same scaffolding used for the main game, therefore from this point of view, beyond the aesthetic variations provided by the new structures and the new dinosaurs, there are no particular differences compared to the level previously reached, which is already excellent. The Biosyn buildings are in some respects more fascinating and technologically advanced and the characteristic Research Complex is a pleasant addition, however if we want to find fault it could be said that the new Sierra Nevada setting is a bit monotonous and not very characterized compared to the possible choices.", "date": "2022-07-07", "grade": "7.2"}
