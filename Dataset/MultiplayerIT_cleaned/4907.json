The update comes shortly after the introduction of the fun seasonal challenges, a feature with which the developers have seen fit to enrich the game's endgame, made up of skill tests that must be completed within a certain period of time. the reset. A situation similar to that seen in Watch Dogs 2, therefore, which in fact remains unrelated to the DLC that we are about to review and which will in fact see us restart our climb to the top of Santa Blanca ... completely alone. Forget about the Ghost team: in Narco Road we will have to create a new character and infiltrate the powerful organization, posing as one of their members, in order to track down the boss of an unexplored area: El Invisible. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands - Narco Road catapults us into a new mission, this time alone Fast and furious The progression at the base of Narco Road is the same as in the main game, which means that to get to be able to confront El Invisible we will first have to complete a series of missions to steal information and get rid of his lieutenants: Eddie Escovado, a drug addicted psychopath full of money and followers who loves drug and starlet parties; Arturo Rey, head of the Death Riders, a dangerous biker gang; and finally Tonio Mateos, an extravagant muscle car enthusiast who often organizes clandestine races to see his racing cars whiz by. At the same time as the new villains, an unpublished map also arrives which stands as a variant of Bolivia from Wildlands, naturally less extensive but aesthetically very similar to what has already been seen during the main campaign, so don't expect big surprises on this front. To make the exploration of the scenario more varied and fun, new vehicles have been introduced, such as the aforementioned muscle cars and monster trucks. The latter are not exactly easy to drive on routes that almost always include sharp bends and confined spaces, so the solution naturally becomes that of going off the road and thus reducing the distance that separates us from the current objective. The missions that we will have to carry out to convince the three commanders of our loyalty to the Santa Blanca include the liberation of kidnapped actresses, the delivery of drug shipments, the escort of VIPs, the destruction of specific targets and of course the speed races, made even more frenetic by the presence of boost in almost all cars. Another aspect of the new ~Fast & Furious~ vision of this expansion lies in the many skill challenges scattered throughout the map, with ramps from which to make spectacular leaps, rings in which to pass while driving planes and helicopters, sequences of drift and so on: all useful actions to grow our followers and thus speed up the procedures to get to El Invisible. Lone wolf The price of Narco Road is justified by its rich structure, given that in addition to the main missions for each of the three targets we will see the scenario full of secondary activities, exactly as for the original campaign, which will substantially increase the duration of the experience in case in which we decide to complete them all. We are not talking about particularly varied missions, indeed in some cases we will find ourselves faced with rather repetitive situations, but it is the same, identical formula at the base of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands, so if you liked the basic game you will only appreciate also this extension of its mechanics. The big difference, as mentioned at the beginning, lies in the fact that we will have to face all this alone rather than from the point of view of a team, unless of course you decide to organize yourself with friends or participate in public sessions in cooperative multiplayer. In any case, we understood each other: no synchronized shooting, ergo our approach towards the enemy positions will have to change radically, using the drone here too to mark the guards but then having the task of having to eliminate them by ourselves, always paying attention to exploit the silencers and to destroy the alarms in order not to create an inconvenient havoc among the hostile troops. The degree of difficulty of the missions increases accordingly, and although our new character starts from level 20 (with the ability to have vehicles delivered by rebel troops already unlocked, however) we will certainly find it a bit difficult to proceed, getting used to acting solo instead of being able to count on the reliable support of the other Ghosts. It isa solution that on the one hand offers an experience that is in many ways different, more difficult and complex, but at the same time disavows tactical mechanisms to which we were by now well accustomed and on which it becomes hard, out of the blue, to no longer be able to to count.", "date": "2017-04-27", "grade": null}
