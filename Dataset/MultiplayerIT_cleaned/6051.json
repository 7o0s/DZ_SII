{"name": "Piattaforme arcobaleno", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155670-runbow-piattaforme-arcobaleno.html", "text": "It is singular that Runbow is designed to be experienced simultaneously by nine players, when nine are also the people who have decided to create it. Yes, because 13AM Games is a Canadian startup born from the collaboration of a small group of young developers, fresh out of their game design degree at George Brown College in Toronto. From that experience, completed just over a year ago, the idea was born of continuing the journey together, founding a company and trying to develop video games full-time. The creation of Runbow took about six months, although the concept was completed in just three days, during a session of the Global Game Jam in Toronto. Among the main influences - limiting ourselves to staying at Nintendo - the project has obvious contaminations of titles such as Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, but it is as if it amalgamated a Mario Kart-like party game engine with a platform bodywork, not only for the presence of power ups but above all thanks to a deliberately balanced game structure to give the best of itself in multiplayer. The peculiar qualities of the project - faithful to the old school tradition but at the same time endowed with a clear personal imprint - have also allowed 13AM to take home an award for Best Game Design at the Level Up Showcase, an event held annually in Toronto in April. Moreover, it may be interesting to take a look at the mentality of this young software house, based on comparison and devoid of protagonisms. According to the phrases spent by the insiders, it is as if it were a round table based on the creation of interactive works, where everyone has the same specific weight. As Dave Proctor, producer and spokesperson for the company recently explained, the first choice was to put aside any form of selfishness, in mutual respect for roles and in the name of freedom of expression. The mental openness, also due to the previous feeling of the group, helped them to get to know each other even better and to team up, remaining always and only at the service of the project. Obviously, not all that glitters is gold and it is an independent experience, there was no lack of more complex sides to manage, such as workloads and a very limited budget that had to be managed in the right way. As it happens, the short story of 13AM already seems to contain a winning recipe: a lot of passion, accompanied by a good dose of humility and above all planning, done in small steps. According to Proctor the most rewarding moment coincided with the beginning of the testing period. It was then that the studio realized that they were really on the right track to present themselves to the public with something that would stick. We assure you right away that the goal has been achieved and, if you own a Wii U, Runbow deserves your attention without hesitation. Runbow successfully amalgamates platform mechanics with a party game structure Platform is there, platform is gone! The main characteristic trait in the experience offered by Runbow is the gameplay that punctuates the platform phases. For each game it is possible to choose a palette made up of four colors, which will alternate seamlessly and will change the background of each level. Many of the platforms needed to complete the path will have those same colors and will disappear when the background takes on the same hue. To allow players to understand what the sequence will be and allow them to adapt their strategy, the game has the next color quickly displayed on the left side of the screen, before expanding to the rest of the scenario. And in fact the challenge of Runbow is precisely this: the player's ability to adapt to an unprecedented interaction. Being a title designed to give its best with nine players, the levels have ramifications and can be crossed at will both in the lower and in the middle / upper part of the screen, giving numerous alternatives in choosing the most effective path or the less difficult. We didn't mind the level design, although there are some segments that are almost identical on more than one occasion, or in any case with limited variations on the theme. The high number of players supported locally also required the implementation of a heterogeneous and flexible control system, which guaranteed the use of the pads intended for the Wii U and at the same time also the support of the old Wii controllers. In this way it is possible to use up to four Wiimotes, while the four nunchucks are connected only to reach the maximum number of participants. Inuseful to say that the most positive feedback relating to the control system came from the pro pad and the Wii U Gamepad, while the nunchuck proved to be - not very surprisingly - the weak link of the group. Considering the nature of the game, controlling both the direction and the jumps using only the right hand is rather awkward and makes it a bit of a challenge to be able to stay in the lead for a long time. In this sense there are balancing problems, which risk penalizing some players over others. The most consistent disadvantage concerns the loaded jumps, which involve a chain of buttons and are fundamental in many maps, but with the nunchuck they become very unmanageable. Even the approach chosen for the power ups seemed particular to us, managing to mix the cards both in a positive and negative sense. Unlike what happens in Mario Kart, where the negative consequence can arise from bad evaluations - for example the passage on the same banana peel left on the ground in the previous lap - in this case it is possible to suffer an immediate disadvantage even without having made any mistakes. Thus it happens to pick up an object and be reversed with someone who is in the rear, while other times it will go better and you can slow down time or invest your opponents with paralyzing electric shocks. Although this dynamic ends up penalizing the skill of the individual player, it is also a good way to make the races very close up to the last centimeter of the course. Lots of ways to have fun with friends Runbow offers six different modes and, although the multiplayer component is always predominant, there are even some solutions that can work best even in single-player or in co-op with a single friend. In Get ready to run mode the only goal you are given is to finish the level before anyone else. When starting from the blocks it is possible to adopt various strategies: punching the opponents and getting a boost that allows you to break away from the group, take the less crowded routes, or give yourself a boost with charged jumps in order to avoid attacks and earn a lot ground. Every single round conquered allows you to forfeit a point and at the end of the ten foreseen - customizable up to a maximum of 100 - it will also be possible to play a playoff to decree the final winner. Then we have the mode called Honor to the king of the hill, which is nothing if not a sort of capture the flag with strong brawler influences. During these sessions you must be able to stay on a box on the game map for at least five seconds, avoiding being knocked down by some opponents, while the background will continue to change color and cause some platforms to disappear. Chaos reigns supreme but overall these levels work pretty well and are a lot of fun to play through. On the other hand, the Enter the arena section proved to be less convincing, the equivalent of a free-for-all deathmatch in which it is really difficult to be able to orient yourself and understand what is happening on the screen. In these moments even the identification of one's character can become complicated and frustrate the game. The last mode specifically designed to be experienced in the company of many people is Defeat the master of colors, in which an asymmetrical gameplay a la Evolve is proposed. Up to eight players must work together to reach the end of the level safely, while only one user will take on the role of the Master and will have to try in every way to stop their progress. To do this, the additional screen of the GamePad must be used, through which bombs must be placed, the colors of the platforms changed, the commands reversed and so on. To make the game attractive even to those who want to enjoy a few solo sessions, the developers then included an adventure mode, in which you have to complete a myriad of levels within a time limit. The speed and accuracy allow you to forfeit medals and thus unlock some extra items. Finally, for fans of more complicated challenges, the campaign called Confront the Bowhemoth has been prepared, which exhibits a very high level of difficulty and is strongly discouraged in groups, since it is all too easy to hinder each other and almost impossible to complete the levels. Frenzy and fisticuffs also online The online sector will enrich the spectrum of possible alternatives in local multiplayer, thanks to which you can compete with the rest of the community. On this side, the available alternatives are only Get ready to run, Enter the arenaand Honor the King of the Hill, while both asymmetric and cooperative modes are absent. The matchmaking works properly and leaves no annoying downtime, while the fluidity of the game has lent its side to ups and downs, with some drops in frame rates too many and some episodes of lag that can make the game too chaotic and messy. Moving on to the extra content, the five selectable characters by default are joined by twenty-eight other protagonists, who must be unlocked by completing specific objectives. Among them we have identified many old acquaintances who will make fans of indie productions smile: in fact, the roster includes Shovel Knight from the video game of the same name, Teslamancer from Teslagrad, Rusty from Steamworld Dig, Juan and Tostada from Guacamelee! and many more. Moreover, since no specific moves have been introduced, even the bonus characters will have movements completely identical to the default ones. Coming to the audio sector, there are more than twenty tracks and they too must be unlocked with the progressive completion of the levels; overall they seemed to us to be very light and light-hearted sounds, suitable for the type of game and clearly inspired by the Donkey Kong series.", "date": "2015-09-09", "grade": "8.0"}
