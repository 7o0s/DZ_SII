{"name": "Pocket Chef", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pocket-chef_a.html", "text": "Nintendo DS and Wii owners were able to enjoy creating dishes for all tastes thanks to Cooking Mama. This particular ~chef simulator~ also arrived on mobile, but in a much smaller version than the original, so much so that you ended up completing all the available recipes in a matter of minutes. Gameloft seizes the opportunity, taking advantage of that conversion that is not up to par, to offer party game enthusiasts a completely new simulator, which has the clear advantage of having been designed specifically for mobile gaming. Pocket Chef, therefore, uses the same structure as Cooking Mama to offer much more substantial entertainment, with particular attention to the control system. Once the game has started, you can start with a quick game, consult the recipe book (where only the dishes that have already been completed appear, however) or try your hand at a career. In this case we will find ourselves facing seven different locations, each with a certain number of dishes to complete. Each recipe includes several phases, which will be evaluated from the game to the end and translated into a rating ranging from one to three stars: if successful, you will move on to the next dish; otherwise, we will have to restart the preparation. Depending on the dish, the things to do and the buttons to press change: to slice something, we will have to move our hand on the screen with the joystick and press the 5 key to cut, paying attention to the thickness of the slices and the speed of the movement; to mix, on the other hand, we will have to act on keys 4 and 6 with a certain speed. There are many things to do, in some cases you take direct control of the chef's hand with the joystick (when you need to spread, for example), but generally the approach is ~detached~, i.e. you control everything with one or two buttons without problems. Being a mobile video game, Pocket Chef unfortunately has the same weak points as the Cooking Mama conversion: controlling the preparation of the dishes using the keys and not a ~physical~ controller like those present on the Nintendo DS and Wii takes away much of the charm of the action, but above all it greatly reduces the complexity of the gameplay. Fortunately, the title developed by Gameloft can count on at least quantity: the mobile version of Cooking Mama made available very few recipes, while Pocket Chef has so many, distributed over seven ~thematic~ locations with increasing difficulty. It rarely happens that a mobile game can boast a good technical realization for both graphics and sound. Thanks to the ~gastronomic~ nature of Pocket Chef, on the other hand, we have available not only a series of nice music, but also numerous sampled effects which, unlike what usually happens, are reproduced without any problems and without causing slowdowns. However, the bulk of the work is carried out by the graphics which, as per Gameloft tradition, boast an excellent style, with a skilful use of colors and always perfect ~readability~. Bearing in mind the large number of different objects that had to be represented (all the ingredients of the numerous dishes, but also the tools necessary to prepare them), it was difficult to do better. PRO A large number of different recipes Excellent graphics and sound The best title of the genre for mobile, at the moment... AGAINST ...but the comparison with Nintendo DS and Wii is merciless Very limited gameplay Control system with treble and bass", "date": "2008-08-11", "grade": "S.V."}
