When you are passionate about real simulators, the choice can only fall on the PC, where theoretically niche products can literally break through at the box office. The case of Euro Truck Simulator 2 from the small independent development studio SCS Software, founded in Prague in 1997, is emblematic. In addition to being the absolute point of reference for those who are fascinated by international road haulage, it is an incredibly solid, deep, vast title capable of reaping unanimous acclaim from critics and the public, thanks to a recipe so well packaged that it is difficult to find a similar one. Released on January 16, 2013 on Steam, it has since been continuously updated and cleaned up, with a constant influx of patches supported by the feedback of the warm community and, above all, beautiful mods, as you can read in our dedicated special. A turning point in the life of Euro Truck Simulator 2 came with the release of the first official expansion called Going East!, which with thirteen new cities and thousands of kilometers to travel across Eastern Europe further broadened the horizons of the already mammoth work . To replenish their coffers again, the Czech developers would have been sufficient to update the map with the same ingredients of the previous work, moreover the over thirty thousand ~extremely positive~ reviews on Steam represent a very solid guarantee, nevertheless SCS Software really wanted to overcome , and with Scandinavia set a milestone for the future of simulators. If you want to find out why, just keep reading. The trucks of Euro Truck Simulator 2 arrive in Scandinavia with a load of novelties The tank top is not enough Although from the point of view of the extension of the map and the kilometers of practicable roads we are below the values of Going East!, the quality and density of the contents present in Scandinavia, an expansion that embraces Norway, Sweden and Denmark (which technically is part of the Scandinavian peninsula) is substantially on another production level. Let's start with the cold numbers. Twenty-seven new cities that are larger and more detailed than before, including the fascinating Copenhagen, Stockholm, Oslo, Malm, Gothenburg and Uppsala; eighty new types of cargo including trailers and semi-trailers of all kinds; over one hundred new building models and twelve ferry terminals with specific infrastructures and embarkations, all to the advantage of realism, given that sea transport is extremely widespread in the Scandinavian peninsula. These details alone would be more than enough to justify the purchase by a Euro Truck Simulator 2 enthusiast, however, as pointed out, there is much more in this second official expansion. The study of the geography and road networks of the newly introduced nations has been decidedly more accurate and meticulous than previously, a mammoth work which has not only benefited from the delightful reproduction of landscapes, residential areas and industrial complexes, but also the coherence and the variety of junctions and intersections, with many solutions for motorways and extra-urban roads capable of significantly impacting driving. The central area of Norway, for example, is incredible, with infernal passages and roundabouts that require much more attention in the maneuvering and traffic jam phases. Generally, the impact is more realistic and varied, and getting lost in some secondary road or taking the wrong lane, if you don't look carefully on the navigator, is a real possibility. As far as new infrastructures are concerned, the many reconstructed bridges are simply marvelous, such as the spectacular resund bridge (15.9 kilometres, the longest cable-stayed bridge in Europe) which connects Denmark (Copenhagen) with Sweden (Malmo) or those between Sweden and Norway, immersed in truly enchanting scenery. As in the past, the largest and most famous monuments and buildings of the various cities have been faithfully reproduced, but it was above all the factories, industrial areas and those for loading and unloading goods that benefited most from the production efforts of SCS Software. For example, we find huge complexes of fictitious brands such as those of IKA, which clearly mimics the Swedish furniture giant IKEA, and new types of entrances and exits for factories, which require particular manoeuvres, especially when parking. Among other things, new toll booths have also been introduced, where an automatic collection system is finally available (our Telepass, in practice)also for the player's truck, who no longer necessarily has to stop to pay the toll. Among the most interesting novelties, there are also reproductions of the huge Volvo factories near Gothenburg and those Scania in Sdertlje, explorable areas that offer specific transport missions with dedicated trailers, such as the delivery of new trucks to dealerships scattered throughout Europe . As indicated, eighty new types of cargo find space in Scandinavia, and among them there are even special trailers for livestock to be recovered from agricultural industries, as well as new foodstuffs, furnishings, machinery and dangerous chemical agents, which, as they well know the assiduous players of Euro Truck Simulator 2, are a source of substantial economic rewards when delivered. As far as natural landscapes are concerned, in the south of the Scandinavian peninsula we find above all plains with beautiful lakes surrounded by boreal forests, while further north there are spectacular mountain ranges capable of putting a strain on the engine of your truck. The very long journey that leads from Sweden to the city of Stavanger, in Norway, offers simply breathtaking views, and more than a few times you are driven to pull over to admire the landscape (with the consequent risk of delaying delivery). The Nordic vegetation has been finely reproduced and it is possible to observe birches, pines, firs and conifers lining the roads, so faithful to the real ones in terms of signs and infrastructures, that SCS Software is receiving thousands of emails with compliments by those who actually live there. Curious, for example, are some multi-lane Swedish roads where sometimes one of the driving directions is limited to a single lane, with consequent traffic slowdowns during peak hours and near city centres, while those in the heart of Norway, where it is necessary to juggle the twelve gears well to face them at the right speed. Overall, unlike the basic title and Going East!, traveling the splendid streets of Scandinavia you have the feeling of always being in different places, eliminating the understandable repetitiveness of some areas of the original map, considering the crazy extension. No chains The Scandinavia expansion, with all its load of spectacular new features, was accompanied by a substantial free update for everyone, which brought Euro Truck Simulator 2 to version 1.17.1. Beyond a better representation of your profile, now visible with a color photo, and the addition of new truck drivers controlled by artificial intelligence, the most important introductions have been made on the dynamic day-night cycle, on the lighting system and the rain effect. As far as the light effects are concerned, the rendering is now decidedly more refined and credible, with deep HDR, twilight rays and a whole series of details which, in concert with the renewed celestial vault, especially at sunset, offer incredibly spectacular views, with the aforementioned mountainous areas of Norway that really blow your mind. The rain effect, in addition to having been lightened from the point of view of the impact on performance, is now better refined, and based on the conditions it can drastically reduce visibility, with obvious effects on gameplay. The audio effect has also been completely re-sampled, with water droplets now gently tapping the cab when stationary and dynamically responding to the trucker's head movements, such as when looking out the window. Small details that increase the realism and the involvement factor of the title. Curiously, despite being set in Scandinavia, snow was not introduced in the expansion, which probably would have created more than a few headaches in the physical and dynamic model, as well as impacted on performance. After all, due to the greater density and variety of urban centers, at maximum detail and in 1080p the frame rate can be inconsistent even with a powerful 980 GTX equipped. In the Steam launcher, however, new launch options have been made available, which finally also include the 64-bit executable, as well as the inevitable DirectX support, each with its own level of influence on performance, already widely adjustable thanks to the many advanced graphics options. SCS Software has declared that the new updates and the production efforts expressed in Scandinavia represent the basis for what they will develop in the future, with the clear intention of realizing the definitive simulator; We hope you get at least oneanother expansion, dedicated to Italy (now represented by only three northern cities) and the Iberian Peninsula. Among other things, an agreement has finally been found for the Mercedes-Benz license (fictitiously called Majestic), and from the next update, free for everyone, the legendary Actros will officially find space in the garage of Euro Truck Simulator 2, which will thus embrace everyone and seven of the most prestigious European brands of tractor manufacturers. Furthermore, work continues to support mods more effectively, and beyond the highly anticipated integration with Steam Workshop, an elegant proprietary mod manager is also being developed, of which the first information has begun to circulate.", "date": "2015-05-15", "grade": null}
