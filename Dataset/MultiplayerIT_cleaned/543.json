{"name": "Exit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/exit.html", "text": "What a style! Taito's fatigue is a minimal product, starting with the plot. The protagonist is in fact Mister ESC, an escape professional who lends his services, for a fee, to anyone who needs to escape from dangerous buildings or places against his will. The game, in summary, is a kind of platform/puzzle that skillfully mixes the characteristics of the two genres producing an interesting final result, not totally innovative but still quite different from most of the games currently on the market. To get a vague idea, try to think of a cross between Prince of Persia, the one in 2 dimensions that gave rise to the series, and Lemmings. From the first it takes the management of the protagonist and the structuring of the levels, from the second the need to coordinate not only one's own efforts, but also those of one or more characters controlled by the CPU. The view is lateral, like in classic side-scrolling games. The aim of the game, in essence, is to navigate levels full of pitfalls and dangers, interact with objects and - above all - with the victims to be saved. Yes, because Exit, unlike most video games, is permeated by a particularly altruistic feeling, which requires the player's efforts to be directed towards the attempt to accompany women, men and children trapped inside buildings towards the exit. There are 10 different environments, from a burning building to a flooded shopping center to a hospital during an earthquake, to a hotel hit by an avalanche and so on. All absolutely disastrous situations, then. Each of these settings is made up of 10 levels, for a total of 100 to which are added another 100 downloadable from the network. Mister ESC's abilities are the classic platform ones, that is jumping, running, collecting objects, crouching and so on; all essential to be able to move within stages that have fires to extinguish, crates to move, electrified tiles to avoid and chasms to overcome. All things like that, and more. Unfortunately, however, it is precisely in the management of the main character that what is in fact the main defect of Exit appears, namely the control system. Woody, not very condescending, slow and sometimes cumbersome, so much so that he often and willingly decrees the famous and hateful accidental deaths. And since Taito production is not a simple game, especially in the advanced stages, and which requires precision and speed, these limits are even more annoying and irritating. Nice and good We were talking about CPU-controlled characters. In fact, within the levels there are various ~victims~, which can be men, women or children to be saved by successfully bringing them towards the exit. Unfortunately, none of the secondary characters have the athletic characteristics of Mister ESC, but rather each of them has advantages and disadvantages to use in their favor or to work around. For example, fat men can move large objects but cannot climb them unless they are helped by two adults. On the other hand, children must be supported both to go up and down from the various platforms, but their small size allows them to slip into otherwise unreachable tunnels and pass through unsafe corridors. It is also possible to assign short and simple tasks to fellow sufferers, thus untying them from the classic single file behind the hero to which they are otherwise forced. But there are also wounded people, who cannot necessarily help the protagonist in any way, not even being able to walk; in such cases, Mister ESC is obliged to carry them on his shoulders, limiting his movements enormously, until he reaches a stretcher on which to place them. The puzzle component of Exit is therefore decidedly marked, and often the only way to understand how to solve situations is by trial and error, or as English speakers like to say through ~trial and error~. Also because Exit is a game that forgives little or nothing: one mistake and the protagonist is dead, a box moved too much and the level has to be redone. An often frustrating system, even more so because of the aforementioned control system, but also absolutely rewarding once the solution is reached. Graphically, the game is truly a feast for the eyes; the style used, cartoony and benefited from a top-level artistic direction and an excellent use of color, makes the overall experience really pleasant. The characters, made in a stylized way using black silhouettes, are also beautifully animated. The sound is not as good, yes valid as regards the music but made lightnt irritating from the sampled sentences of the npc, really hard to digest especially since they are repeated over and over again. Comment Exit is a good game, but one that not everyone might like. Yes, because behind an attractive appearance determined by an artistically excellent graphic design, there is a product that is anything but immediately accessible. The game structure, a mix between platform and puzzle with a marked propensity towards the latter genre, requires commitment and attention, but above all patience, which may not belong to many potential buyers. It is above all a pity that alongside a ~healthy~ and stimulating difficulty determined by an excellent level design, another much less appreciable one must be pointed out and linked to a control system that is not up to par. Anyone who is able to accept a picture of this type, however, will be faced with one of the most rewarding and sincerely intriguing games of recent months. Pro Stimulating and rewarding. Excellent graphics. Definitely long-lived. Cons Unsuitable character control. Frustrating on occasion. Annoying sampled vocals. Within a particularly flourishing period for PSP, characterized by a fair number of quality titles intended to satiate the hunger of its users, Taito's Exit certainly deserves a prominent place. Brought to the West by the very active Ubisoft, the product in question is certainly not intended to surprise or leave you speechless; rather, Exit slowly grows in the player's interest, level after level, eventually becoming a real little obsession that is difficult to break away from.", "date": "2006-04-14", "grade": null}
