{"name": "Redout 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/redout-2-recensione.html", "text": "Almost six years have passed since the release of Redout, the spiritual heir of WipEout and F-Zero. A hyper-fast racing game in which the protagonists are futuristic space ships that challenge each other on gravitational tracks located in the most disparate places in the galaxy. The title of the Italian 34BigThings has been able to carve out a niche of enthusiasts, both thanks to the post- launch (the beauty of five DLCs were released in 2017), and above all to the collaboration with the Epic Game Store. About a month ago, in conjunction with the Enhanced Edition giveaway, the title was further updated and returned to the spotlight. An excellent commercial maneuver to push the launch of this sequel which is proposed as an enhanced version of the original game from all points of view. Let's find out what's new and above all how they have been implemented in our review of Redout 2! Lots of content Maintaining the ideal line is challenging even on the wider stretches of track Most of the work was concentrated on enriching the offer and perfecting the driving model. Starting from the first aspect, the quantity of tracks present in Redout 2 is appreciable: they are even 36 (or double, if we consider that they can also be tackled in the opposite direction), compared to the 25 of the predecessor. They are located on ten planets, each characterized by a specific value of gravity, atmospheric density and climate. The first variable affects cornering grip, the second affects resistance to forward movement and the third affects how quickly the turbo overheats. Precisely the latter is a key element of the flight model: there is the temptation to press the boost button as frequently as possible, but the engine temperature must be kept at bay which, if it remains for too long beyond a threshold of guard, it risks exploding. In addition to avoiding touching the barriers, an action that reduces the resistance of the shields and makes the spaceship more vulnerable, the secret is to take advantage of the shape of the runway to use the turbo only when it is really necessary. As? Mainly passing through accelerators placed in points that are not always in the ideal trajectory, and dosing the pitch to gain speed in the downhill sections while maintaining it in the uphill ones. This is easier said than done, considering the concentration required by piloting. There is no curve that is trivial and even the straight sections can hide pitfalls, especially during jumps, where you have to carefully calibrate the roll so as not to miss the landing point. Leaning against the barriers, with the consequent loss of speed, will make you lose patience quite often also due to the skill of the opponents, ready to exploit the slightest mistake. The whole thing is made even more complicated by the unforgivable absence of a minimap. Sure, there are rally-style indicators that anticipate the evolution of the track by a few seconds, but it's difficult to pay attention to them due to the high speed. There was a change of philosophy involving dueling on the track. In Redout it was possible to damage opponents by stealing their propulsive energy: this possibility has been eliminated to focus all attention on driving. Career and arcade The sensation of speed is extreme As in the first, there are two offline game modes. The arcade one, where almost all the tracks and spaceships are available from the beginning, does not present any major innovations. Six types of events: you start with the time attack, a challenge against yourself to improve the lap time, to move on to single races with a maximum of eleven challengers. In Last Man Standing, lap after lap, whoever is in last position is eliminated, while in Arena Race there is no margin for error: the explosion of the ship, whether due to engine failure or going off the track, involves the instantaneous end of the test. In Speed you earn points by maintaining a certain minimum speed for as long as possible, while Boss is a kind of marathon, providing for the connection of all the tracks without interruption. To this is added the real highlight of the Redout offer 2, i.e. the career, completely revisited compared to its predecessor and now more similar to that of Forza Motorsport. It spans five major leagues, each consisting of a complex set of challenges, which must be tackled in sequential order to unlock access to the most competitive leagues. Each trial presents various objectives whose completion is rewarded with new vehicles (twelve in all) and upgrades. This is another big news. While in the predecessor only two aupdates (one active, the other passive), in this sequel the level of customization is much more stratified and involves putting hands on as many as six technical elements (propeller, stabilizer, etc.) and three aesthetic ones. The biggest problem is that the upgrades are provided in a pre-established sequence, without the player being able to decide what to buy with the credits received. Little accessible, very customizable The level of difficulty is high even with all the aids Shortly before the publication of the review, a patch was released which lowered the difficulty level of the tutorial, a fundamental step to say the least to unlock all the features of Redout 2. Without having completed the first three tests, on the results of which the level of challenge, it is not possible to use the driving aids, nor to access the multiplayer mode which we will discuss later. The developers soon realized that they had set the initial bar too high, sparking several controversies on the forums: for this reason, although the release notes reiterate the fact that Redout 2 is by no means a game for everyone, they made it less difficult the opponents of the third round. Now it's easier to cross the finish line first and therefore have the ability to customize the gaming experience. There are even ten driving aid parameters (in practice they concern all the movements of the spaceship) and on each of them it is possible to intervene in a targeted way by regulating the intervention of the artificial intelligence between zero and one hundred. Not forgetting the six levels of difficulty of the computer-controlled opponents. All these adaptations give hope of tailoring an experience to measure, but in the end things are different. First of all, there is no way to completely delegate some maneuvers to the PC which remain difficult even with maximum aid. The AI is overly punishing and suffers from an unfortunate ~one-way~ rubber band effect. Forget mistakes by CPU-controlled opponents: in all of our tests it never happened that they ended up off the track or leaned against the walls. On the contrary, the player is only allowed minimal flaws: if your spaceship explodes due to excessive overheating you will be forced to restart the race, because it is practically impossible to catch up. Realization and surroundings Some color choices are questionable While we praised the first Redout for cleaning up the paths, sadly we can't do the same for the ones in this sequel. The bulk of the artistic work was concentrated right on the slopes, but it seemed to us that the designers paid more attention to the spectacular than to the functionality. They certainly hit the wow effect: whether you pass between the two guard dragons on Mount Fuji, or inside an industrial pyramid in the Cairo circuit, there is no shortage of memorable views. Among the most successful tracks are those set in space, where in certain passages it seems to be in the grip of psychotropic effects. Too bad, however, that, just as often, we don't realize the presence of jumps or barriers, which are lost with the sparkling setting. In other cases, concentration is lost to study the positioning of the accelerators, which often blend in with the rest of the circuit due to a questionable chromatic choice. Also in this sequel, the models of the spaceships settle on a lower level of detail than the scenarios ; this defect is a little more evident and annoying than in the past, especially in the customization menus, while it is not noticeable in while driving. This is because the sensation of extreme speed also supported by a granite frame rate has remained unchanged. The tests, conducted with maximum graphic detail and UltraHD resolution, returned, in moments of maximum glory, peaks of 110 fps, without ever dropping below 80. The excellent soundtrack helps to keep the adrenaline high, thanks also in the presence of special guests such as Giorgio Moroder and Zardonic, whose tracks stand out above the others. While waiting for leaderboards and classified championships to be available, multiplayer represents a valid alternative to arcade mode, given that opponents are much more likely to make mistakes (which almost never happens to artificial ones). However, the matchmaking needs to be refined, because on some occasions we happened to leave a few moments later than the rest of the group.", "date": "2022-06-20", "grade": "7.7"}
