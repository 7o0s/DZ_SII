Onslaught, this is the name of the package that is difficult to pronounce, which for the usual amount of  14.49 allows us to download four multiplayer maps, the all too powerful Maverick, a hybrid assault / sniper rifle and above all Nightfall, the new episode of the cooperative campaign Extinction. In short, nothing new: the developers change, but not the substance. Let's try to understand, therefore, if the contents present in the package are worth a not exactly economic outlay. In this sense, those who already know that they will buy all future DLCs will undoubtedly have to buy the Season Pass, in order to save a little on the individual packages. Onslaught is the first DLC for Call of Duty: Ghosts, and here's our review That house in the woods Among the maps, the least ~unpublished~ one is undoubtedly Ignition, which takes us directly back to the times of Scrapyard, or in the Modern Warfare 2 area. We are near what looks like a miniature Cape Canaveral, abandoned and full of structures left to rot among weeds and various wreckage. The layout is rather linear, but it must be said that there is no shortage of raised structures from which to enjoy a broad point of view over the central hot area, and several small hangars, underground passages and so on to enliven the rides from point A to point B. Defilaments galore, in short, and a couple of interactive points, such as the ability to turn on an Odin engine that can instantly incinerate the unfortunates. An interesting map, just as intricate with its good mix of open and closed spaces, but certainly not essential. Bayview takes us to the west coast, to what appears to be a much larger and more complex pier than the one in Santa Monica. The map is complex, and characterized by a dynamic element, or rather the carriage of a small train on which we can get on and automatically paint a target on our heads, but at least its constant movement breaks the lines of fire. There is not only this, however. As it should be, given the setting, the map is full of small shacks, but above all larger, multi-storey shops, which you can enter and perhaps ~snipe~ from the windows. Wide spaces here too but, thanks to the many structures and ~secondary streets~, also many defilations and blind corners. Bayview must therefore be studied well in order to memorize its complex but fundamentally very fun layout. Containment is certainly the most ~caciarona~ of the group, it seems made to be played with confirmed kill. Everything revolves around a real bottleneck, a bridge that connects the two ends of a Mexican village, on which a military truck has stopped carrying something that emits radiation like crazy. Obviously the climax of the clashes takes place in this area, giving rise to epic ~fagiolade~, all grenades, both lethal and tactical, and machine-gunned in bulk trying to catch someone when you are practically blinded by the dust and fumes. But we must certainly not forget that under the bridge there is the bed of a dry river which allows us to go around the bottleneck and catch those who linger behind shooting pigeon, passing from below, but above all a maze of alleys and hovels to complicate everything. Without a doubt the most immediate and rewarding map of the lot. To conclude the package there is Fog, which takes us to a grove immersed in the fog or, better, makes us experience the classic setting of an American horror film, the usual lonely house where he doesn't pick up the phone and where the big blonde is the first to die. And in fact it is enough to carry out a field order to transform into the Michael Myers of Halloween, complete with a mythical musical theme to announce the arrival of the maniac on the scene. The map is quite large and somewhat reminiscent of the snowy Whiteout. Caves, hidden passages, houses, barns and hills with secluded streets that take us to the top. This map is undoubtedly the best of the package: perhaps the palette used to color it is decidedly too gray, but it is the best structured and varied one. And then there's the new layer for Extinction. We like Nightfall, as we liked the first adventure on the Ghosts disc. This time we are inside a base, no longer in a Colorado village. New weapons, new aliens, but the concept doesn't change, you have to actively cooperate to get to the end, hive after hive, a very long and difficult process complete with a huge boss that punctuates the clashes. There is little to say that you don't know about thisthis modality: it is undoubtedly the icing on the cake of the DLC, capable of being played, or replayed for a very long time, with a good diversification of the areas. In short, we could almost say that it alone is worth the price of the ticket.", "date": "2014-01-31", "grade": null}
