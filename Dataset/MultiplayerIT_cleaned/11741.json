{"name": "Wipeout Pulse - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wipeout-pulse-recensione.html", "text": "Intense and lasting, this is how the relationship between the Wipeout series and the Playstation brand could be defined. Not only because it has always accompanied its hardware, but also because, with its mature and modern cut, the ex-Psygnosis racing title has always perfectly represented its underlying spirit. After the success of Pure, which was one of the first reasons to adopt the Sony portable console, Studio Liverpool therefore took the necessary time to work on a sequel that could take even better advantage of the hardware characteristics of the PSP. Wipeout Pulse is available for PSP. Turquoise Hexagon Sun The title helps us to understand from the beginning what is the concept behind the visual, playful and sound system of Wipeout Pulse. Starting from the purity and aseptic nature of its direct predecessor, in this episode the predominant figures are the electric impulse (and consequently the production of energy, the narrative pretext for some of the proposed routes) and the networks of hexagons, which in a coherent but often redundant characterize every aspect of the game. In fact, one of the main innovations concerns the structure of the races: having abandoned the linear system of Pure, in Pulse the single player campaign is divided into grids made up of hexagonal boxes. In turn, each of these corresponds to an event which, once successfully completed, will unlock the adjacent boxes and make the player acquire a specific number of points, awarded based on the type of medal obtained. Each grid has a minimum number of points needed to unlock the next, but each player is free to earn them by following the path that best suits their style of play. The events can correspond to different game modes, from the classic Single Races, Tournaments and Time Trials to more particular competitions, specially designed by Studio Liverpool for Pulse. Speed Lap is a sort of time trial where the goal is no longer to complete the race in the shortest time possible, but only to set the best lap time. Eliminator, on the other hand, refers to the Deathmatch tradition of first-person shooters, with the aim of eliminating as many contenders as possible. Head to head is also new, a race against a single opponent and without the possibility of using any weapon. The Zone mode returns, this time involving every track and every team, proposing an alternative Tron-style color scheme. The speed classes available are the same as Pure, with the exception of Vector. This time, however, it is possible to set the difficulty of the race separately by choosing between three levels of artificial intelligence of the enemies. Everything unlocked in the campaign mode can be used in the Race box, where you can create your own grids and customize them in every aspect. Black & White One of the most heralded features of this new chapter of the Sony title is the mag-strip. It is a gravitational coupling system with which some parts of the circuits are equipped which has allowed greater variety in the track design, making it possible to introduce loops and twists otherwise incompatible with the physical model of the game. The tracks are in most cases well designed and skilfully alternate long straights, series of hairpin bends and spectacular stages such as jumps or portions of the track without guard rails, but they struggle to reach qualitative peaks comparable to those of their predecessors (G2 above all) and sometimes they are rather anonymous, both in terms of driving style, setting and visual style. Each circuit is offered in two versions, black and white, where the direction of travel and some portions of the track change, so as to make it passable in both directions. On the one hand, this entails a double number of tracks and therefore greater longevity, but on the other, the risk of creating confusion in the player: obtaining successes in Wipeout means first of all knowing the routes perfectly, and having to memorize and distinguish two different share the same setting certainly does not facilitate the player's task. These circuits must then also be recognized in the Zone mode, with a totally different graphic design. Of course, we are not faced with the total confusion of Wipeout Fusion and its 6 paths, normal and reverse, for each world, but the impression is that we wanted to extend the stock even where it was not necessary, going to undermine the identity unique and peculiar to each circuit. Shockwave! The historic stables of the series are back, without too many changes compared to what was seen on Pure. AThe only team introduced for the occasion is the EG-X, with a vehicle with a good balance and no particular strong points. The Loyalty points system is totally new: at the end of each race, based on the player's performance, ~loyalty points~ are assigned to the team used, which will later be used to unlock extra content. Specialization is thus rewarded, perhaps excessively penalizing those who prefer to vary the team according to the type of race. The bodywork of each vehicle can be painted as desired through a tool available on the game's website, according to a good degree of customization. There are also packages containing new teams and circuits, exactly as happened with Pure, which presumably will see the return of ships such as Harimau and Icaras. Even with regard to the artillery, there are no major changes, with the exception of a machine gun that requires continuous firing and which risks distracting from driving (as already seen in Fusion) and a whole series of heavy weapons available in Eliminator mode. The multiplayer Wipeout Pulse offers different ways to play multiplayer games, from local LAN to game sharing. Online multiplayer via infrastructure is finally available (up to 8 players), but we weren't able to test it in the review phase due to Studio Liverpool's decision to block the servers until the game was released. Comment Wipeout Pulse demonstrates how Studio Liverpool knows how to pack great products. Technically impeccable, game mechanics filed to the millimeter, long-lived and complete also from the point of view of statistics, additional modes and in general of the ~outline~ to the actual game, it completes the process of building the perfect structure already started by Pure. What is missing is a strong and unique identity, but probably Studio Liverpool wanted to emphasize the play system, almost as if it were a dress rehearsal for the next-gen episode that all Wipeout fans are waiting for, and it is a compromise certainly acceptable given the quality of the product they have put on the market. Pros Complete and long-lived Technically excellent One of the best games available for PSP Cons Game experience forcibly lengthened Graphic design not up to the brand The leap compared to Pure is not so marked I loved my DR", "date": "2007-12-12", "grade": null}
