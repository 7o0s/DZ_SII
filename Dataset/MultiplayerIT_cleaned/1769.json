The title of Tummy Games is placed on that borderline between the game openly for children and the harp enjoyable even for adults, also putting together a nice characterization and a control system which, in some elements, almost seems to leverage some mechanisms psychological to be irresistible. Farm It! it makes us check some aspects of a farm, from working in the fields to the packaging of culinary products To all this is added the classic accumulation dynamics, in this case of agricultural products and obviously money and gems, which always works well to keep us tied even to titles that are not particularly engaging in terms of gameplay and story and it becomes clear how you are faced with a much more reasoned and complex mechanism than its cute appearance might make us think. The nice thing is that it's an Apple Arcade game, so although it seems designed specifically to extract money with micro-transactions, these don't actually exist inside it (at least in this version) and all the boost to increase and customization is completely ~sound~, only related to the dynamics of the game. Also for this reason, despite being a title entirely made up of extremely simple mini-games and designed for short hit and run sessions, it is probable that one will not be able to easily detach once a game has started, a symptom of the fact that the developers have managed to create a good rhythm through the well-functioning juxtaposition of game mechanics, it being understood that it is a gameplay that is truly minimal. Cut, grow, cook and sell The purpose of Farm It! is to run a farm, increasing crops and livestock and enriching it with new structures and furniture, as the fruits of hard work in the fields. The latter, to tell the truth, takes place in a very singular way: whether it is a question of cultivating vegetables or raising animals (a choice that can be made at the beginning of each new working day), we are faced with a series of mini -game in rapid sequence, somewhat distant from the reality of agricultural work. Particularly strange, but also incredibly satisfying, is the first phase in which we find ourselves moving a huge knife over a block (a sort of cake, it would seem), moving it up and down in order to slice it into small cubes to be thrown with the greatest precision possible inside the trailer at the top of the screen. It is a mechanism that has very little to do with cultivation but which allows you to collect various resources including wood, stones and gems which will be useful for the expansion of the farm. But above all, the fluid response of the knife to the movement of the finger on the screen and the decomposition of the block into small cubes generates a sensation of almost physical satisfaction, truly to be experienced. The work in the fields in Farm It takes place through mini-games that have little to do with real farming In the next phase, we find ourselves choosing which crop to plant or which animals to feed, thus passing in very rapid sequence to sowing and irrigation in the case of plants or to the distribution of feed in the case of animals, to then go through the last phase of fruit harvesting and vegetables or various livestock products, to be carefully poured into the tractor trailer. Everything is solved in simple and quick gestures on the touch screen to be carried out with the greatest possible timing and precision in order to get the most out of the harvesting operations. To tell the truth, the impression is that the calculation of the success percentages is somewhat uncertain as the controls do not allow for a particularly high degree of precision, but this is not a game that goes too subtle and the important thing is accumulate resources with quick gestures on the screen. Farm It evaluates the precision of movements, even if it is not clear how All the sideline activities are then aimed at the commercial phase of the agricultural activity: we can expand the structures to increase crops and types of animals, furnish the farm in order to increase the possible actions and the executable recipes and thus be able to sell a greater variety of products at the market. The kitchen is another fundamental element in the whole mechanism: also in this case they are simple mini-games focused on precision and timing (someof these particularly demanding, to tell the truth) whose results are reflected in the quantity of dishes and products that can be packaged to be able to sell them on the market.", "date": "2021-04-02", "grade": "6.4"}
