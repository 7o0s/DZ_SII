We had already completed it at the time, eight years ago, but facing the Second European War all over again together with Alicia, Welkin and the others is it was a pleasure that you rarely experience: in this case almost two decades have passed since the release of the PlayStation 3 version, but the tear that fell again on the end credits reminded us of a couple of things. First of all, in a period in which remasters are flocking to the right and left of games that have recently come out, the conversion of the SEGA title, years later, is a second chance for those who did not know it and had so far missed a little gem. And then, obviously, emotions don't get old, and Valkyria Chronicles is a great story, even before being a strategic RPG. We have already told you about the plot in our previous trial, so we invite you to read the dedicated paragraph to learn more about this parallel world and its political situation. If, on the other hand, you want to know if the gameplay has aged well but, above all, how this conversion behaves... read on. The remastered version of Valkyria Chronicles is not surprising, but the SEGA title remains unmissable Playstation 4 trophies Unlike the original, this remastered version of Valkyria Chronicles finally supports Trophies: divided into 7 bronze, 3 silver and 10 gold, to which the platinum trophy belongs, the achievements in the SEGA title require a little ' commitment because you don't have to complete only the story missions, but dissect every aspect of the game and make a real massacre of enemies. Welkin Gunther's War Let's recap for those who are too lazy to go and re-read the aforementioned tried or our review of yesteryear: Valkyria Chronicles is a delightful cross between a JRPG, a visual novel, a turn-based strategy and a real-time strategy. Described in this way it may seem like a tremendously complicated game, and even a little boring, but in reality the guys at SEGA have managed to mix everything expertly, devising an intriguing and at the same time easy to understand combat system. The player controls the individual units in real time: it's up to him, as Welkin, to decide how to spend the Command Points (CP) to move his pawns. When the precious resource runs out it's up to the enemy, after which the cycle begins again until the objectives set from mission to mission are reached or the turn limit imposed by the game is exceeded. The various characters and vehicles are controlled almost as if we were playing an action game in the third person, climbing over walls and exploring the map vertically and horizontally as long as the movement capacity of the selected unit allows it: each type of unit enjoys a certain freedom of movement and capabilities that make it more or less suitable for skirmishing with enemies. In fact, when you engage in battle, you have to aim and hit the target, possibly where we would inflict more damage - to the head, for example - to get rid of it faster. Here the synergy between the various units comes into play with arrogance: the covering fire allows you to attack more or less undisturbed and each character has unique powers and abilities that make him more or less suitable for certain situations. Some soldiers are more susceptible to certain environmental damage, others fight better in urban centers, still others are at their best when accompanied by certain other heroes, and so on. Each ability is narratively justified: most of the characters have their own personality and the game encourages us to get to know them better between one mission and another, when we can micromanage our army through the barracks menus, upgrading the various classes and recruiting new ones units, aware that every battle for them could be their last. Although much more permissive, in fact, permanent death is a reality that risks depriving us of our most precious soldiers. Through this exemplary combination of gameplay and narration, Valkyria Chronicles manages to involve and excite, as long as you have the patience to cross your arms on your chest and follow the long cinematic sequences that often separate the various missions and which, perhaps, would have benefited from a slightly livelier direction. In this sense it is clear that the SEGA title was not designed only for die-hard strategic fans, but also and above all for a wider audience: the level of difficulty is medium-low and it is possible to complete some missions in a few minutes , simply by checking the fastest drives and choosing the safest routesthrough the map. The rules would even seem to reward the quick and painless approach, net of a sacrifice in terms of killings and experience points that could leave lovers of the strategic genre and RPG dumbfounded, especially in a war context like the one proposed in the game: fortunately it is possible to choose the most suitable tactic, in the vast majority of cases, and possibly change it along the way. In short, while proposing a somewhat naive structure, Valkyria Chronicles offers sufficient freedom of action to satisfy even the most shrewd of strategists, thanks also to the large number of secondary missions and the DLCs included in the package. Remastered for us The peculiar visual style adopted by SEGA excuses a graphic backwardness that dates back to the early years of the last generation, embroidering a soft pastel color on the cel shading that transforms each scene - including, and above all, those of combat - into something more than a animated illustration in the form of a video game. The merit also goes to the singular shaded frame, slightly resized in this remastering to facilitate overall visibility, which projects us directly into the book in which our adventures are recorded, a real menu through which we can access the various missions and options of game. If it is true that buying Valkyria Chronicles Remastered means going towards a production of eight years ago, and therefore with somewhat approximate three-dimensional models and animations that are not always very fluid, it is equally right to underline the fact that we are faced with one of those rare cases in which the artistic direction clearly outclasses the brute force of the polygons thanks to the always spot-on choice of colors and the over the top level of detail, especially in maps with an urban setting. The differences compared to the PC version proposed a year ago are minimal, in reality: the 1080p resolution and the granite 60 frames per second guarantee an always excellent experience, but in this conversion we found a significantly more marked aliasing which gives some sequences a little dirtier look. In contrast, there is a fair amount of improvement work on some textures, even if not so evident as to overturn the fate of a version lower than the PC one, albeit by very little. As already anticipated in our test, it is possible to set the Japanese audio track and enjoy the dubbing in the original language instead of the English adaptation; in any case, it is a work of excellent quality, underlined by the punctual and beautiful soundtrack signed by Hitoshi Sakimoto.", "date": "2016-05-10", "grade": "8.5"}
