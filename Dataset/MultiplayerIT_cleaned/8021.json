{"name": "Battaglia nell'oltretomba!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/114285-skulls-of-the-shogun-battaglia-nelloltretomba.html", "text": "The fledgling software house of 17-Bit (originally Haunted Temple Studios, but they then changed their name in homage to the original team authoring Worms, Alien Breed and so on on the Amiga) is made up of four exodate experts from the ranks of Electronic Arts: folks tough who has worked over the years on important blockbusters of the video game industry such as Command & Conquer, Medal of Honor, James Bond or Scarface, but also people like Jake Kazdal, visual artist, who even has REZ and Space Channel 5 in his curriculum , worked alongside sacred monsters such as Mizuguchi-San. In short, the experience behind this fresh and small team is not lacking, despite the fact that Skulls of the Shogun is their very first title to appear on a console (Xbox 360, specifically, but also Windows 8 - necessary to play on PC - and Windows Phone). Old reminiscences It is precisely the co-founder of the studio Jake Kazdal who declares how this title was born: his visceral love for Advance Wars on Nintendo DS gave him the idea, then playing Pixeljunk Monsters, Valkyria Chronicles and Plants vs Zombies on everything materialized in a very natural and spontaneous way, also considering that another member of the team already had a graphics engine ready and running. The idea behind Skulls of the Shogun is to create a real-time strategy game that is however much more ~fluid~ in gameplay, without downtime and continuous enter/exit from multiple choice menus. Starting it up, the first thing we notice is the very particular graphic style, a 2D cel shading with cartoon-style and super deformed characters, rubbery, soft but not banal, rather funny and irreverent as South Park could be. Everything, starting from the menus, brings to mind just what is in the DNA of the team's ~name~: from Worms to a font very similar to what we saw for Alien Breed a decade ago on the Amiga, up to the title itself which brings to mind old graphic adventures on PC, the homage is clearly that of the 16-bit era. Skulls of the Shogun has a main mode called quite simply ~Campaign~, through which, after a small incipit inserted to make us understand that we are undead, we have to face scheme after scheme of armies and end-of-level bosses. More than a conventional map of an RTS, each scheme resembles a stage of any two-dimensional action game, with roads, shortcuts, obligatory passages and paths through highly inspired settings. Quite clearly it reminded us of the older ~Mystaria/Blazing Heroes~ (old Sega Saturn fans will gasp), also an RTS done to very adventure-like levels. After a few seconds of the game we have already amassed, in the afterlife, a large group of followers, old Samurai who still recognize us as authorities and are ready to do anything to follow us: in the game you not only command a character but a team made up of the ~Commander ~ and various non-commissioned officers. The fateful ~Game Over~ occurs only and only when the commander's energy reaches zero. Xbox 360 goals Skulls of the Shogun puts a good 400 points ~up for grabs~ to be obtained by unlocking 20 objectives, of which almost a third are related to online multiplayer, tough enough to get them all. Another third are obtained automatically by progressing through the levels of the game campaign, while the rest with particular achievements. For example completing all levels in less than 3 hours might be pretty tough. In general, however, objectives within reach of the ~pad~. An atypical RTS for atypical gamers Unlike ~normal~ RTS, in which the characters move within the level through ~chess-style~ grids that let us understand how many moves we can advance, in Skulls of the Shogun an action circle is activated at the inside which we can move freely with the analog stick, to then decide which action to take in real time, with a single ~on the fly~ menu on the screen that reminds us of the possible selections, non-invasive, without wasting time or too many clicks useless. Definitely a choice that streamlines the ~ancient~ gameplay of this genre and makes it much faster both in movement and in the actions performed: attacks, spells, defense, summons and so on, all selectable on the fly once we have stopped at the point chosen. Obviously to make white weapon attacks we have to get at least close to the enemy, on the contrary, when we attack from a distance we are allowed a certain distance based on the magic or weapon selected at that moment, and the game also takes into account the surrounding environment (a boulder placed between us and the target affects our shot, for example). The silly and fun look of this pot gamewould mislead many: Skulls of the Shogun is an RTS that requires careful planning of the moves, knowledge of the game environment and the exploitation of all the resources present in the level. In short, in one word: strategy. It might be obvious, but it's not in a title that claims to be a ~light~ RTS due to its speed and maneuverability. You will understand from the first level that going ahead with your head down immediately entails a punishment. The Commander is the most powerful warrior we have in the army, the one who inflicts the most damage and the one capable of the most powerful summons and spells, but it is not possible to deploy him on the front line at the mercy of the enemies because the game over is guaranteed in a few minutes. There are three main classes (infantry, cavalry and archers), each with specific mobility and attack/defense characteristics. Managing them in the best way leads to a big advantage over the opponent, for example, but that's not all because there are dozens and dozens of variables in play. The Importance of Skulls In addition to the variables given by the setting, full of shelters, ravines, secondary roads, there are also evocations. For example, if we manage to take possession of the Temples we can have the spirits of the ancient Warrior Monks on our side. Some of them are able to wipe out multiple enemies at the same time through their magic, others have healing potions on their side, still others are fearsome in close combat: using them intelligently is a winning tactic. Another variable is instead made up of other infested areas, areas whose color changes according to the team that has taken possession of them (and which obviously can be reconquered in turn). Finally, the name of the game itself makes us guess yet another feature of the same, or the skulls that play a predominant role in the gameplay. Whenever we kill an opposing warrior and his skull remains on the battlefield, we can assimilate it (yes, we are in the afterlife after all) and obtain the benefits. Each of them makes us gain more energy, while taking three in a row our unit transforms into ~demonic~ and gets an extra turn (always useful!). The great peculiarity of Skulls of the Shogun is also that of being one of the few ~cross platform~ games available for now, since you can play it on Xbox 360 and then continue on the new Windows Phone portable devices, or on a PC equipped with Windows 8 with the game save on the ~cloud~ and following us everywhere. If we really want to find some flaws, we must necessarily say that the ~free~ control system on the map, in the busiest moments, often leads to a bit of confusion because our soldiers cannot be distinguished well from the enemies, and sometimes it is even difficult track down the biggest General in the army. Ultimately, a compromise that we like but which inevitably leads to some problems with order and cleanliness on the screen. Ultimately, there is a lot of irons in the fire, provided that the most experienced and savvy players manage to go ~beyond~ the colorful and nice facade of the undead Samurai, being able to understand all the depth of the gameplay and the goodness of the system shift control. In addition to the basic ~game~, then, there is everything from online multiplayer, locally up to 4 players, and cross platform. Old players thank, and look forward to future expansions already announced.", "date": "2013-02-05", "grade": "8.0"}
