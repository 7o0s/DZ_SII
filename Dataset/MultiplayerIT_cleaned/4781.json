From the end of 2014 to today, the experience developed by Frontier Developments has evolved under various aspects, it has grown in numbers and facets, and the fruits of a lot of work are also visible on the Sony platform; starting with the fact that it is possible to buy the game in two different packages: the basic one, which costs 24.99 euros and therefore allows you to try this difficult but fascinating space simulator by investing a relatively modest amount, or the Commander Deluxe Edition, which at the price of 49.99 euros also includes the Horizons expansion. In any case, it is a product that according to many enthusiasts stands as ~what No Man's Sky wanted to be~, although in reality from many points of view the Hello Games title, despite all its limitations, is more comprehensive and malleable, especially in the initial stages. We need a light It is now known that Elite: Dangerous is a game that engages in the first ten, fifteen hours solely to understand how to complete the most trivial operations and interpret the dynamics of an absolutely vast, complex and angular structure. The game has some small tutorials that teach you how to manage the ship, extract minerals from space rocks and even fight with a basic or advanced style, but once this phase is over you will be literally alone in the immense void of an entire galaxy, wondering where to go , what to do and how to do it. By visiting the various spaceports you can be assigned missions useful to grow your reputation in view of the alignment that at a certain point you will be called to choose, but during the first twenty or thirty hours you will do nothing but go around the trade routes as simple messengers, transporting goods to collect the credits necessary for the purchase of new modules and new spacecraft. In fact, the Sidewinder supplied at the beginning does not lend itself to particular needs, so once you decide whether to dedicate yourself to trade, exploration or combat (as bounty hunters or as pirates), it will be essential to equip yourself accordingly. Even in these situations, however, the game does not provide any support and it is necessarily necessary to leaf through online guides and suggestions to understand what is the right way to proceed: a lack that perhaps on PC one does not pay too much attention to, but which the console user might justifiably find it daunting. give me a sign The initial menu of Elite: Dangerous allows you to start a new game in ~solo~ or ~open~ mode, the latter with the possibility of meeting other users (up to thirty-two) during their space crossings. An eventuality that we have discovered to be quite rare: the huge map fielded by Frontier Developments, with its boundless distances, hardly lends itself to random encounters. Speaking of distances to cover, even on PlayStation 4 one of the first things we will have to familiarize ourselves with is the navigation system of the spacecraft, which uses two different solutions to shorten otherwise infinite journeys: hyperspace jumps and Super Cruise mode. The first allow, within certain conditions, to select a destination system and make a leap that will take us there in a few moments, while the second is a super-fast guide that allows you to move quickly within the shortest routes , within the solar system itself, but being very careful to exit this mode when approaching planetary orbits and/or your destinations. Less trivial to master than it might seem, the game's movement system is managed in a more than discreet way by the DualShock 4, thanks also to the use of the touch pad to display maps, contacts and any missions in progress on the left, while in the right panel there are the options of the ship, the modules and so on. +5 Playstation 4 trophies As was to be expected, the fifty-eight Trophies of Elite: Dangerous must be conquered with commitment and patience, exploring the galaxy and spending dozens of hours completing missions of various kinds. In fact, there are several ~numeric~ achievements, which can be unlocked by performing the same operation for a certain number of times, but also others linked to the first time certain actions are performed. How many stars have you collected? In the last three years we have discovered how Elite: Dangerous is an ambitious project with enormous potential, but at the same time often unable to adequately exploit thisle which are its most peculiar facets, such as for example the possibility of actually affecting the balance of certain systems. However, these are concepts that during our tests on PlayStation 4 we have done nothing but imagine, engaged in the aforementioned initial ~farming~ phase and in some impromptu duel against space pirates determined to steal our cargo. The fights remain the best part of the experience even on the Sony console, thanks to a depth that in this specific situation finds immediate enhancement and allows you to implement precise strategies, especially after having taken care of your equipment a minimum. From a technical point of view, however, the game continues not to surprise, often proving to be modest and also accusing the Sony platform of the obvious drops in frame rate when the fast moving modes are activated. While remaining anchored to 1080p and without HDR support, on PlayStation 4 Pro it is however possible to choose between two different presets, quality and performance: while the first improves the effects at the expense of fluidity, the second guarantees sixty frames per second practically constant.", "date": "2017-07-11", "grade": "8.0"}
