{"name": "Oceanhorn 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/oceanhorn-2-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Oceanhorn 2: Knights of the Lost Realm takes us into a fascinating and suggestive world, which pays homage to the atmospheres of The Legend of Zelda while trying to find its own identity. Available only on Apple Arcade, the new episode of the series developed by Cornfox & Bros. arrives almost six years after the debut chapter, but narratively stands as a prequel, set thousands of years before the events told in Monster of Uncharted Seas Of course this does not imply the lack of technical and structural evolution, which is actually the first thing you notice as soon as you launch the application on the iPhone or iPad. Everything has changed a bit: the characters no longer have the chibi-style proportions of The Wind Waker, the artistic sector appears convincing and mature, but above all the settings say a lot about an undoubtedly ambitious production, which not by chance is currently being billed somewhat as the face of Apple's subscription service. Story and characters The story of the game revolves around a young hero who, on the very day of his investiture as a knight, finds himself having to face the invasion of a mysterious army of dark warriors, supported by very powerful flying ships capable of hitting targets from long distances thanks to lethal beams of light. However, the event is anticipated by the arrival of Trin, a courageous fighter who comes from Arcadia, who together with the android Gen will join the protagonist, effectively creating a party that we will be able to manage in a simple way, possibly indicating the enemies to attack or the areas to go to, especially if they are pressure interruptions for opening doors or activating mechanisms. In this regard, it must be said that even from the point of view of the puzzles, the developers have introduced new ideas, in concert with the possibility of using a magic gun that can be loaded with pellets, flammable seeds, ice spells and lightning. There are in fact barriers that can be set on fire to pave the way, or antennas to be connected electrically to pilot the opening of a gate; in addition of course to the simple fact that our character cannot jump except automatically, in the presence of minor obstacles, and therefore it is often necessary to understand which path to take in order to get closer to the objective of the turn. It is in these situations, as well as in the graphic style, that the greatest similarities with the various episodes of The Legend of Zelda are found, although the level of the puzzles of Oceanhorn 2: Knights of the Lost Realm never pushes itself towards levels of excessive complexity . To adapt also and above all to those who use touch controls, evidently, the authors did not want to play with the timing or a particular management of the view: an understandable approach, but which inevitably ends up limiting the experience. There are creatures that pop up within the scenarios and that generally have to be faced with a sword and shield, but don't expect too much from the feedback from the fights: Nintendo productions boast an extraordinary level of refinement in this respect, and unfortunately the guys from Cornfox & Bros they could not guarantee the same quality; especially in the not very numerous boss fights, which are always resolved without too many problems and in a fairly trivial way. Technical realization and gameplay The greatest value of Oceanhorn 2: Knights of the Lost Realm undoubtedly lies in the quantity and quality of the scenarios that we will find ourselves visiting during the campaign, which boasts a duration of about ten hours and a very well marked progression, introducing new elements man as you go into the story. There are aspects of the game that reveal the inevitable budget limitations, especially during the dialogues between the characters, but we have rarely seen in the mobile sector such a high production value and such attention to detail. Played on a 2017 iPad Pro, the title offers truly suggestive moments, while showing the side of some small problems in the streaming of the assets during some sequences. The architectures of the cities we are going to visit, equipped with a non-open world structure but large watertight compartments, which require very instantaneous loading to move from one district to another, boast a certain degree of variety and are very well enhanced by a sophisticated and convincing lighting system, which gives a great charm especially to the dungeons. Remaining in the technical field, the audio sector boasts fairly well-made English dialogues (subtitled in Italian) and rather inspired music, capable of creating a certain atmosphere but inevitably repetitive when you pass too muchlittle time in a certain point of the map, perhaps thinking about how to overcome a more obscure puzzle than the others. As for the gameplay, there are RPG elements that mark the progression of the protagonist and make him gradually stronger, stones that can be collected and use to enhance equipment in various ways, as well as a selection wheel (vaguely reminiscent of the one in Skyward Sword) to use a specific item. Getting hold of bombs, for example, allows you to destroy certain barriers in order to access otherwise inaccessible areas; just as the grappling hook opens up a whole series of new possibilities for shortening distances and moving vertically very quickly. The aforementioned touch controls work fairly well, but Oceanhorn 2 certainly stands as one of those mobile games that is definitely worth 'more worth playing with a controller (here we have made a list of the best): in this way the whole experience earns several points. Too bad only for the lack of an option that allows you to reverse the vertical view, but it seems to be included soon with an update.", "date": "2019-09-29", "grade": "8.5"}
