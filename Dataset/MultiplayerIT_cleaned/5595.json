It is a turn-based strategy that basically takes up the combat system of traditional RPGs, with a party, made up in this case of superheroes from the House of Ideas, who find themselves gradually facing waves of increasingly stronger enemies, inside four chapters (but for the moment there are only three) divided into various missions and playable on multiple levels of difficulty where there is a need to do a little grinding. Many characters present, both as regards the ~good~ and ~bad~ factions, with comic book variants alongside cinematic ones (the latter generally less strong) and a system that randomly selects our heroes during the first bars, then relying on the classic expedient of ~extraction~ to enrich the roster of characters, skills and objects, often expendable to enhance the characteristics of our fighters. The plot behind Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2, if we want to call it that way, will see us engaged in countering a terrorist operation aimed at conquering the famous ISO-8 minerals of the videogame universe. In short, we will have to lead our hands, make the most of our team's resources and try to make the most of the turn-based system to defeat the enemies, even in an asynchronous one-on-one multiplayer mode. Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2 is a well-crafted, solid and fun title, full of characters The sacred covenant Our team can count on a maximum of four active components, with a front line formed by three heroes. Among these there will always be one coming from an ~alliance~ with another user, modifiable but only up to a certain point, sometimes for narrative reasons. After logging into a mission, we will find our team on the left and the bad guys on the right, while the turn order will be visible at the top of the screen: this is a negligible element during the first few games, but which assumes a role of fundamental importance as soon as the difficulty rises, which happens to be precise in the middle of the second chapter, when the freemium nature of Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2 comes out into the open. However, it will take us several hours to get to that point, and they will undoubtedly be fun hours. The combat system works well, with the selection of the moves in the lower part and a series of tactical facets that can make the difference in terms of a particularly tough fight. There is also a great fidelity in the reproduction of the maneuvers of each individual character, together with an impressive amount of villain. The fact of having to submit to an energy system to grapple with the missions never appears limiting, and in fact during our tests we never had to wait for this indicator to recharge. From a graphic point of view, an excellent job has been done, with really well done polygonal models in cel shading and a fair variety of settings, ranging from streets to roofs, passing through hangars and control rooms.", "date": "2016-04-07", "grade": "8.0"}
