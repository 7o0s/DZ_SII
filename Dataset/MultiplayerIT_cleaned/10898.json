{"name": "Sexy Tower Quest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sexy-tower-quest.html", "text": "1987: Triffix Entertainment develops for U.S. Gold an original and innovative platform, which is converted for all home computers of the time (Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, etc.): Nebulus. The game sees us control a kind of green frog called Pogo, who has to destroy eight towers that have sprung up from the sea waters. To succeed in this enterprise, the character will have to climb these towers by navigating the platforms around them, avoiding the numerous traps and eliminating all the enemies present. The peculiarity of this title lies in the basic concept, given that in fact it is not Pogo who moves, but the environment that surrounds him: the tower rotates left or right, depending on our movements, using a truly surprising graphic effect. Almost ten years later, in 1995, the Traveller's Tales team created a platformer for Mega Drive and Super NES to celebrate the career of the most famous mouse in the world: Mickey Mania. The title stands out for its graphics and playability, and in its most spectacular stage it mentions Nebulus, with Mickey Mouse having to climb a tower as quickly as possible while flames rise from below. So, what do these two classics have to do with the new Twistbox Games production? It's simple: Sexy Tower Quest takes up the same mechanics of Nebulus, that is, it puts us in the role of a character who must climb five towers to their top to free some Venusian princesses. Along the way, we will find many enemies of various kinds as well as more or less dangerous traps: collapsing platforms, rollers that roll left or right, etc. The game control system is extremely simple, with the d-pad for movement and jumping (which can also be operated using the 1 and 3 keys, for greater precision), and the 5 key for firing the laser gun. There are five towers to climb in all, each with a different setting and a level of difficulty that grows gradually and which can be further increased once all levels have been completed. At the end of each stage we will see the tower collapse on itself and we will acquire the ~sexy~ image of the princess we freed. Here, in this sense we need to open a necessary parenthesis: adding the prefix ~Sexy~ to the title of this game appears to be a controversial move, as we are certainly not dealing with a production with an erotic background and the same images of princesses are extremely chaste. Moving on to a purely technical discourse, it is clear that the bulk of the graphics sector is represented by the excellent rotation effect of the tower, which moves fluidly and without uncertainties. The rest, to be honest, leaves something to be desired: the design of the characters, the Achilles' heel of all Twistbox Games productions, is anything but exceptional, while the animations are of decent workmanship and the enemies quite numerous and varied. The locations have been differentiated above all on the basis of the colours, but the chromatic combinations very often leave something to be desired. As for the sound, we have some MIDI music with some interesting ideas but boring in the long run. The controls respond to inputs with enough speed and precision. PRO The rotation effect of the towers is nice Simple and immediate AGAINST Too easy and limited Mediocre technical achievement Anything but ~sexy~", "date": "2009-02-03", "grade": "S.V."}
