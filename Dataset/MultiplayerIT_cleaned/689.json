{"name": "Gene Troopers - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gene-troopers-recensione.html", "text": "FPS: either here or there Fans of the genre will have noticed in recent times how the settings for First Person Shooters now essentially sound dichotomous: with rare exceptions, we will either live a first-person experience during the Second World War (Call of Duty, Brothers in Arms, Medal of Honor ), or in a science fiction universe of various genres (Doom, Quake, Half-Life, Halo, Riddick). Gene Troopers is looking for a place in the sun right among the productions set in the more or less distant future. The work of the Cauldrons (previously authors, among others, of Chaser, Spellcross, Battle Isle: The Andosia War, Quadrax) initially lets itself be appreciated for the excellent incipit with very lively cut scenes which however do not have a reading clear. Only later, with the use of various flashbacks, will everything become clearer: in practice our digital alter ego is sucked into a dimension parallel to the one populated by us humans and without batting an eye he finds himself with various genetically modified grafts by no better ~Gene Troopers~ that in a few seconds we understand to be the bad guys of the situation. However, our man does not undergo a total conversion work (who is saying Quake IV over there?) and thus finds himself half human and half ~GT~, in an unclear situation that could prove to be very dangerous in any case. As if all these problems weren't enough, his daughter has also been captured by the Gene Troopers and will not rest until he has freed her. On more than one occasion we will find ourselves faced with crossroads in which we will have to make a choice Gene Troopers: the sliding doors of video games The originality of Gene Troopers lies in the fact that the whole narrative background, as well as being the background to the action, will prove to have a direct repercussion in our history since on more than one occasion we will find ourselves facing crossroads in which we will have to a choice. For example, at a certain point in the game, a mysterious alien (at least until that moment) who seems to be on our side anyway informs us of where our daughter could be but at the same time warns us about our hybrid condition and advises us, before proceeding with the rescue work, to be assisted by a specialized doctor on a distant planet. At this point it will be up to us to decide what to do and clearly our choice will lead us in different directions. There is no doubt that this element will lead to a high replayability factor to see how the story would have continued if we had made a different decision. Gene Troopers: the sliding doors of video games Another specificity of GT concerns the particular characteristics of our modified DNA, the element capable of improving the performance of our digital alter ego in managing the character similar to the coordinates of RPGs (in fact we will collect the DNA from the aliens we have killed, thus making this element resemble the typical ~experience~ of role-playing games). Don't expect who knows what wonders from this aspect also because it is only about upgrades since instead the weapons (which we will talk about in more detail later) are given to us automatically every certain level. Another specificity of GT concerns the particular characteristics of our modified DNA He takes to the field If up to now you have probably got a good idea of Gene Troopers, unfortunately things will change drastically by touching the more strictly playful aspect of the gameplay. The problem is very simple: programmers have forgotten about artificial intelligence!!! This is not an exaggeration, but a total lack on the part of the enemies and even our occasional partners during the missions of any form of reasonable behavior other than standing still and shooting. That's all, and it's not who knows what hyperbole: in all game situations the elements moved by the AI will do nothing but stand still or at best come towards us. The writer has no prejudice against immediate FPS such as Painkiller or Serious Sam but here we are faced with completely ridiculous situations with most of the enemies nailed to a piece of land, without any reaction: definitely regrettable! Equally unconvincing are some situations in which the game, for narrative reasons, performs real ~miracles~. To explain: inside a structure you take an elevator that takes you downstairs. If the game script provides that our adventure companions must also be in that elevator, the latter materialize out of nowhere! There will also be miraculous resurrections of our friends after being hit bybombs, laser rifles, snipers and anything else always for script reasons Fortunately something in the gameplay of Gene Troopers is saved. In fact, the paraphernalia at our disposal turns out to be simply splendid, made up of many ~clones~ of the toys already seen in Unreal Tournament, to which have been added an anti-gravity power (toh!) connected to special gloves and a molecular disintegrator of incredible impact, capable of unceremoniously eliminating enemies of any size. The idea of also proposing additional accessory gadgets with the right mouse button is superb: the grenade launcher, for example, has the construction of a temporary barrier as a secondary element which in many points proves to be really useful and essential. Even cooler is the possibility of turning the double circular machine gun at our disposal without firing it. All small cameos undoubtedly, but overall they give a real ecstasy and a feeling of power that is difficult to find in other FPS. We are faced with completely ridiculous situations with most of the enemies nailed to a piece of land, without any reaction Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde The ~beautiful-ugly~ dichotomy in Gene Troopers continues in the analysis of the graphic elements. The aesthetic choices of GT in terms of background and light effects are simply wonderful: without having a very powerful graphics engine at their disposal, the designers have nevertheless managed to embellish the title with an impressive dose of bright and psychedelic colors that make the title truly ~full  and aesthetically alive. One cannot fail to mention the level of the jungle full of ups and downs, of lianas everywhere which gives our sight that all-encompassing sensation capable of completely estranging us from our ~real~ context. The interiors are also very good (the aerospace port for example, is of an impressive majesty despite the number of polygons and the detail of the textures is not among the highest) and above all the visual effects of fire (the opponents' flamethrower is very hot), water, weather... After having praised the production of Playlogic, we have to shoot zero on other graphic elements starting with the horrendous animations, in particular for the visualization of the deaths of the opponents which absolutely make you laugh (or cry depending on the perspective... ). Equally insufficient is the use of Havok: probably Gene Troopers is one of the worst applications of the well-known engine. If we think about what we see in Half--Life 2 it is hard to believe that it is the same physics engine that has been used in the two games. Genetically Modified Music Gene Troopers' schizophrenia does not spare even the sound even if in this case the plus signs are in the majority. The musical component is undoubtedly to be commended, worthy of a cinematic blockbuster (or video game like Halo, so to speak) and also the interpretation of the dialogues (in English but with Italian subtitles) are of undoubted value. Unfortunately, to spoil this idyllic picture there are some rather mediocre sound effects and above all the screams emitted both by our digital alter ego and by the killed aliens more similar to the moans of a hard core film than a science fiction film Gene Troopers' schizophrenia does not spare even the sound even if in this case the plus signs are in the majority Genetically Modified Music Finally, it is useless to underline how all the flaws that we have presented to you are not immune from the multiplayer component which includes the three most classic modes: deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag. Cross-platform Gene Troopers, in addition to genetically modifying us on PC, also mutates our DNA on Xbox. The differences are the usual ones between the two formats: lower general detail both for the lower video memory available and for the resolution of the TV, lowered frame rate (but in any case the title remains decidedly fluid) and passage of the command system from the mouse combo + keyboard to pad. Final comment Gene Troopers is probably the most schizophrenic game in the history of videogame productions. The title created by Cauldron's programmers makes qualitative ups and downs that are difficult to find in any other software created for entertainment purposes. One is taken aback when the title starts with an excellent incipit, continues with a good narrative framework, an atmosphere of a good ~sci-fi~ film and then sinks in the face of the total absence of a minimal artificial intelligence that at least allows opponents and our AI-powered partners to have at least minimal rational behavior. And the same can be said for the technical aspect with splendid scenesdesign lines sadly accompanied by bad animations. There are too many flaws in Gene Troopers to give it a completely sufficient grade. On the other hand, however, in the title it is perceived that some elements of the programming team have the stuff and talent to sell and that by changing some pieces of the team, a possible sequel to GT could really be a ~headline~. We sincerely hope so Pros Beautiful Sci-Fi atmosphere The presence of crossroads is passionate Soundtrack from Kolossal Cons Artificial intelligence not received One of the worst games using Havok Many bugs of various kinds ATTENTION TO THE CD-KEY If you don't want to waste more than two hours of your time figuring out why Gene Troopers doesn't start as happened to whoever is writing to you, before inserting the cd-key to start the game, know that there are many incorrect codes in game packs. To replace it, just go to the official site of the game www.genetroopers.com, enter the code you found in the package and the site will automatically provide you with a correct code. In case you have already entered the wrong code, you will have to trace the Gene Troopers folder in the Windows registry file and delete the wrong cd-key otherwise the protection system will not allow you to enter a new code. This last problem is not even reported by the official website of the game or by that of the Italian distributor of the title (Atari)", "date": "2005-12-16", "grade": null}
