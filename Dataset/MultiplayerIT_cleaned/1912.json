{"name": "Resident Evil 0", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-1.html", "text": "Raccoon City, the day before... Set twenty-four hours before the events narrated in the first Resident Evil, Zero is a tasty prequel in which, for the first time, the origin of the T virus and the reasons why Raccoon City was invaded by zombies and other biologically mutated ready to kill anything that moves. The player is called upon to assume the role of Rebecca Chambers, the youngest recruit of STARS, who will soon be joined in her mission by Billy Coen, a former mercenary with a dark past, on the run after being sentenced to death for killing twenty-three of his comrades under mysterious circumstances. Raccoon City, the day before... And the major innovation introduced by Capcom in this new Resident Evil lies precisely in the presence of two main characters. To tell the truth, already in the previous chapters of the series the player has been called to guide different digital alter egos, but in Zero, for the first time, you have total freedom of management of the characters with the possibility of switching in real time from Rebecca to Billy with the push of a button and even to proceed in pairs in the adventure, with the second character guided by the computer to join us in the clashes with zombies and the like and to watch our backs. Still on the innovation front, there is also the disappearance of the odious trunks to contain objects, a pedantic trademark of the series, which forced the player to retrace his steps over and over again. Items can now be conveniently left in any room you are in, with the only limitation being that each room can only hold a limited number of items. However, this new system does not bring actual benefits to the gameplay: you soon choose a base room where you can store all the useful objects and you continue to go back and forth with the characters, exactly like in the other chapters of the series. Excluding these two changes, which add something to the gameplay without however being able to revolutionize it, the game system has remained unchanged in all respects and the years inevitably begin to feel. The paleolithic control system sometimes makes even the most basic maneuvers difficult, the puzzles are very absurd and out of place and the whole game is a tedious monument to the most sinister backtracking. Even with all its flaws, however, even this new Resident Evil is still fun, still enjoyable. There's no shortage of good moments, there's no shortage of jumping on the chair, breathtaking fights, there's no shortage of an intriguing story although still firmly linked to the tradition of b-movies. Resident Evil Zero is the furthest thing from an innovative title, but it's really perfect in proposing, updated to the needs of 2002, all the ingredients that have made the Capcom survival horror saga great over the years. It is the swan song of the genre, really impossible to do better, pending the release of a Resident Evil 4 which hopefully, yes, revolutionary. Raccoon City, the day before... The graphic engine, as in Rebirth, knows how to assert itself and show off its powerful muscles. The quality of the rendering on screen has increased and the final result is, if possible, even more photorealistic. The two-dimensional backdrops were already practically perfect in the Resident Evil remake, but Capcom has surpassed itself by paying more attention to even the smallest details and adding animations practically everywhere. And there is no shortage of fully animated backdrops: the train carriages with all the objects that move as the wagons sway are the most striking example, but continuing in the game there are other equally explanatory and spectacular examples. Difficult, if not impossible, to expect more from a 2d/3d hybrid engine. The sound sector is equally well-finished and impactful, with excellent effects, good dubbing and adequate music. From a technical point of view everything is perfect then? Not really, given that the flaws of the Rebirth are repeated, verbatim, also in this Zero. The collisions continue to be rather imprecise and the annoying interpenetrations between polygons and between characters and backdrops remain, while the animations are in some cases excellent, in others very bad (terrible those of the characters when they turn on themselves ...). Venial peccadilloes, which absolutely do not undermine the visual impact of the game, but which are even more annoying in light of the perfection and high standard of Capcom production. Furthermore, Capcom's choice not to support positional audio in DPLII is always inexplicable, a choice that would certainly have contributed to increasing the immersiveness of the game.Conclusion Years pass, Resident Evil remains. There are zombies, there are pre-rendered backdrops, there is a good background story, there are twists and turns and shivers down your spine. Capcom has done his homework well and offers us the new Resident Evil in a nice brightly colored gift box, wrapped and decorated with the best 2D/3D hybrid graphics engine ever seen. Once the package has been greedily discarded and the colored bow has been removed, unfortunately, what remains begins to smell, inexorably, old and stale. The welcome additions and novelties cannot by themselves reinvigorate a gameplay that has been outdated and weighed down by the years. Gameplay that, taking due account of its limitations, still continues to entertain, just as the game continues to offer a very high level 'production value'. Ultimately Resident Evil 0 is a must buy for avid fans of the saga and highly recommended for those who do not disdain its classic setting. But those who have become bored with the hackneyed mechanics of the rev series stay away, at least until the release of that Biohazard 4 which promises, this time for real, to bring real innovations. PROS Production of the highest level Devastating visual impact, albeit with two-dimensional backdrops Some novelties in the gameplay It is Resident Evil CONS It is (always) Resident Evil Dated and inadequate control system Collisions and animations that could be greatly improved The lack of exploitation of the DPLII is inexplicable A lot of water has passed under the bridge and since 1996, the year of release of the very first Resident Evil on PlayStation, many things have changed. Yet Resident Evil is always there: immutable, immortal like the zombies that populate its rooms, its corridors shrouded in darkness since its first appearance. And, after a welcome graphically pumped remake, here comes the first unpublished episode of the series for GameCube, born on Nintendo 64 but soon diverted to the 128bit big brother. And what has changed this time? As we have already said, for better or for worse, nothing, absolutely nothing Resident Evil 0 is a must buy for die-hard fans of the saga", "date": "2002-11-26", "grade": null}
