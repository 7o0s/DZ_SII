It is useless to make a beautiful arcade platformer based on very precise jumps if you then have to play it as if you were wearing oven mitts. Luckily it seems that things are about to change, at least this is the impression one gets when playing Sword of Xolan, a delicious action title for iOS (and also coming to Android and Windows Phone) with a slyly retro graphic design. of an excellent level design and a decidedly affordable price. Sword of Xolan is a great platformer for smartphones, which is at least worth a look An essential story Just like most of its predecessors from the golden age of the arcades, Sword of Xolan is based on a story that offers the minimum necessary background to place a sword in hand and launch us on a glorious adventure. There's an evil sorcerer who has imprisoned everyone and unleashed hell on Earth, even defeating a nerd version of Gandalf. We are Xolan and obviously we are here to fight and save everyone, we don't have to know anything else. The game is based on the usual mechanisms of the genre, there are self-propelled platforms, sharp points to avoid, monsters that shoot at you, monsters that come at you, monsters that move up and down, chests to open, hearts to collect to heal and ampoules of mana with which to recharge our magical strength. In fact, our alter ego is not only equipped with the sword that gives the title to the game, but also with a simple yet effective magical ability that allows him to throw fireballs that have a damage equivalent to a sword blow. The idea is not bad, too bad using the magic the game becomes much easier. It is true that you only have three fireballs available for each mana potion, but the game distributes so many that you will hardly run out of fire and therefore you can always count on a very simple solution to eliminate monsters from a safe distance. Not always such a challenge Sure, as the levels progress the spell becomes less effective against certain creatures, but it's still a great way out for more complex situations, which is a shame. This brings us to Sword of Xolan's only real flaw: the level of challenge. Apart from some tougher monsters, the difficulty of the game remains more or less constant throughout the game. Perhaps it would have been better to implement progressive growth, so as to make the final levels real challenges to the limits of possible. But be careful: this does not mean that we are dealing with a simple game, but that perhaps a game in which the player knows that the next level will require more effort than the one just finished was better. However, there is an interesting progression that could make you play and replay this title even when you get to the end. Every 1500 coins reached you can unlock a card that will change the game conditions in some way. Maybe you will get more gold in the chests, maybe it will increase the damage, who knows, for sure you will find yourself playing and replaying the old levels to get the few coins that separate you from the next card. From the point of view of the mechanics it would not have disfigured even a system of different weapons and armor, so as to make the progression of the player even more interesting and evident. But as we have seen, given that the difficulty of the game remains a constant, probably making the character too much stronger than the enemies would have unbalanced the game too much on the player's side, as well as requiring an additional effort from a balancing point of view. Total control What fortunately does not require any commitment are the controls. As we wrote at the beginning, Sword of Xolan enjoys what are probably the most responsive and precise controls for a mobile game. Every jump, even double, is precise, every sword stroke punctual, as well as the swipes needed to get off some platforms. We have tried many mobile platformers, but until now we have rarely been faced with such precision in the response and given that each level is full of secret areas that can only be reached by moving with intuition and precision, this is undoubtedly a 'great thing. As if that weren't enough, the five keys can be positioned at will on the screen, so as to satisfy every type of player. Another great value of the game is undoubtedly the graphic sector, as you too can admire from the images in the article. Each screen is a true pixel art masterpiece, an explosion of colors that will sweep you awayweight to the golden days when the only commitment of your day was to pass a very difficult level trying not to get caught by your mother and her desire to make you study. The same goes for the soundtrack whose fantasy theme is the perfect accompaniment for the great deeds ahead. As for longevity, Sword of Xolan offers 30 levels, 3 bosses and 9 time attack-style challenges, within each level there are also three people to free and who will further increase the loot that can be spent on power-ups. The whole thing costs 0.99, which we think is a decidedly acceptable price for one of the best mobile action titles currently available.", "date": "2015-05-29", "grade": "8.5"}
