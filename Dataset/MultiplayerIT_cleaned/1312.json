{"name": "Singles: Flirt Up Your Life!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/singles-flirt-up-your-life-2.html", "text": "Aaaction! The game action always revolves around the same hinge. The scenario, that of a more or less luxurious apartment located in the middle of a typically European-looking city, will be the scene of all our actions, nor will it therefore be possible to abandon it for a single moment during game actions. The three different game modes allow us to choose whether to completely furnish the apartment following our taste for art deco and design, starting with a large budget, or settle down in a comfortable apartment or a more elegant villa, to immediately start the charge without too many hitches. The phase dedicated to furnishing the future love nest offers a quick check of the technical potential of the game. From a graphic point of view, Singles deserves to be reported right away for the accuracy in the details and the fluidity of the engine, despite some transparency effects and reflective surfaces that create too marked and often not very credible plays of light. Once the house is furnished, the heart of the game awaits us. The future couple's adventure begins from the moment you decide to press the ~play~ button on the control console. From this moment the interaction between the two characters starts and the player's task will be to allow the two to get to know each other better and establish a solid and ~supportive~ relationship. Just like two new roommates, in fact, the two characters will not give each other much confidence and the interaction actions will be limited to a few completely formal approaches. By selecting one of the two protagonists with the right key, it will be possible to act on the objects in the house and on the second tenant. A rose menu will appear whenever it is possible to establish a relationship between the character and the selected object. Gradually, first making friends through simple chatter or little jokes, it will be possible to bring the two virtual alter egos closer together until they make a friendship fatally destined to turn into something more complicated and intense. [C] Flames under the sheets Cheeese! [/C] AI, mimicry and couple laughter The artificial intelligence introduced in the game is of a rather refined level and allows for the occurrence of really interesting situations. Combined with an incredible expressive capacity of the faces of the characters (always visible in the foreground through a mirror in a corner of the screen) this aspect amazes more than the same graphic apparatus which, while remaining of a good level, remains at the levels seen with the beta analyzed on the occasion of the preview. The mimicry of the characters, and the consequent ~non-verbal~ language offer a rapid verification of the state of things, making us clearly understand when it is appropriate to change strategy. Each character, in fact, has a personalized character that prevents the use of ~standard~ approaches but pushes the player to throw himself into ever new boarding techniques. Every action taken will trigger consequences in the sentimental plot. Showing yourself naked in front of your partner when you are not yet intimate enough can certainly have not entirely positive effects on the couple's relationship. The same is true of mismatched furniture that can be misunderstood by the characters. In fact, there will hardly be a couple of people who are not yet intimate who decide to spend the night in the same bed, so the choice of a double bed must not be too premature nor must it speed things up: the vision of a double bed will not be enough squares to convince the characters to live an unforgettable night. A section of the control console allows the vision of the different parameters and scores that regulate the life and attitudes of the characters. Characteristics and needs of the individual are constantly recorded, as well as the sentimental status and the various aspects of the relationship with the other party. By improving in these aspects, it will then be possible to move on to spicier and more engaging phases until it leads to the most heated expressions of the couple's relationship. The grave of passion? There are no limits to the couple relationship in Singles. The modality called ~pink~ allows the formation of same-sex couples, like heterosexual ones. And if there are no limits to the action, there are also no filters for the ~squalor of a couple~. The game offers the most hilarious scenes in the most unexpected moments, such as when, after hours spent convincing your partner that there is nothing wrong with kissing completely naked on the sofa, you find yourself with the girl standing staring into space and the boy intent on watching TV in all his Adamic nakedness. The passion of the rest often gives way to boredom and the frenzy of the rhythm of everyday life that requiresprotagonists of carving out time for themselves too, for household chores and above all for working hours, the only source of livelihood for the couple. In fact, for the sake of completeness it must be said that the protagonists will have the obligation to leave the apartment for several hours a day in order to be able to go to work and be able to earn enough money for everyday life. [C] What a thoughtful face! Oops! [/C] In conclusion The time has come to sum up. In recent months we have had the opportunity to analyze this product in detail, which has not been slow to make people talk about it. After all, the coup by Deep Silver, the developer of the game, could not fail to hit the mark. The themes dealt with by this game are already in themselves a good prerequisite for creating an effect of safe indirect advertising based on word of mouth. The product itself, however, does not present itself as something excellent. It remains rather normal and hardly offers any ideas to hope for a significant longevity. Having reached the goal and having exhausted the initial euphoria for the game ~where they do it~ one falls into monotony and ends up badly enduring the defects and limits that this title presents in any case. All in all, we don't feel in a position to advise against a title that without any shadow of a doubt entertained us and made us smile on more than one occasion. Let's say that, while waiting for The Sims 2, Singles looks like a decent aperitif, just to warm up and prepare your wrist and index finger to go wild on very different battlefields. A more comprehensive article on one of the games that has caused a stir in recent times could not be missing in any way. Since the release of the preview and the first leaked news Singles has not failed to intrigue audiences of all ages. After all, a video game with a strictly relational / erotic background is not seen very often. For those who are not aware of what Singles is, it will be enough to know that it is a life simulator (very close to The Sims in terms of concept and gameplay) whose sole purpose is to make the two protagonists fall in love and build a relationship in the background. sentimental, and why not, even sexual.
