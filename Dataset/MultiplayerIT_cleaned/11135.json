{"name": "Brothers in Arms: Double Time - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brothers-in-arms-double-time-recensione.html", "text": "The brothers in arms also land on Nintendo Wii, thanks to the producer Ubisoft and the developers GearBox, already authors of the versions for PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC. The box set is called Double Time because it includes two games in one, collecting the first chapter Road to Hill 30, set in the Normandy landings, and the famous sequel Earned in Blood which takes place in the heart of France in the Second World War. Both have been adapted in the gameplay to meet the particularities of the new hardware, using the remote control and the nunchuck for a gameplay unprecedented in the series. From a visual point of view, the game has remained almost unchanged from the PlayStation 2 version, and nowadays shows a fairly dated technical sector. Sergeant Baker's tales are revived through Brothers in Arms Brothers in Arms: Double Time is a package consisting of two distinct adventures that intertwine their plot with a plot seen from the perspective of two different protagonists of the same battle: sergeants Matt Backer and Joe Hartsock. Through their eyes we relive the intense and dramatic moments of the Second World War, in the clashes that took place in Normandy, parachuted behind enemy lines and without reinforcements. The GearBox developers made use of the collaboration of Sergeant Baker, the authentic war veteran, to reconstruct from his memories those fateful eight hellish days that changed the course of history. Road to Hill 30, the first disc in the collection, tells his story and how the 3rd Airborne Platoon, the 101st Division nicknamed the ~Screaming Eagles~, was led through the French countryside. In the game we lead a team divided into two patrols, manageable entirely through the use of the Nintendo Wii remote control. In previous versions of the game the commands were given by pressing the four different directions of the digital cross, in this case the input has been replaced by the movement of the remote control in the air, which simulates the authentic gestures with which the team leaders give orders to the soldiers. The GearBox developers made use of the collaboration of Sergeant Baker, the authentic war veteran, to reconstruct from his memories those fateful eight hellish days that changed the course of history Sergeant Baker's tales are revived through Brothers in Arms You can decide to attack, targeting the desired area and moving forward; or you can decide to move around, or even to stay in a defensive position. At any time it is possible to call up a sort of bird's eye view, an aerial camera that allows us to study the area of the battle and choose where to direct our platoon. Usually the two teams have different armaments: melee combat, grenadiers, snipers. The strategic component is a fundamental part of these chapters of Brothers in Arms, while maintaining a fast and frenetic gameplay that in shooter sessions are very reminiscent of Medal of Honor. With the famous Electronic Arts franchise it also shares an extreme linearity of level design, which combined with the strategic components, however, does not have a very positive effect. The game is spectacularized to the max and choreographed very well, but the tactical components are too repetitive in the long run precisely by virtue of the fact that it is impossible to choose alternative routes, surround the enemies in different ways or scatter with greater freedom. In a cinematographic game with simplified playability, all of this is admitted, but if a title makes claims from a tactical point of view, the system works much less, as all that range of possibilities that leaves the player free to implement a his own strategy. Some levels, however, can be tackled in different ways from the usual frontal clash, and the monotony is broken by some variations on the theme such as the possibility of commanding tanks, defending positions or assaulting farmhouses. The cursed virtual perimeter for shifting the view After Sergeant Baker and his platoon's horrific eight days, airborne behind enemy lines in Normandy and forced to live in hell before they can count on reinforcements and be safe, the second part of the story takes place through the eyes of Sergeant Hartsock, whom we had previously met in Road to Hill 30. Earned in Blood, as the second story of Brothers in Arms is called, is a continuous intertwining with the first, and from one to the other we continually pass from being protagonists of the story to battle companions, looking at each other with the eyes of one and then the other. The references and cross-overs are continuous, and so is poIt is possible to experience that dramatic war from two points of view. The landscape of Normandy has been reconstructed thanks to aerial photos and videos, and the guys from Gearbox have personally gone to the real places where the adventure takes place to try to recreate in the best possible way the feeling with the air, the ground, the houses and the atmosphere of those places. The game producer stated that by carefully studying these two chapters of Brothers in Arms it would ideally be possible to go to Normandy to be a tourist guide, so faithful is the reproduction of those places. It is obviously not possible for us to verify for ourselves, but the sensations of being truly at war have actually been well studied, thanks to many technical artifices, a well-narrated script and superb choreography, shown in cut-scenes made with the game's graphics engine and well dubbed in Italian. Earned in Blood, as the second story of Brothers in Arms is called, is a continuous interweaving with the first The cursed virtual perimeter for shifting the view Earned in Blood begins with Red's (as Colonel Hartsock was nicknamed) tales of his Normandy landings, and will continue with the liberation of the city of Canteran until the final assault on St.Sauver. The control system works for both chapters in the same way. With the analog you move in four directions, while you point the screen with the remote control and rotate the view as you like, just as if we had shouldered a real rifle. The limits of this control system are once again felt, given that the movement of the viewfinder is not exactly fast and precise: to turn left and right, for example, you must first hook the virtual (and invisible) perimeter of the aim, within which only the cursor moves, after which the shot must be moved. The time that elapses in the movement of the viewfinder from the center to the perimeter actually represents the lag, the delay, that our aim has on the opponents. The problem is present in all shooters that share this same aiming system, but in some (such as Metroid Prime 3, for example) it has been overcome by reducing that invisible perimeter to the maximum, thus speeding up the movement of the view. Brothers in Arms is instead too slow and tiring to maneuver, reducing the feeling of satisfaction during the fights and the naturalness of the shot. Tactical ambitions As we said, many commands can be given to soldiers. The order of movement is given by pressing the A key and moving the blue circle that appears on the battlefield to the place where we want our troops to go, while to recall them it is necessary to describe large horizontal circles in the air with the nunchuck. To fire, just move that blue circle until it turns red (the color that indicates enemy engagement), then release the A button and wait for the soldiers to attack. If instead of the A key we use the B, instead of firing from a distance ours will throw themselves forward looking for a direct and close encounter. Choosing which option to use from time to time essentially represents the Brothers in Arms strategy, since, as we have seen previously, freedom of movement is decidedly castrated by a linear level design, full of invisible walls or unreliable borders as a thread barbed wire, bushes or stones. Even the artificial intelligence is not particularly refined, and it will not be uncommon to notice how enemy soldiers throw themselves into the attack regardless of our shots, or reload their weapons in poorly covered positions. In the same way, our infantry is not very rational, since it will often remain to fire in front of enemy hordes in clear numerical superiority, without running for cover or cover. freedom of movement is decidedly castrated by a linear level design, full of invisible walls or not very credible borders Tactical ambitions The bird's eye view, then, is almost always useless as the on-screen indicators are already sufficient in themselves to make us visualize the enemies, and thus loses all its tactical-organizational ambitions, while remaining in fact a good idea. The visual sector does not differ from what has already been seen on consoles such as PlayStation 2 and GameCube, demonstrating a certain backwardness of the Wii hardware. Some effects, such as rain on camera, animated vegetation and explosions, are done very well. Other aspects of the game, such as the polygonal count, the fluidity (poor) and the definition of the textures, are instead to be censored. The audio is perhaps the most successful technical component, with masterfully orchestrated background music that knows how to underline the most dramatic moments of thethe clashes, many different phrases as regards speech, and a well-exploited three-dimensionality of sound, with voices and noises that vary in intensity based on distance and position. Finally, longevity is guaranteed by four difficulty levels and by the very nature of this Wii edition, which includes two games that tell the same adventure from two different points of view. Comment Brothers in Arms: Double Time is a pack that includes two games, both set in World War II and in the same battles. The story is well told and the reality of the facts exudes drama from the memories of the real protagonists of these events. The adventure is choreographic and the audio sector excites the listener. The real problem, however, is the control system, too artificial compared to the more reactive traditional pad. Furthermore, the decidedly flat level design extinguishes any possibility of taking different paths and decisions, essentially eliminating any tactics. Graphically the game is dated, and even if it shows some valuable effects, nowadays it absolutely doesn't keep up with modern productions for the Nintendo Wii itself. Pros Masterfully narrated story and plot Well orchestrated choreography and audio Cons Too slow and cumbersome controls AI not up to par Level design too linear for a game that has tactical ambitions", "date": "2008-10-14", "grade": null}
