{"name": "Asgard's Wrath", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/asgards-wrath-recensione.html", "text": "And in the end they did it: Oculus has finally mastered the software quality that until now was the prerogative of the less advanced viewer, the Sony one. We saw the first attempt to overtake it a few months ago with Defector, an equal level of Blood & Truth, but with Asgard's Wrath, whose review you read, the leap forward is now clear. Oculus has finally transformed itself into a mature platform, first by intelligently renewing the hardware offer, and now by realizing its ability to invest in quality software. With Half-Life: Alyx even Valve is waking up from a long slumber. They took a lot of it, but finally everyone understood it: however fascinating, whimsical, revolutionary, only small productions don't go ahead, and that now we need games, but those with the money behind them. And Asgard's Wrath is, so much so that probably together with Astro Bot for PSVR it is perhaps the best virtual reality game in existence today. Not only because it's a nice game to play, fun, epic, long-lived, but because it's clean, clear, rich, like a Triple A game. There's no room here for those unreadable interfaces, for those somewhat rudimentary animations , for that slightly cheap aspect which in many cases is fine, but which apparently is not enough to keep an entire technology on its feet. Simply... divine In Asgard's Wrath, the player is a new deity, The God of Animals according to what Loki will tell us in a warm inn full of weird figures in which we will return several times along the adventure. And as gods, we have our powers and duties, including helping people who need it most. A pretext that will give us the opportunity to enter the body of different characters and experience their sumptuous adventures, for a total of twenty very dense hours of gameplay that can easily double if you get involved in the side dish made up of challenges and collectibles. We are faced with a typical action role-playing game, with a simple yet surprisingly effective progression system. The levels are composed linearly but unravel along several larger areas, designed to slow down the action through more reasoned phases, effective gameplay diversions. Here, usually, we will be able to leave the character's body to return to being immense divinities, able to move the objects of the scenario such as bridges, braziers, etc. as if they were toy constructions. When we are in our original form, while maintaining its graphical appearance, the game world will seem to have transformed into a beautiful scale model, but full of life, in motion. We underline the effect because by now we are somewhat accustomed to the virtual first person view, while we tend to underestimate the impact of certain other views which, on the other hand, are just as surprising. Virtual first person In first person you pull levers, you talk to the different characters, you inspect, and of course you fight. And Asgard's Wrath's combat is top-notch, even managing to convey decent feedback when bladed weapons inevitably collide in the game world and not in reality. The parry, which can be carried out both with the same weapon and with the different shields, thus becomes an essential element for getting the opponent into trouble. Through the commands it is also possible to make directional shots to quickly get out of trouble. Different characters will also be able to harness the power of a surprising amount of thrown weapons, including bows, crossbows, wrist dart shooters and more, plus each weapon has its own special projectiles. And let's not forget the most important thing: are we the God of Animals or not? By entering our original form, we will also be able to transform some beasts into humanoid companions with different characteristics and abilities, ready to help us in combat and in solving some environmental puzzles. In Asgard's Wrath there is also room for a more than decent crafting system. Technically this new adventure exclusively for Oculus is detailed, colorful, and with an excellent character design. The artists of this American software house called Sanzaru have really done a great job in recreating environments and above all atmospheres. To the point that we often wanted to return to the worlds of Asgard's Wrath even after completing each mission, just to continue exploring immersed in this virtual wonder. In fact, if the screenplay stands up well without ever proposing more complex nuances, the extraordinary sets perform a fundamental job to allow the user to completely abandon himself.", "date": "2019-12-08", "grade": "8.9"}
