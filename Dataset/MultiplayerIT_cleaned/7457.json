{"name": "Democracy 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125855-democracy-3-vi-daro-la-luna.html", "text": "In recent times, the word populism has made a comeback given the clamor of parties that rely more on sensational declarations than on political programs to survive. But as with the bright colors of advertisements, the high-sounding election promise is an integral part of that pervasive system of governance we call democracy. On the other hand, it is a form of organization of a quantitative type and although there are numerous rules aimed at making the representation of the people structured and functional, the only absolute law is consensus. A law that is the very pivot of Democracy 3, a very particular political management game and rather far from the most widespread videogame forms but which has the advantage of highlighting and translating the paradoxes of modern Western politics into game mechanics. Democracy 3 is a particular title that highlights the paradoxes of consensual democracy The hard job of the politician Democracy 3 is the third installment in a series developed by Cliff Harris, a single man who has managed to create a complex product, capable of attracting a moderate following, using a decidedly particular setting. The entire experience is in fact linked to graphs and information sheets, the only visual tools with which the player, who plays the role of prime minister of one of the world's great democracies, can evaluate which decisions to take to keep the government standing, increase the percentage of consensus and increases the Gross Domestic Product of one's own country. But despite the spartan graphics, closer to that of an analysis tool than to that of a video game, the mechanics of Democracy 3 are decidedly complex. Selecting one of the nodes that make up the main title screen, organized in a ~radar chart~, highlights the many interrelationships and interdependencies that characterize each element. They range from education to taxes, obviously passing through transport, weapons, energy, religion, health, space, ethnic minorities, the various types of industry, technological evolution, the environment and the various wealth segments of the population. Justice is obviously one of the most important factors and the safety of the citizen is one of those elements on which to leverage when you are short of consensus. But if you intend to be remembered as a winner, and not as a populist who has tried to go the extra mile, you need to take into account the practicality of your choices by carefully evaluating percentages and side effects. The populist promise trick Democracy 3 can also be enjoyed by pursuing consensus exclusively, which unfortunately seems to be in the ropes of even more than a flesh-and-blood politician. But it is clear that in this case the element of challenge is lost, the only true videogame factor of the entire production. And it is here that we come across the biggest flaw of this title or the inability to add salient innovations and some extras capable of making everything light and engaging. Democracy 3 is a title created with a cleaner and more refined care for the interface than that of the second chapter of the series: the information sheets are extremely legible and the symbols are designed to make the wall of icons that pivot the experience less aggressive . Thus, viewing the data relating to a sector or making a choice is a matter of a few clicks. However, despite the enviable ability to mix a complex soul with an agile and intuitive experience, there is a lack of a pinch of spice that could be the simulation of crisis situations, a narrative component, electoral campaigns or greater depth internal relations in the country. Political crises, unexpected events and emergency measures are present in the game and also relations with ministers are important since they influence consensus and accumulate points that determine the number and weight of choices we can make in a turn. But it is clear that this part of the game would benefit from some additions while on the geopolitical front the number of factors taken into consideration is sufficient and would be enhanced in a more structured context. Luckily in this last chapter the influence of international politics is felt and limits the omnipotence of a Prime Minister who is too decisive on the dynamics of his own country and, moreover, the Steam Workshop support should guarantee the community the possibility to fix and enrich the title, but as far as its mechanics are concerned, one certainly cannot speak of evolution. In any case, Democracy 3 is a unique game that manages to offer an almost simulative management, albeit based on data that is far too precise andforeseeable, of a democratic type of government and this while adopting an all in all light and usable approach.", "date": "2013-11-25", "grade": "7.0"}
