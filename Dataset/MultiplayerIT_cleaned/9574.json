{"name": "In forma con Kinect", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83012-your-shape-fitness-evolved-in-forma-con-kinect.html", "text": "The game requires Kinect for Xbox 360 Your Shape: Fitness Evolved is Kinect's debut in the world of home fitness products, therefore without the need to be limited in use by platforms or controllers to be gripped to make the console keep track of the movements made by the user. The concept is that, and it is extremely innovative, of taking home a private instructor able to see with his own eyes, which in this case are the small cameras mounted on the Xbox 360 peripheral, the correctness of the movements and positions assumed by those who ~ plays~. In fact, thanks to the total body scan, the virtual trainer or trainer is able to give continuous and simple warnings asking those who are training to go in time, to push harder during lunges or to maintain a better posture. We have to come to terms with the fact that it is still a product that arrives at the launch of such an innovative peripheral and still, necessarily, a little immature, but here is everything you need to tone up, burn calories or boost yourself , staying comfortably at home (sweating a lot, that's for sure). The trainer's eyes One of the things made with the most care in the whole Your Shape: Fitness Evolved package is the interface with which you move within the different exercises and the new age gym air that welcomes the phases of the workouts with different settings . You choose the gender of the trainer, the type of goal to achieve, you indicate your age, the frequency with which you train and, at that point, you have access to a series of games, fitness exercises and some other halfway between Thai Chi and Yoga, each of which is introduced by a short tutorial. The part dedicated to the personal trainer includes a series of progressive workouts, each with a specific purpose, from toning, to cardio, up to strengthening, if you combine exercise with the use of weights; Fitness includes Yoga exercises and excellent Fit Boxing routines; gym games include, among others, the hoola hop which is, due to the lack of floor exercises, one of the more specific exercises for toning the abs. The novelty is obviously that, thanks to the cameras, the software is able to perceive the fact that one moves in time and that the posture in the different phases is correct, with the lenses also able to understand if the torso is inclined or straight , thanks to depth detection. After an initial mutual study approach, it seems that Kinect has to take our measurements and in fact it does, we find ourselves moving in total freedom and we realize that the training cycles are well studied with muscles that feel the next day and with large rivulets of sweat soaking shirts and shorts. The silhouette of the player is rendered with a series of effects that see rose petals floating from legs and arms during exercises and can be represented with abstract luminescence or in a realistic way reproducing the clothing of those who train. The precision is excellent in most cases, sometimes it seems to be unable to go in time for posture errors to be signaled to us, when one is sure of exactly replicating the movements of the trainer, but, avoiding trying at all costs to create series 100% accurate (precision leads to determining the number of calories burned for each exercise), everything will begin to flow with extreme fluidity and good performance. Xbox 360 goals The 1000 points of Your Shape: Fitness Evolved are all obtained simply by using the game, also because they are mostly linked to the amount of calories burned. There are also those that are obtained with games and the fit box or the hoola hop, but it's only a matter of time to collect the full loot Space matters There are a couple of things to take into account, first of all the failure to include exercises on the ground, which if they are not essential for burning or toning legs, buttocks and arms, are essential for the pectorals and for strengthening exercises in general , and above all, the need for space. If you are taller than 1.85 m, the two meters that are usually necessary to be able to use Kinect, here they ~stretch~, since when you find yourself spreading your legs, you leave that virtual square that indicates the field of vision of the cameras and in which it is necessary to re-enter to be correctly detected. As mentioned, the air you breathe is exactly what you would expect from a Kinect experience with a futuristic interface which, even if a little slow, forces you to movements that already act as a warm-up and preparatory phase, also thanks to the tutorials that pop up from time to time. The greater the time dedicated to the series, the more exercises are unlockedor and at multiple levels of intensity. Moving through the menus with your arms and selecting options by stepping on virtual buttons probably brings to life the closest thing to the commercials of the peripheral that have been announcing its release for months. The margins for improvement are vast, but between what is there and the possibility of comparing one's results online with those of friends and the updates that are already being released on the Market Place, Your Shape: Fitness Evolved represents an excellent start for a whole genre to be discovered with these assumptions and a real substitute for training in the gym, especially for aerobic and cardio exercises.", "date": "2010-12-13", "grade": null}
