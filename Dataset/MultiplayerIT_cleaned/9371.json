The last episode in chronological order, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12: The Masters, arrives on iOS platforms in a double version (for iPhone/iPod Touch and for iPad) but simply with the title of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 not boasting, unlike of the console versions, the inclusion of the Masters tournament. Not bad, however: the differences compared to the game released in 2009 catch the eye from the first moments, thanks to completely new graphics and new modes. From the start screen, we can choose whether to play a quick game, try our hand at the full-bodied PGA Tour, face the Tiger Challenge test or play a multiplayer game, even if unfortunately only locally. The quick game is the only mode that allows us to take on the role of famous players, such as Tiger Woods, Paula Creamer, Anthony Kim, Paul Casey and others, for a total of eight characters. The PGA Tour, in fact, requires the creation of a golfer from scratch through a simple editor, and then follow his career from the beginning to the consecration, through a huge number of competitions and tournaments, really able to keep us busy for several hours. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 also has an integration system with Facebook to set up quick ~bowl~ style challenges, that is, with each player who must try to get the ball as close as possible to a pre-established point on the field. Finally, the Tiger Challenge is a substantial collection of skill challenges that can be unlocked through the victories obtained in the main mode. The golf war In recent months we have witnessed the attempt by Gameloft to impose their golf games both in terms of the arcade and simulation genres, respectively with Let's Golf! 2 and Real Golf 2011. A half-successful operation, given that the former has given the user a fun, immediate and very nice to see title, while the latter has not been able to do the same due to a technical implementation that is not up to date. height and a questionable shooting system. The old Tiger Woods PGA Tour therefore remained the best golf simulation available on the App Store for two years, despite the mediocre graphics and some annoying bugs. The 2012 edition, as previously mentioned, starts from a completely renewed technical sector, which makes the most of the resolution of Apple devices (clearly also supporting the Retina display) to offer eight courses characterized by a good design, very ~populated ~ and very rich in detail, especially as regards the grass and the leaves of the trees. Too bad for the surrounding elements, which do not boast the same quality, and for a frame rate that sometimes shows the side of some uncertainty, at least on the iPhone 3GS. The shooting system has remained unchanged and is completely based on ~touch~ dynamics: we have to slide our finger on the indicator first downwards and then upwards, and depending on the timing and precision we will obtain a more or less powerful. In this sense, the game also lets itself go to a small arcade concession: when the shot starts with maximum power, a series of quick shot changes enhance the maneuver. The choice of club can be managed automatically or manually, and in the same way it is possible to determine the type of swing we intend to perform. Closer to the hole though, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 felt a little too stiff and lacking in give, producing quite a bit of frustration with close-up shots that miss the target by a matter of millimeters. Finally, the sound seemed mediocre to us. The tested version is 1.0.0 Price: 5.49 App Store links", "date": "2011-04-05", "grade": "7.8"}
