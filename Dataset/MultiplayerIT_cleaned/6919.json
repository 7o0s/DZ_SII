{"name": "Velocity 2X", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/137194-velocity-2x-dai-kai-tana.html", "text": "When we finished Velocity Ultra last year and parked the Quarp Jet in the garage, we weren't convinced we'd be playing space pilot Kai Tana again. True, FuturLab's 2D shooter was warmly received by critics and Vita owners, and after all the cliffhanger at the end of the game was a more than obvious indication of the development team's intentions, but being able to pack a sequel that expanded on the formula original and that didn't seem just a ~more of the same~ it seemed an impossible challenge for the group led by James Marsden to win. And yet, the small developer from Brighton has succeeded in the enterprise, pulling out of the hat an episode that is not only bigger, richer and more graphically impactful, but also (and above all) better in terms of gameplay and capable of introducing new ideas that they work unexpectedly well. Velocity 2X is the high point reached by a series that humbly debuted among PS Mini games but finds its maximum expression on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. Velocity returns to PlayStation Vita and debuts on PlayStation 4 with a sequel that's more thrilling than ever Back on board Velocity 2X picks up where events left off in the previous episode, but this time it does so with much more emphasis on story and characters. Level after level, the game uses a few cutscenes and a handful of dialogues to tell how Kai, who survived the collapse of a star, begins a battle against the civilization of Vokh warriors, helping the pacifist Jintinda people to free themselves from their slavery . It being understood that the narrative element remains absolutely secondary in a shoot'em up like Velocity, the developers must be given credit for having written a simple plot that connects the different settings in a very effective way. But what made Velocity Ultra one of the most interesting games on PlayStation Vita is the way it revamped the classic vertical-scrolling shooter mechanic. The Quarp Jet's ability to teleport from one point to another on the screen may seem like a minor addition, but in reality it completely changes the cards on the table, opening the door to a number of new possibilities in terms of level design. It is thus possible to overcome barriers, reach distant bonuses, avoid enemy blows or appear in an instant in front of a group of enemies. At some point, the levels begin to fill with forks and switches to hit in the right order, thus turning into labyrinthine puzzles in which you teleport back and forth continuously. The amount of improvements and refinements compared to the first Velocity is remarkable: selecting the point to teleport to is now much faster and more immediate, and also the way in which the camera follows the Quarp Jet helps to make the experience smoother and easier to follow. Even more important, however, is the decision of the developers to eliminate the limit of lives, the cause of numerous game overs in the original Velocity. Precisely because there is no longer the risk of having to start the level over again, Velocity 2X leaves the player with free rein, encouraging him even more to play recklessly and quickly. The crme de la crme, then, is playing it on PlayStation Vita: not only does the search for the perfect score make it a title suitable for a portable console, but once again it is possible to teleport simply by tapping on the touchscreen, which makes it even more intuitive to face each level. PSVita trophies For the completionists, Velocity 2X offers a very varied set of Trophies. Many of these are unlocked simply by progressing through the game, collecting a certain number of crystals, unlocking all skills or eliminating a Vokh. However, others are decidedly more challenging, passing through having to find and unlock all the secret levels, until you get a perfect score in every single level. Run, Kai! Run! The most obvious novelty introduced in Velocity 2X, however, is represented by the sequences set within the Vokh space bases. You momentarily leave the Quarp Jet and suddenly the game transforms into a frenetic side-scrolling platformer. In Kai's shoes you run, jump, slide, shoot at three hundred and sixty degrees and, just like in the ship, you can teleport to other points on the screen. In this way the protagonist is able to overcome traps, move faster or displace an enemy to hit him from behind. These platforming moments aren't sporadic variations on a theme, or gameplay ideas squeezed in to justify a sequel. The walking sequences are seamlessly integrated into the experience ofgame, both because the passage takes place without any interruption, and because the platforming moments maintain the same rhythm and frenzy as the original gameplay. Some of the most thrilling moments in the whole game were just running around and teleporting like crazy while playing Kai. The only unfortunate exception is that of telepods, small devices that must be launched at the exact points where you want to teleport. In this case you have to stop for a few seconds, adjust your aim and launch, a procedure that slows down the pace and momentarily interrupts the action. In a game that relies on fast and relentless racing between levels, breaks of this type are far from welcome, sometimes becoming the cause of a missed perfect score. This is the only drawback in a production which instead proves to be impeccable and meticulously cared for in every other aspect. The boss fights, another novelty of the game, gradually become more complex and interesting, while a surprise mechanic is introduced in the last three levels which represents an unexpected twist to the game formula. The enormous attention that FuturLab has paid to detail is noticeable not only in the gameplay of Velocity 2X, but also in the art direction and aesthetic realization, a clear departure from what was seen in Velocity Ultra. At every moment, the screen is filled with lights, bloom effects, explosions and lens flares, without causing the slightest uncertainty in the frame rate. Compared to the first Velocity there is also much more visual variety, passing from the colors of the planet Tiracas to the acid shades of Altranda, from the frozen backdrops of Rokunia to the gloomy Paroika Prime space station. All accompanied by the impeccable soundtrack created by James Marsden and Joris de Man.", "date": "2014-09-11", "grade": "8.8"}
