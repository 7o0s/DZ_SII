Indeed, to be honest, many of the younger users probably owe their passion for electronic entertainment to it and to the figure of its protagonist, Lara Croft. The beautiful and busty archaeologist whose image was clearly conceived in the design by the developers Core Design (it was Toby Gard who designed it) mainly for a male audience, only to then make inroads into the female one as well, succeeded since her first appearance back in 1996 on PC, PlayStation and Sega Saturn, to attract the attention of players and the media. Again to Lara, in fact, we largely owe the clearance of the figure of the video game as a niche element, which later became a mass phenomenon, and of the gamer, too often in the past seen from the outside almost like an alien. Croft is so considered an icon of the sector that over the years she has earned the covers of various fashion and fashion magazines, and even entered with great pomp in the ~Guinness World Record~ as ~The most famous video game heroine in the world ~. As well as films dedicated to her. Inevitable, therefore, that this brand continued to ~live~ over the years in various projects and was exploited for what appears to be more than ever today the new frontier of low-cost videogame productions: the versions of the great classics of video games remastered in high definition. So, a few weeks after the launch of the Prince of Persia collection, Tomb Raider Trilogy arrives in stores. Which, let's say it right away, compared to the Prince's collection appears to be a much better product. Included on the Blu-Ray are Tomb Raider: Legend, Tomb Raider: Anniversary and Tomb Raider: Underworld. Being adaptations, the games carry the strengths and weaknesses of the original versions, and in general, the playability is always the same: apart from a few new moves that can be performed by Lara between one chapter and another, a greater or lesser visual detail, or a slightly different basic structure, on balance the control system of the three titles is the classic one and lovers of the saga will not struggle to find the feeling with the controls from the first sequences. As tradition dictates, our favorite heroine can jump, cling to ledges, climb, hang from poles, throw the grappling hook to hook onto specific points, shoot and so on. However, just to highlight the differences between one title and another, let's now analyze them one by one. Playstation 3 trophies There are one hundred and sixteen Trophies present in the Tomb Raider Trilogy Blu-Ray. To be exact we have 42 for Legend (8 hidden), 41 for Anniversary and 33 for Underworld. To unlock them generally it will be necessary to complete certain events or complete specific actions. For example, in Tomb Raider Legend you can get prizes by blowing up enemies with the help of two petrol cans or by kicking a ball against the door of a church in Peru. In Anniversary, on the other hand, they will be able to collect among others by completing the appropriate scenarios such as Peru or Egypt, by carrying out certain killings or by defeating the Bosses and completing the game on the Hard level. Finally, in Underworld there will be some details, such as those that can be unlocked by eliminating five enemies by investing them with the motorcycle, recovering relics and overcoming the three Speed Demon challenges. Tomb Raider: Legend Let's start with Tomb Raider: Legend, what was supposed to be the title that would have relaunched the series after the slow decline that began with Tomb Raider 3 and culminated with Angel of Darkness. And so it was. Eidos decided in 2006 to give the saga a decisive turn, removing the franchise from the hands of the original developers of Core Design and entrusting the creation of the new game to a new team, that of Crystal Dynamics, the same of Legacy of Kain (within of the adventure it is possible to unlock a special weapon called Reaper of Souls, in English ~Soul Reaver~. A tribute to themselves and to the game that made them famous - Ed). Just starting from some mechanics borrowed from this other interesting adventure series, then perfectly integrated with those typically of the Lara series, the developers managed to revive and refresh a stale playability, and to get the beautiful Croft back on track. Eliminated the invisible grids or the system of jumps to be calibrated to the millimeter, often even placing oneself with the heels poised on some unsteady platform, integrated new movements made fluid and natural by various new animations and by a more immediate character control system than ever, the title sthe confirmation still today after years extremely fun to play. Even during the combat phases: here the beautiful archaeologist can show off her great skill in hand-to-hand combat, complete with slow-motion kicks and blows, and several new firearms, compared to the series, to be used against unfortunate turn. A pleasant addition then lies in the presence of a motorbike to drive and some interactive elements of the scenario, such as explosive crates or tanks full of petrol, indicated by the presence of an icon, to be exploited during the clashes. Ditto the grenades and the inevitable quick time events. Too bad that this edition of Legend also carries some defects from the original, such as a dancer camera that is not always positioned ad hoc. Tomb Raider: Anniversary Of the games contained in the Tomb Raider Trilogy collection, Tomb Raider: Anniversary is to all intents and purposes the celebratory title of the series. It is a remake of the first Tomb Raider of 1996 for PlayStation, conceived and adapted for PlayStation 2 (and now for PlayStation 3), taking advantage of the mechanics, the graphic engine and the new movements of Lara from Legend. In this game there are the intricate levels that many players had loved in the original, revised and corrected for the new graphics engine and remodeled around the new moves of the busty heroine. For the rest, however, the game is practically identical to the progenitor of the series. The plot, with Croft chasing the Scion, a three-part artifact that once haunted her father and now haunts her, the levels and several of the actions to take all bring to mind the original. Obviously, making a restyling of a product that was already originally restored must have been almost a piece of cake for Crystal Dynamics. Indeed, in our case, apart from the adaptation of the graphics to the standards of HD televisions as regards the textures that cover the scenarios and the characters, there is absolutely nothing different from the remake seen on PlayStation 2. So expect to live again the dead premature due to particularly difficult sessions to overcome, platforms to be reached with leaps and stunts worthy of a circus acrobat and in general levels along which it will not be enough just to press the right button at the right time to move forward, but also to use the brain and a pinch of strategy to get to the bottom of some seemingly insurmountable puzzle or situation. Yet precisely this intrinsic difficulty of the product, its being complicated at times, despite Lara's new abilities, as mentioned, taken from Legend and therefore more useful for facing scenarios fraught with pitfalls, seems to push the non-occasional gamer and in general the fans of the saga to enjoy it to the fullest. And to almost savor those moments lived over 15 years ago. Tomb Raider: Underworld The last game contained in the Tomb Raider Trilogy collection is Tomb Raider: Underworld, which then was also the easiest for developers to integrate into the collection, since it was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 among others a couple of Years ago. Also for this reason it is certainly the most beautiful to look at, as shown by the photo on the side. At the plot level, the title restarts immediately after the end of Legend with Lara looking for a way to reach her mother. If in general in this episode there are no significant innovations regarding the actions that can be performed by the protagonist, apart from the unprecedented possibility of exploiting the ledges of the walls to climb and move, in terms of playability it stands out due to the high difficulty from the other two products. In general, the levels in which to act are very large and built in a rather logical way, with certain elements of the scenario that upon careful analysis prove to be truly ingenious in their design, referring in this sense to the first episodes of the saga for the way in which they be exploited to get to the bottom of some passages or puzzles related to them. The general approach with which to tackle each area, in fact, is the reasoned, inquiring one. Before jumping headlong from spike to spike, for example, you have to look around, explore, make empty attempts if necessary to observe its effects and thus arrive at the resolution of the riddle of the moment. What has been sacrificed a lot compared to, for example, Legend is the combat system which here is rather anonymous due to a poor AI of the enemies and the automatic aiming of weapons, which allows you to easily get rid of your opponents. Incredible then to say, but Underworld, which is the newest, is also the one with the most defects. In addition to a badhe management of the camera that affects practically the whole game, with the shot that too often focuses narrowly on Lara rather than on the surrounding environment, effectively limiting the view and hiding important holds or platforms, another defect of no small importance is the tendency of the archaeologist herself to get stuck with portions of the scenery, in an interpenetration of polygons such as has not been seen since the days of PlayStation 1. New graphics and new content From a graphic point of view, it is evident that the three titles contained in Tomb Raider Trilogy are visually, as mentioned in the previous paragraphs, born on consoles that are completely different from each other in terms of potential, from the old PlayStation 2 and Xbox to the recent and best Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Underworld in the end is always the same from this point of view, and therefore excellent. Legend had already been adapted very well on Xbox 360 in spring 2006 and therefore already boasted basic textures and effects perfect for high definition (this Sony version of the game is the same as the Microsoft console). The major work Crystal Dynamics has evidently done on Anniversary, which despite all the limitations of the case has been almost refurbished. In fact, he has done an excellent job of embellishing the detail, if you pass the term, improving the backdrops, the architectures, the general richness of details and the bibs of our beautiful archaeologist, in order to give us a decidedly effective visual impact, certainly better than seen for example in the remastered edition of the three Prince of Persia. The animations of the protagonist have also been revised. At least that was our feeling. Apart from the greater number of frames which certainly facilitate and make certain movements fluid, it seemed to us, by heart, that Lara acted even more naturally in certain situations, as if Crystal Dynamics had implemented a few more movements. Certainly there are defects always speaking of aesthetics, and in Anniversary some are highlighted due to the HD. But nothing particularly annoying always keeping in mind the age of the product. The sound is also good, with a decent dubbing in Italian and audio and environmental effects in line, qualitatively, with other products of the genre and complete remastering of the soundtrack and background elements. The inevitable Trophies have been added, for a total of one hundred and sixteen divided into the three games (42 for Legend, 41 for Anniversary and 33 for Underworld), as you can read in the special box on this page. Then, again, a lot of bonus material among which a theme for the Cross Media Bar PlayStation 3, some behind-the-scenes footage of the three productions and a new avatar of Lara Croft stand out.", "date": "2011-04-15", "grade": "8.0"}
