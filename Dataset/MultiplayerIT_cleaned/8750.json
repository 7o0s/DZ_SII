The fascinating strategy created by Alex May and Rudolf Kremers was criticized mainly due to a slow and superficial gameplay, despite the design choices and the artistic style making it a more unique than rare product, a rough diamond in the midst of less and less productions originals. After years away, and following an equally controversial PlayStation 3 release, the arrival of Eufloria HD on the App Store presented a double challenge for the developers. On the one hand, the need, as far as possible, to adjust the shot on the basis of the criticisms received so far in order to re-propose the product to a new audience; on the other, to completely revise the control scheme to adapt to the large iPad touchscreen. Could the third time finally be the right one to be appreciated by critics and the public? Boring or misunderstood? Minimalist in aesthetics and, above all, in mechanics, Eufloria HD completely strips the genre of real-time strategy from what are some of its more traditional elements, such as the collection of resources or the management of your units, setting everything in that universe made of celestial bodies, plants and living organisms openly inspired by the theories of the American mathematician Freeman Dyson. At the start of each level the player finds himself in possession of one or more planets, some trees and a handful of flying seeds that orbit around them. As in the more traditional RTS, the aim is to increase the number of your units, conquer nearby planets and overwhelm opposing armies before they are able to pose a serious threat. However, the formula is essential to say the least: each tree planted on the planet produces new seeds, which can in turn be used to create new trees, to attack opposing units or to explore the surrounding planets. By tackling the story mode, further elements of the game are gradually introduced, although the strategic component never reaches a huge level of complexity. Soon you can plant a defensive tree, choose rallying points for new seeds or select units based on attack power, speed and your own energy, but you can't manage mixed groups of units for more tactical approaches if not through a series of cumbersome steps. However, one of the most controversial aspects of Eufloria HD is the behavior of the enemies controlled by an artificial intelligence that is far too tame: the opposing seeds will spend most of their time swarming around their own planet, and even when they are clearly outnumbered it is rare that take the initiative, most of the time waiting for a risky move by the player. Yet, if this may seem like a serious flaw to the more hardcore audience, it is actually a fundamental component in the Zen alchemy formulated by May and Kremers. Eufloria HD doesn't want to be a too brainy game, nor does it want to generate anxiety in the user through an immeasurable amount of options or an artificial intelligence that is too warlike. The interface is simple and the player's choices are few and linear just to allow him to relax and appreciate the calm rhythm and the atmospheric dream, enjoying the elegant stylistic component but requiring the minimum attention and challenge necessary not to get bored. Forget about Zerg and Space Marine: Eufloria HD is a game that must be played in total silence, possibly in the dark, obligatorily with headphones; exactly like Flower but in an RTS sauce, the title entertains and fascinates despite extremely simple mechanics, while the Relaxed and Dark Matter modes ensure an even more atypical audiovisual experience. A floral touch The transition from the mouse to the joypad and finally to the touchscreen has allowed the Omni Systems Limited team to refine the game interface and smooth out all those defects reported by the two previous versions. It is no coincidence that the iPad edition is undoubtedly the most successful so far, and it is curious to note how the original playful experience is perfectly suited to traditional tablet inputs, such as pinch, zoom and double-tap. There are some small drawbacks (upgrading one's units is inexplicably difficult), but the fact that it is possible to interact with planets and seeds in different ways should be able to satisfy everyone a little. Furthermore, if one of the main criticisms leveled at the PC version was the enormous slowness of the action, it is now possible to increase the speed up to three times the normal speed. The story mode and its 25 levels already ensure several hours of entertainmentaccompanied by a mysterious storyline, but clearly it is in the Skirmish mode, in its procedurally generated levels and in the skills unlocked from the beginning that Eufloria HD shows itself in its entirety, although some may still shrug at the lack of a multiplayer option .
