Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Consecrated by over a million downloads, the Clear Vision series quickly established itself on the App Store and Google Play, thanks to an immediate gameplay but with interesting facets and respectable numbers. The developers have learned to make the most of their product, focusing on the peculiarity of a graphic style that represents the characters as ~threadlike compositions~, elementary figures that however move and interact with each other following the traces of an amusing plot. The leitmotif of Clear Vision 3 is the sensational return to the scene of a professional killer, the same one who in the previous episodes has put the police forces in serious difficulty and who once again aims to carry out his exploits without getting caught. It is a ruthless hitman, who keeps the truth about his work hidden even from his family and who every day pretends to go to the office and then access an underground base, select the targets to eliminate and reach the designated place carrying a rifle. of precision. There is a minimum of textual indication for each mission, and reading it can help us understand who should die and who shouldn't. Then we move on to action, moving the viewfinder with the right thumb and opening fire with the left one, trying to close the question as quickly and ~cleanly~ as possible. But things aren't always that simple... Clear Vision 3 is a solid and fairly varied sniping game. Too bad only for the limits of the freemium Boom! Headshots After a short tutorial, the first stages of Clear Vision 3 are completed without particular problems: just frame the victim's head in the center of the viewfinder and open fire. The more we go on in the campaign, made up of fifty-five missions in total, the more we come across variables that can give us a hard time: the distance, the wind, the presence of any witnesses and so on. All these elements must be kept in mind in order to be able to complete one's task perfectly, and often this implies the use of a great upgrade system that allows us to modify the viewfinder, stock, barrel and other components of the rifle (or buy new ones ), all by spending the virtual money earned by completing levels. What about the freemium aspects of the experience? The game can be downloaded and used for free, but you have to submit to two precise limitations: the first, less cumbersome or now quite widespread, consists of an energy bar which empties as we face the stages and which is recharged as we go weather; the second, indeed more annoying, is the obligation to use hard currency (obtainable only with real money) to access the alternative missions and interrogations, which in fact represent the most relevant innovations of Clear Vision 3 compared to the chapters that have it preceded. This is not the most permissive approach with which we have come across, remaining in the sphere of freemium titles, and in the end it constitutes the biggest problem of the DPFlashes Studios production given that, as already mentioned, the quality of the game in terms of gameplay , structure and technical sector are indisputable.", "date": "2014-02-22", "grade": "7.7"}
