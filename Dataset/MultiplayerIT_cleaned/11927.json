{"name": "Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/syphon-filter-dark-mirror-recensione.html", "text": "Western development teams are generally thought of as harbingers of poor innovation and graphics engines that are technically inferior to what is produced by their Japanese counterparts. In the case of Siphon Filter, however, we are faced with a series that first introduced the ~stealth action~ genre, together with products such as Tenchu and even Metal Gear Solid at the time of PSone. Undisputed protagonist in the 32-bit era, agent Gabriel ~Gabe~ Logan did not find a similar response on PS2 and tried the PSP route. The choice proved successful with the Dark Mirror episode, which we can now see at work on PlayStation2 as well. Dark Mirror After the mediocre The Omega Strain, this new episode of Siphon Filter aims to recover credibility in view of the probable leap to PlayStation3, and it does so first of all by adapting on a technical level: the very jerky engine previously used has been replaced with a much more efficient one, which at least it brings the technical level of this title to the average of current PS2 games. Otherwise, there are no major changes: the story behind Dark Mirror revolves around the invention of a new satellite superweapon that could fall into the wrong hands, and Gabe Logan must prevent that from happening at all costs. To complete his new mission, the special agent must go through a large number of stages (set in four different world locations), get in touch with certain people and eliminate all the bad guys. To help him there is always the skilled Lian Xing, which we will be able to control in some levels, as well as the classic vocal support of the Agency. The game The Siphon Filter startup screen allows us to adjust the video options (widescreen and progressive scan are supported) as well as customize the controls, so we can start with the tutorial to understand how the game works, what are the actions that Gabe and how to behave when there are enemies. Once we become familiar with the control system, we can begin: some animated sequences show us the incipit of the story, then it's up to us to take action and follow the instructions in the briefing, checking progress from the pause screen. We can move the character using the left analog stick, while with the right stick we orient the view (and therefore the viewfinder). The d-pad is used to access objects (visors of various types, but also medkits) and available weapons (up to four), whereas with the back buttons you can enter ~viewfinder mode~ and fire. There is no shortage of sniper rifles, so we will be able to eliminate our opponents from far away with a headshot, but also use a whole series of projectiles of different types: standard, explosive, gas or equipped with an electronic inhibitor. One of the substantial differences compared to The Omega Strain lies in the lack of automatic aim, so we will have to manually frame the enemies and the fights will have a greater strategic component, amplified by the possibility of hiding behind elements of the stage and then looking out and shooting. The moment there is an opponent very close, Gabe automatically switches to hand-to-hand combat to knock him out. Our character's energy is shown to us by a bar located in the lower right part of the screen, and also in this new chapter we will be able to ~strengthen~ ourselves by equipping ourselves with a bulletproof vest. Finally, there is no shortage of puzzles to solve: there are stages in which you have to understand how to move forward, which switches to activate and which hidden passages to crawl into. In addition to firearms, the protagonist of Dark Mirror is in fact equipped with some tools that can open doors or vents in the ventilation system, to find a way out in any situation. Technical realization As mentioned, Siphon Filter: Dark Mirror uses a different graphics engine than The Omega Strain, boasts a certainly more fluid management of polygons and a greater level of detail, especially as regards the characters. The textures are average for PS2 titles, so there's nothing to rejoice about, and the frame rate doesn't reach 30fps but it doesn't end up in noticeable slowdowns either. Overall, we are dealing with a graphically average product, which does not boast high quality solutions but does not even turn up one's nose. As for the sound sector, its strong point certainly lies in the good quality Italian dubbing, while the music is rather anonymous and the effects do not shine for realism or originality. The control system is rather simple and immediate, becoming cumbersome and confusing only when collectednew weapons are created to replace the ones we already have. The aim is quite precise, even if a greater fluidity of the graphics would certainly have made things easier. The online mode, which is present in the PSP version of the game, is completely missing. Comment If on PSP it has found fertile ground for a whole series of reasons, not least a high-level technical realization, on PS2 Siphon Filter: Dark Mirror turns out to be an average product, devoid of high notes and afflicted by ~naivety~ that distinguish the series forever. The step forward compared to The Omega Strain is clear and tangible, especially in the graphics, but it is not enough to push the game as much as it deserves. Gabe Logan fans will still find bread for their teeth: this new episode is full of stages, weapons and objects, and also introduces strategic elements that were definitely lost in the transition from PSone to PS2. Unfortunately the stealth key is not valued much, but in general Dark Mirror represents a recommended purchase for those who love Siphon Filter and ~Western~ action games in general. Pros: Lots of levels, lots of weapons, lots of items More ~reasoned~ firefights than in the past Dubbed in Italian Cons: Technically decent, but no more Neglected stealth elements No online mode", "date": "2007-10-16", "grade": null}
