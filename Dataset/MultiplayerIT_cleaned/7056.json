Team Kabam's game does everything pretty well in regards to these characteristics: the story is extremely classic, with the usual evil forces threatening the balance of the Mirrorverse (an alternative Disney metaverse) and an army of Guardians bent on defending this strange and composite universe. The fact that these fighters are characters from the most beloved animated and cinematic series represents a plus that cannot be overshadowed, resulting in the real driving force of the whole game. The beauty of Disney Mirrorverse is precisely the cast of characters, and it is no small thing in a gacha focused on the collection of these: in addition to being famous heroes of mass popular culture, loved by young and old, these 40 Guardians (plus other arriving post-launch) are also convincingly reimagined as real fighters. Mickey Mouse appears in his figure as a wizard similar to the Sorcerer's Apprentice, Rapunzel is a sort of agile and pot-armed warrior, the Little Mermaid is an expert in the use of the combat trident, Sullivan is a huge armored tank and many others are been perfectly redesigned to fit better into this strange context. The character design is really excellent and the reinterpretation interesting, obviously capturing the typical elements of the characters, where possible: Merida uses the bow, Buzz the space weapons, Mulan is a skilled swordswoman. It might look like a huge hodgepodge of assorted fan art, but there's a remarkable coherence to the overall artistic vision and overall the fascination of certain enduring characters and seeing them fight together in this form is something of a day's dream. childhood that comes true. A universe of challenges Disney Mirrorverse: Mickey in action The aim of the game is to fight the Broken, or corrupted copies of the Guardians who are trying to conquer the fragments of gems on which the balance of the universe is based. To fight them, we can deploy fighters of various types who are divided into the typical classes of the genre between tanks, ranged, magic specialists and more. Everything revolves around the conquest of gems and materials useful for the summoning of new characters and the evolution of those who are part of our army, which takes place by taking part in the different game modes available: the main one is obviously the Story mode, which offers a series of levels placed in sequence and with increasing difficulty, but these are accompanied by other types of game such as one-on-one confrontation with progressive levels focused on resistance and timed events dedicated to particular characters who can be conquered by carrying out these quests . The mechanics of the clash is generally the typical one of this genre of games: each level is broken down into 3 or 4 mini-sequences in which we have to free the area from the enemies, and then get to the fight against the boss which guarantees the unlocking of the rewards to the end of a generally more demanding and minimally tactical battle. Scenarios and enemies change but the mechanics of the levels always remain the same, which inevitably leads to a sense of constant repetitiveness, even if perfectly in line with the standards of this type of game. Combat and progression Disney Mirrorverse, a chaotic team fight Also from the point of view of gameplay, Disney Mirrorverse does not differ much from the standard canon of mobile gacha RPGs, however the combat system manages to emerge from the mass of similar games, always remaining quite engaging. The control over the character is direct: with a virtual stick we can move it around the level and attack by touching the keys corresponding to the various skills, with related specific cooldowns to keep under control. During the battle, some purely action elements are also detected, such as the need to di dodging opponents' attacks with quick evasive maneuvers carried out at the right time, or the ability to counterattack once the enemy has been outflanked. It's a basic system but it still works quite well and doesn't force you to invoke autoplay in order to avoid the pain and run for the rewards as happens in an enormous amount of games of the same genre, which is already a significant element in favor. Various uncertainties are found in the controls, as often happens with sticks and virtual keys on touch screens, but in principle a certain margin of error is always allowed to compensate for these inaccuracies. The character progression system is instead the usual cumbersome and brainy boulder that we have seen many times in gacha RPGs: also in this case we are faced with an enormous amount of resources and in-game currencies to manage, each corresponding to particular parameters to make the characters evolve through different mechanics whose characteristics are not always easy to understand. Disney Mirrorverse, a team of female fighters There are different materials that apply only to certain types of characters and even to certain specific ranges of levels that can be reached. The result is the usual chaos of gems, fragments, materials, gold and other elements that accumulate trying to activate the right automatisms to level up the characters, with the crystals which obviously turn out to be the most precious as they are responsible for the summons and then of the gacha mechanism. The drop rate and the collection system of new heroes is not dissimilar to many other games and this is not exactly a positive element, given that we can easily include Disney Mirrorverse in the mass of gacha RPGs with rather predatory monetization systems tending towards microtransactions , which on the other hand is inherent in the very structure of this sub-genre.", "date": "2022-06-28", "grade": "7.2"}
