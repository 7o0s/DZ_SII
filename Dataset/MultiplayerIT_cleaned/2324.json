{"name": "Frank Herberts's Dune", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/frank-herbertss-dune-la-saga-continua.html", "text": "The beginning of the adventure To better understand who we are and what we have to do in this adventure, we report an excerpt from the introduction of the game, above all for the benefit of those who are unfamiliar with the plot and the characters of the books in the series: ~We are on Arrakis, the distant planet of sand, better known as Dune. Dune is the only known source in the entire universe of the much-needed spice. Duke Leto Atreides, Planetary Emperor of Dune, has recently been betrayed by Emperor Shaddam IV and slain by the malicious Baron Harkonnen. The duke's entourage was also murdered, taken prisoner or forced to flee. His wife, Jessica, and young son Paul, the new duke, managed to flee in dexter. At this time the boy is still known like Paul Atreides. Those who don't know him might say that the situation the boy finds himself in is desperate, but the one who lends himself to becoming Muad'Dib knows that he himself is the master of his destiny. Lost in the desert together with his mother Jessica, Paul plans to rally the Fremen to fight for his cause. This mysterious people of the sand is in fact a formidable potential weapon and Paul intends to use it to regain control of the spice trade, taking back his fiefdom and avenging his family. Excerpt from ~Paul Muad'Dib's Fremen Chronicles~, Written by Princess Irulan. Stages of battle. Let's now take a look at how the game is structured. Our attempt to gain the trust of the Fremen people in order to lead them, under our command, against our enemies in order to regain dominion over Dune will be constantly marked by the alternation of two distinct gaming phases that will have the Sietch and the missions that will gradually be assigned to us. The Sietch is none other than the headquarters of the Fremen where the attacks to be carried out against the Harkonnen are planned and discussed. The primary objective of the game phases carried out within this place is to collect as much information as possible to determine the objectives of the missions to be organised. At the end of each mission we will have to return to the Sietch to verify our successes and take note of the next steps to be taken to expel the invaders from the planet. While the headquarters has an introductory and narration function of the events, the missions are instead the real heart of the game as it is within them that we will have to guide Paul in an attempt to complete the objectives assigned to us. The typical mission is divided into several distinct phases and only by successfully completing an objective will it be possible to continue with the next ones. The tasks that we will be called upon to carry out will be many and diversified: we will have, for example, to be able to destroy the structures used for smuggling in La Spezia or directly attack the Harkonnen outposts; we will be engaged in various sabotage actions or in the exploration of the deserted lands to find the secret deposits of La Spezia... The movements of the warrior. Paul can only rely on our ability to guide him through the many dangers he will face. To try to safeguard our hero's health we will have to make the best use of the numerous movement options that are made available to us by the game interface. We will be able to make Paul walk or run, make him climb stairs or climb obstacles, ambush his enemies by crawling against walls and walls and perform rapid and silent sorties in order to observe the movements of those around him unseen; all using the mouse and keyboard at the same time. Despite the attempt made by programmers to automate and simplify as much as possible the use of all these movement options, we often run into quite a few problems in trying to move the game character exactly as we please. For example, every time you get too close to a wall, Paul automatically leans against it with his back in an attempt to hide, an action that takes a few seconds to carry out and which in some cases compromises the development of the movements we had planned to carry out by putting ourselves even in danger by slowing down our advance towards the enemies or in any case compromising the action we had in progress. Some management problems can also be detected in the synchronization between mouse movement (used to rotate the view) and keyboard use (used to make the character walk); in some cases it is necessary to wait a few seconds before performing a rotation or a change of perspective... often very valuable in carrying out an attack or escape. The Weapons of War. At our disposal to eliminate any obstacle that will arise in our path we will have an arsenal consisting of both classic weapons and superhuman powers. We will start the game armed with a Cryss (Fremen ritual knife) and a pistol but soon we will also be able to rely on the power given to us by the voice, or rather Paul's ability to stun enemies using the hypnotic power of the sound emission of his own words . However, the use of the voice will only be possible when our life is in danger (that is, when the energy bar is on red) and its use will block each opponent within 10 meters for a time of 5 seconds, causing also an amnesia that will lead him to forget that he ran into Paul and thus making him become harmless towards us. While the use of the Cryss is very well managed and spectacular (the animations that see us silently slitting our enemies' throats are really nice) the use of the pistol and firearms in general is quite complex and at times frustrating. Paul will not be able to extract the weapon and rotate on himself to better aim his targets but will only be able to shoot in a straight line while remaining fixed in the direction in which he pointed the weapon. The same goes for our enemies, ~animated~ by a very elementary AI, who will only be able to detect our presence, point their weapons at us and unload their arsenal on us. No complex interactions between enemies and the environment were envisaged by the programmers; for example, even if they trample on the corpse of one of their companions, they don't worry in the least, continuing as if nothing had happened to walk carefree. Speaking of weapons and wounds, we also mention how damage recovery is managed in the game. Since the most important asset on Arrakis is water, it will also be our only source of energy and sustenance. In order to restore the vitality lost following the clashes with our antagonists we will have to dip into our H2O reserve by drinking from our inseparable water bottle and, to fill it up again, we will be able to either rely on the water supplies that we will find scattered throughout the levels of the game both on the crystalline liquid that we will extract from the covers of our poor enemies killed using the Cryss. Voices, words and writings. The entire game is localized in Italian (text, manual, spoken) which helps a lot in understanding stories and missions. In the face of a discreet dubbing, however, we must detect a poor synchronization of the characters' lips with what they pronounce, a flaw mainly due to the few movements foreseen for the lips and cheekbones by the programmers. Another small note of denial must be made to the plot of the product, sometimes confusing and containing elements that are not well described for those unfamiliar with the show or the books from which the game was based. A note of value must be spent instead as regards the animations, especially those of the sandworms made in a truly imposing and impressive way. Summing up we can define Frank Harbert's Dune a pleasant game able to make us spend a lot of hours of play in a carefree way, giving us the opportunity to venture into the magical world of Arrakis. We are not dealing with the game of the year but with a product that is perhaps suitable for a Christmas present given the once in a while not impressive hardware resources (PIII 500, 64Mb ram, GForce). Any enthusiasts of the Dune paper saga should note the presence of numerous discrepancies with what they have read and what they will see in the game, also due to the fact that the main source of inspiration is the television serial which already moved away a bit from the original ideas present in the texts. We also point out a peculiarity of the package which, despite being in the now canonical DVD format, also has a cardboard case in which to store the plastic box, giving a pleasant added value to the whole. The Endless Saga. The success of the books written by Frank Herbert is indisputable and recognized worldwide; from such a masterpiece it was more than obvious to expect some mediumistic transposition... but I think no one would have ever thought of seeing the birth of a cinematographic film, a television serial and a really long series of computer games. After 4 games ofstrategic mold set in the world of Arrakis and an adventure for the Amiga 500 here is a new title on PC users' monitors, this time taken directly from the television series broadcast months ago in America and on Tele+. In this new product we will find ourselves playing the role of Paul Atreides in the period immediately following the assassination of Duke Leto, our father and governor of Dune. To try to escape the soldiers of the empire who, in cahoots with the Harkonnen our ancestral enemies, intend to exterminate every Atreides present on the planet (us in primis), we will use a ..... aiming towards the most deserted and wild areas of the planet. Due to a storm, however, we will be forced to make an emergency landing that will leave us at the mercy of the sands and the scorching sun with only a still suit at our disposal to avoid dying of dehydration.", "date": "2001-12-08", "grade": null}
