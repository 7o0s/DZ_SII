Production has certainly changed, as a result of public taste and perception, but the graphic adventure remains a healthy genre that continues to be enriched every year with new interesting titles, even if necessarily developed by lesser-known labels and with styles of alternative production, between crowdfunding and independent financing. Particularly active on this front are the European teams, especially in the German area, which has now become a sort of school for this ~new wave~ of graphic adventures. The series The Book of Unwritten Tales fully responds to this identikit, developed by KING Art Games following a fundraising campaign that ended with great success and was released a couple of years ago on PC. Let's talk about it again today because the mobile version has been released on iOS and Android transposed by Fishlabs, which re-proposes the excellent experience seen on Windows practically unchanged with a simple adjustment of the interface to the touch screen, which confirms once again how this genre is particularly well suited to mobile devices. Curious to note how a game that so naturally transfers to this technology is also conceptually very distant from the typical mobile use, but this can also represent its strong point, positioning itself as a title suitable for classic gamers and for those who want something more thoughtful and cadenced. It should be noted that the point and click mechanics is mainly designed to be performed with the mouse and some control uncertainties emerge in this tactile transposition also in terms of precision especially on smaller screens, however not such as to affect the experience and the significantly reduced price of the mobile version (4.99 euros) compared to the original amply compensates for the relative inconvenience. The unwritten stories in The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 in mobile format are worth rediscovering A book of well-known stories The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 is the same excellent adventure reviewed two years ago on these pages, so we refer to that article for all the background information on the game. The story tells of the intertwined destinies of four unlikely heroes, tangled together in various ways and all in search of their own goal, which somehow then finds itself tangent to a much greater issue concerning the salvation of the whole world, as befits to great stories. What stands out here is the quality of the writing, which tackles profound themes while always remaining balancedly humorous, bringing together various characteristics of fantasy, fairy tales as well as popular culture and parodying them in an intelligent and inspiring way. An approach that is somewhat reminiscent of Terry Pratchett's style on similar topics, and a quantity and quality of dialogues approaching those of the great LucasArts adventures, within a story that lasts about twenty hours spread over five chapters. It can be a challenging tour de force for those less inclined to embrace the point-and-click adventure mechanics, and the amount of text (dialogue is spoken in English with Italian subtitles) is impressive but it's easy to get carried away along the way lightly, also thanks to a not excessive average difficulty of the puzzles, given by a certain logic at the base of their structure. Speaking specifically of this adaptation, the interface has remained substantially identical but the two main actions (looking at and interacting contextually with objects and elements of the scenario) now take place via a quick touch for the first action and selecting from a sunburst mini-menu that appears by holding down for interaction, while leaving inventory management unchanged. Curious, in this regard, the fact that the tutorial has remained practically identical to the original, still mentioning the use of the left and right mouse button on which the PC interface is based. The controls are functional even if with some inconvenience, while the software appears rather heavy for older devices on which a certain latency is detected, but it is still commendable to note a rather extensive compatibility (based on tests, it works well on iPad Retina devices onwards, less well on an older iPad 2). Keep in mind that this is a very large game in terms of data to install: the bas packageand occupies about 3 GB but the chapters are downloaded progressively and bring the total calculation to about 4 GB of free space required.", "date": "2017-02-08", "grade": "8.7"}
