Before analyzing the new EA title, it is at least necessary to ask the following question: are we really interested in simulating a rugby match? Among our readers there will certainly be some fans or practitioners of this sport, I believe most of the public is able to answer for itself and therefore decide whether or not to continue reading. The mechanics of rugby are basically more complex than those of football, basketball and volleyball, popular games in our country: leaving out the advanced rules such as offside in football, goal tending in basketball and invasion in volleyball , grassroots rugby is a team sport which, unlike the others, consists of several different phases of the game and a mix of rules that are difficult to digest. For those who are completely fasting on oval balls, here are the basic principles of the regulation in a very concise and forcibly superficial version (also consider, in case you are interested in learning more, that the rules adopted by the game are the official ones of Rugby Union and not those of Rugby League): two teams, made up of fifteen elements each, face each other with the aim of crossing the goal line, placed at the end of the opponent's field, forcing a contact between the ground and the ball without the ball escaping the player's grip. It is possible to pass the ball with the hands only backwards while to direct it forward it is mandatory to kick it. When a player passes the ball forward with his hands involuntarily or when he loses the ball and it heads towards the opponents' goal line, the action stops and scrums are created which follow particular rules. I have just told you the basics necessary to understand what happens on the pitch: from this point on, for further information of various kinds it is better that you direct your browser to one of the many official sites of rugby federations around the globe. The gameplay and the technique The EA title comes into play right now: in the menu, under ~game modes~ the tutorial is clearly visible which obviously allows you to become familiar with the complicated controls and some of the advanced rules of this fascinating team sport. After spending a couple of hours sifting through the tutorial, the time will come to enter the field for the first official match. The options menu is very poor and the only possibility to start playing other than the ~play now~ (practically nothing more than a friendly match) is offered by the tournament mode which, it seems obvious to say, allows you to play one of the tournaments implemented in the game. We counted a total of seven selectable competitions (world cup, six nations, three nations, tour, super 12, European trophy and world league) and the presence of around sixty teams, obviously including Italy too. Provided you are able to master the controls, the simplicity of the game soon becomes apparent on the field. It is enough to pass the ball at the right time and count your players: ~only~ a lot of practice is needed, the depth of the game frankly seemed almost nothing to us despite the possibility of choosing between different schemes. Furthermore, scrums seem to have too often a completely random result, to the point that the CPU occasionally allows itself to cheat, making all our defensive attempts in vain. Discreet and effective, in our opinion, the management of free kicks and in particular of the throw-in, those who approach rugby for the first time on this occasion will find themselves facing a real game within a game. Graphically, it pains to say, we are faced with a real polygonal havoc. Beyond the flat textures and the unpleasant realization of the players, the biggest negative aspect is that of the animations: they wouldn't be evil (the race is done well, for example) if only they were connected to each other in a convincing way. Switching from performing one gesture to performing another, the player suddenly freezes to change the action to be performed. It seems complicated to understand but imagine running and wanting to pass the ball: without any connection between the two animations your rugby player freezes and switches from the running animation to the passing one, as if nothing had happened, without any intermediate movement. The sensation is unpleasant and leaves the player with an impression of incompleteness that is difficult to digest. The commentary of the matches, in English, is discreet and gives a television feeling to the EA production. It is not only the commentary that is in the Anglo-Saxon language but thehe entirety of the game: the only words in Italian can be found in the manual which will come in handy more often than usual, especially in the initial stages. Comment Evaluating a Rugby game is not easy: in Italy the oval ball does not enjoy the same success as the sphere that rolls every Sunday on the Serie A football fields and the mechanics of the EA title, as well as those of the sport itself, are all It's more than simple to learn. Such a difficulty in learning the rules and controls results in a playful experience suitable exclusively for rugby enthusiasts. A niche title, at least in our country, hardly able to guarantee fun and therefore not recommended. Lovers of the Anglo-Saxon sporting discipline are instead invited to try Rugby 2004 before buying to directly verify if the level of simulation implemented is able to satisfy them. We sincerely doubt it Pros: The tutorial explains the commands well... Cons: ...but where are the rules? Technically mediocre Won't entertain those unfamiliar with rugby Won't excite fans Soccer, football, ice hockey, basketball and more. Writing a list of the sports simulated by the EA Sports development team is practically impossible as there are many games that the company produces annually. Among the most unusual, at least as far as we inhabitants of the beautiful country are concerned, we can easily count this Rugby 2004 which arrived among us precisely in conjunction with the rugby world championship.", "date": "2003-12-29", "grade": null}
