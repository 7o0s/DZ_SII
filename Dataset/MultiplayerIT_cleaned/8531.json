An almost elite game therefore, which in its thirteenth incarnation on traditional home consoles has rediscovered a youth and freshness that many feared would be lost forever. Transferring such a legend to a platform naturally disinclined to fighting games like the iPhone therefore seemed, at least initially, almost a lack of respect, a mere commercial operation born to collect as much money as possible. In reality this The King of Fighters-i 2012 is, as we will see, very far from being defined as an insult to the historic brand; if anything, it is perhaps the umpteenth consecration. More than perfect conversion In referring the reader to the review of The King of Fighters XIII to find out about the particularly intricate plot behind this martial arts tournament, the first consideration to be made here concerns the nature of the title SNK: The King of Fighters-i 2012 is in fact a complete and very rich conversion of chapter XIII for consoles, therefore not a weakened version placed on the App Store just to attract the most ardent fans, perhaps showing at most a dozen characters and 4 modes in total. This time we find ourselves in front of a real game, with an important single player made up of six distinct modes (Training, Single Battle or Arcade Mode, Endless or Survival Battle, Time Attack, Team Battle and Challenge or Missions) and with two types of multiplayer, i.e. locally via bluetooth and online via Game Center via Wifi. If we add to all this the 32 fighters available, this explains the slightly above average cost but, obviously, completely justified. Another element that unites the iOS version and the reference home version is the game HUD, practically identical; this is because even on the small touch screen of the iPhone it is possible to perform all the traditional shots, whether they are Special, Super Special or Neomax techniques. The dreaded HyperDrive is also present, indicated by a special flashing icon, whose activation speeds up the transition from one animation to another, thus favoring the success of the combos. Similarly to what was said for the plot, the analysis of the bars present and of the shots useful for activating them is good to go and review it in the repeatedly mentioned review of The King of Fighters XIII, as it is resumed in an almost identical way; this version intended for a device without physical feedback, however, allows the use of facilities to activate the super combos, which can be recalled (only if you want) with a single tap. The main menu is completed by the Gallery, where all the unlockable objects such as images, videos, and collection cards are displayed; the Rose Shop, where you can buy or sell additional messages for multiplayer or cards with in-game currency, and the Communication section, where you can associate your Twitter account and add the official Facebook page to your favourites. Look out! Once you get into combat, the sensation is that incredible of being with your iPhone playing in your living room: perhaps for the first time ever, the controls of The King of Fighters-i 2012 respond almost perfectly to requests and you have the impression of being able to easily control one's digital alter ego. Whether it's one-on-one or three-on-three battles, the player with minimal experience in the genre (or rather a fan of the saga) will have no trouble mastering the various Kyio, Terry, Andy or Mai, especially if he decides to take a few precious minutes to get through the initial tutorial. The opposite should be said instead for all those players who perhaps do not have enough hours of fighting games behind them but would like to buy a good title of this kind on iOS: in this case it is fair to warn you that despite the facilities included, the learning curve remains very high and start without the fundamental physical controller it is certainly not the wisest choice. Both the graphic sector is excellent, with the usual splendid animations and a fluidity always at the top, and the typical music of the series. The only drawback are the totally static backdrops, an acceptable compromise to have an excellent framerate. Finally, it should be noted that the online games played through Game Center, both classified and free, have not suffered from the slightest lag, a truly rare fact for a game on this platform and therefore certainly to be commendedare.", "date": "2012-05-18", "grade": "9.2"}
