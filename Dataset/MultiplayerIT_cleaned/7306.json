Among the most convincing imitations certainly stand out the series of novels and films The Hunger Games, but also the comic miniseries Avengers Arena recently published by Marvel Comics and, of course, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, a 2010 visual novel originally developed for PlayStation Portable and then converted for iOS and Android a couple of years ago by virtue of its great success, until it landed on the new Sony laptop just a few months ago. Considering that the PlayStation Vita library does not shine with vitality, it was rather surprising and pleasant to discover that the very Japanese Danganronpa would also be localized for our market, where ~Japanese-style~ visual novels have never had a particularly important following. And it's a shame, because the Spike / Chunsoft title is really good and exciting. Despite the less than cheerful theme, Danganronpa is a thoroughly entertaining visual novel High School Murderer The premise is absurd, but quite simple. Makoto Naegi is a very common and ordinary teenager without any particular talent, yet he is selected to attend the very exclusive Hope's Peak Academy: it is a high school which can literally be accessed by the crme de la crme, from the best baseball player to the best karateka passing for the best pop star or the best clairvoyant, however little sense that makes. Makoto is chosen by pure chance, so in hindsight we could define him as the most unfortunate on the planet since from the very first day his new school turns out to be anything but a student paradise: the kids are literally trapped, at the mercy of a mad principal who manifests himself in the form of a psychopathic and murderous teddy bear. The rules are very clear, because the boys cannot leave the building and to graduate they must kill someone by the end of the course without being discovered. If the culprit is found, it's over for him... but if he doesn't get caught or the wrong student is charged, it's game over for everyone else. It goes without saying that the tension immediately skyrockets: on the one hand no one seems to support this diabolical game, on the other everyone looks at each other with suspicion, convinced right away that someone could make an attempt on their lives. Makoto, for his part, is a good boy and will find himself - the player in his shoes - investigating the mysteries of the school and the macabre events that will begin to follow one another right away. We repeat, the story is truly absurd, but the quantity and quality of the dialogues is indisputable, assisted by truly dramatic moments, truly unpredictable twists and situations of great creativity; obviously there is no shortage of jokes or situations bordering on paradox in the purest Japanese style, but the characters reflect and discuss the events on the basis of peculiar and well-defined personalities which, moreover, it is possible to deepen in two very specific game phases . The first is called Daily Life and basically it is the one that allows you to carry on the story, conversing with the various characters who inhabit Hope's Peak Acadamy. These sequences alternate with Free Time moments, in which the player is free to wander around the school in first person and hang out with his classmates to get to know them better, setting up branching dialogues that can increase his affinity level and unlock new skills to exploit in the minigames we'll talk about in a moment. It is worth mentioning the fact that by completing the game a mode entitled School Life is unlocked, which in essence offers an alternative and more cheerful version of the story, in which it is possible to interact with the various characters without the dramatic implications of the original plot. It's a divertissement for those who haven't gotten to know some supporting actors in time and which, however repetitive, allows you to better appreciate their excellent characterization. Provided, of course, that you know the English language perfectly since there is so much to read and in most cases it is essential to understand the dialogues and their implications. PSVita trophies Thirty-eight Trophies can be unlocked in Danganronpa: twenty-seven bronze, five silver, five gold and the final platinum. For the most part, just following the story and solving the various cases, but sometimes you will have to try a little harder, finding all the collectibles and fulfilling particular requirements. The great game of the dead A bit' visual novel and a bit of a social simulator, Danganronpa also offers interesting interactive sequences that are easily comparable to the mechanics of the Ace Attorney series. When your classmates turn out to be potential killers and the only way to survive is to unmask the culprit on behalf of a bipolar teddy bear, discovering detective is an almost obligatory step. In the game sequences called Deadly Life it will be necessary to explore the school in search of clues: in reality, the interface clearly shows us every point of interaction, and it will be up to us to examine them all in search of those necessary to carry on the story and provide us with the evidence we will need. This phase is probably the most boring of the adventure, as it is not clear what we need and in what quantity, and the creativity of some cases makes certain interactions rather improbable; moreover, we find ourselves talking repeatedly with the various characters, in case the last clue acquired has unlocked new enlightening dialogues. Once all the clues have been discovered, the story continues and we move on to what the principal Monokuma defines as Class Trial, practically a real debate that involves all the students still alive and which is structured in a series of different mini-games. The title Danganronpa in Japanese means something like ~refutation bullet~, and this is in fact the metaphorical form that our tests take: in the first minigame, Nonstop Debate, we will in fact have to ~hit~ the compromising sentences of the other characters with our tests in order to contradict them. It follows the Hangman's Gambit, a practically impossible mini-game for non-English speakers in which you must hit the letters that move around the screen and which can form a word that refers to one of the clues found earlier. The rhythm game Bullet Time Battle forces us to press the keys in time in the final tte--tte with the bad guy, while the final Closing Debate makes us complete a kind of summary comic of the case we are facing. The minigames become increasingly difficult and complicated as the chapters of the story follow one another, and some Class Trials can even last an hour, requiring a considerable effort of concentration and memory: fortunately, the skills learned by increasing the affinity with our unfortunate (?) Companions allow us to ~boost~ Makoto's performances, simplifying our lives together with other mechanics such as the one that allows us to momentarily slow down time and, therefore, to study the flurry of dialogues calmly. In these sequences, however, the graphic style adopted by Danganronpa has much more charm because the camera movements and the play of light and shadow better hide the bizarre choice of showing the characters and practically every other element of the environment in the form of two-dimensional artwork without thickness, paper-style. Apart from this, the short interlude cinematics and the general artistic direction are pleasant and disturbing at the same time, summarizing well the thriller colors that Spike / Chunsoft wanted to recreate with some success.", "date": "2014-02-19", "grade": "8.0"}
