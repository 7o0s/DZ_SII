{"name": "Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawks-downhill-jam-recensione.html", "text": "A new Tony Let's start immediately from the premise that Downhill Jam has little or nothing in common with the main Tony Hawk series, apart from the famous athlete's license used more for marketing reasons than for real necessity. To define the Activision production, one could in fact think of an SSX with a skate board instead of a snowboard. Extremely more arcade, dynamic, limited and immediate than the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater that we are used to knowing therefore. The core of the game revolves around a series of competitions, set in 8 different locations: San Francisco, Hong Kong, Machu Picchu, Rome, Edinburgh, Rio, the Alps and the Mall. The concept is simple: you start from the other side of a route, and you have to reach the finish line through downhill roads full of dangers and obstacles. In most cases, the races will be faced in companions of 4 other skaters (from a selectable list of 9, each with the usual statistics to differentiate them), willing to do anything to cross the finish line first; as in SSX it is therefore possible to hit them mercilessly with kicks and punches, to gain a considerable advantage over them. In some cases it may also happen that you have to take part in solo challenges, in which perhaps it is necessary to cross colored circles scattered along the track. In any case, the final result is rewarded with the classic gold, silver or bronze medals, respectively associated with 3, 2 or a point. The sum of your points allows you to unlock subsequent races, in the most classic of ways. To get the better of your opponents, however, you will not have to rely only on pure speed; in fact, all the tracks have a large number of detours, shortcuts and alternative routes with which it is possible to overturn the classification more often than not. There is also the turbo bar, to be filled by doing various tricks or beating up opponents; the evolutions, it must be said, are present in much smaller numbers than the aforementioned main series of Tony Hawk, also going in this case to closely resemble SSX. Check this out Downhill Jam makes use of the Wiimote, to be held horizontally with two hands, simply to briefly control the ~steering~, or rather to make your skater turn. Nothing more, given that the classic pressing of the keys is required to accelerate and to perform the tricks. A system, this, with ups and downs; the immediacy and simplicity in being able to manage the direction of one's digital alter-ego clashes with a non-impeccable precision and responsiveness, which often creates problems that are easily understood in the case of an extremely dynamic game with this one from Activision. In particular, jumping on a ramp or doing a grind can often be a more difficult action than it really should be, to the great frustration of the poor player. In principle therefore, although it is far from unplayable, the use of the Wiimote in this Downhill Jam never gives the feeling of being considered preferable to that of a normal analog stick. Turning instead to the technical sector, it is quite evident that the effort of Toys for Bob is a first generation product, which on Wii means being practically indistinguishable or almost from a good Gamecube game. The number of polygons is certainly not impressive, as is the quality of the textures and the visual depth; likewise the frame rate, while always remaining on absolutely acceptable levels, is neither high nor rocky. Support for 16/9 and 480p do not raise the slightly more than sufficient evaluation of the graphics component of Downhill Jam by much. The sound side is slightly better, which together with standard audio samples and effects offers a solid tracklist of 40 songs, with tracks by Iron Maiden, Motorhead, Public Enemy, White Zombie and so on. Comment Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for Wii is an extremely banal and unoriginal title. But luckily, it's fun. In reality, the control system, while intriguing, is not the strong point of the Activision production, but rather the solidity of an ultra-tested, but still pleasant game mechanic. The races convey a good level of challenge, and the quality of a track design enriched by shortcuts and detours always keeps the tension high. Too bad for a graphic component that is very little. Ultimately Downhill Jam is an absolutely unforgettable product, but one that can give more than a few hours of fun to those interested in this kind of game. Pros Fun from the very first minutes Good track design Good game mechanics Cons Graphically modest Not flawless control Lacking any originality Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam was one of the very first Thurswho for Wii that we had the good fortune (??) to see live, to be precise during Activision's pre-E3 2006 conference. The rather backward state of the programming and the certainly not spectacular graphic design led the audience to welcome the title with a little encouraging silence, accompanied by some not exactly enthusiastic comments. Fortunately, the following months have benefited the efforts of the Toys for Bob team, which while not reaching stellar qualitative peaks, can undoubtedly be placed among the recommended purchases for users of the new Nintendo console.", "date": "2007-02-22", "grade": null}
