{"name": "Ball Rush 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ball-rush-2.html", "text": "The simple basic idea here has really been taken to the nth degree by the developers. With our bar positioned at the bottom of our mobile screen, we'll control a bouncing ball with the task of destroying all the blocks that are suspended above, to pave the way to the next level. In this new version everything is animated, the track of the ball, the dynamic backgrounds, the interactive menus and of course the many bonuses. Longevity shouldn't scare you, certainly the concept on which the game revolves is almost archaic, winking heavily not only at Arcanoid but also at a masterpiece like Pong, but the many levels, 128 to be exact, and the numerous bonuses they always make it interesting. Our cursor and the ball will undergo improvements as a result of the bonuses we get by hitting blocks of the right color, the sphere will turn into a fiery mass capable of devastating the most difficult blocks to break, it will become a small iceberg capable of freezing all hit bricks making them so fragile that they can be broken by a simple second contact, and finally it will become radio controlled or split in two thus creating a real pinball action on the screen. Other simpler bonuses concern the cursor bar and make it go slower or faster, lengthen or shrink it, making the challenge always varied. Even the blocks have some peculiarities, there are eight different types, from the timed ones which, once destroyed after a few moments, reappear on the screen to the ~bomb~ ones which break themselves and everything around them, just to name a few . One of the aspects that most struck us was the developers' choice not to give the player more than one ~life~, but the mystery is soon explained; every time we manage to destroy the barrier of bricks above the cursor bar we will face the next level by literally ~climbing~ upwards with the game, while every time the ball falls we will retrace our steps and therefore fall back into the previous level. In the end, therefore, the fateful game over can only be encountered by returning to the first level and losing the sphere. In order not to make Ball Rush 2 become too frustrating in Herocraft they have decided to keep the levels at their completion state even once you have fallen through a mistake, when we go back to the top so we will find everything as before without having to start the whole world all over again . Technically the game looks good even if on our Nokia N70 we have seen it suffer a little too much in the most agitated situations, with decisive and evident frame drops. PRO A great classic revisited Guaranteed longevity... AGAINST ...but a lot depends on your tastes Some frame rate issues", "date": "2007-05-01", "grade": "S.V."}
