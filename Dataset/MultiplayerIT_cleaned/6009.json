It is in fact one of the longest-running genres ever (the debut took place fifteen years ago, with Dynasty Warriors 2, where the first episode presented itself as a normal fighting game) but also one of the most impervious to change, both that from a structural point of view there have been very few innovations introduced over the years. The formula has therefore always remained the same: under the command of a skilled leader, you have to face thousands of enemies on various battlefields, going to the areas of the map that are indicated from time to time to free them from the control of the opponents and to eliminate specific targets . A feat to be completed by performing combos and special moves, but which inevitably proves to be repetitive. This has not prevented the franchise from carving out a large slice of fans in Japan, as well as finding numerous admirers in the West as well, so as to allow Koei Tecmo to produce new episodes, spin-offs or simple expansions on a continuous basis. Samurai Warriors 4-II, subject of this review, is itself the improved version of a chapter released eleven months ago. Samurai Warriors 4-II is the slightly improved version of one of the best musou available My name is Li, Naomasa Li What has changed from the original Samurai Warriors 4? In the first place there is a new protagonist, Naomasa Li, who stands out on the cover of the game and joins the roster of previous characters, with a view to a Story Mode that has a total of thirteen single player campaigns, most of the which ones to unlock by completing those initially available. Li was one of the four guardians of the Tokugawa clan, and in the title developed by Omega Force he appears as a virtually invincible warrior, equipped with a showy red armor with long golden horns and armed with a spear capable of simultaneously defeating dozens of enemies. The campaign that involves him takes place in the perspective of the wars for the unification of Japan in the Sengoku period and various support characters alternate at his side (including the legendary Hattori Hanzo), but the five missions turn out to be rather simple and linear , as they are based solely on the elimination of certain targets within the maps. Of course, the initial approach highlights an increase in the degree of challenge of the experience, so much so that already at the normal difficulty level one must be careful not to be surrounded and promptly identify in the scenario those objects which, once destroyed, allow the restoration of the life energy. In short, the artificial intelligence of the standard enemies remains vague and basic, but the feeling is that the soldiers are much less ~shy~ than in the first version of Samurai Warriors 4, and do not disdain to hit us if they have the opportunity. A similar argument can be made for the bosses, who generally use the parry and prove to be immune to the charge, but fall easily under the blows of the special maneuvers. In this sense there has been a strengthening of the moves based on the morale of the characters, each of which, moreover, has an ~awakening~ with devastating effects in battle. The possibility of composing the combos starting from both the light and heavy attacks, through various ramifications that become more complex as you level up, certainly adds a pinch of variety to the action, which however remains bound to the same mechanisms as always. Furthermore, due to the ineffectiveness of certain attack sequences compared to others, there are combinations that end up being repeated all too often (in the case of Li, for example, we start with the ~burst~ triangle and square, then perform the ~whirlwind~), resulting in monotony. Playstation 4 trophies The 54 Trophies contained in Samurai Warriors 4-II must be unlocked by fully engaging with the various modes of the game. There are in fact the achievements that are obtained in a linear way, simply by completing the campaigns, but also those based on experience, in this case the obtaining of skills and weapons, or the achievement of a certain level in the Survival mode. All together passionately There are also news on the front of the modes available. The aforementioned Story Mode is no longer joined by the Chronicles mode, but by the Endless Castle, which includes both the Survival mode previously seen in the series and the Challenge mode. The first asks us to face a virtually infinite castle, going up from floor to plan after having eliminated the opponents but being able to count on a single bar of vital energy. Before going up the stairsthat will take us to the next level we will be able to decide to abandon the mission and therefore keep the objects collected up to that moment, or risk the game over and the loss of the loot. Instead, the challenges are divided into four ~chambers~, characterized by as many objectives: in one of them we will have to defeat a certain number of enemies within a time limit, in another to collect as much gold as possible, or even cover certain distances without being distracted from opponents. The last room, the most difficult, even provides game over for a single hit suffered. In Samurai Warriors 4-II there is also the Dojo, where it is possible to create and customize your own warrior and a Free Mode to face any mission with each character, in a completely free way. The comparison with the original edition sees a situation of substantial balance, in the sense that the Chronicles mode perhaps offered a few more possibilities in terms of duration, but was tainted by the presence of a marked grinding that further weighed down the gameplay. All modes are playable both in single player and in cooperative multiplayer, locally or online, and from this point of view the product does not disappoint: if you were used to tackling the Samurai Warriors missions together with a friend, perhaps higher difficulties, you can do it again this time. Finally, the concept of equipment customization has been extended, with the possibility of using different horses in addition to weapons and a set of active or passive skills to be unlocked using experience points earned in battle (if you played the original Samurai Warriors 4 , you can receive a fair amount for free). As far as the technical sector is concerned, we are probably faced with the best musou made so far, capable of exploiting the hardware of the new generation platforms to finally eliminate the showy pop-up effect of the enemies (which in the ~old-gen~ episodes appear even a few meters away) and manage a truly enormous number of polygonal models simultaneously on the screen, as well as more advanced effects also on surfaces, capable of rendering the armor of the protagonists very well. Of course, behind these valuable elements the fact remains that the basic opponents are all identical and have very few animations, but above all that the scenarios have a desolate design and are completely devoid of interactive elements. Furthermore, if the pop-up of enemies has been resolved, in some scenarios we unfortunately witness the ~magical growth~ of the grass as we move, with sometimes even comical effects.", "date": "2015-09-29", "grade": "7.0"}
