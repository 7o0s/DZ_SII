The beautiful graphic realization seemed wasted to us on the small screen of the GamePad, on which you keep your eyes glued all the time, and the level design, however ingenious, seemed to us to resort a little too often to the same solutions within the first two worlds, excessively prolonging some internships. Once the adventure was completed, we must admit that those two problems proved to be more annoying than expected, exposing some shortcomings of HAL Laboratory towards this first - and therefore important - visit of the legendary Kirby on the Nintendo branded home console. Kirby and the Rainbow Brush wasn't the debut we expected for the pink wad on Wii U Running out of ideas For those who have missed our trial - and are too lazy to read it... - it is good to take stock of the situation for a moment. Kirby and the Rainbow Brush is the spiritual sequel to Kirby and the Dark Design, a title released way back in 2005 for Nintendo DS which exploited the then peculiar touch screen to offer a decidedly new gameplay: instead of a pure platformer, Kirby and the Dark Design was also a kind of puzzle game, as the player was called upon to draw lines on the lower screen of the console to direct Kirby and solve the puzzles that hindered him in each level. Kirby and the Rainbow Brush follows the same philosophy. It begins with a long cinematic in which the world of Kirby, Dreamland, loses its colors due to a spell by the perfidious Clargilla, an enemy from another dimension, and our hero, together with the inseparable Waddle-Dee and a funny little fairy, is forced to explore this parallel universe divided, needless to say, into worlds and related stages. Apart from the specious plot, Kirby and the Rainbow Brush plays practically like the predecessor of ten years ago for the Nintendo DS: the player draws colored lines on the GamePad screen and then taps Kirby to push him in the direction he is facing, making him slide on the aforementioned lines so that it uses physics and the law of gravity to roll and bounce towards the goal. In words it seems complicated, but in reality it is a pleasure to play: the touch screen responds quickly to the player's input, and in a few minutes it is possible to perform the most complicated evolutions while the pink ball dodges enemies and zigzags between obstacles and traps . It just takes a little practice. Level design is often very intelligent, especially when you have to interact with the environment by creating obstacles to slow down enemies or designing barriers and connections to contain liquids or create alternative routes. The problem, if anything, is that most of the stages are excessively long and the puzzles repeat themselves too often, making the levels very repetitive in a matter of minutes. The guys from HAL Laboratory should probably have ~spread~ the various thematic puzzles over several stages, making the experience much more varied and exciting. Once you understand the turn mechanic, however, you quickly get bored repeating the same routine over and over again. That the developer was out of ideas, then, is confirmed by the choice to re-propose the same end-of-the-world bosses several times, slightly expanding their attack patterns. Even Kirby's transformations into a rocket, tank or submarine don't impress that much: when available they give a small twist to the gameplay, but they are confined to their thematic stages, making the experience much more predictable. The problem is less felt in the optional stages designed to put the player to the test, but the level of difficulty, calibrated decidedly downwards - complete with an optional option to jump directly to the next level, in case you fail too often - makes every challenge a mere exercise in patience. Considering, therefore, that Kirby and the Rainbow Brush is not played as a traditional platformer, at a certain point a certain feeling of tiredness takes over which makes it more attractive for games of a few minutes than for long sessions. The multiplayer mode, fortunately, improves the situation a lot. It was better on TV Up to three players can control the corresponding Waddle-Dee as in a normal platformer, using the strokes of the player who controls Kirby on the GamePad to defeat enemies and solve various environmental puzzles together. HAL Laboratory has even modified the attack patterns of somethe bosses, in case they face each other in company, to make them a little more compelling, but although the cooperative mode is definitely more fun than the single player, it still drags along many design problems, starting with the camera it always follows Kirby, not to mention the fact that on several occasions there is the feeling that the two souls of the gameplay come into conflict with each other. The Waddle-Dee in question, however, are decidedly luckier than Kirby: they can admire the stupendous graphic creation on a nice large and high-resolution screen, while the poor fellow is forced to stare at the GamePad touch screen, limiting himself to looking up only during uploads or breaks. The decision to confine Kirby and the Rainbow Brush to Wii U left us truly perplexed, because on the one hand it is one of the most technically impressive games for the Nintendo console, on the other hand when we played alone we limited ourselves to turning off the television so as not to consume electricity unnecessarily. The dynamics of the gameplay, in fact, force the player to focus entirely on the GamePad, sacrificing the beauty of the style adopted by HAL Laboratory and its exceptional attention to detail. On a portable console like the Nintendo 3DS we would have had other disadvantages, of course. Kirby and the Rainbow Brush probably wouldn't have been as nice to look at, and the generous size of the GamePad makes the experience at least more comfortable, but perhaps it would have lent itself better to portable use from a gameplay point of view. On Nintendo 3DS we played the beautiful Kirby Triple Deluxe only a few months ago, but in hindsight we would have gladly made the switch, also because the developer's stylistic choice does not influence the gameplay in the slightest way. In Kirby and the Hero's Cloth, for example, the idea of the world of wool and characters sewing and unstitching were an integral part of the game, but in this adventure the fact that Kirby and company have become clay has consequences purely aesthetic. When Kirby falls from great heights he squashes like a ball of plasticine and reassembles himself, making us smile and nothing more. What is the use of being able to admire the clay models of the collected characters, if on the tiny screen of the GamePad it is still difficult to notice the nuances of the colors in the points where the different parts of the body come into contact or the fingerprint marks left by the hands that have they created virtually? The same grievances apply, in a certain sense, to the sound sector, made up of traditional tunes that are hard to get out of your head for a few hours, which the GamePad speakers still don't do justice to. We might as well put on a pair of headphones, at that point, realizing that we are playing a Wii U title after having transformed it, for all intents and purposes, into a handheld.", "date": "2015-04-17", "grade": "7.0"}
