Since 2004, the French studio Nadeo has been offering fast and adrenaline-pumping driving experiences, aimed at enhancing reflexes and stimulating systematic comparison with friends and the community. Over the years there have only been two attempts to approach the console landscape, which took place on Nintendo DS and Wii between 2008 and 2011, but never before had there been talk of a chapter developed simultaneously for three different platforms. Trackmania Turbo not only subverted this tradition but brought the series to Sony and Microsoft hardware for the first time. The game is in fact available, starting today, on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, also giving the public the opportunity to choose between the digital delivery version or the packaged edition. Although there are some interesting innovations, the core of the experience offered has always remained the same: crazy races against time along tracks with tortuous shapes, loops, surface changes and very long drifts, capable of offering many hours of genuine and genuine fun . Trackmania Turbo encourages you to push your reflexes to the limit First medal, 199 left! The Campaign mode of Trackmania Turbo boasts 200 tracks, divided between four different areas with peculiar characteristics. The tracks featured in the Grand Canyon Drift section are characterized by dry and sandy expanses, where asphalt and steep concrete ramps reign supreme. On the other hand, the landscapes of the Down & Dirty Valley clearly go against the trend, in which mixed routes are faced consisting of wide dirt roads, meadows and streams, interspersed with wide jumps and frequent loops of the loop. However, the craziest stunts and the most sudden changes of direction are the prerogative of the Rollercoaster Lagoon area, while International Stadium closes the tour by offering world-class challenges within a state-of-the-art complex. What catches the eye once you pick up the pad is the immediacy of the control system, which is based exclusively on the accelerator button and the dosage of the brakes, useful for triggering drifts. The difficulty curve is therefore determined not so much by the driving system but rather by the subdivision of the campaign into categories which become progressively more difficult to master. Each of these series is in turn divided into slots of ten tracks and each sector must be unlocked by accumulating a sufficient amount of laurels. The first two series can be activated in full reaching up to 70 bronze medals, while the levels of the blue and the red zone will require up to 150 silver medals. Finally there are the black runs, which can only be activated after accumulating between 160 and 190 gold. To tell the truth, the criterion does not appear completely mandatory, since there are medal jokers by means of which the most prestigious laurel can be unlocked even after having achieved at least three times valid for silver. Time attack as if it were raining In Trackmania Turbo the majority of tracks must be covered from point A to point B trying to take as little time as possible, however there are also some circular maps in which three consecutive laps must be completed. During the campaign, time is the only adversary, although the results achieved by friends can be monitored and global, national and regional leaderboards kept track. The classic game view provides a third-person shot located behind the vehicle, but in the vicinity of the loops the image automatically switches to first person, changing the reference points in the player's possession. It is also possible to set the first-person view as the default view, a solution perfectly in line with the support of Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR viewers which had already been confirmed by Nadeo in recent weeks. Variable driving situations are also not lacking, due to the continuous changes of surface or inclination but also to the presence of the usual platforms which trigger the turbo or vice versa, stop the vehicle's engine for short intervals of time, requiring a correct dosage of the accelerator. It is no coincidence that one of the aspects for which Trackmania has been appreciated over time is precisely the sense of speed and this chapter is no exception. Nonetheless, the development team could have worked a little harder to fine-tune the handling of collisions with objects in the paths and to take care of theto jumping physics, which often does little justice to the trajectories set when crossing bottlenecks or suspended platforms. The real challenge is with friends From a cooperative point of view, the main novelty of this chapter is represented by the Double Driver Campaign, by means of which several players are placed at the same time driving the same vehicle. The coordination of movements assumes a fundamental value, since it will be enough to direct the lever in different directions or not to exploit the drifts with the correct timing to make the vehicle uncontrollable. Furthermore, we had the clear sensation that this mode makes sense especially in those games involving four players, while in two-player races there are no substantial differences compared to the experience in single player, even when testing the more complex tracks. Among the more traditional multiplayer modes, Hot Seat returns, in which you have the opportunity to participate in group competitions of up to a maximum of 16 players, based on a series of rounds to be completed in succession. Furthermore, it is possible to decide whether to compete in two opposing teams through the solo time attack, or to fall back once again on the double driver. Then there is the Arcade mode, which plans to beat the best ten times recorded on a given track, being able to take advantage of only three credits. Split Screen offers the traditional split-screen game mode for up to 4 players, but there is also a fourth item - which can be activated via a few button combinations - through which some additional game variants can be unlocked. In this context, we especially appreciated Mono Screen Fun, a competition where all the participants are displayed on the same screen and the camera films the cars from a wider and more decentralized view, making it more difficult to maintain the points of reference that are usually possess in the other competitions. But there is also Arcade Smash, where the accelerator button must be pressed continuously to maintain high speed. Furthermore, the modes available in multiplayer offer direct access to almost all the tracks of the campaign, regardless of whether the medals have been unlocked in the single player mode. As an alternative to challenges with friends, there is the Online Racing mode, which offers access to dedicated servers for up to 64 players, in which you have to try to get the best time during the session. Build your track The points of contact with tradition also emerge thanks to the presence of an in-depth editor for the creation of customized layouts. The Trackbuilder has been designed to offer various degrees of complexity, in order to satisfy the needs of newbies without disappointing the most passionate. In Beginner mode, the interface makes completing courses much faster and more immediate, and an autocomplete function is also available if fundamental components are missing. Once the works have been completed, validation must be carried out through a test ride, at the end of which the type of style associated with that course must also be identified. Normal mode offers more pieces while possessing a simplified interface, while Advanced mode uses a more complex menu system and takes more time to master properly. Nadeo has also introduced an automatic track generator, which can be used during games in the company of friends and is useful for creating completely new tracks in real time, within seconds. From this point of view there were some inaccuracies, in fact we happened to face quite messy paths and there were even some annoying bugs which, in some cases, prevented the correct conclusion of the race. Obviously we trust that the post-launch patches will be able to easily solve these types of problems.", "date": "2016-03-24", "grade": "8.5"}
