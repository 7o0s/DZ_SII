The price of this freedom is clearly visible: a myriad of products of dubious quality, released only for the fun of it and perhaps with the chimera of becoming millionaires thanks to the new ~Angry Birds~. But fortunately, sometimes special situations happen, games out of the ordinary, ~pearls~ (perhaps to use an overused term) capable of restoring dignity even to the chaotic development on these new platforms; the case of Gua-Le-Ni Or: The Horrendous Parade is, in this sense, truly emblematic. Taxonomy, this unknown The initial tutorial of Gua-Le-Ni Or: The Horrendus Parade already represents the entire objective of the game: in fact, the player is immediately forwarded to the fascinating(?) world of Taxonomy. By this Greek term we generally mean nothing other than the science of ~Classification~, in all its variants; in the specific context, however, the matter that we must try to catalog correctly is biological or, better yet, animal. By opening a digital book, a sort of ~bestiary~, the player sees different animals scroll before his eyes; the seemingly simple goal is to find the name of the beast in transit before it reaches the bottom of the page, thus disappearing from view. Naturally, all the animals that pass through the bestiary have the same qualities in common: in addition to not really existing, they are the fruit of at least two truly existing creatures fused together. In order to correctly name the bizarre animal, it is therefore necessary to first discover the origin of the two parts individually, usually the head and body. The tools made available to the player-taxonomist are two cubes with faces covered with animal parts; the cubes, positioned next to each other, return a different ~compound~ animal each time if turned in the right direction. The total parts present, at least initially, are therefore 12, the result of the sum of the 6 faces of both cubes; during the ~Horrendous Parade~ of the creature through the open book, you will have to try to reproduce its features simply by rotating and moving the two tools available, until you form exactly the right composition, thus archiving it definitively. The initial difficulty, as often happens, is certainly very low; but going forward with the cataloguing, the effort required is gradually increasing, reaching such a point as to seriously hinder the work. For example, animals can be hungry, a state that involves increasing the speed of transit through the pages, reducing the time for recognition (only the right food in this case can slow down the run again), or they can increase the parts of which they are compounds, forcing you to recognize 4 different cubes while maintaining the same travel time. It seems almost superfluous to talk about technique for Gua-Le-Ni Or: The Horrendus Parade: the title has a particular graphic style, it has something poetic and relaxing but it doesn't even disdain the actual challenge, thanks to the heavy impediments that can be included in the taxonomic procedure. Nevertheless, thanks also to the perfect interface, it is never too frustrating. Behind the Scenes: Biometrics and Philosophy Gua-Le-Ni Or: The Horrendus Parade can boast an unequaled primacy not even in the vast ocean of applications that is the App Store: during its development, the biometric values of a series of players were monitored, chosen from the ~casual~ between 25 and 45 years old, while they were playing the game. In particular, the data obtained from the heart rate monitor, the conductivity meter, the heart pressure sensor, the eye-tracker, etc. were recorded. The result is a title magically adapted to the moods of the player, a product almost endowed with a life of its own, capable of interacting in a way never seen before in emotional terms. As if that weren't enough, according to its main developer Stefano Gualeni, at the basis of the game concept there would be none other than one of the most famous philosophical theories, namely the functioning of the imagination and the concept of ~complex ideas~ by David Hume. The subject, although certainly intriguing, is complex and cannot be tackled here, however we invite any interested readers to deepen it privately.
