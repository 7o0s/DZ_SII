{"name": "Fra sogno e realt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/172400-nba-live-mobile-fra-sogno-e-realta.html", "text": "In recent years we have witnessed a general simplification in the field of mobile games, both from a structural point of view (with the increasingly widespread adoption of the freemium format) and from that of gameplay. The problem that the developers have set themselves is whether or not it is appropriate to transport complex mechanics to devices equipped with touch screens, given that a blunder in the controls is enough for the experience to become hopelessly cumbersome and frustrating. We must therefore applaud Electronic Arts, which with NBA LIVE Mobile did not want to compromise by pursuing ~casual~ solutions, but was able to create a system which at first is necessarily a bit difficult, but which after a few games it gives great satisfaction, adding depth to the whole experience. Five against five, the matches alternate offensive and defensive phases which denote interesting strategic references, all the more so given the composition of the teams. Net of real teams and players, reproduced under license, the game's career is in fact nothing more than a full-bodied ~Master League~ in which we will find ourselves managing athletes who are initially fairly scarce, then gradually more capable and able to make a difference . And it is precisely in this area that the great compromise of NBA LIVE Mobile occurs, with a system of cards and envelopes to open that goes hand in hand with the freemium dynamics, but which ends up creating a huge roster and numerous variations of the team, the management of which is a bit confusing. Added to this is the traditional energy system which is consumed in each game, more or less markedly depending on the type of event (in addition to the matches of the season there are skill challenges, special events and asynchronous multiplayer) . However, this is not a big problem, since the quarters last for two minutes each (with the possibility of saving in between) and therefore it is played quite a bit before the energy meter needs time to recharge. NBA LIVE Mobile manages to establish itself as the best basketball game available on iOS and Android Slam dunk We were talking about the complexity of NBA LIVE Mobile earlier. Well, in terms of controls, the virtual analog stick works almost perfectly, the inertia that accompanies each movement has the flavor of simulation and the buttons allow you to pass, shoot and sprint during the attack, block and jump in defense. Situations that are usually resolved in simple alternations find unexpected facets here, given that blocking an opponent in his position, preventing him from advancing towards the basket, leads the team to conclude in an awkward manner and allows the ball to be recovered on a rebound to project quickly towards the opposite half of the field. Of course, the physicality of the players could have been made even better, especially in the defensive phase, where it is easy to ~slip~ and the automatic selection of the basketball player is anything but punctual, but in the end these are nuances with respect to the overall quality of the experience . Also on the technical front: the animations of the athletes appear surprisingly fluid and realistic, the rendering of the scenarios and all the polygonal models is excellent, and finally the sound effects accompany the action very well. In short, the developers have taken care of every phase of the game, without giving in to the temptation to simplify certain moments.", "date": "2016-08-12", "grade": "8.0"}
