Given the success of the first chapter, like this one that also arrived on the iPhone, the step to redo the second was short and that's how we find ourselves today talking about the special edition of The Secret of Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. Like a year ago, once again the old game has been revived and completely revamped, with remodeled graphics and enriched by the presence of the voices of the voice actors, able to put the adventure born in 1991 in step with the times, naturally in high definition. All this without forgetting the exquisitely pixelated elements seen almost 20 years ago, available like the restored version with the simple push of a button with which to switch from the old to the new graphics and vice versa, thus having the opportunity to appreciate the work done. It is almost superfluous to introduce the plot of this game, which anyone who has played the classic version will certainly not have forgotten: it all starts with the protagonist dangling in a chasm hanging from a rope with a trunk in his hand, helped by his lifelong love, Elaine Marley, to get out of it. But not before having told her how he ended up there starting from Scabb Island in search of Big Whoop, the famous treasure which also holds the secret to burying forever LeChuck, Guybrush's nemesis ghost pirate, who came back to life thanks to a ritual voodoo. How much wood could a rodent chew? At this point it is incredible to note how the mechanics, the puzzles and every single aspect of the game are current and so insanely fun even after so many years, with a Guybrush that in its genius born from the madness of Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman is still able to hold its head high in the face of modern characters, gluing the player to the monitor thanks to an extraordinary humor that pervades all aspects of Monkey Island 2: emblem of all this is the scene of the spitting contest, which enters by right in video game history as one of the funniest ever made. A structure that has remained almost unchanged (compared to the classic it is not possible to choose the difficulty, but fortunately the game is the complete one) is also accompanied by an update of the control system, far from the old interface made up of actions and objects placed at the bottom of the screen: to open the inventory now just press the middle mouse button, while the actions on the objects can be performed by right-clicking and choosing from those proposed. Those who find themselves in difficulty with the style of graphic adventures of yesteryear, but above all with the way of thinking behind the puzzles of Monkey Island, have the possibility of counting on two useful tools: the first for highlighting on the screen the elements with which to interact and the second to have useful ~helpers~ to move forward without getting stuck, in spite of the (good?) times when you had to wait for the current solution to come out in your favorite magazine. New with style The design studied by the developers further improves the one seen in the remake of the first chapter, enriching the details of the characters and their animations, thus completing the excellent work done a year ago. The old graphic is obviously always the same: it will hardly be appreciated by newcomers but nostalgics will equally certainly love the possibility of quickly passing from the new to the old, where fortunately this time it is possible to enjoy the speech without therefore losing the dubbing work. To greatly enrich this version we also find the commentary of the three minds behind the original game, ready to accompany the player throughout the adventure explaining how such a masterpiece could come to life, obviously with the humor that distinguishes Monkey Island. Switching between old and new also means doing the same for the music that accompanies the game: while the old MIDIs are always available in the classic version, for the new one the work done was more than good, even if the transitions of the old iMUSE ( system designed to accompany the passages between the various environments of the game through music) paradoxically make their absence felt. Guybrush in your pocket (or backpack) With the arrival of the iPad, the graphic adventures on App Sthours have found particularly fertile ground, and it is no coincidence that The Secret of Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge is in fact available on the App Store in the double edition iPhone/iPod Touch (at 5.99 euros) and iPad (7.99 euros). The differences tip the balance decisively towards the tablet version, both simply for the greater precision of the control, and for the high definition graphics accompanied by the audio commentary of the game creators. More generally, however, there have been clear improvements in the interface compared to the release of the first chapter, which therefore contribute to making Monkey Island 2 a more than recommended purchase even on Apple devices.
