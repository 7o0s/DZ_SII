{"name": "UNO (iPhone)", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/uno-iphone.html", "text": "First of all, let's take a brief excursus on the rules behind UNO. The aim of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your deck before your opponents, by placing them in turn on a pile placed in the center of the table: to do this, one of your cards must have the same color or the same number of the one at the top of the pile. There are also special cards, which can allow you to skip the next player's turn, change the color of the card on the table, and so on. When you are left with only one card in your hand, you must say the word ~UNO~ to let everyone know that you are one step away from the end of the game. As is evident, the mechanics are extremely simple, but this does not necessarily mean that bringing them to the iPhone touchscreen is a small feat: Gameloft is well aware of it, which has also undertaken to make this incarnation as immediate as possible, with definitely positive results. The game screen shows the cards in your possession lined up in the lower part of the display, and it is sufficient to slide your finger to highlight one and perform a quick double-tap to select which one to put on the table: a system that works fairly well, even if occasionally there is some delay in translating one's movement into action. The single player part of UNO is necessarily quite limited, despite the three difficulty levels and some customization options, but it is a task that you have to face if you want to unlock the initially unavailable trophies and profile pictures. However, the Gameloft product redeems itself big on the multiplayer front, allowing you to compete against four other human players in local, wireless and online matches. In the first two cases, all you need to do is simply pass the iPhone from hand to the user who has the turn or connect with other friends equipped with the same device and a copy of the game. The online environment is instead even more stimulating, thanks to the excellent interface and the presence of global scoreboards that indicate our position in the ranking compared to other users from all over the world. Summing up, it can be said that the ~classic~ version of UNO is still ideal for games with friends, but the iPhone incarnation obviously offers something extra thanks to the possibility of challenging thousands of players via wi-fi -fi. On the technical front there isn't much to say, being a card game: the graphics are clean and colorful enough, without useless frills to weigh it down, while the sound is not invasive (and in any case it is allowed to play by listening to music from your own library iTunes).
