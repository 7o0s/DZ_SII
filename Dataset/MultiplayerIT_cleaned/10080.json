As all clowns really are, unless they're of the psychopathic and robber type, in which case they're having a blast, everyone likes them, and they can attract the attention of batmen. Sadwick, on the other hand, is not only depressed and disconsolate, but no one believes in him, so that the cycle of discouragement feeds on itself. His life is limited to the activities of a bankrupt circus, between the orders of his brother Ben and the useless rantings of his grandfather who is now too advanced in years to be decisive. However, our arrival in his life coincides with the beginning of a vision-like dream, which warns of an impending Apocalypse, of which this blue acrobat is supposed to be the cause. From this premise, a fairy-tale adventure with twilight, epic and melancholy tones begins. In fact, Sadwick, accompanied by a green worm with an eternal stupid smile, has decided to try to influence fate and become the fulcrum of universal salvation despite himself. In his own way of course, without exalting tones and persecuted by a twentieth-century nihilism. Lazy contemplation of the end Initially The Whispered World can give the impression of being a light-hearted adventure, with backdrops drawing from a vivid color palette. In reality, after less than an hour, a feeling of imminence is perceived; something inexorable must happen, like death, which waits on the horizon of life, even when it is so distant as to seem unreal. The mood of adventure settles on these dark shades, and he no longer distances himself from them. Humor therefore becomes the decompression chamber of anguish. In fact, some dialogues seem to have been designed specifically to give the player a breather, such as the brilliant encounter with the two talking stones. These are light moments that don't break the pact of seriousness that the game establishes with the user right from the start. No jokes over the top or out of context; nothing that would make a character or situation look ridiculous or crass. In this balance between sunny moments and nostalgic resignation of the inhabitants of the world, the allegorical power of The Whispered World emerges. The story as a whole is divided into four acts, each of which takes us one step further and further away from the starting point, in a crescendo of pathos and complexity of the puzzles. From this point of view, all the mechanics are those that you might find in a point and click adventure fifteen years ago. The only differences are the possibility of identifying the hot-spots in one fell swoop by pressing a button (innovation of recent years), and the role of the ever-happy earthworm that accompanies you: this cute invertebrate can in fact inflate and deflate at will and even turn in a living match, thus offering further possibilities for interaction. The puzzles are fairly difficult compared to your average adventure, but you won't be faced with sudden spikes in complexity, the kind that stall for two days in one spot. In any case there are at least a dozen puzzles that require a little more thinking to solve. On the path a few stones too many The Whispered World's weaknesses are also apparent right off the bat. The first is undoubtedly the dubbing. Sadwick speaks in a slurred, slurred voice that is initially unbearable. Fortunately, as the hours go by, the ear gets used to it and tends not to notice it anymore. On first listen though, the effect is daunting. The same goes for the character animations, which could have been brilliant if they'd only gotten to a decent level of smoothness. It is clear that this depends on a budget and timing issue, because the ability of the people who worked on it is evident. Another defect, however, is structural: throughout the story a solid bond is never established with any of the few characters present (just think that of a whole circus company there are only Sadwick's brother and grandfather). The world presents itself as a succession of splendid but lifeless and organic screens. We proceed without leaving anything behind, and there are moments in which we seem to be suspended waiting for the story to get going again and for someone to notice us. In any case, the general solidity and coherence of the style with which this fairy tale is narrated make it an exciting and thick title. It is also entirely subtitled in Italian.", "date": "2010-04-13", "grade": "8.0"}
