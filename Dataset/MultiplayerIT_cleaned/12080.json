{"name": "Skate Attack - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/skate-attack-recensione.html", "text": "Too bad for the AI of the enemies managed by the CPU, certainly not the best, if we exclude the bosses, better calibrated in this sense. And for the presence, in most of the missions, of an annoying coutdown to mark the time within which to carry out one's actions. It is interesting to point out how in the game you are not limited only to constant challenges with your opponents, but you can move around the city perhaps using a gadget and a strange green ray which, by slowing down the flow of time, will allow the protagonist to hook up to vehicles or to the Drones, the flying robots that populate the area, to go around or throw them against other vehicles or buildings if a certain destructive fury explodes in the video gamer. Also available is a decent multiplayer mode for more than four players. To confirm that Skate Attack doesn't want to take itself seriously, we have a stylistically cartoonish graphic sector, in the sense that scenarios, environments in general and characters have a look very similar to that of animated toys. But on the other hand, it appears in line with the whole concept. However, we cannot fail to notice a certain approximation in the creation of the scenarios, visually very colorful, very bright, but technically poor, not very detailed. Thankfully the characters are a tad better done. The sound sector, on the other hand, disappoints enough, resulting musically repetitive at times and with general effects to be reviewed. Conclusions Skate Attack can be succinctly defined as the simplistic version of Tony Hawk, a sort of younger brother and with a more ironic but also technically scruffy, not in-depth look. In itself, from a gameplay point of view, the game is strange: sometimes it manages to reach some points of fun, others stress the gamer with situations bordering on the impossible due to certain aspects (countdown, low enemy AI) ill suited to the context. It also seems to lack that ~I don't know what~ that makes it ~take off~, distinguish from the crowd. Therefore, even with some reservations, without rejecting it (it would be unfair, all in all it has pleasant ideas) Skate Attack we feel like recommending it exclusively to all fans of this discipline and especially to those looking for a ~comic~ alternative to the aforementioned Tony Hawk . Pro: The idea of combining the skater-game with the fighting game is nice. Decent multiplayer mode. Graphically nice. Cons: AI to be reviewed. Poorly calibrated difficulty. Skateboard games have always been considered niche products in Italy, as this extremely fun sport does not boast vast numbers of admirers in our area. Lately, however, the software houses are trying to change the trend and to propose new and different products from the multi-acclaimed Tony Hawk. It is the case of Midas and this Skate Attack. Skate Attack probably has one of the most absurd plots (yes, because there is a plot...) in the history of video games (but on the other hand the developers themselves have repeatedly stated that they want to give an ironic touch to the game): in a futuristic city a certain Virus, the ~crazy mascot of a casino~, came to life by literally ~coming out~ of an advertising billboard that represented him, and kidnapped the playmate of the protagonist of the videogame, another skater... Through various levels, challenges and actions it will therefore be necessary to remedy the situation and defeat Virus. Once you really start playing, you can play one of two characters available for selection (four others are unlockable, however). After an initial and in-depth training tutorial, we enter the heart of the adventure and our virtual alter ego will be able to get busy on the streets of the city. In fact, the gameplay of Skate Attack consists of phases in which, by completing the missions assigned to us by Virus' minions, we must try our hand at the canonical challenges with stunts through which to load the adrenaline bar by boosting for a certain amount of time time the Pg's athletic abilities through combos and related scores, and in a series of fights with skate shots. With 30 plus ~moves~, Skate Attack stands out for its completeness with its single lip, grind, kick, manual and grind tricks.", "date": "2007-08-03", "grade": null}
