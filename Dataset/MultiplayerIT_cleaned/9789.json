It is, however, a project divided into three parts, each consisting of five episodes: the first two are already available on the PlayStation Store for PS5 and PS4, the third will only arrive on December 3 and will conclude an original plot that certainly has elements of interest for the many Gundam fans. Too bad the charm of the game stops there. History Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy, the protagonist Alma Universal Century, year 0079: the young fighter Alma reaches the headquarters of the Noisy Fairy division to join the secret unit commanded by Killy Garrett, set up by the Principality of Zeon to counter any attempted invasion by the forces of the Federation Terrestrial. It is an all-female team, also made up of the shrewd and resolute Helena and the shy but brilliant Mia. During the first mission, the debutant Alma immediately shines thanks to her surprising skills and is named leader of the team, with good peace of her companions. After which the story comes alive, and in the course of fifteen chapters it tells the growth of the girls, the progressive acquisition of greater security and the consolidation of the unit, which stands out on the battlefield for the important results obtained. Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy, Helena and Mia As mentioned at the beginning, the structure of Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy is practically that of an anime: each chapter has an opening theme and even a recap of what happened previously, and there are animated sequences that serve as an introduction for then leave room for an introspective phase in pure Japanese style, which serves to characterize and add depth to the protagonists. Punctually preceded by a briefing, the missions themselves see the presence of abundant cutscenes that illustrate what happens from time to time and the inevitable ~twists~ at the end of each single assignment, which in fact is thus divided into two distinct phases: when it seems that Alma, Helena and Mia have destroyed all the enemy troops, unexpected reinforcements arrive and the situation becomes more complicated. Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy, the three protagonists aboard their respective Zaku As interesting as it is, the plot of the game is difficult to follow due to the dialogues in Japanese and the subtitles available only in English, which inevitably make it difficult to scroll through large amounts of text; unless you were really impressed by the all-female approach of the adventure and by the fact that in this case you militate among the ranks of the Principality of Zeon, often and willingly fighting the mobile suits of the Earth Federation. Another reason to desist and inevitably skip the many sequences, however, lies in the fact that they are supported by a really dated technical realization: the various Zakus are made discreetly, but in general the visual sector is worthy of a low-budget game for PlayStation 3, so let's talk of two generations old graphics, which are hard to involve. Gameplay Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy, Mia's Zaku during a mission If you've read our Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2 review, you already know what to expect from Code Fairy's gameplay, which almost feels like a single player tutorial to complete before moving on to the free-to-play title. However, the important element of customizations, components and unlockable weapons must be removed from the equation in order to create the perfect mobile suit for your needs. None of this: we will have very few variations available and only in the context of a linear progression. After that, once on the battlefield the game behaves like a sort of World of Tanks with robots. During the cutscenes the three Zakus that make up the Noisy Fairy team move with agility, using the thrusters to slide quickly on the ground and produce interesting attack maneuvers, but in-game the heaviness and cumbersomeness of the controls are really daunting and become soon a big limitation. Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy, a Zaku attacks with sword Each weapon in the equipment requires long reload times, but it is absurd that even swords or axes cannot be used freely.ent, demanding long seconds of pause between one blow and the next. It goes without saying that the only possible strategy is therefore that of alternating the various instruments on the fly, passing for example from the assault rifle to the built-in machine guns, from the sniper rifle to the gunshot, all in order not to remain helpless in front of the enemy in waiting for the reload. Likewise, the elements of the scenario play a fundamental role during the battles: given the very low mobility of the Zaku we control, which can indeed sprint and roll to avoid blows but on the basis of a stamina indicator that immediately runs out, you often have to take cover behind an obstacle so as not to be riddled and frequently implement a ~hit and run~ style approach, trying to stay away from your opponents. Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy, Zaku squad prepare for battle Unfortunately the simulation intentions of the developers are not supported by adequate feedback of the attacks, which are quite inconsistent. Furthermore, some weapons, such as the bazooka for example, have very little reason to exist given their slowness and imprecision, as well as a limited power after all: get rid of them as soon as the game allows you to replace it with a rifle. Then there are our two companions, who move independently but can follow some of the indications we give them, such as the order to hit the same target, to follow us, to maintain the position or to attack indiscriminately. In case one of the two is defeated, after a while she will be able to return to the battlefield, while the same will not happen to us: it will be game over and we will have to repeat the mission all over again. There is undoubtedly a certain strategic depth in the gameplay of Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2, but it's all far too cumbersome and poorly implemented for the experience to be really fun. For example, there are points on the map that we can conquer to create repair stations, but to do so we will have to go out with the pilot and then return: an action for its own sake, completely superfluous. The mobility of the robots is so limited and imprecise that one ends up setting aside actions such as the jump, which is very slow, or the frontal charge, which most of the time fails, trying to make do with what remains of the repertoire and trying to exploit the special abilities of the three protagonists in the moment Right. Finally, let's spread a pitiful veil on the artificial intelligence of the enemies, really basic, and on the boss fights that see us face large warships which however remain stationary to absorb bullets. Graphics and sound Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy, the graphics of the dialogues between the missions are really mediocre We found the end credits song of Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy very nice, which can be listened to at the end of each of the three packs but which cannot be skipped. In general, the music and Japanese dubbing of the game are enjoyable, while the effects appear quite mediocre and certainly do not earn from being reproduced also by the DualSense controller speaker, indeed this feature only adds ~plasticity~ to the sounds. As for the graphics, there are highs but above all lows, as we said. The anime sequences are nice, if far from spectacular, and the cutscenes featuring the Zakus are decent, while the in-game graphics between missions are more or less that of a Nintendo DS for geometry and animation. Once they take to the field, the robots are not bad but all around there is a disheartening desolation made up of empty, dull landscapes, devoid of any interaction, absolutely generic. Does the game start in Japanese? Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy boasts two generations old graphics and woody, slow and frustrating gameplay, but it also has flaws. For example, it could happen that the game starts completely in Japanese, therefore not only in the dialogues but also in the texts on the screen, including the menus. In this way it is unusable, so how do you put things back while waiting for a patch? From the main menu, press Start, then go to the fourth item to enter the options: at that point select the fourth item for the text language, then from the second item choose the second option, press Circle and confirm with Cross.", "date": "2021-11-21", "grade": "5.0"}
