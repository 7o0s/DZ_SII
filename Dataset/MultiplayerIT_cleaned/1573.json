{"name": "Pokmon Ruby & Sapphire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-ruby-sapphire-2.html", "text": "Water and fire After letting us explore the regions of Indigo and Johto far and wide, this time Nintendo throws us into the small continent of Hoenn. Once again we put ourselves in the shoes of a rookie Pokmon trainer (whose gender can be chosen, like in Crystal) who, as soon as he moved to the new city, near which his father runs a gym, almost by chance runs into Professor Birch, a distinguished scholar taken aback by a rather aggressive Poochyena. To save the Professor, we will have to choose a Pokmon from three randomly dropped Pokballs on the ground and that will become our starting Pokmon. Shortly thereafter, we will meet Professor Birch's nephew (or niece, depending on the gender chosen at the beginning) who will represent our rival for the rest of the adventure (although, unlike the previous versions where the rival was arrogant and obnoxious, this time we will find ourselves in front of a precious friend) and finally we will go on an adventure. An adventure also full of surprises and unexpected events, when our alter-ego will be involved in the war between two criminal gangs, Team Aqua and Team Magma: depending on the version chosen, we will find ourselves against one of the two factions and allied with the other so that, for example, in Sapphire our rival will be Team Aqua, intent on conquering a sacred sphere that would allow them to control the legendary Kyogre and submerge the world while, in Ruby, Team Magma will try to take possession of Groudon to desertify it. The plot, however simple and linear, presents a greater variety compared to the previous episodes and towards the end of the game it even takes on epic contours, when we will have to thwart the awakening of Kyogre or Groudon at the last moment by fighting against them. In any case, the script is just a pretext to force the player to face the journey to Hoenn following a certain order in the exploration, which if in the eyes of a layman it may appear almost random, to those of a seasoned player it appears as logical and natural. It's the beauty of Pokmon, after all: older players will find themselves at home, even though even the hemisphere has changed! Let's go by the numbers... The numbers of the Pokemon series really make an impression. Here are some. Brrrr.... At the end of March 2003, more than 100 million Pokmon games were sold worldwide. Since the game's introduction in 1999, over 25 million Pokmon games have been sold in Europe up to March 2003. The Pokemon trade has generated more than $15 billion to date. In the first five months of marketing in Japan, more than seven million Pokmon Gold & Silver were sold. At the end of March 2003, 4.4 million copies of Pokmon Ruby & Sapphire were sold in Japan. 2.2 million copies sold in the States. To date, more than 9.8 billion Pokemon card game cards have been sold. Since the arrival of Pokmon, about one million Pokmon games have been sold in the US every month. Pokmon The Movie grossed $50 million in its first week in the United States. An absolute record for a cartoon. The overall development for first Pokemon lasted a full six years. The game was released in Japan in 1995. The development of Pokmon Ruby & Sapphire took two years of work. Forty Game Freaks plus a further 100 support people participated in the development. evolution Right from the start, the casual player who knows Pokmon briefly may have the impression of being faced with the usual play structure, slightly varied in the setting and use of the menus or Pokmon themselves. Nothing more wrong: the changes in Pokmon Ruby / Sapphire, compared to the past, are there. Here's if there are. On a second analysis, the first thing that catches the player's eye is the considerable managerial complexity of the new Pokmon: if already in Silver/Gold/Crystal we had become acquainted with some ~bi-elemental~ Pokmon, characterized, that is, by the combination of two elemental characteristics, to be precise, this time we are faced with a PokDex decidedly monopolized by these mixed creatures. Already Torchic, the fire Pokmon selectable at the beginning of the adventure, presents in its first evolution, Combusken, the combination of Fire and Fighting elements, as well as Mudkip and Treecko, as well as the vast majority of Pokmon available in Ruby / Sapphire. This new elemental distribution forces the elderly player to almost completely review his old game strategies and the layman to experiment, in the first few hours of the game, with the best possible combinations for creating a balanced team without real game points.boli, which at this point is easier said than done. Another new and important characteristic of Ruby/Sapphire's Pokmon is represented by their character and the way we treat them, making them fight or leaving them too much on the bench: an aggressive Pokmon will tend to weaken if little used, for example, and this involves greater tactical reflection on the groups we intend to create. The brand new ~Berry Blending~ is also linked to the idea of the character: basically, around the world of Hoenn we can cultivate Berries, berries with various powers which, once transformed into candies through a special mini-game, will increase Pokmon stats; this nutritional system obliges the player not only to cultivate the Berries and feed them to their own Pokmon, but also to carefully check the compatibility between a certain type of Berry and the Pokmon that one is about to feed, in order to avoid unpleasant alterations of its characteristics. The latter, among other things, are the basis of the unpublished Contests, challenges that engage Pokmon on a sort of stage: each Pokmon's special move has a certain effect on the audience, and the player must carefully choose which attacks to use and at what moment, so as to be able to disadvantage the challengers and conquer the precious medals that will increase even more his prestige and the power of the Pokmon. For the rest, the Pokmon game system has remained almost unchanged: you travel far and wide, doing a lot of backtracking (fortunately equipped, this time, with a running shoe or two types of bicycle) and always experimenting new paths, solving simple tasks and, of course, catching the various Pokmon he comes across along the way, some exclusive to each version. Even the fights have remained almost unchanged, maintaining the classic ~scissors-rock-paper~ formula and the possibility, introduced in Silver and Gold, of assigning each Pokmon an object with the most disparate powers. However, the brand new battles in pairs deserve a special mention, a divertissement that engages two Pokmon at a time against an opposing pair, taking advantage of an attack assignment system particularly dear to the JRPG genre: the clashes between pairs of Pokmon turn out to be extremely fun and various, even allowing you to perform particular combinations of attacks if the two Pokmon are similar (as in the case of Plusle and Minun), but they are really too few to be considered a main feature of this version. Luckily, Nintendo has already announced that it wants to put the emphasis on this experimental battle system, and we can only hope that, from the next episode, we find ourselves controlling multiple Pokmon at the same time Revolution As stated in the incipit of the article, Pokmon Ruby / Sapphire is a game that does not place the emphasis on technical implementation, however presenting a respectable one. We are not dealing with a programming miracle, such as that represented by Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age, but in general the visual aspect of Pokmon is pleasant and, ultimately, very good. The sprites on the map are simple and barely animated, and on the other hand they are not the fulcrum of the game, but the environments that are visited during the course of the game always have a high level of detail and variety and a rich and colorful color palette. good taste: it ranges from forests to mountains, from caves to cities, always respecting a solution of continuity that makes the map of Hoenn a real microworld. Deserve the mention, among other things, decidedly amazing graphic effects such as the distortion of the reflection of the sprites on the mirrors of water or the pouring rain or the sandstorms, which add a particularly spectacular touch to the visual rendering. The same cannot be said for the combat phases: although the Pokmon sprites are of considerable size and well colored and detailed, they totally lack animations of any kind, representing a step backwards compared to the timid proposal made in Crystal in this area. Nothing to say, however, on the visual rendering of the special attacks which ranges from mediocre to excellent. The menus are also very well thought out which, in addition to presenting a flood of very useful options (such as the possibility of tracking down the challenged coaches to give them a rematch), present a certain visual originality. As far as the sound aspect is concerned, however, we are faced with inspired but not particularly high quality songs and jingles, never annoying but not transcendental either, despite the fact that some of them we find ourselves whistling themalmost without realizing it while they go about their daily chores. And if, in their simplicity, some jingles have this effect, everything can be said except that they don't leave their mark... Comment Is Pokmon Ruby/Sapphire a good game? Was the wait worth it? Is he a worthy heir to the historic first episodes? Let's dispel all doubts: the answer to every question is yes. With some reservations though. Ruby/Sapphire is basically a small GBA masterpiece, an absolute must for all Pokmon lovers and a very pleasant, deep and satisfying gaming experience for all those looking for healthy entertainment and, from this point of view, waiting has been amply repaid. However, although it takes the place of the prequels very well, Ruby / Sapphire stands at least a span and a half below Silver / Gold and Crystal for various reasons, especially for the most serious: the commercial aspect. Let's face it, despite the innovations made to some purely playful aspects Pokmon Ruby / Sapphire presents a gameplay that is still too similar to the originals, almost anchored to a tradition that obscures weak steps forward that ultimately proved to be far more than convincing, as in the case of Pokmon Contest, unfortunately limited to experienced and perfectionist users, or team fights, present in a very small number. On the other hand, the step backwards made compared to Silver/Gold/Crystal is inexplicable: if in those versions it was possible to explore two continents to catch all 252 Pokmon present, in this Ruby/Sapphire this is only virtually possible; the Pokmon actually present in the cartridge are only 181 (moreover easily catchable), some borrowed from the old editions, others brand new (with a sometimes uncertain, sometimes excellent design, unfortunately all too similar to Bandai's Digimon), but through special tricks it is possible peer into the code and unbelievably find data on all 353 Pokmon created by Nintendo. How is it possible? Mystery. How mysterious is Nintendo's decision to eliminate perhaps the most ingenious idea that characterized Silver/Gold/Crystal, or rather the alternation of day and night and the variation of the days of the week. In short, Ruby / Sapphire is a rather contradictory episode for the Pokmon series, which perhaps will be expanded by the introduction of some ~expansion~ or add-on, such as Pokmon Box: until then, the advice remains to get this little gem of programming which, although bending to the laws of merchandising, demonstrates that the fun is still unclassifiable if the work done behind it is done very well. Pros: It's always Pokmon Fun, deep and very long-lived Excellent technical realization Cons: In some ways a step backwards compared to Silver / Gold Hackneyed game mechanisms and few innovations It's Pokmon: you either love it or hate it In these days we have led you by the hand into the magical world created by Satoshi Iwajiri and Game Freaks, illustrating the history of Pocket Monsters from its origins to today, through a summary analysis of the media phenomena that have made them protagonists of the last five years throughout the world. merchandising world. But to ~understand~ Pokmon Ruby/Sapphire, the first new-generation version of Pokmon, traditionally released for the Gameboy Advance, it is necessary to do a little reflection. In a market projected more and more towards the search for the sensational, especially at a technical level, with millions of polygons moving on the screens while playing with home consoles and increasingly elaborate audiovisual effects, Pokmon is almost the emblem of essence of the video game, which transcends the technical limits of a console, imbuing every moment lived through it with fun. So, in other words, Pokmon needs a certain open-mindedness to be fully enjoyed, it needs a user who doesn't pay attention to amazing special effects but to the fulcrum of the game, who knows how to understand it and be satisfied by it. And yet, at the same time, Ruby/Sapphire proves to be a bit of an antithesis of the concept that generated it, as it amply demonstrates how, in the end, the fulcrum of the game, what triggers the fun, is set aside by the programmers, looking for an easy income through a well-known and widely commercial logo. Ultimately, Pokmon Ruby/Sapphire... how is that?", "date": "2003-07-25", "grade": null}
