Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. It would be easy to compare the mechanics of Smash Hit to those of traditional third-person endless runs, but in reality the points in common between the title developed by Mediocre and the various Temple Runs and Subway Surfers are limited to the survival connotation of an experience that measures progression in meters and which challenges us, in each game, to go further. Available for free on the App Store and Google Play, with the possibility, however, of unlocking a ~premium~ version that memorizes the checkpoints and allows us to resume from there after the game over, at a price of 1.79 euros, the game catapults us into a a sort of first-person journey inside a world made of crystals, proceeding from one stage to another while shapes and colors change around us, tracing the lines of a sometimes psychedelic vision, which is further strengthened by an accompaniment music in dubstep style. In Smash Hit we are projected forward, gradually faster, and our goal is to clear the path to avoid harmful collisions, throwing metal spheres against the obstacles that stand in front of us and, at the same time, against crystals which go to multiply our ~ammunition~. The balls also act as vital energy, so when they run out, our stint ends too. Smash Hit is a simple but terribly stylish action game, a nice first person atmosphere Seven years of bad luck The control system adopted by the developers is extremely simple and straightforward, and is based solely on the use of the touch screen. Where the movement of the camera is automatic, as mentioned, our task is to hit the crystals that give us new balls and destroy the obstacles, also made of glass, which eventually block our way, appearing through various different mechanisms, which in more advanced stages also become quite elaborate and complex to neutralize. A touch on the screen translates into the launch of a sphere, which however proceeds in an ~inertial~ manner, drawing a parabola which evidently obeys precise physical laws and implies a rapid calculation of times and distances so that the shot is successful and does not end wasted. This kind of attention permeates the Smash Hit experience at all times, since even the crystals break following realistic and detailed dynamics, while emitting very convincing sound effects. Every ten ~centers~, our launch doubles and we can therefore throw two spheres at a time while consuming only one, all up to quadrupling our firepower. A particular green bonus also allows us to enter a special mode, which lasts a few seconds, in which it is enough to draw lines on the touch screen for lots of balls to be launched, but without affecting the reserves. After a few games it becomes quite clear what is the best strategy to get as far as possible, what are the ideal distances to make throws and how we should approach certain obstacles, for example the large glass plates that we can break selectively , creating a ~passage~ so as not to waste too much ammo. The mechanisms put in place are therefore very simple, but the implementation is excellent and it is certainly worth downloading.", "date": "2014-03-15", "grade": "8.0"}
