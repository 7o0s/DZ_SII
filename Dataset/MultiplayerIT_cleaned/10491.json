It is a mix of code, graphics and sound that gives the player the feeling of really hitting someone, while his alter ego on the screen distributes sganassoni left and right. The character throws a punch, the punch lands, there is a sort of ~slow down~ as the two figures hover, then an equalized sound effect plays so that it jumps to your ear. The old Final Fight in the arcade was an extraordinary example of this, which literally made you enjoy hitting those virtual mauls, inflicting lightning-fast bursts of blows on the biggest and baddest opponents. It was played not so much to see if in the end the huge Haggar would have embraced his daughter again, but for the catharsis that came from such sensations. Twenty years later, Spyborgs offers very similar mechanics on the console from which you would least expect it: the sensation of impact is definitely not that of the golden age, but the clear references to Captain Commando (another famous Capcom-branded scrolling fighting game ), the anything but ~casual~ look and the type of structure suggest a ~revival~ operation as interesting for nostalgics as for last-minute gamers. violence! Interspersed with animated sequences whose style is very reminiscent of some cartoons made in the USA, the ~fighting game~ phase is clearly central in Spyborgs, which does not get lost in chatter or puzzles but only asks us to beat our hands all the time and without stopping . There are five levels of difficulty to choose from, and it must be said that even the intermediate one in some phases creates great difficulties and forces us to start the stages over and over again, until we get over the most problematic situations. We can choose our character from the three available: Stinger, a cyborg in whose right arm is hidden an energy cannon, balanced and effective even from a distance; Bouncer, a childlike robot capable of inflicting devastating blows; Clandestino, an agile and fast ninja but a little too ~soft~ in offensive maneuvers. There are five large areas to clear, each divided into a variable number of stages, and along the way there are many objects to be destroyed to obtain energy crystals: depending on the color, they can fill up our energy bar (blue) or that of the special move (orange), increase the number of credits to spend on upgrades (red) or make us momentarily invincible (green). Very often we will also find invisible boxes, which must be revealed by pointing them on the screen with the infrared pointer of the Wii-mote and pressing A, then shaking the controller vertically. The same expedient is used not only to make useful devices appear to continue in the stages, but also to activate dangerous explosive objects, make certain hidden enemies visible, destroy assault turrets, etc. In addition to the main game mode, Spyborgs gives us the possibility of accessing an arena to face fifty waves of increasingly dangerous enemies, in a sort of ~survival~ that is really difficult to complete. You can also replay already completed stages. Furthermore, once the game is over, we can start it all over again, perhaps at a higher difficulty level, keeping the upgrades already acquired. The highest difficulty level must be unlocked, and its completion probably starts new animated sequences for the real conclusion of the story. Finally, the developers had fun inserting numerous ~achievements~ in the style of Xbox 360 and PS3, obtainable by completing certain objectives. Is it him or is it not him? Although Spyborgs officially has nothing to do with Captain Commando, the similarities between the main characters of the two scrolling fighting games are numerous: both blond with crew cut, dark glasses and a bionic arm. If desired, Bouncer also recalls a character from Captain Commando, or Baby Commando, a bizarre baby who drives a powerful robot-wrestler. Given the presence of Capcom as the producer of the game, one wonders why they didn't think of creating an official remake of that classic from the 90s... You have three seconds left to live The control system sees the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination used in the most classic way. So with the analog stick we move the character, with A we can jump, with Z we activate the parry or trigger the special move when possible, with B we carry out the main attack and with C the secondary one: the two buttons must be combined to obtain combos as spectacular as effective. At termAt the end of each stage we are awarded a total of credits that we can use to buy upgrades that increase vital energy, the amount of damage we can inflict, the effectiveness of the special move and the number of executable combos. At the end of the day, there aren't many maneuvers that Stinger, Bouncer and Clandestino can perform, so you end up repeating the same sequences over and over again, alternating them with the important parry so as not to lose precious energy. Probably the most serious thing is the absolute lack of grips, which have always made the difference in scrolling fighting games, as well as of any vehicle or usable device along the way: there are no robots or vehicles that we can control. On the other hand, we must admit that an excellent job has been done as regards the number and types of opponents we will have to deal with: although often they are simple ~alternatives~, each enemy has a precise modus operandi and weaknesses which must be exploited in order to survive the most complicated situations, when numerical inferiority makes itself felt more than necessary and we are not even given time to breathe. Our team is made up of two of the three available characters, and clearly there is a multiplayer mode to be able to play as a couple with a friend: just turn on the second Wii-mote. Too bad you can't play in three at the same time, and it's also a shame that the possibility of including online multiplayer has not been taken into consideration in order to give everyone the opportunity to play as a team. The interesting thing, however, is that in the single-player game the second character is controlled by the AI, but it is possible to switch from one to the other at any time by pressing the ~+~ key: a useful function especially when we want to make the best use of super moves. The aesthetics of mallet The technical realization of the game is not particularly sophisticated nor does it show who knows what style, but it lends itself well to the development of the action. The characters are pretty stereotypical and nondescript, but from the point of view of the enemies, yes notices a certain effort to look for variety and the unusual. The ~goblins~ may not be beautiful to look at, but all the opponents we will face have ~layers~ that fall away when we hit them, trying to give the best idea of the damage suffered. The ~feeling of impact~ mentioned at the beginning is not very evident and sometimes it ~slips~ a bit, but in the end you play well and you practically never hit the wrong target (except when firing with the Stinger cannon, but oh well). It's just a pity that the general fluidity of the graphics leads to noticeable slowdowns when the situation gets too crowded. As for the locations, let's just say that the clichs associated with scrolling fighting games have all been respected: we have the factories, the train in motion, the inevitable elevator that fills up with enemies at every stop, the cross-sections of the city and so on . The characters speak in English (subtitled in Italian) and the level of acting is discreet, but without a doubt better effects and music have been done, both excellent and engaging.", "date": "2009-10-06", "grade": "7.0"}
