Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent. From Doodle Jump onwards, there are now so many action games on the App Store in which you simply have to jump from one platform to another, vertically, with the aim of reaching the point as high as possible in a single match. There are numerous products that simply reiterate this formula, but there are also some that have managed to differentiate themselves just enough to enter the hearts of enthusiasts. This is the case of Mega Jump, which since its original publication has been enriched in various ways, through continuous updates, and stands today as a reference title among free applications. The merit of so much success is undoubtedly due to the irresistible gameplay of the game developed by Get Set Games, but also to a structure that goes beyond the limits of the classic ~survival~ approach, of the ~single game~ that does not provide stimuli beyond the achievement of a new record, and resorts to different scenarios and worlds in terms of appearance and characteristics, which must be unlocked as you get points. In short, reaching an ever higher position in the stage is not an end in itself, because at a certain point you cross the line between one level and another, you go ~beyond~ and things change , with even more complex challenges to overcome in order to resist. The protagonist of Mega Jump is a funny little red monster with big frog eyes, which emits nice cries every time it comes into contact with a bonus capable of making it jump upwards. Within the levels there are many objects that can produce such an effect and help us cover large distances in a matter of moments, but in principle the mechanics require our character to jump by touching coins suspended in the air or , at some point, some platforms. The coins are collected and can be spent on the purchase of temporary upgrades and therefore to increase the chances of reaching so high as to unlock a new scenario, but above all it is the amount of stages and areas available that make the difference in the long term. since it is not simply the colors or textures in the background that change, but also the position and quantity of coins, as well as the possible presence of traps. If we miss a jump and fall, it will be game over, this doesn't change compared to other products of the same genre, but the motivations that drive us to refine the technique and improve the precision of the movements change. The control system is also of the traditional type and is based solely on the accelerometer, therefore the ~bounce~ on coins and objects is automatic, but moving from one side of the screen to the other occurs by tilting the device. The response to requests is precise and it is certainly one of the most refined aspects of this production, improved through the various updates. The little monster can even pop out from the other side of the screen, a maneuver that comes in handy when alternating rows of coins at the ends of the level. The action is assisted by a technical sector decidedly up to the situation, with an excellent design, a very colorful style and a discreet sound accompaniment.", "date": "2012-03-31", "grade": "8.5"}
