The other chapters of the series, although they have never expired in mediocrity, have brought more variations on the theme than actual improvements: Virtua Tennis 2009 is no exception, if not in the negative. Old Needless to deny it, in recent years the Japanese video game - partially excluding Capcom and Nintendo - has been progressively supplanted by the Western one: not only in the genres historically in the hands of American software houses, but also, and more surprisingly, in some of those shaped by nipponese. The gap between Konami's football simulations and those of all the other houses (for example), which appeared unbridgeable for the beauty of fifteen years, has been reset and overturned in a very short period of time. As a simulation Virtua Tennis had already been deprived of authority years ago by Top Spin, as an arcade, on the other hand, it was undermined recently by Wii Sports tennis, which, without exaggeration, was the Pong of this beginning of the century: SEGA had the big opportunity, through the Wiimote and, above all, the MotionPlus, to recover at least one of the two ~crowns~, the one relating to the best tennis simulation in circulation. The opponent, to stay on topic, is not so much Top Spin, but the equally western Grand Slam Tennis. Left Handed For a left-handed player, playing with Wiimote and Nunchuk is a sort of dilemma: should you hold the Nunchuk or the Wiimote with your right hand? Personally I belong to the category, and I have chosen the first hypothesis; however, playing Grand Slam Tennis online, I only found one other ~virtual~ southpaw, so it means that many have opted for the latter. Virtua Tennis 2009 does not pose the problem - proving once again that it was designed for a classic pad more than for the Wiimote, let alone for the MotionPlus - and leaves the racket on the tennis player's real hand, not on the player's, creating a annoying effect: left-handed people will see Federer with the racket on the right anyway, right-handed Nadal with the racket on the left anyway. Cross-platform Without commenting on the SEGA choice in commercial terms, which we - at least here - are of little interest to, one cannot help but notice a big, first, fundamental difference between the EA game and Virtua Tennis: if the former was designed for Wii - not only that, it was conceived around MotionPlus - the second was first transplanted to us and then superficially modified to also work with the new Nintendo peripheral. Leaving aside the MotionPlus factor, at least for the moment, it must be noted that, with only the Wiimote, Virtua Tennis works well: the remote control is used exactly as in Wii Sports (although it proves to be less precise), i.e. it is simply used to choose the type of shot (short ball, lob, spin), not directing it, which depends exclusively on the timing with which the ball hits. Yes, you can play both by moving the player through the nunchuk and with the wiimote alone, but it is only in the first case that Virtua Tennis 2009 constitutes a deeper - or rather, complex - experience compared to ~simple~ Nintendo tennis: the variety of rallies increases noticeably, although, as mentioned earlier, lobbing and curling is much more intuitive in Wii Sports. The 2009 edition, after the (further) arcade turn of the third episode, tries, if not to be a simulation, at least to reach a certain balance between the two factors: slower action, less recoveries at the limit, more importance to timing and to placement. The result is a fairly fun game, but still not very realistic and, above all, too cumbersome in the exchanges, both for the frequent slowdowns, and for the imperfect control you have over the direction of the shot: you feel that the mechanics were built for a traditional pad, and only later adapted to the Nintendo Wiimote. This is what happens on the pitch; on the contrary, Virtua Tennis 2009 is better than any other tennis game on Wii, including Grand Slam Tennis. The career mode is long and demanding, usually composed of both tournaments - main and secondary - and fun (but decontextualizing) mini-games, the character editor is quite rich, while the online mode, although not at the levels of the EA one, it's there and it works fairly well: in short, if Virtua Tennis manages to captivate you, there's a lot to play. Plus Grand Slam Tennis is an edgy game, with several shortcomings, but there is no doubt that it has brought the tennis genre into a new world: in the future it will be refined and improved, but it will always have the merit of being the first to have reconciled brilliantly simulation and motion control. Virtua Tennis 2009, for its part, works better than its rival EA if played with only the Wiimote: trifles, because the real SEGA challenge, at least on the Wii, was to compete with Grand Slam Tennis in the new ground inaugurated by MotionPlus. In this field he comes out miserably defeated: if in Grand Slam Tennis the feeling of having an arm inside the game is strong right from the start, here you have to make several shots before realizing the - few - improvements made by the peripheral. The level of interaction does not change, as does the variety of strokes, only the recognition of movements is more precise: the MotionPlus simply serves to refine the basic mechanics, old and designed for a traditional pad, not to distort them. Lobs, short balls, backspin and topspin are made much easier than with the Wiimote alone, but the direction of shots is always calculated based on timing: it came out the same day as EA's production, but it seems to belong to another era.", "date": "2009-07-22", "grade": "6.6"}
