{"name": "F1 Manager", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f1-manager-la-recensione.html", "text": "If it is true that design, technology, strategic choices and the strict adherence to careful planning seem to have somewhat killed the emotion and romance of Formula One, it must be said at least that all these characteristics make it fit brush with management video games. In fact, on this front the maximum automotive discipline has been able to give great satisfaction and therefore it is not surprising the exploitation of the rich official license of the FIA for another title of this type on mobile platforms, or F1 Manager, which we analyze in this review. It is a rather streamlined and simplified version of the more complex games usually found on PCs, a game solution that we have already had the opportunity to appreciate in Motorsport Manager Mobile 2 but which in this case is further modified by the exclusively multiplayer setting one against one (pending the arrival of the next updates) and from the free-to-play mechanics which introduces the inevitable micro-transactions. This last detail is not exactly a good business card for traditional gamers, who perhaps more than other users may be interested in this mobile title, however there are various considerations to be made in this regard. As always in these cases, the game pushes towards in-app purchases in order to be immediately competitive and above all to compress expectations that are otherwise an integral part of the experience, but if you face everything with patience it is possible to obtain rewards in game and simply wait for the times set for the unlocking of the boxes in order not to fall into the trap of compulsive buying. In short, the classic recommendation to take the game in small doses always works, even in this case, even if it must be said that the exclusively multiplayer setting seems to want to push further towards the pay to win trap. There are two in-game currencies, coins which are used to participate in races and to level up drivers and various car components, and banknotes which have a wider use, allowing you to buy consumable power-ups to temporarily enhance the pilots, buy new elements for the car or speed up the opening of the boxes, thus representing the most important currency and consequently more difficult to accumulate and more expensive to buy. Managerial ubiquity Team management includes many aspects, ranging from car composition to driver management. From a mobile game of this type we cannot expect the infinity of options and variables present on more complex simulations, however F1 Manager defends itself quite well as regards the depth of the management elements. The options regarding the car are limited to the possibility of applying or improving the various components (brakes, suspension, engine, spoilers and more), without going into more complex options such as tuning and aerodynamic management. As for the drivers, it is above all about winning them by winning races, assigning them to the first or second car of the team and making them evolve by collecting the corresponding cards, always starting from the boxes that are won after the races. For the rest there is to compete, with the only possibility offered to challenge another player in a direct head-to-head, with the participation of other cars managed by artificial intelligence. Before the race we can choose which type of tire to mount between soft, hard and wet, while during the grand prix the only interactions concern the possibility of calling the riders back to the box to change tyres. Obviously here comes the ability to strategically evaluate the right time to change and what type of tire to use, with petrol which must also be carefully managed during the race, given the impossibility of refueling during the race. For each of the drivers it is possible to set the attitude between fast, medium and slow, other elements to be dosed properly to better manage tire and fuel consumption. During the races, which take place on real Formula One circuits and between real drivers and FIA officially licensed cars, it is possible to follow the performance of the cars by zooming in on the track, with the possibility of appreciating in this way the excellent work carried out by Hutch Games in the reproduction of cars and tracks, or adopting a far more minimalist distanced view from above but which allows greater concentration on the positions, distances and the overall situation of the race.", "date": "2019-05-17", "grade": "6.8"}
