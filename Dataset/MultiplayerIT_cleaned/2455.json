{"name": "F-Zero: Maximum Velocity", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f-zero-maximum-velocity.html", "text": "Playing Wanting to start running we can choose whether to participate in a grand prix, practice, or play multiplayer by connecting up to 4 GBA. Multiplayer is distinguished in the single cartridge mode and in the one cartridge mode for each Game Boy Advance. The difference lies in the fact that with a single cartridge only one track and one car is available, while with one cartridge for each console it is possible to choose from all the available tracks and vehicles (including the unlocked ones). Obviously, the heart of the game is the Grand Prix mode, in which we will be able to participate in three different series of competitions (plus a secret one) of increasing difficulty. In fact, in the first (Pawn) the circuits will be very simple and linear, to become more twisted, complex and demanding in the higher series (Knight and Bishop). The aim of racing is clearly to win and it is important to win all the races in each series if we want to unlock every secret of the game. As expected, along the track you can come across all kinds of obstacles (mined areas, blind curves on an abyss, fraudulent launch ramps, etc.), but also in the classic temporary acceleration arrows and (fortunately) in the area to recharge our vehicle. In fact, to win it is important to avoid contacts with opponents and the sides of the track, which deprive us of precious energy and slow us down. Judging The controls are easy to say: with A we accelerate, with B we brake, the directional cross manages the movements and the back buttons R and L facilitate the sliding of our vehicle in curves, to improve its insertion. There are also other button configurations (according to non-modifiable pre-set schemes) which can be activated from the options menu. The controls, however, are a bit cumbersome. In fact, the directional cross isn't exactly the best for performing the most delicate maneuvers and the R and L keys are awkward to use for the hands of an adult who, let's say, goes long with his index fingers; the re-configurability of the keys is also unrealistic, because of all the possible arrangements the default one is the ~best~. The level of difficulty of the tracks is well thought out and the artificial intelligence of the opponents is no less. If at the Beginner level most of the opponents will dodge making it easier for us to overtake, in the Standard and Expert levels they will give us a hard time, demonstrating a remarkable and stimulating competitive spirit. However, there will also be errors on the part of the drivers controlled by the CPU, sometimes in fact you can witness their accidents and skids. Overall, finishing all the series on the highest difficulty levels is not easy at all, but usually very fun and rewarding (especially when you manage to win). Of course, once all the Grand Prix mode is finished there isn't much left to play, obviously however if you have one or more friends/GBA/F-Zero the fun continues over time, given that the challenge becomes even more intriguing with a human opponent (preferably also experienced). Otherwise we are left with only a secret game mode and the hunt for the best record, therefore the longevity of the title is discreet, but not high; evidently Nintendo have bet a lot on the potential that F-Zero can express in multiplayer. Technically the game proves to be very solid (as per Nintendo tradition) and although it doesn't boast a graphic richness at the possible limits of the machine, everything has been studied to achieve the maximum possible fluidity. In fact, the game flows wonderfully, thanks above all to the much-vaunted Mode 7 engine (of Snessian memory), here retouched and enhanced. Scrolling is the most captivating, which even in multiplayer never has a moment of indecision. The backdrops are always well done and often very evocative, the tracks are sparse, but colored in such a way as to create strong contrasts with the curbs and vehicles (all to the advantage of visibility). The vehicles also deserve a separate mention: they were made with rendered polygonal models and then converted into two-dimensional sprites, retaining all their three-dimensional charm; even the exhaust gases are well made and vary in intensity as the acceleration varies. Overall, the Nintendo programmers have managed to give F-Zero a very valid and convincing three-dimensional appearance, setting up a graphics engine that perfectly balances speed and visual richness. Even the audio sector does its duty well with precise effects and adrenaline-pumping music and in theme with the circuits, settling on a discreet general sound quality. summing up F-Zero can cause irritation in the gameator at first approach, because it is a game perfectly in line with Nintendo's ~Easy to play, hard to master~ policy. However, after a few hours of practice it is possible to make up for the inconvenience of the machine by obtaining good driving control (gradually more and more perfect) and satisfactory results. However, the regret remains for the lack of free reconfigurability of the keys. Behind the apparent flatness of the game lies all the strength and charisma of F-Zero which makes simplicity its trump card. summing up Pros: excellent technical achievement, fun and challenging Cons: suboptimal controls (GBA's fault) discrete longevity (but it goes up with multiplayer) Introducing Those who have never heard of it must know that F-Zero is in its third incarnation, after having made its debut on SNES and repeating its success on N64, now on GBA it is ready to transport us again into the ruthless world of futuristic racing. In fact, aboard very fast racing cars, we will have to climb the top of all the competition series to become number one. Anyone who thinks it's a clone of the well-known Wipeout is wrong, as it was F-Zero who invented the genre to which these two and many other titles belong. When the console is turned on, the game immediately presents its logo and a flashing text that invites us to press START. If, on the other hand, we wait a while or press SELECT, a suggestive demonstration of the game is started which provides us with useful driving instructions, through written suggestions and graphic symbols. It is therefore advisable to follow these demonstrations carefully, because they are really useful. By pressing START (or A) from the initial menu you can choose whether to start a career or continue or cancel a pre-existing one. 11", "date": "2001-07-09", "grade": null}
