{"name": ".hack//QUARANTINE", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hackquarantine.html", "text": "Quarantine time For anyone who has played .hack up to now, it would not be fair to reveal even the slightest detail about what is narrated in Quarantine: the fourth and final chapter of the saga, in fact, is so full of twists, revelations and narrative sequences so amazing that everything could be considered spoilers. The true purposes of Cubia, the fate of Mia, the secret of Aura, the fate of our world at the mercy of the virus and the dysfunction of The World... everything will be clarified, everything will be concluded, and Kite and his companions will have to face the battle harder. For those who have connected (pardon the pun) only now, it is right to briefly mention the plot of .hack//, which begins in 2009, with the first log-in of a player with the nickname Kite in the MMORPG most popular in the world, The World; in the company of his friend Yasuhiko, aka Orca in the world of The World, one of the most famous players on the server, Kite crosses a virtual creature that ~kills~ Orca, simultaneously sending it in as his alter-ego Yasuhiko in the real world. Having escaped the battle, Kite will investigate the matter and meet Aura, a ghostly girl who will give him the Sunset Bracelet, through which Kite becomes an outlaw player, able to fight the mysterious virus that is infesting The World: all this is just the The incipit of a saga that unfolds between real and virtual life, an adventure in which nothing is what it seems and only the courage of a group of simple gamers will be able to eradicate a terrible threat to both worlds. And at the same time, the Original Animation Video series .hack//LIMINALITY also concludes with the unpredictable and surprising final episode, Trismegistus. An already known conclusion? The commercial premise of the .hack// minisaga is always the same, and we must not forget it: we are talking about a single game divided into four episodes. Consequently, it is basically useless to talk about novelties or radical changes in the gameplay, since there are none. Everything has remained as we saw it two months ago with .hack//OUTBREAK, for better or for worse: the simulated online world is slightly larger, populated by new (N)PGs running through the city streets and with whom it is possible to interact to find information or exchange objects; the Gates now give access to all the areas explored in the previous Volumes and to the new ones after the frequent and annoying Gate Hacking system which forces the player to go far and wide in search of the Virus Cores necessary to continue; the unchanged combat system, a mix between an action-game and a classic turn-based RPG with drop-down menu, now contemplates a vast range of new spells and special attacks, which can be acquired by wearing dozens of new pieces of equipment... In short, come back .hack// as we know it, in a big way, with the pros and cons that entails the most notable feature of QUARANTINE: the embarrassing imbalance of the level of difficulty. Well yes, although a player, as per the premise, must realize that he has to face hundreds of fights for the fourth time which after ten months of play begin to be a bit monotonous, however entertaining and well thought out, it is not justifiable the 's sudden and brutal increase in difficulty by Bandai, which brings into play incredibly powerful monsters that almost always force you to rely on Kite's main ability, the Data Drain. And as any .hack// player will well remember, the Data Drain has the unfortunate consequence of infecting Kite and leading to game over if used too frequently: it is therefore at this juncture that QUARANTINE takes on a bizarre strategic aspect, which leads the player to wisely decide when and how to use the Data Drain to make his way through his opponents. But apart from this inexplicable defect, which fans of the saga will be able to overcome to enjoy the grand finale, the fourth volume of .hack// also presents some improvements in terms of longevity, thanks to the usual secrets to be unlocked with the Ryu Books and new, nice minigames. Final upgrade It has already been said, we repeat: .hack// is a saga divided into four volumes, each of them is not a game in its own right and looking for substantial changes in the gameplay or in the technical sector would be wrong and misleading. Yet, Bandai must have realized that this excuse is not very valid for the fourth episode of the saga, not when competitors of ruthless beauty like Final Fantasy X or XenoSaga stroll on the same shelf as the adventurous Kite saga. So here is that QUARANTINE seems to have undergone a significant graphic improvement, which especially affects the facial expressions of the characters, now more expressivea and animated, while the models by Kite et al. enjoyed a slight increase in detail. A careful eye will also notice vague improvements between one texture and another, but one thing remains constant: the sensational character design by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Fushigi no Umi no Nadia, Neon Genesis Evangelion) who has been able to give us a series of splendid characters, divinely characterized also by an excellent English dubbing, which reaches its peak in QUARANTINE, although it is once again possible to select the American and Japanese audio tracks. Even the soundtrack satisfies: beautiful, spot on and in some situations thrilling. A modest ending, but perfect for a saga that has never claimed to astound anyone, however succeeding in other ways. We are at the grand finale of .hack// and the question was: were the prequels worth playing all these months? The answer, on the other hand, is: yes. Narratively, .hack// keeps all its promises by giving us a truly ending with a bang, between unpredictable twists and dramatic implications. The gameplay, however, hasn't changed one iota, despite the introduction of some new element that enriches the combat system, expanding the lists of weapons, skills and monsters. Even the technical sector greets us with style, always remaining modest but now showing some marginal but certainly not contemptible improvements. The real problem of QUARANTINE? Its excessive difficulty, perhaps too difficult for those who do not have the willpower or the curiosity to find out how the saga will end. But we are sure that .hack// fans will enjoy QUARANTINE until the last second. Pros: Worthy conclusion of a great saga Sensitive technical improvements Attached bonus DVD Cons: Unbalanced difficulty Stale gameplay could get boring Here we are. Six months have passed since the release of the first volume of .hack// in our country, but in the end this story too has reached its natural conclusion. Which is not yet a real conclusion, given that .hack// finds its ending only in the extra animated episode of the series .hack//SIGN, in which the protagonists of the video game and the anime get together to pull the sums of their adventure and send a last farewell to the public, gamer or simply spectator. Because, let's remember, .hack// isn't just a video game: it's probably one of the biggest commercial operations of the last few years. Between animated series, manga and video games, .hack// has also had the time to revolutionize the now static concept of action-RPGs, with innovative and simply brilliant ideas. A simulated online connection, an offline MMORPG where NPCs look like real people, an adventure divided into four episodes and a DVD with a splendid cartoon episode from the .hack//LIMINALITY series included in every package... Bandai has really done it things in a big way, this time, and while the .hack//SIGN series also sees its distribution begin in Italy, the only question left is whether the promises of the Japanese softco have been kept up to the last minute. In short, the question is: was it worth it to spend all this money and all this time to get to Quarantine?", "date": "2004-11-29", "grade": null}
