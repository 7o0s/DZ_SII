{"name": "Rayman Raving Rabbids: TV Party- Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-raving-rabbids-tv-party-recensione.html", "text": "Out of the blue Lightning strikes a group of alien rabbits who are trapped in Rayman's TV (which poor thing to be able to find space in this spin-off, appears only in the interludes where he is intent on destroying the TV), and the pivot on which all the software is TV: the developers have taken the opportunity both to make fun of real television broadcasts, sometimes more ridiculous than those of the game, and on the role that TV has within society. The fact that a group of aliens try to control the world through television I think lends itself to very few interpretations. At the game level, this expedient translates into an original, albeit marginal, system of organization of the levels that are divided into days, time slots, and channels. The channels and broadcasts in the game are parodies of the real ones and the fact that most of them are recognizable gives one to think about the globalization brought about by television. The game is completely localized in Italian with particular attention to adaptation, in fact you will happen to read titles such as ~Falciami stupido~ or ~Fammi il Hay~ and presenters such as ~Checco Mentina~. The channels are themed, among which there is the sports one, the one on rural/documentary broadcasts (think of Linea Verde), the music channel, the Cult channel with B-series films, and a few others. Playing single-player, starting from the first slot on Monday, the player can create his own schedule by choosing the challenge to face each time until he gets to the last slot on Sunday, when he has played every possible program. In multiplayer, on the other hand, you can directly access the games by choosing whether to undertake a certain number of tests, or whether to play for a certain amount of time. As far as the multiplayer options are concerned, we point out three ways of calculating the score, among which the most bastard as well as the most beautiful, or the one where the second arrived in the minigame does not take even a point. In addition to the single game and the multiplayer game, the initial menu allows us to train and participate in a competition which consists in dressing the rabbit in a certain way and voting for the best one, a bit like in the Mii competitions channel, only to vote you have to turn on your PC and do it from the Internet, limiting or even killing an idea that is not too attractive in itself. the use of the Balance Board gives prestige to the game and demonstrates how the peripheral can be used for more traditional entertainment Shopping rabbits The biggest introduction of the game is that of the Wii Balance Board, and without too many words we can anticipate that it is also the most successful and interesting aspect of the game, which due to an obvious and naive mistake does not prove to be as valid as it should have been. The games prepared for the Wii Balance Board can be played alternatively with the Wiimote and Nunchuck: one gains in precision, but loses in fun, but this is not a problem since those who have the scale exploit it and those who don't have it he plays the same. The applications of the Nintendo peripheral are different even if we will mainly get on it like on a surfboard, or we will rest our scented buttocks intent on turning a bull that we are riding upside down. Among these games there is one where you have to surf among the stars, in a setting that vaguely recalls starfox and where you move across the whole Cartesian plane, and which guarantees an excellent degree of involvement and fun. Furthermore, we can use the balance to direct a jet of fire or manure or to use it as a brake and accelerator in a racing game aboard a combine harvester. In short, the use of the Balance Board gives prestige to the game and demonstrates how the Nintendo peripheral can truly be used for a more traditional type of entertainment. As for the other games, however, we have two taken directly from the last episode, namely the musical game where you have to shake the remote control and Nunchuk to play the instruments in time, and the lightgun-like one where you have to shoot plungers at the rabbits on the film set. To these are added other totally new challenges, including a rather successful dance that uses the Wiimote / Nunchuk as a basic controller, and optionally the scale for additional moves, for a total of games that reaches, with the trick, about 50. Neurotic zapping If you have tried to do some calculations, you will have noticed that between the number of games mentioned and the total (the approximate count is 7 time slots for 7 days) there are many in between. The truth is, some games are repurposed over and over again. The GrooveOn channel dance game for examplecounts seven iterations, same thing in a more limited way for the shooter and the slalom on the bull. On balance, the games aren't that many, but the worst flaw is that about fifteen of these (practically all those that require the Balance Board, even if played with the Wiimote, and a few others) have been designed for a single player, so that playing in multiplayer (up to 8 players) you will have to alternate games, which don't last so long. For those waiting there is the possibility every now and then of being able to interfere by throwing snowballs or mud on the screen but it is not enough to remedy a problem that had never been so present in the series until now. This must be why the developers have also introduced another novelty: every now and then during the minigames you can access a demented advertising interval which benefits the challenger who manages to conclude the spot positively, giving him various bonuses on the score or the possibility of choosing the next game. Among other things, precisely these intervals are collected in a final Zapping challenge, called ~No brain channel~ and which consists in tackling the games one after the other (zapping in fact) like Wario Ware, trying not to make mistakes by burning so one of the four neurons left. Comment The most penalizing flaw of Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party which lowers the weight of an assessment that would certainly have been more generous given that the games are almost all well made, that the use of the Balance Board is perfectly integrated and that the technical has finally reached a more than acceptable level, it's just what you would never expect to find in a party game: for about half of the games available (since the others in multiplayer are often the same with different songs/levels) the challengers alternate commands and do not compete for the match facing each other directly but only competing for the highest score. On the one hand this solution bores those who wait, on the other it takes the spice away from direct challenges, the heart of every competition. So sorry to see the good things in this third round of the Ubisoft rabbits partially ruined, which could finally have been the consecration of a brand that instead will still have to wait for a new probable episode for an unblemished evaluation. Courage Ubisoft! Pros Good use of Balance board Well made games Improved graphics engine Cons Lots of repeated games and many more are for a single challenger Rayman Raving Rabbids: Tv Party is available for Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii. The tested version is the one for Nintendo Wii.", "date": "2008-11-18", "grade": null}
