Infinite combinations and possibilities of choice, this is what this title offers us where the videogame digital medium intertwines with a pinch of imagination and inspiration that will certainly succeed in motivating and instructing us to fill our free time with a relaxing hobby like that of do-it-yourself. That's why we warm up our Nintendo DS consoles... we set off to discover a ~new world~! Mama is really meticulous in her explanations and for those who have difficulty she also reserves Practice, a section to practice the different steps of the various creations. The selection sections are different, Mistero for example has unknown creations in store for us for which we will first have to make and then be able to imagine the object we are going to create step by step, exactly the reverse production process. There are three subject sections to choose from: Sewing, Pottery, and Woodworking. By choosing the latter, the mini-games begin, between cutting, sanding and drilling the wood, you begin to glimpse the mysterious object, assemble the pieces and color it as you like, thus forming an amazing xylophone. Mama is always enthusiastic about our work, she motivates us and cheers us up with her chubby smiley face and her famous glitters that she gives us after doing a great job! However, it becomes even more proud when choosing the Collection part, we can have her put our creations that we can see worn on the screen. We create ~What do we make?~ asks Mama before starting to play. The possibilities of creation, as mentioned above, turn out to be multiple thanks to the goals that in turn unlock other creations, so the options increase and the title will not be absolutely obvious or repetitive. The objects to make are obviously not just to be worn, the funniest are creations such as Pressed Flower, Pinwheel and Earrings even if the more you go on with the game the more you are captured by the taste for DIY and the new creations unlocked by our winnings. Felt with needle, clock or balloon sculpture capture our attention more because they increase the difficulties and therefore the satisfaction in overcoming the challenge! Candela contains some exciting mini-games which are basically the steps to be taken to shape the work. You have to crush the candles and crayons of the same color with a hammer, pour the powdered crayons into a pot that melts the candle, paying attention to the timing of the action, pour the mixture into the mold and then remove it meticulously following the suggestions that appear on the screen. Earrings on the other hand could initially give us a hard time, the first step sees us precisely cut the metal wire where we must not exceed a certain length and of course make it come out of its casing slowly otherwise we risk removing it all and losing it. However, each creation gives the possibility - as the last minigame - to assemble or color the work as we like, refining it according to our tastes. For everyone The title is clear, it would be considered purely female, the first impact leaves no doubt. Instead, many creations also reflect the male universe that can entertain the little ones: Water Pistol, Ocarina, Sumo or Paper Airplane are just a few examples to consider. To close the range of possibilities offered by the game we find Party Modality which is able to let four people play at the same time, to have fun with friends and family. Dealing with these videogame realities often has an excellent result on our psyche. Indeed, behind these games, which may also be unsuitable for older ages, lies the possibility of redemption, education, entertainment and mental training. Recent research has highlighted the possibility of developing creative situations precisely in old age: in senile age the individual can maintain his global psychic efficiency if he exploits the residual resources, for example through mental training. There is nothing more beautiful than trying to play with our ~ever green~ grandparents or relatives in Cooking Mama World: Hobbies & Fun; this can in fact be an excellent medicine for them but also a good excuse for us who can spend some time together having fun with cutting and sewing creations without needles and balls of yarn!", "date": "2011-01-11", "grade": null}
