Beyond Follett's typically pressing and dry narration, the great charm of the work obviously lies in its particular historical setting, staging the British Middle Ages with its typical lights and shadows that are perfectly reflected in the architectural style of the Gothic cathedral on which the whole story focuses, a true metaphor of the staged era. It is not an easy material to deal with in videogame form, but Daedalic is a now expert software house, able to handle the narrative with a certain skill as well as to explore the different meanings of the adventure with confidence. For The Pillars of the Earth, the choice of the interactive story was particularly spot on, moreover basing the production on a decidedly different level of literary substrate from most other titles belonging to the same sub-genre. Similar to the novel to which it refers, the narrative is choral and follows the intertwined stories of three characters in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, in twelfth-century Wiltshire. What this videogame transposition succeeds particularly well is precisely the construction of credible and interesting characters, who perfectly symbolize, each in its own way, the different souls of the multifaceted British medieval society in a period in which ancient feudalism was beginning to give way to new bourgeois thrusts, but classist rigidity was still prevailing. Three medieval souls The story is divided into three books for a total of 21 chapters, with each book developing seven chapters long and staging the exploits of the monk Philip, the young mason Jack and Aliena, a noblewoman who has fallen on hard times. These are three different perspectives that highlight different aspects of the historical setting, with the young commoner's search for redemption, the need to mediate between the spirituality and political responsibilities of the monk destined to become Prior of Kingsbridge and the intrigues of the nobility and of the bourgeoisie arvating on the front of Aliena. In this edition we have only tested the initial part consisting of the first seven chapters, which however contain all the features of the entire game. The structure takes up the classic stylistic features of the point and click graphic adventure, but more than on the puzzle design I Pillars of the Earth relies on the story and on the excellently written dialogues and also well dubbed in English (with Italian subtitles), outlining a multifaceted story but coherent and able to keep the interest high also thanks to the frequent interweaving between the various protagonists. Great adventure enthusiasts will perhaps find the proposed puzzles too simple, but it is not actually on these that the charm of the game is based, which also manages to be something more than a simple interactive story, given that the required actions are however complex and often provide (both in the dialogues and in the interactions with the elements of the scenario) different choices with interesting results. As for the artistic / technical aspects, the graphic style adopted is all about animated drawing and has an excellent style, able to create the right themed atmosphere with the historical setting represented. The user interface has been well adapted to the touch screen, making the mobile version one of the best ways to enjoy The Pillars of the Earth.", "date": "2018-04-16", "grade": "8.8"}
