{"name": "S.W.I.N.E.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/swine.html", "text": "War! Before throwing yourself headlong into one of the 2 available campaigns, Fishtank Interactive has included an excellent tutorial where in about twenty minutes you will learn everything you need to get energetic and combative on the battlefield; you start with the routine (learn how to manage the views, move your troops, open fire, etc.), gradually arriving at more and more complex actions (repair a damaged vehicle or supply it with weapons or fuel, call allied aircraft to bomb certain areas, etc.). Once the tutorial is archived, it's time to play, as the rabbits or the little pigs. Like any rts, you will need to have a strong leadership skill, knowing where to direct your troops, identifying which objectives to aim at the expense of others and much more. The means at your disposal are present in good quantity, starting with tanks, fighters, jeeps, missile launchers up to the very useful transporters of fuel and various weapons, as well as the vehicles used as a kind of crane (to transport damaged vehicles elsewhere). There are 22 missions in all (10 if you use the rabbits, 12 for the pigs), during which you will have the opportunity to get, little by little, into possession of the various means described a few lines above, as well as buy weapons and other something else may come in handy. Once the 22 missions designed for the single player mode are finished, there are also the modes created for the multiplayer game (the excellent Gamespy Arcade program is included in the installation CD), i.e. deathmatch, countdown, dominance and capture the flag . Unfortunately, the undersigned, suffering from a rare form of acute bad luck, has never found anyone to be able to play these multiplayer modes, a real pity, because if some of these can be traced back to their videogame value thanks to the wording alone (deatchmatch, capture the flag and dominance), it is equally true that at the moment it is not possible for us to describe the countdown mode. Pig graphics! The graphic engine prepared by the German coders ensures very good fluidity (about forty frames per second on average, more frames, less frames), rarely affected by any uncertainty, caused by an abundance of particle effects, if coupled with a high definition images (from a resolution of 1024x768 and up). The character design, supported by an English dubbing that defining hilarious is equivalent to using an understatement, is well studied and laughter is guaranteed, especially when your instructor will speak in the tutorial, with his purely French accent, like the other soldiers of the army of rabbits. Passing from our combative little pigs and bunnies to the rest of the graphic creation, one cannot but highlight the excellent work done on the backdrops: bridges, houses, streams, everything was created with a skilful number of polygons, subjected to the most disparate colors due to of the many effects of light and shadow ready to embellish them; the well-defined and highly effective textures elevate S.W.I.N.E even more. in the Olympus of the most beautiful rts, cosmetically speaking (together with the evergreen Ground Control and Homeworld). In an RTS, however, it is not so much the backdrops and the pilots that dominate, as the means: what is the use of a likeable protagonist and winking backdrops, if planes, tanks, helicopters, missile launchers and trucks are made in a questionable way and are have ridiculous physics? Luckily for us, the guys from Fishtank Interactive have certainly left nothing to chance and also in this case the technical realization is really first-rate: shoot down a tank and you will see, among puffs of smoke, flames and truly excellent particle effects, the pieces of the vehicle fly in the air and then peep out onto the battlefield, with very credible physics, as already mentioned. Oink Oink After analyzing the surprising graphic sector, there is no great surprise in seeing the excellent quality of the dubbing and the sound effects present therein. First of all, it must be said that there are really many digitized sentences, all with a decidedly amusing tone; both the sentences of the bunnies, with their typical French accent, and those of the pigs with a hard German accent, will make you burst out laughing or at least give you an always welcome smile, while the sound effects are among the most appropriate that could be asked for in a humorous rts like this one. Last mention for the music, well done but present in too small a quantity to be able to give a judgment of excellence assolid on the sound side, fortunately plenty of speech and excellent sound effects. Piggy system requirements S.W.I.N.E. requires at least a P2/Celeron at 466 mhz, 96 mb of ram and a video card with at least 32 mb of ram; since with a similar configuration the shots will certainly be the order of the day, the manufacturer recommends a P3 800, 192 mb of ram and a video card not inferior in performance to a GeForce 2 Gts or Radeon DDR. The undersigned has tested the game with maximum detail and 1024x768 resolution on his P3 933, 256 mb of ram and (coincidentally!) GeForce 2 Gts with 32 mb of ram, without any problem, since the few shots presented are practically imperceptible, if not equipped with an extremely critical and fussy eye. We forgot, free up at least a gig of space on your trusty hard drive. One last thing before moving on to the conclusions: on the official homepage of the game, in addition to being available a playable demo, there is also the patch to bring S.W.I.N.E. to version 1.4 which should solve various crash problems; whoever writes these lines hasn't had the slightest problem with the game, while actually the rumor of some crashes fixed with the 1.4 update has popped up here and there. We reiterate, nothing strange has ever happened to us, otherwise we would have reported it, as already happened with the scandalous Giants. Rabbit conclusions Graphically it is a cut above the average of other rts, the funny character design goes well with the hilarious English dubbing with a French and German accent, the playability is the classic of this genre of games, so war strategy aficionados they will find at home while newbies through the tutorial in less than half an hour will immediately enter the heart of the action. An excellent product recommended to all fans of the genre, detractors try it first, the humor present, together with the excellent audio-visual realization, could convince them too. Pigs to the rescue and rabbits on the attack Swine..an English word never heard in the life of whoever writes these lines, gives its name to the RTS programmed by Fishtank Interactive which has only recently found the way of distribution in Italy in Leader (and therefore a game entirely localized in our tongue). After quite a few hours spent disintegrating tanks and setting traps for enemy armies, perhaps it is no longer the case to be surprised if our protagonists, in the form of hilarious bunnies, have to contend with tons of combative pigs, so tender when they invoke help, how hateful the moment they tear your trusted armies to pieces. But let's go in order!", "date": "2002-02-24", "grade": null}
