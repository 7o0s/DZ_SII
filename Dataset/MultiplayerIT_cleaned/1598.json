{"name": "GROM", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grom.html", "text": "The Colonel and the Merry Brigade We will guide Grom and his companions through the mountains of Tibet in various missions which very often will have as their objective the defeat of the Nazis. At first our movements seem dictated by chance, the wrong person at the wrong time, or Grom who seems interested only in money, but soon we will discover that our job is to prevent the weapons hidden in the Lost City from falling into the hands of enemies. The colonel will be able to receive the help of other people in his mission, and here the most similar part to the RPGs that we know comes into play; managing a group or party. Very often there will be a Yak in the group which will be indispensable for carrying supplies of bread, whiskey and canned meat, very useful for recovering the energy lost during the fights. Following the movements of the group members is very simple and by following the small initial tutorial we will also practice with the wheel interface that allows us to set some aspects of our companions, especially as regards the A.I. during fights or different methods of movement, including a comfortable Stealth mode which makes us practically invisible to the enemy (This mode consists of the ~very difficult~ move of crawling towards the enemy who will always look upwards and does not expect no attack ~from below~). Our heroes will also have backpacks that are accessible with a simple press of the mouse button. We won't have much space to carry objects and ammunition, since the weapons we find will be placed in the pockets of the backpack (then you explain to me how it is possible to hide a sniper rifle in a backpack). Therefore, our Yak ally who carries the bulkiest objects is fundamental. After some practice in the movements of Grom and his companions, we will begin our adventures. The long road to the Lost City The various missions that Grom will face are quite linear and, as we will soon discover, are linked to the search for weapons hidden in the Lost City of Arjuna. During the game you will hardly find yourself in difficulty and without a goal. Thanks to the handy diary, you can always have an idea of the places to reach and the searches to be carried out. The map will automatically show you the places to reach, including any travel days to reach your destination. Traveling won't always be smooth. The mountains of Tibet are full of dangers, from bandits to Yeti, without forgetting the Nazis, always ready to eliminate you, in fact, while traveling it can happen that you have encounters with some of the aforementioned enemies. We have already seen a similar situation in RPGs such as Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 and it represents a good method to simulate the danger of a ~hot~ region such as the Himalayan mountain range during the Second World War. The only flaw that can be found so far is a medium-high difficulty in the fights. You have to be very careful and plan the movements of Grom and the companions who follow him. Many times I found myself having to restart a game because I had taken lightly a firefight with Nazis or Tibetan bandits. Fortunately, during the fights it is possible to pause the game and decide the moves of our characters. This is a very useful possibility to catch your breath and not make rash moves. The music and sound effects that accompany the game are to be covered separately. While on the one hand we have good graphics and high detail, on the sound side we are quite lacking. Few music during the game and few sound effects (even if these are well done like rifle shots and reload movements) are not enough for a game like Grom that wants to reach a high number of users Well so this Grom, how is he? The CDV title is not a masterpiece, but it can serve to bring newbies closer to the world of adventures and RPGs. As I have already said, graphically it is pleasant and the learning curve of the movements and game mechanics is medium / low. This is not a negative factor but it can stimulate players who are new to the genre. Surely with Grom it is possible to practice how to command a group of characters and how to move them during fights. Everything is spiced up by a story which, even if it draws from rather inflated elements, is not boring and focuses on Heroes who are not the classic good-looking or ultra-glossy ones (in fact, our Colonel is not an Adonis) and veryoften the game situations poke fun at some of the classic adventure game clichs. CDV has decided to release Grom also for the Italian market, although this is done several months after the release in all other European countries. Unfortunately, those who are not familiar with the English language will not be able to experience the adventures of our Colonel, as the localization only includes the box and the manual. Pros: Immediate and playable Curious setting Fun without too much effort Cons: Little thickness Sound not always up to par No localization Reading the beginning of this review, it seems that Grom is the new chapter in the Indiana Jones saga but in reality we are facing a new and rude hero. Colonel Grom is a Polish soldier who escaped the captivity of a German camp and has now taken refuge in the remote mountains of Tibet, to leave behind the suffering of the war that is involving the rest of the world. Unfortunately peace for our hero is still far away and soon the Nazis will cross his path. As per tradition, the Nazis are looking for a weapon to turn the tide of the world war in their favor. This time the Germans are engaged in the mountains of Tibet on the trail of a famous city where an ancient king has buried 12 weapons of enormous destructive power. Grom will have the opportunity to redeem himself from the years of captivity and thwart the important plans of conquest of the Nazis. The game falls into the category of adventures with RPG elements and even the graphics are reminiscent in some ways of the more classic RPGs we have seen on PC. The view of most locations is isometric (like that of Baldur's gate) with a very high level of detail. Many side objects are present in the places that form the backdrop to our businesses even if they are objects that have no interaction with our actions. The view changes, however, both in the case of combat, switching to a new bird's eye view, and inside buildings, showing a closer isometric of our hero. All the graphics of the game are very accurate and the developers have deliberately kept a fun and colorful stretch of the textures. The faces of the characters look like they are taken from a comic book, and they bring a smile in many situations.", "date": "2003-07-07", "grade": null}
