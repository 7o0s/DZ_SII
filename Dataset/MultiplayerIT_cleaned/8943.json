{"name": "Io", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/95605-assassins-creed-revelations-io-me-ed-ezio.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360 It must not have been easy for Ubisoft to create Assassin's Creed Revelations, the third installment of the franchise starring Ezio Auditore da Firenze: there are so many questions that arose in the minds of fans of the series that need an answer and too many are the needs to innovation loudly required for a gameplay that remains strongly anchored to its prototype of now four years ago. And it is therefore not surprising to see in the opening credits as many as six divisions of the French publisher collaborate on this huge project, the one that should close the narrative arc of a story that has marked this generation of consoles and has become part of the lives of many players who in Altair first and Ezio later found real characters in some cases even to idolize. We would therefore like to point out that it will not be easy to avoid some spoilers essential to explain the evolution of the plot and at the same time we feel like immediately pointing out that in our opinion Revelations cannot be enjoyed adequately by those who have not played the previous exponents of the series. Precisely for this reason we will take for granted that whoever reads this review is not new to the adventures of Desmond, Altair and Ezio but rather has followed them with some attention, instead indicating to those who are new to the series, to approach Brotherhood first, if not even to Assassin's Creed 2, and therefore to pick up Revelations. Three stories in one Desmond Miles is in a comatose state, hastily attached to the latest release of the Animus in a desperate attempt to keep alive his mind completely devastated by contact with the apple of Eden. We were forced to stab Lucy to death without having real control of our avatar at the end of Brotherhood and now we see the terrible scene repeating itself before our eyes shortly after the start of Revelations. We are inside a surreal scenario with the waves crashing on a beach populated by huge gray monoliths and rock sculptures floating in the sky. Our first contact in the role of bewildered Desmond is with subject 16 who somehow acts as Cicero to explain the meaning of this Black Room where only the basic functions of the Animus are active and where our protagonist will have to relive the actions of the his ancestors, once again, to look for mnemonic joints, abstract entities capable of separating Miles' personality from that of Ezio and Altair and thus making him regain consciousness even in the real world. This is the incipit of Assassin's Creed Revelations. Remaining in Desmond's shoes for a moment, we will have the opportunity to play five unlockable missions by collecting the fragments of Animus scattered throughout the game. These represent one of the great novelties of the sequel: wonderful puzzle sections played entirely in first person where only the option to jump or build small blocks of two different shapes is given. And with these few elements of interaction he will have to overcome obstacles of all kinds within a virtual reconstruction of the machine language of the Animus, all while Desmond narrates the memories of his life, from his childhood up to his capture by Abstergo with which the first Assassin's Creed opened. Naturally the bulk of the game is focused on Ezio Auditore. Revelations recounts the deeds of the assassin about 12 years after what was seen in Brotherhood. Weighed down by age and long pilgrimage, Ezio thus finds himself landing in Istanbul - or Constantinople, if you prefer - in 1511 where he will meet some historical figures who really existed, primarily Prince Suleiman, future Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and Manuel Paleologus, pretender to the Byzantine throne and new guide of the Templars. The adventure of our protagonist in the wonderful border city between Europe and Asia will allow us to get to know two supporting actors who will accompany Ezio for most of his stay in Constantinople: Yusuf, the mentor of the local guild of assassins and Sofia, a bookshop scholar of ancient texts . And obviously in all this dense layer of history he could not be missing, Altair ibn La-Ahad, who we will find in Revelations in a handful of missions dedicated to him that will make us relive his deeds in Masyaf. As in the case of Desmond's missions, these are rather guided sequences where very little is left to the player's autonomy and where there will actually be very little to explore. Ultimately, it is an exceptional fan service where the skilful mastery of Ubisoft's direction is clearly evident, capable of bringing together the three parallel stories in acrackling and melancholy ending which, while leaving a narrative thread open, manages to satisfy most gamers. And just for information, it took us about 15 hours of gameplay according to the internal meter to reach 70% completion. We have no trouble imagining that those who want to complete every single element of the game will hardly take less than 20-25 hours. All mine the city The game structure of Revelations remains extremely similar to that of its two predecessors with a handful of small but substantial differences and innovations. We therefore find ourselves in the presence of a free roaming gameplay where the player is free to pursue a rather substantial amount of secondary objectives that go alongside the classic missions essential to carry on the story of the game, once again divided into different DNA sequences . It will therefore be possible to scale the various observation points to synchronize the game map and restore the shops scattered across the four districts into which Istanbul is divided. There will obviously be no shortage of historical monuments that can be restored to their former glory and the classic faction headquarters with the courtesans replaced by the Athingans that will allow you to unlock the various tests and a series of small additional missions. The recruitment of new assassins already seen in Brotherhood also remains valid and which is activated by setting fire to the various Templar hideouts scattered throughout the city once the leader who manages them has been killed. The battle for control of the Mediterranean also returns, which will allow us to use our followers in a variety of missions that will change the strength of the Templars' rule in several crucial cities of Europe. However, compared to the previous title, not only will it be possible to conquer the various urban agglomerations in all respects but, depending on the percentage of possession, we will see periodically increasing amounts of money flow into Ezio's pockets and we will have access to constant supplies of components for bombs (and we will return to these later). Furthermore, by making the assassins gain experience, we will be offered the possibility of putting them in charge of one of the lairs released in the city by unlocking further secondary missions. In short, if on the one hand we reluctantly witnessed the loss of the so-called exotic quests that took Ezio around the world to complete Leonardo and Machiavelli's requests, on the other we noticed a greater refinement in the accessory offer to the main plot. In other words, more compressed content but certainly higher quality and without those ups and downs that instead characterized the secondary parts of the prequel. Pad in hand But let's get to talking about the more substantial introductions. Let's start with the completely redesigned alert system. Now Ezio's notoriety in the city will no longer grow only by committing murders and harassing the guards but also by carrying out the restoration actions, buying goods, weapons and armor components and also carrying out the various missions. But even if the behavior of the guards will be much less influenced by the degree of ~crime~ reached than in the past, it will always be essential to keep it under control by bribing the auctioneers or killing the officials on patrol (fortunately the posters to be torn up have disappeared) under penalty of assault of the Templars to a den we previously freed. In fact, by reaching the maximum alert level, a territory will become disputed and we will have to go there to start a sort of mini-game essential for resolving the dispute over control. In a sort of tower defense we will have to manage a resource, morale, to populate some roofs with various types of fighters with the sole task of blocking a certain number of waves of Templars. Particularly intuitive and fun at first, this digression on the classic gameplay tends to become extremely repetitive in too short a time and variety in attacking and defensive units is useless. Even the technical solution of a free view in rotation but blocked in zooming and moving has left us rather dumbfounded. Where, on the other hand, the guys from Ubisoft have succeeded perfectly in their intent is in the desire to make Ezio's navigation through the streets and roofs of the city even more frenetic, rapid and fluid. In this case, the hooked blade is the master, a particular weapon that will be delivered by Yusuf to our protagonist practically at the beginning of the game and which will allow him to climb the buildings much more quickly, to jump on the backs of enemies during a run, to demolish the wooden barricades that line the houses on the fly and finallyto exploit the cables that connect some roofs of the buildings, even offering the possibility of assassinating the guards who are near the arrival point on the fly. In short, Ubisoft's desire to make escape or stealth action even more enjoyable, rather than actual combat which with Revelations reaches new heights of simplicity, becomes very evident. In short, the French publisher did not want to retrace his steps by modifying what for many is the only real negative element of the gameplay: the fights remain one-on-one and indeed now more than ever the feeling of power you feel by controlling Ezio is very strong between throwing weapons, sharp blades and bombs it is to all intents and purposes a real immortal war machine. Fortunately there remain several challenging elements capable of bringing the difficulty of the game upwards such as the numerous missions with a stealth flavor where being caught by the enemy is equivalent to instant defeat with immediate repetition of the memory. Finally we come to the bombs. By combining the numerous components that can be collected from the corpses, earned through the missions of Ezio and his assassins or bought in the various shops, we will be able to create three different types of bombs that will occupy as many slots in the inventory. There are lethal bombs whose purpose is to kill the enemy, debilitating bombs which serve to put the enemy at a disadvantage during combat and finally diversion bombs which are useful for attracting the enemy's attention to a specific area before they has spotted us. These three types have in common the selection of the type of casing that ranges from mines in contact, to bombs that explode on impact or after a few rebounds or still able to stick to the enemy and the type of gunpowder that determines the area of action of the explosive but then differ in the agents used to bring about the effect. In total we will have hundreds of different combinations to choose from for the happiness of the most tactical players. It's just a pity that it is possible to bring a maximum of three bombs of each type, which forces the player to return to the creation bench with disarming frequency to reassemble his favorite bomb. The increased number of weapons at Ezio's disposal forced Ubisoft to partially rethink the interface for quick selection and use of them in battle. Now in practice by holding down the right backbone, two dials for selecting weapons will appear on the screen. It is always possible to use the four directions of the digital cross to quickly set and select items but now they have become far too many forcing the player to constantly interrupt the flow of the action to select his preferred weapon according to the situation. Furthermore, even if on the one hand one could be happily surprised by the great variety offered, in reality looking more specifically one realizes that many weapons are redundant and in fact nothing changes based on which one is used. Why, for example, offer throwing knives, a pistol and a crossbow, when all three do the exact same thing, that is, they kill the enemy from afar, without any difference in functioning? Wouldn't it have been more interesting to offer different values of range, power or noise to force the player to make an informed choice based on the situation? Even the difference between long blade, short blade, and hidden blade tends to vanish in combat. Xbox 360 goals The game features 49 achievements for a grand total of 1000 points. Ten are linked to the multiplayer component, all of which are easy to achieve, while fifteen are completely focused on the single player with Ezio and Desmond as protagonists. Then there are several achievements related to particular activities within the game and to collectibles such as, for example, the completion of all bomb missions, control of all cities in the battle for the liberation of the Mediterranean or the ascent of Santa Sofia in less than 25 seconds. A bit of healthy multiplayer In Revelations, that puzzle component that enriched the two previous titles starring Ezio has disappeared. Now there are no more palaces to explore in search of hidden signs armed only with an eagle eye, let alone riddles to solve or mathematical problems to face. To break the free roaming rhythm typical of the series there are the various missions with Desmond and Altair already mentioned above and a handful of missions with a strongly platform flavor which in part recall what has already been seen previously in the Brotherhood's Romulus lairs.
