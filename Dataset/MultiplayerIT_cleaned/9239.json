Velocispider does not escape the ~clone~ classification of the classic Taito, in this sense, yet it provides an undoubtedly atypical reading of the shooter in which a terrestrial station alone had to face an entire army of alien spacecraft that were inexorably approaching the surface of our planet. Beyond the obvious optimization of the mechanics, which in this specific case are based on a control system based almost exclusively on the accelerometer, in which you have to tilt the iPhone for the dinosaur to move left or right, to differentiate the product by Retro Dreamer from Space Invaders there are first of all the ~narrative~ background and the graphic style, both over the top to say the least. The story behind Velocispider is in fact the most absurd one can conceive: an evil alien invader wants to steal the eggs of a large, er, bionic ragnosaurus, and the latter must prevent the space troops from putting this purpose into practice. The Ragnosaurus can move quickly from one part of the screen to another (using, as already mentioned, the accelerometer) and shoot upwards via the cannon mounted on its head. The fire works on automatic, but the standard weapon leaves much to be desired in terms of power. Fortunately we have two alternatives: we can hold a finger on the touch screen for a few moments and then release a strong charged blow, or collect the power-ups that drop when we eliminate certain enemies. Following the same dynamic, the destruction of some opponents can earn us a ~heart~ (our energy bar is made up of three hearts) or a score bonus. Jurassic Pork Velocispider's gameplay is simple and immediate, and it takes just a few moments to familiarize yourself with the tilt controls, which immediately prove to be very precise and avoid the need for a touch alternative. The aliens who alternate in the composition of the ~swarms~ gradually become more numerous and resistant, showing an excellent variety both from a purely aesthetic point of view and as regards the modus operandi. In fact, we range from the starting enemies, who only descend downwards, to those who close themselves in a shell and are momentarily invulnerable, passing through the skulls with tentacles that approach the eggs of our ragnosaurus to steal them. The more we proceed towards the conclusion of the game, the less effective the default weapon is, a cannon whose rate of fire and whose power actually leave something to be desired, thus creating a pleasant contrast when we manage to make an upgrade our own. however temporary. There are three: the first doubles our attack, allowing us to obtain the same results in half the time, especially against bosses; the second multiplies the rate of fire, creating a very rapid burst that destroys anything in a short time; the third increases the range of action of the projectiles, which are tripled and proceed in as many different directions. Finally, as already mentioned, by holding down a finger on the touch screen we can load a ~mega shot~, possibly even partial, which can really make the difference against more resistant opponents. And speaking of resistant opponents, we cannot fail to mention the bosses, really big, very beautiful to look at and equipped with the typical attack and movement routines that must be memorized in order to be able to face them. The last enemy, in this sense, turns out to be really ~old school~, since we have to knock him down several times and that with each destroyed component he adds new moves to his repertoire.
