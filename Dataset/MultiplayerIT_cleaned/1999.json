{"name": "Ninja Assault", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ninja-assault.html", "text": "The first screen that you will be able to see will be the very welcome one of the selector for the video update to sixty Hz. After a brief introduction, you will finally be able to get to know the usual menu complete with audio/video options and two game modes: story and bonuses. The first (also playable in pairs) is the core of the game and is divided into four parts: arcade plus three parts dedicated to each of the characters present who are distinguished from each other by the presence of some different stages. Whatever the choice, there are always seven levels to deal with. The bonus mode, on the other hand, provides training that unlocks other weapons (in addition to the pistol already supplied) to be used in the main mode and the possibility of tackling the individual levels (however, these must also be unlocked). Once the necessary choices have been made, the first thing that will strike you will be the absence of the hateful black bands and slowdowns and the Italian localization of texts and dialogues. Unfortunately, this is where the positives relating to the technical sector end, given that the graphics are dated (it looks like a PSone game with higher resolution!). The polygons are very few and covered by textures with fluctuating quality but practically settled on medium-low levels. There is also some jaggies and slight flickering of the images. Fortunately, the skilful direction and the always fluid update make everything a little more beautiful to see. Neither high nor low for the sound, made up of oriental music, the cries of the enemies, the shots of your gun and little else. Like most light gun games, the only action allowed is to shoot anything moving on the screen before it has time to hit you, affecting the energy bar, after which, a nice countdown will will prompt you to use one of the eight continues initially available. Unlike other games of the genre (Time Crisis above all) in NA there is no time indicator, accompanied by the possibility of parrying each time the weapon is reloaded, replaced here by the constant presence of the character on the screen. This difference causes the pace of the game to be very frenetic as you have to hit the enemy before he does; add to this the presence of numerous enemies and some sudden assaults, mix it all with the sudden changes of direction of the virtual camera and you will have an idea of what awaits you. The downsides of this system lie in the possibility of continuously reloading the weapon while shooting, without losing sight of the on-screen action as happens in Time Crisis. This translates into a simple target shooting exercise up to the final monster, also helped by the numerous continues available and by the brevity of the seven missions (it takes thirty minutes to complete the game with one of the characters!). In short, if there were no bonus modes and the three characters to choose from, longevity would be close to zero, and even with all the additions, the game will hardly last you more than a couple of days. Ultimately a mediocre title, capable of entertaining you but for a very limited time. The only smart thing you can do (as long as you don't let yourself be intimidated by the slightly dated graphics) is to rent it for a couple of days, keeping the money aside for some future games. Before closing, applause to Namco for the excellent transposition into our PAL format, hoping that this treatment will be extended to all future titles. Pros: The setting is suggestive Excellent localization Frantic Cons: but too short Dated graphics Control system to be reviewed The hunger for games that exploit the light gun made in Namco must be really exaggerated if you have decided to bring out nothing less than a two-year-old game. The original Ninja Assault was in fact a decent arcade title based on the Naomi card. The story is more of a pretext to justify what happens on the screen and sees the three protagonists fight against an evil Shogun and his hordes of demons in order to free the princess held hostage. The setting is typical of feudal Japan but peppered with demons and pure fantasy machinery. Overall it's okay and brings to mind some famous cartoons of Japanese origin.", "date": "2002-09-30", "grade": null}
