{"name": "Il ritorno di Desert Strike?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/119014-thunder-wolves-il-ritorno-di-desert-strike.html", "text": "When it was released on various platforms (PC included) way back in 1992, Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf obviously relied on the dramatic events of the Gulf War to call shooter enthusiasts to an experience that, in fact, is it revealed solid and deep, anything but caciarona. In short, the Electronic Arts production did not put us on board an Apache helicopter with the imperative of destroying anything that moved, but provided us with strategic objectives from time to time that had to be achieved by planning the actions and possibly returning to visit several times to our adversaries, so as to break their resistance without exposing ourselves for too long to their reactions. An approach that in some ways we find in Thunder Wolves, the new shooter developed by bitComposer Games, team authoring, among other things, Jagged Alliance and Galaxy on Fire 2. Available on the Steam digital platform and also arriving on Xbox LIVE and PlayStation Network, the game offers a single player campaign consisting of thirteen missions, which can also be tackled in cooperative mode together with a partner. Thunder Wolves From a narrative point of view, Thunder Wolves is very simple and is clearly inspired by the action cinema of the 80s, also as regards the protagonists of the story: a real fair of stereotypes, from the infallible pilot to the grumpy female soldier, passing for the brave soldier who decides to sacrifice himself for the common good. The first level serves as a tutorial with respect to the control system, which involves the use of the mouse / keyboard combo or the Xbox 360 controller, perfectly supported were it not for a rather serious lack: the impossibility of inverting the Y axis. Making a shooter of this type without this feature is actually a risky move and therefore we are confident in the release of an update that fixes it, but in the meantime you have to get used to aiming using the right analog stick ~in reverse~. Which is a shame, because the developers have taken great care of the controls, providing three different layouts to operate the machine gun and missiles, activate the zoom or boost, move the helicopter and make it gain or lose altitude. The configuration that in our opinion goes best with the most varied needs is the third, which delegates the flight height adjustment to the back buttons and the change of the equipped missiles to the d-pad, going in this case to penalize only the aim precision (which is activated by pressing the right stick on its axis: not the best of comfort). As we complete the missions, we will be able to select different helicopter models at the start, each with unique characteristics in terms of speed, resistance and firepower, as well as equipment that includes standard, self-seeking, dispersion missiles and finally those that we can control directly, switching to a first person view the moment we launch them. destroy everything One of the most surprising aspects of Thunder Wolves, which recalls the classic Desert Strike, is the variety of missions, each consisting of a series of main and secondary objectives and combining different situations. In certain moments we will in fact find ourselves wiping out an enemy base, going around the targets and often activating the flares to deceive the missiles that are fired at us, while immediately afterwards we may have to go inside a cave to identify further targets to eliminate , or protect the escape of allied units in obvious difficulty, or even challenge other powerful helicopters in exciting dogfights. The presence of infinite ammunition, and a bar that recharges over time in the case of missiles, implies the possibility of really throwing the impossible at our opponents, in a party of explosions that is well represented on the screen thanks to a series of interesting effects such as the tilt shift, which makes the idea of a ~miniature~ perfectly and therefore gives a particular charm to the action sequences. The developers have therefore tried to overcome the budget limits with ingenuity and imagination, obtaining in the end a more than discreet result, which is also light and manageable with maximum effects even from non-top configurations. Thunder Wolves is an attempt to offer a different shooting experience than usual.", "date": "2013-06-05", "grade": "7.0"}
