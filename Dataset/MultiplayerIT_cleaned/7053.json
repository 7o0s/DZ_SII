Relic, who already brought the series to free-to-play with Company of Heroes Online before taking a step back, doesn't seem to fear the challenge of going against the tide and is indeed convinced she can restore luster to her most recent strategy game with a booth expansion halo that abandons any ambition to offer a single player experience. The Western Front Armies is a pack containing two new factions, US Forces and Oberkommando West, and nine maps designed with a different scenario in mind than the Eastern Front in the base game. Content that winks at those who appreciated the original, but also an opportunity for newbies to be introduced to the series, perhaps enticed by the all in all low price of twenty euros. The first step for a long-term project that the developer has promised will be enriched over time with new additions, free and otherwise. The Western Front Armies is a good expansion and an interesting starting point for the curious Snow in the sun The western front of the Second World War was a radically different scenario than the eastern one, starting from the climatic conditions. The maps in Company of Heroes 2: The Western Front Armies reflect that difference and where once there were whitewashed forests and bare trees, now there is no trace of ice, the plants are more lush than ever and represent an important strategic element for hiding from the enemy and prepare ambushes. In short, the nine locations included in the expansion abandon the use of Cold Tech technology, leaving the sheets of ice, the icy storms and the footprints drawn on the snow on the road, in favor of a drier, more essential approach. Working by subtraction has certainly removed part of the charm on which Relic had aimed to present his strategy in the first instance, but has brought the ability to manage resources and units back to the center, as well as to read the scenario. In this regard, the unpublished theaters of war range as usual from the countryside to the cities, from the woods to small rural villages. Overall there is some variety and whether playing with two or eight, again the maximum number of users hosted at the same time, there should be something for everyone. Those who were to purchase only The Western Front Armies, without owning the basic package, will still be able to test themselves on the twenty-three previously released maps by playing in Quick Play mode, as well as they will be able to face or ally themselves with the other two armies, the German one ~of base~ and the Russian one. From a technical point of view, both in terms of aesthetics and environmental interaction, Company of Heroes 2 does not seem to have made any particular progress in this case. There are tweaks and small improvements, but nothing that can really be called an evolution. An effort to implement important features for a title devoted solely to multiplayer would also have been welcome, such as the ability to reconnect to a match if you had to leave due to a network problem, but none of this has been done. On the other hand, the online progression system has been enriched and from time to time you receive small perks and bonuses to add to your equipment, together with the Commanders who usually allow you to vary the trend and the strategic options during the game in progress: a potentially tasty addition, especially since it makes sense to accumulate experience points beyond the level cap. Compare exercises The gameplay of The Western Front Armies is no different from what the 700,000 buyers of Company of Heroes 2 have come to love or hate in the last year. Same modes, same options to customize the game and the same resources to conquer, protect and exploit. Those who have not loved the direction taken by Relic will certainly not change their minds now, while those who have enjoyed the hours of gameplay spent on the campaign but, above all, online will not be disappointed. The first of the two factions introduced is American, the US Forces already present in the original Company of Heroes which has reached the battlefields in the ongoing conflict and which focuses much of its potential on the versatility of the units it is able to develop. For example, the infantry can be customized by adding pieces of equipment over time, such as the very useful rocket launchers, which can be developed as needed to react to the opponent's moves and then recovered within the base. This is already built in full at the beginning of the match, but the individual structures must be activated gradually so the difference is more practical than substantial. The media themselves reflect the flessibility of the US Forces, are fast and medium light, concentrate fire on one point and are perfect for raids. Another peculiarity that many will appreciate is the introduction of transported air troops, to be launched on the ground complete with an anti-tank cannon, perhaps to take a point well defended from more massive opponents, such as the Oberkommando West, from behind. The second German army reflects what was available to Germany at the time at the end of the war, a force equipped with devastating means that does not focus on mobility like the American counterpart and indeed needs the best possible positioning on the battlefield. It will appeal to those who like the idea of controlling huge tanks, but also to those interested in gadgets not usually associated with conflict. We are referring in particular to the tank equipped with infrared rays, capable of identifying enemies at a short distance and giving us enough time to position ourselves in the best possible way. Unlike the Yankee counterpart, here not only does the base have to be built one piece at a time, but each structure is literally installed on a control point at will: this means that supplies can arrive more quickly and that, depending on each of the three headquarters, you can take advantage of the mechanics or doctors present on site, or defensively exploit the cannons of the Heavy Tanks Headquarters. Overall we found US Forces and Oberkommando West to be two well-designed and built factions, with unique distinctive traits that will make them differently attractive. Doubling the armies will multiply the balancing problems and we expect some work to be done, but if indeed Relic, as stated, wants to make this the starting point for a game-as-a-service development process in the coming years, updates and additions will have to be constant and of quality.", "date": "2014-06-23", "grade": "7.8"}
