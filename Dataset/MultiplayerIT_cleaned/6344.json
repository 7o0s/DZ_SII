Metal Gear Solid, ICO, God of War and Hitman are just some of the titles that have enjoyed similar treatment. Among them certainly could not miss a collection dedicated to one of the historical brands of the jRPG genre, namely Final Fantasy, and in particular to two titles originally released on PlayStation 2. We are talking about Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2 which after seeing the light again last year on PlayStation 3 they also arrive on the new Sony flagship in a special edition entitled Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. Both episodes are accompanied by several bonuses, including trophies, extra content such as Final Fantasy X: Eternal Calm, a movie that acts as a link between the tenth chapter and the spin-off and Final Fantasy X-2: Last Mission , which allows you to play a sort of roguelike inside a huge multi-story tower. And again the audio drama Will, written by Kazushige Nojima and set about a year after the events of Final Fantasy X-2. Focused on two new characters, Chuami and Kurgum, it is essentially an audio story in English, with Italian subtitles, to be followed while watching a sequence of artwork and various illustrations from the two games scroll across the screen. Finally there is the cross-save function with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, and a couple of new graphics and audio which, however, we will discuss in detail later. Final Fantasy X and X-2 also arrive on PS4 in a rich edition remastered in high definition Playstation 4 trophies The collection offers 34 Trophies for Final Fantasy X, divided into 20 bronze, 8 silver, 5 gold and 1 platinum, and 35 for Final Fantasy X-2, divided into 22 bronze, 7 silver, 5 gold and 1 platinum. To obtain them, in the tenth chapter, for example, you have to find all the Albhed dictionaries, learn Jecht's shot, complete the spherographies of all the main characters or defeat Der Richter, while in its spin-off you can unlock rewards after acquiring a dress special, caught a rare chocobo, got the treasure of Tonberry or eliminated the bosses in the different floors of the tower of Iutycyr. The threat of Sin All the contents of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster reside on a single disc support, and therefore can be enjoyed starting from a main menu. Starting with Final Fantasy X, a game that has represented and still represents in many respects a sort of milestone for genre productions. Its plot tells of Spira, a world in danger threatened by a devastatingly powerful Entity called Sin, capable of wiping out all life in a flash, and a group of characters who, due to a series of dramatic events, find themselves united to try to stop the threat. Led by the sweet Yuna, a summoner of the Yevon sect, and by Tidus, a Blitzball player, the group of heroes also sees Wakka, Lulu, Kimahri, Rikku and Auron lined up among their ranks, each of which has its own personality to discover and explore during the adventure as well as special techniques called Turbo and unique abilities for each, which can be improved or acquired through Spherography. The latter is a particular character growth system which, through the use of special points and spheres to be spent on a sort of chessboard, affects the statistics, skills and techniques of the party members, from black to white magic, from those of support to the different types of attack or defense. It is the player who actually chooses which parameters to enhance, moving within the Spherography. At the start of the game, the user can choose which type of Spherography to use between the Standard and the Master. The first provides a slightly more guided path for the growth of a hero, who in any case will remain quite specialized in his techniques; the other is freer, has fewer blocks than the Standard one but allows you to divert the path of evolution of any element of the group. A character predisposed to become a powerful wizard, for example, with the Spherography Master can instead be made to specialize in physical attacks, which on paper would instead be more suitable perhaps for other members of the group more suited for this specialization. Going even further into the gameplay of Final Fantasy X, the title reproduces practically all the trappings of the jRPGs of the past, with the exception of the world map, with different areas to explore, mini-games to participate in for fun or to recover objects, weapons or rare skills. Particularly funand in this sense Blitzball, a strange underwater sport similar to handball of which, as mentioned at the beginning, Tidus is a champion. In the game you can participate in an entire championship with the possibility of obtaining rewards and recruiting new and stronger teammates around the world. Of course, the random and fixed-turn combats are inevitable, even if here, unlike the chapters of the saga that preceded it, the battle system does not rest its foundations on the Active Time Battle bar. In fact, everything is managed through the CTB, a system that provides, among other things, the attack order of each participant in the battle in relation to his specific attributes and speed (there is a line on the screen that indicates the rotation times of the various characters and enemies). Put simply, the turns are not superimposable and a character can attack several times in a row if he has attributes of speed superior to those of his opponents. Then there is the possibility of changing the fighting party members with those on the bench in real time, and that of resorting to the summons of the Aeons, which are very powerful creatures equivalent to the Summons of Final Fantasy VII or the Guardian Force of Final Fantasy VIII , albeit with different functions and roles. In fact, once invoked, these creatures remain on the ground to replace the other elements of the team, controllable by the user like normal characters, therefore subject to losing HP and being defeated if hit. In short, there is everything to make fans of the genre happy, from turn-based combat, to villages to areas to visit full of secrets, dozens of monsters and bosses to face, even if in all probability the gameplay of the product, with its frequent random encounters and its style will be unattractive for those accustomed to action games or certain modern RPGs. It being understood that usually this type of user does not come close, if not just out of curiosity, to a classic role-playing game. Yuna's dance The other title in the collection is, as mentioned, Final Fantasy X-2, in its International incarnation unpublished at the time in Europe. Therefore, compared to the one that came out in 2003 on PlayStation 2 in our part, there are some extras such as the Creature Creator function, which allows you to capture and use monsters that you meet around within the party, and several additional missions. The game begins two years after the end of the tenth episode and focuses on the figure of Yuna who has in the meantime become a Sphere hunter together with her friends Paine and her old acquaintance Rikku, with whom she forms an all-female team called the Seagulls. Following the discovery of a globe containing images that appear to depict Tidus, the former summoner leaves with her friends in search of lost love. Moving aboard the Celsius flying ship, the user thus has the opportunity to revisit the world of Spira, meet characters already seen in the tenth episode of the series and perform actions capable of influencing some aspects of the story to arrive at one of the different adventure endings. From the point of view of playability, the product is conceptually more frivolous and less busy than its predecessor: progress in the game takes place through five chapters and the successful achievement of some missions available in each place that can be visited. Most of these tasks can only be tackled from a certain point in the adventure or up to a certain point in the story, so it becomes important to return to certain locations throughout the story. However, to differentiate this spin-off from the title of which it is the sequel, however, are the way in which the gamer interacts with the world of Spira during exploration, with Yuna who can run, jump and climb, and the battle system, focused on the Job System and a fast-paced and dynamic version of Active Time Battle. In fact, the player can control a party made up of only three elements, namely the girls of the Gabbiani team, but each of them can wear a different dress through the Looksphere system, or Spheres that allow them to change their appearance, moves and skill. The latter must in turn be developed one by one through specific points. During the course of the adventure it is possible to acquire new clothes, to be used according to one's preferences or the monsters to be faced, and to enhance them through particular grids called Garnment Grids to obtain other benefits, such as for example attack bonuses or particular spells not yet learned through the acquisition of the canonical skill points. The battle system of Final Fantasy X-2,clearly inspired by that of Final Fantasy V, all in all it is not evil and in general the title is pleasant to play because it allows fans to return to explore known areas. You touch and touch up As far as the technical part is concerned, it should be emphasized that the two titles do not leave you speechless for the amount of polygons or effects, which can be widely foreseen considering the starting point, but nonetheless present various interesting aspects which are partly linked to the 'ability of the development team in making the most of the hardware potential of PlayStation 4, in part to that of the designers. In this sense, and we say it right away, the glance offered by the two games is really pleasant, thanks to the usual inspired artistic direction of Square Enix. Going into detail, both games have gone from 4:3, which is the television standard of twelve years ago, to today's indispensable 16:9, with a resolution equal to 1080p. The models of Tidus, Auron, Yuna and that of all the other main characters, reconstructed in such a way as to be more defined, well-finished and beautiful to look at already in the version released on PlayStation 3, have been further retouched by the graphics, which have finally given more prominence also to many secondary characters and monsters, improved with a more refined set of textures than the originals or those of the remake. The restoration also involved several elements of the scenarios, whose structures were embellished with more detailed textures, a better lighting system and good use of anti-aliasing effects. The overall view is therefore decidedly valid and the world of Spira has never been so beautiful and colorful to see. The only flaw, perhaps, are the films that cannot be skipped, and this can be annoying regardless of their beauty, especially when, due to an early death, you have to start again from a certain point and therefore have to put up with the entire sequence again . As for the audio part, the Final Fantasy X soundtrack is excellent, with most of the sixty tracks that make up the musical accompaniment of the adventure rearranged for the occasion by Masashi Hamauzu, one of the original composers, reproposed in different versions while obviously maintaining the very valid starting melodies. However, for longtime fans there is the possibility of selecting the entire original soundtrack of the PlayStation 2 edition. Only discreet and for the most part in line with the ~more frivolous~ setting that of Final Fantasy X-2, which is the same as the original PlayStation edition.", "date": "2015-05-12", "grade": "8.7"}
