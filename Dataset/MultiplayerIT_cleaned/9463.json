On the other hand, since the first video shown of this Gameloft game, when the name was not even known yet, the comparison seemed obvious and also considering the marked tendency of the publisher to ~mention~ other highly successful titles, it was clearly agreed by all that the game in question had to be the imitation of Zelda on the iPhone. Which in itself can mean an excellent starting point or a total disaster, considering the perfection of the Nintendo game mechanics and the rare balance of its components, which is difficult to replicate. Leaving aside the direct, decidedly uncomfortable comparison, Sacred Odyssey must be evaluated for what it is, that is a pleasant and rather complexly structured action adventure, even considering the average of productions for iOS. The story tells of a young farmer called Ayden, son of a great fighter and obviously destined to save the world from a terrible threat, all involving a mysterious princess in trouble and an ancient artifact, bizarrely called ~Holy Grail~, broken into more parts to recover. Pure almost trashy fantasy conformism which nevertheless turns into a pleasant hodgepodge of assorted quotations and suggestions, from Zelda to Star Wars, in a continuous alternation of ironic and convinced, which while presenting a real challenge, with dramatic contours, seems not to want to never take it seriously, and fortunately. There is a magical tree with decidedly brusque manners, there is a fairy literally exalted by the Grail research mission and there are dialogues that seem to hide a sarcastic joke at all times. There are even two horses named Miya and Moto, so to speak. It is something almost crazy, which however raises this production from a simple copy of Zelda to a sort of self-deprecating quote, while providing an excellent gaming experience, which is what counts in the end. Ayden can't triforce Through the typical virtual pad drawn directly on the iPhone touch screen, a solution that is not very convenient but with which we inevitably have to live with, it is therefore possible to guide Ayden, on foot or on long journeys on horseback, one of the strong points of the game , and make him fight, talk, interact with the objects of the scenario or use particular equipment with a ~key~, alongside the one dedicated to using the shield. In normal combat phases the game behaves like a sort of frantic hack and slash ~button masher~, with an auto-targeting system that allows you to automatically aim your shots at the closest opponent, which greatly simplifies the action reserving for the player little more than the frantic and monotonous pressure on the keys, however it is in the battles with the bosses that the Zeldian soul is back in vogue. The bosses are huge and have those characteristic weak points to hit that lead to the typical procedure of the seasoned adventurer: analysis of the patterns of attack, defense and well-directed blows, often with the need to use special equipment to get through the fights . These and the puzzles that fill the dungeons are the key elements of this Gameloft production, which manages to combine the two souls of action and adventure, albeit without particularly memorable moments. Even the puzzles owe a lot to Miyamoto's work, between blocks to move, mirrors to orient various switches and the need to exploit elementary logic with the use of special equipment (grappling hook, boomerang, metal gloves, all fairly well-known elements) and they do not represent a challenge to be taken lightly. Outside of the (few but moderately long) dungeons, there is this vast open world to explore on horseback replicating vague echoes of Epona and the Hyrule Field, which in the absence of other iPhone epigones, we do well enough . The game world is entirely made in an excellently crafted 3D, not at the levels of the titles built on Unreal Engine but considering the extension and freedom of movement there is very little to complain about Gameloft, as well as the sound, composed of instrumental music and a surprisingly good dub, it makes a worthy accompaniment to Ayden's sacred odyssey.
