{"name": "Pokmon Link!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-link.html", "text": "They kidnapped Pokmon! The Luxor Battalion represents the bad guy on duty, the enemy to be defeated in the Pokmon Link adventure!. Is there an adventure? You might be wondering, in a puzzle game? Nintendo has well thought of creating a story that justified the usual formula ~put together elements of the same color and make them disappear~, which is the most classic clich that exists in this genre. Each element on our screen represents a Pok-Ball, with Pokmon of various colors inside. The Battalion is kidnapping many orbs and are stockpiling them at numerous suspicious sites. Why gather so many Pokmon? Maybe to start a big war? It's up to us to investigate, sneaking into enemy bases. Nintendo has well thought of creating a story that would justify the simple action of putting together elements of the same color, in order to make them disappear They kidnapped Pokmon! Once inside the Pok-Ball collection centers, through a device devised by the Professor, we will have to ~link~ four or more little monsters of the same type to make their signal more easily picked up by the satellite, which will teleport them to a safe place. A valid justification was therefore also given to the action of assembling several equal elements in rows (horizontal or vertical). The various levels represent enemy bases and are spread across a map that will become more and more extensive as the game progresses. The Touch Screen and its physicality Moving the Pok-Balls with the stylus of the Nintendo DS offers a very ~physical~ and rewarding gaming experience. There are many puzzle games of this type, we only mention Columns on GameGear, the famous Tetris, Dr. Mario and his colored pills, Puyo Puyo and Bejeweled. Similar gaming experiences: frantic, fast, immediate games, with universal gameplay and infinite longevity. All this is also Pokmon Link!, with the added possibility of being able to drag each element on the screen directly with our hands, instead of through the interaction of an analog cross. The Pokmon must be slid both downwards and to the right or left, so as to line up at least four identical ones. A Jolly element could not be missing that could be linked to each other regardless of color. Once the sequence has started, a lot of speed will be needed to create other chain ~links~, often even luck as many combinations will sometimes arise by chance, especially in the most crowded situations. Often many ~combos~ made take place regardless of our will, they arise from the large amount of elements on the screen and there is a very pronounced feeling of randomness, but only when the screen is almost completely filled. Moving the Pok-Balls with the Nintendo DS stylus provides a very physical and rewarding gaming experience... The Touch Screen and its physicality Each scheme has a goal: to save a certain number of Pokmon, starting from the 50 of the first level that can be reached in a matter of minutes, to get to the ~monsters~ that will make our lives more difficult than expected by continuing to throw balls of I continue without ever giving up. Each level is interspersed with cute cut-scenes that are well-crafted and well-animated. The game interface and graphics in general are colorful and pleasant, obviously two-dimensional. The audio sector is the least cared for: the style is that electro-pop dear to software houses such as SEGA, and similar to that already heard in titles such as Project Rub, for example. The music often has very particular and strange sounds. The tunes of the game sessions are not among the most memorable and are limited to playing fast and in some ways annoying rhythms, as if to make the action even faster and more frenetic. The menus, on the other hand, are well studied and full of options, decidedly numerous for a ~classic~ puzzle-game: let's go and discover them. Gotta Catch'em All! The game developed by Genius Sonority (obviously under license from the Pokmon Company) also takes full advantage of the wireless capabilities of the console. As soon as the main menu appears, we can appreciate a two-player challenge mode, called ~Fight~, and another called ~Couple~: a sort of cooperative multiplayer. At the top you can see the ~Adventure~ single player option which constitutes the heart of the game, while on the left we find ~Senza Fine~ which is a classic ~death match~, a game to the bitter end with which we can establish our personal bests. At the bottom of the screen are other options, such as the list of Pokmon to be released: there are 386 of them! Next to it are the statistics and scores. Next we find a button that introduces us a nice feature: each player will have to ccreate your own business card, as Japanese culture requires, to be able to exchange with other Pokmon Link players! each player will have to create his own business card, as the Japanese culture requires, to be able to exchange with other Pokmon Link players! Gotta Catch'em All! We can write a short text message, our nickname and gender. By activating the ~spying~ option we can also automatically obtain the business cards of players who enter our wireless range, even with the Nintendo DS closed. The multiplayer game also works with a single cartridge, it will be necessary to send our friends the version called ~Mini~ of the game, once downloaded they will be ready for action. The collector's factor of the series is maintained both through the ~list~ of saved Pokmon, and by the fact that rare Pokmon can be unlocked by linking with other Nintendo DS cartridges. Final comment. Pokmon Links! is a very valid puzzle-game, suitable for a portable console and for a ~hit and run~ type of gaming experience. The use of the stylus to ~move~ the colored blocks made up of Nintendo monsters is captivating, and the creation of a story around such a simple and traditionally unjustified mechanic is appreciable. Pokemon Link! it will be able to entertain both old Pikachu fans and those who have always put this brand aside. Certainly we are not dealing with a ~new~ title, although it is still a puzzle-game made up of colored elements to fit together, which collides with a myriad of similar products, however, coming out of them very dignifiedly. Recommended for fans of the series and for all those looking for a simple, fast but exciting video game. Pros Lots of levels and Pokmon to unlock Good use of Nintendo DS features Lots of game modes Cons Not original game mechanics Anonymous sound Sometimes chaotic Pokmon Links! is a very tantalizing ~spin off~ of the regular series. However, this is not a classic adventure, not even an RPG, but a very special game: we can define it as a very successful ~puzzle-adventure~ experiment. The key elements are always them, the Pokmon monsters, but this time we are convinced that such a game can also attract the attention of those who have always avoided them like the plague, of all those who have never tried a title in the series because ~for children~, or simply puzzle lovers. Nintendo DS is the perfect console for this Pokmon Link!, a fast, fresh, fun title that takes full advantage of the touch screen, which makes the usual ~move and combine~ action of this kind of game much more intriguing and satisfying.", "date": "2006-05-26", "grade": null}
