It does so by adopting a different formula, however: no longer in episodes, but with an initial package that includes six missions, linked to each other through cutscenes which are entrusted with the narrative component of the experience, and two new multiplayer modes, Sniper Assassin's competitive Ghost Mode and co-op. In truth, the separate downloads of the digital version of the game reveal how the authors probably originally thought of an episodic approach also for this new chapter, falling back on a publication in a traditional format perhaps due to the agreements made with Warner Bros., which took over from Square Enix in the role of publisher. Whatever the truth behind its genesis, the title offers exactly what was expected: a very multifaceted stealth action, a great care for the scenarios and an even greater freedom of action than in the past. New Zealand and Miami Having become a real platform, rather than a video game in its most classic sense, the Hitman franchise obviously cannot do without a set of maps that is both consistent and fascinating, and that knows how to tell interesting stories within itself. Also in this case, Agent 47 hit the mark, however introducing few innovations, classified mostly as nuances, compared to the first season. Possibly completed the good old cruise ship tutorial, the Hitman 2 campaign will first take us to Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, where we will visit a splendid beach house, first with the task of gathering information and then eliminating a target well protected by an ample escort. Once the building has been bypassed and all the security cameras eliminated, we will have to get a tool to short-circuit the garage's electric opening and from there penetrate the property, using instinct to identify the interactable objects and any secrets hidden in the structure. An idea, the latter, which unfortunately is not recalled in the other missions. Then it will be the turn of the now famous map set in Miami, with the huge racetrack that we will have the objective of exploring in search of a tycoon and his daughter, both involved in high-tech arms trafficking that has already done many innocent victims. To enter the various areas we will need different disguises, but also a certain intuition to identify stairs, bridges and underpasses, given that the two targets are located in very distant places. This first US scenario is striking for the splendid colors and the complexity of the structures, but also and above all for the extraordinary abundance of non-player characters that populate the setting: one of the strengths of the Glacier Engine, which manages to manage a huge amount of polygons. Santa Fortuna and Mumbai The Colombian map of Santa Fortuna will see us following the trail of a ~three-headed snake~, i.e. the three leaders of an organization that operates in the drug market. Bringing them closer will not be easy, but by exploring the large village it will be possible to steal valuable information, unlocking the subplots that will allow us to arrive relatively comfortably in the vicinity of our potential victims. It will therefore happen that we have to intoxicate a well-known tattoo artist and take his place to leave an indelible mark on one of the victims, or to replace a drug trafficker and present our goods (suitably ~modified~) to a boss, to then kill him once away from prying eyes. Very distant from those of Santa Fortuna are instead the atmospheres of Mumbai, a densely populated city that is represented in the game in a very convincing way, with streets full of people and a series of very articulated situations for identifying one of the targets and the elimination of all three. Not only disguises: we will have to remember the sentences spoken by some characters, but above all be very careful to find secluded places where to knock out the right characters, steal their clothes and deposit them in a chest or wardrobe. It will also be possible to improvise, but remaining in the wake of these mechanisms: in the event of a sighting, recovering will not be easy at all and the systematic limits of a stealth experience will emerge which inevitably embraces a setting devoted to trial & error. The frequent automatic saves and the possibility of quickly creating manual ones, moreover, wink at this aspect of the game, with everything that follows from the point of view of the rhythmor. Of course, it is also true that ringing the right moves the first time around and avoiding being discovered returns great satisfaction, and it is precisely on this particular scaffolding that the charm of Hitman rests. Whittleton Creek and the Isle of Sgail The last two missions of the campaign present very different situations. In the first case, Agent 47 will have to eliminate an old gentleman and the agent in charge of protecting him, from the perspective of a typically American neighborhood, a sort of happy island in which, however, not everything is as it seems and a policeman can be hidden behind every passer-by. undercover. We are therefore talking about safe houses, a protection program for important witnesses and, once again, the ability to understand the right stories to exploit them to one's advantage. Once you wait inside one of the manned buildings, eliminating the special agent won't be complicated, perhaps by pulling out the good old silenced pistol. More mangy, however, to take care of his protg between disguises, distractions and fire alarms to ensure that the escort breaks the ranks a bit, exposing himself. The map of the Isle of Sgail worthily concludes this initial selection, leading us to visit a huge medieval fortress where a crowded reception is taking place. There are areas of the scenario that are closed to guests, which will therefore require an adequate disguise, and many interesting subquests, especially the three stories that will allow us to approach the final targets, two to be eliminated and one to be extracted safely. The fascinating architecture of the location opens up in some cases to nice platform sections, allowing us to follow alternative routes and also giving us great freedom of action. Outline mode The six maps of Hitman 2, playable independently or in sequence within the campaign, focus on replayability as a fundamental element: in addition to the three selectable difficulty levels (by default you will find the intermediate, ~professional~ one active, which we thought adequate in terms of challenge and realism), with each completion you will unlock a variable amount of achievements and options that can make each playthrough slightly different, rewarding imagination and the ability to improvise in the art of killing. The fun therefore does not end in the handful of hours necessary to complete the campaign for the first time, or at least this is certainly not the ideal way to enjoy the experience packaged by IO Interactive. Having said that, there are also side modes in the package, some of which are unpublished. There is obviously no shortage of contracts, with the possibility of creating almost infinite combinations of scenarios, objectives and conditions, and then sharing them with the community; and the now classic Elusive Targets will be introduced, starting with the Immortal, played by Sean Bean. Finally, there are two multiplayer-based options, one cooperative and one competitive. The first, Sniper Assassin, is exactly what we tried with the beta a few months ago: on the Austrian map of Himmelstein, we are asked to take up our sniper rifle and eliminate three targets from a distance, as well as most of their guards, proceeding with the killings in the most ~silent~ way possible, alone or together with a friend with whom to share the targets. The problem is precisely the fact that there is no news compared to the aforementioned beta, and for the moment there are no further maps. The Ghost Mode, still in beta, starts from an interesting concept, a five-elimination race between two players who move in the same scenario, currently only the one in Miami, but without really sharing it. The formula works fairly well, but gets boring very quickly, placing this mode as a nice but far from essential extra. Playstation 4 trophies Also including all the maps of the first season, Hitman 2 boasts the beauty of 118 Trophies. The basic achievements revolve around the completion of the tutorial and the first contracts, after which there are specific actions for each of the maps included in the package, which add to the already multifaceted system of objectives that characterizes the experience and emphasizes the degree of replayability. Technical realization There are truly evocative moments in Hitman 2, and there is no doubt that the developers have meticulously cared for the game's settings, designing them with great care, leaving nothing to chance and offering credible cross-sections, which make the most of the brute of the Glacier Engine to represent huge numbers of people who, however, are not a mere background to the missions, but play an active role instealth mechanics, possibly assisting in our eliminations, fleeing like hell in case of danger, calling security and so on. The degree of artificial intelligence and realism does not go beyond a certain limit, also because in a probable context most of our actions would stop in the face of a series of insurmountable problems: guards who wake up after being knocked down , call in reinforcements and besiege the area, making it impossible to continue the game without loading a previous save, for example. The architecture and design of the levels are therefore the pillars of the technical sector of Hitman 2, but the effects also have something to say and the management of the lights creates very suggestive moments. From the options it is possible to lock the frame rate at 30 frames or leave it unlocked, thus enjoying great fluidity during the less complex phases from a visual point of view, net of some drops in the most stressful situations, which however never go below the level of guard. There aren't many lines of dialogue and it is therefore a pity that we didn't choose to localize the game completely in Italian, leaving the excellent interpretations in English and translating them with subtitles (with adjustable dimensions, fortunately), while the soundtrack accompanies the narrative passages of the campaign with a very engaging and inspired cinematic look.", "date": "2018-11-08", "grade": "8.0"}
