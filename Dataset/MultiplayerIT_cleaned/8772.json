In addition to becoming a source of boredom and disturbance on the part of uninterested students over time, it was in fact the main source from which the imaginative creators of Board Games, i.e. board games, drew abundantly in the creation of their works. Sometimes only inspired by certain events, other times faithfully reporting them or with some licence, these artists have often managed to recreate some of the most important moments of Medieval and Modern history through a cardboard sheet, a few cards and a few miniatures. Caylus in particular, published in 2005 by William Attia, sets his story in the France of Philip the Fair, right in the municipality of the same name. The figure of Philip the Fair is famous, among other things, for the well-known events related to his stormy relationship with Pope Boniface VIII as well as none other than at the end of the Templars: however, we invite the curious reader to deepen the interesting topic independently, not further addressed here. But what a beautiful castle! In its digital transposition, Caylus maintains its managerial and highly tactical approach: with the aim of creating a new and grandiose fortified castle ordered by the king, the player's task will be to hire and assign the various workers to the right tasks, in order to accumulate the resources needed to complete the work. It must be said that in general the rules for playing remain exactly the same as in the table version; we will try to summarize the most important ones here, also because true enthusiasts know that after a little practice the tactics that can be used are really many and complex. Once you have chosen your favorite color to start the game, the first task to perform is to place the unskilled workers available to work, up to a maximum of six. To do this, an initial budget in coins is used, given that each type of employment costs an amount ranging from 1 coin (in the case of a worker placed in a neutral building or owned by the player) up to 6, when you move your master builder to someone else's or particularly coveted building. Each building is actually a workplace from which to obtain the indispensable game resources: food, wood, stone, fabrics and gold (extractable from the mine); to take possession of the buildings you must then sacrifice a certain amount of resources. Owning more buildings will produce more income for the player, so he can afford to send workers every turn of the game to the best production locations; once an adequate stacked quantity of at least three different resources has been reached, it is finally possible to position one of the diligent workers directly at the gates of the nascent castle, finally guaranteeing the right to erect a part of it. Each portion of the castle built produces the player a bonus, called the King's Favor, consisting of economic gifts, prestige or resources: the management of these bonuses is very important because, with each successful construction obtained, they will grow exponentially. Along the streets of the village, while the various buildings are gradually completed, the institutional figures of the Bailiff and Provost stroll, officials of the king who have the task of influencing with their presence the possibility or not of building in a given point. In the (virtual) game board there are then two key places, namely the inn (which serves to park any redundant workers by paying only one coin) and the stable, whose function is to alter the game rounds. In fact, even in multiplayer mode Caylus works in turns, both online and offline (with the Pass and play method) and the right alternation can in certain situations favor victory or defeat. At the end of the game, the player with the most prestige in the eyes of the king will be the winner, ie the one who will have managed to build the most buildings and portions of the castle. As a faithful transposition of a boxed game, it is of little use to talk about the technical aspect, at least with regard to the graphics (however some hand-painted artworks are beautiful); much more interesting instead to spend a few words on the touch interface, optimized in an excellent and truly intuitive way.
