{"name": "Snowboard Hero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/snowboard-hero_a.html", "text": "Between crazy speeds, very steep descents and spectacular tricks, snowboarding games present themselves as an arcade product with great potential; potential that on nextgen consoles, unfortunately, still has been expressed. So what should the enthusiast in the throes of a nostalgic crisis do while thinking of Cool Boarders for PSone? Well, you can grab your Java-compatible phone and buy Fishlabs' latest Snowboard Hero! From the early stages, the game presents itself in a different way than the titles we were used to in the mobile sector, offering us a career mode that unfolds through numerous challenges against three different opponents. The first challenges revolve around some skills separately, that is, we will have to focus on speed, tricks and precision. After that we will move on to a combination of factors, to which will be added the presence of opponents directly on the track and numerous bonuses and upgrades that represent the key to finishing each event in the best way. Snowboard Hero reveals his attention to the ~substantial~ gameplay also due to the evaluations at the end of the race: by returning to a certain time or a certain score, depending on the nature of the event, we will be able to win a bronze medal, d silver or gold. Getting on the podium will be a necessary and sufficient condition to move on to the next challenge, but not to unlock a new opponent: each of them will require a certain amount of medals to be challenged. This means that not only will we have to be able to overcome the challenges, but also that we will have to master the game to the point of taking advantage of every opportunity to get that extra second that makes the difference between first and second place. The thing turns out to be particularly demanding, in truth: the level of difficulty is on average high, therefore apart from the first few races it will not be easy to bring home the results we want until after a good bit of practice. Within each descent, tricks represent an element of great importance: performing them fills a bar located at the bottom of the screen, which once full allows us to take advantage of an extra push to recover ground. The control system is very simple, just press the 5 key to jump and then act on the various directions of the d-pad to obtain different manoeuvres, which vary further (and produce a higher score) if the bar has already been filled once . The graphics of the game are entirely polygonal, of excellent workmanship: the forests surrounding the tracks are quite populated, there is great attention to detail and the characters have the right complexity, as well as good level animations. Too bad for the presence of a heavy pop-up effect, with the scenario that is built to pieces before our eyes or even fails to keep up with the speed of our alter ego, during fast jumps. The drawing style in the menus is really particular and spot on, while the sound sector is unfortunately not very inspired, with repetitive music and without particular bite. Finally, the controls perform well in any situation and respond promptly to inputs, making us capable of even minimal corrections in the trajectory. PRO Addictive and thick gameplay A large number of challenges Great graphics... AGAINST ...too bad about the heavy pop-up Difficulty high and not adjustable Mediocre sound", "date": "2008-12-18", "grade": "S.V."}
