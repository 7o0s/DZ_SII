In the case of The Fast and the Furious, the racing game series now shines in its own light, having ensured I-play something like fourteen million downloads. So the announcement of ~Fast and Furious~ for the summer of 2009, the fourth installment of the film saga, eagerly awaited by fans for the return of its most important protagonists (Vin Diesel and Paul Walker) probably has nothing to do with the release of The Fast and the Furious: Pink Slip for Java compatible devices. It is a racing game characterized by the presence of thirty-four different cars, whose characteristics focus on four factors: pure speed, the ability to drift, impact resistance and recovery. Four aspects that are reflected in as many types of racing, to be tackled in sequence within the Arcade mode. Among the items that can be selected from the Pink Slip start screen, there is also the garage, with the count of the cars conquered so far. This is a fundamental element for the game, because the difference between winning or losing a race lies in gaining or losing one of the cars: before taking to the track, we will have to bet on our success, putting our vehicle on the plate and that of an opponent. Once in the heart of the action, we will find ourselves facing four different types of event, as mentioned above: the simple race to the finish line, in which you follow a defined path without particular rules; the ~clandestine~ race in which we don't control the car but only have to manage the gearbox and the nitro; the drift race, which takes place on slippery tracks; the escape from the police, in which you have to resist the charges of a police car until you cross the finish line. These are four types of racing that are quite different from each other, especially the one where you only control the gearbox and have to upshift when the rev counter reaches the green zone, using the nitro at the right moment and only when the engine has already given everything: exactly what happened in the first film. Control of the car is delegated to the d-pad or, better, to keys 4 and 6 of the numeric keyboard, while key 5 activates the nitro and key 8 is used to brake. Acceleration is automatic, fortunately, and the car reacts quickly to our inputs, even if driving, unfortunately, is far from smooth. The sixteen races present, together with the large number of racing cars to unlock, guarantees a fairly long-lasting entertainment. The game makes a fine show of good polygonal graphics, whose strong point is above all the fluidity: the sensation of speed is not extraordinary, but the races are quite engaging and the cars are well made. The level of detail is good, even if the locations are often a bit bare or too ~edgy~. In any case, the excellent use of colors and the numerous pre-calculated sequences (which see, for example, the cars preparing on the grid) contribute to the excellent final result. The sound consists only of music, of discreet workmanship, which enjoys independent volume adjustment from the mobile phone.
