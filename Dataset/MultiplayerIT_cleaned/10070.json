{"name": "Bakugan: Battle Brawlers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72437-bakugan-battle-brawlers-carte-scoperte.html", "text": "Version tested: PlayStation 3On air on our television networks for some time now, the animated series Bakugan: Battle Brawlers joins an endless list of productions for children in which the various characters collide with each other using ever more abstruse means and processed. Who remembers the good old Mini4WDs? Now, magical cards and monstrous creatures summoned to participate in tournaments where the fate of the world is at stake are all the rage. As absurd as it may seem, Bakugan Battle Brawlers also proposes the same concept, in certain moments even taken to the extremes of the clich: there are brave kids, gigantic supernatural creatures, teenage loves, rivalries and dramas, a bad guy to defeat and two worlds to save. Enough material to make a video game out of it, right? From TV to console Fans will be happy to know that Dan, Runo and all the other protagonists of the series will be recurring presences in this video game version of Bakugan, but their role will be more marginal: in fact, the protagonist will be a new character that we will create with a decent editor at the beginning of the Story Mode and that he will find himself linked for mysterious reasons to a creature called Leonidas. The intentions and role of this bakugan will be revealed little by little but don't expect a complex narrative or exciting twists: the story is rather dull and develops slowly through numerous dialogues, definitely revealing itself as a mere pretext to give rise to countless battles. Surprisingly, the plot is told through written but also acted dialogues, often using the Italian voices of the cartoon, a gem that fans of the series will definitely appreciate. Even the visual rendering is very reminiscent of the television series, the style adopted to reproduce characters and clashes is a very clean 3D in cel-shading: the polygonal models do not have a particularly memorable amount of details but show off fluid animations and a discreet visual cleanliness. The fights therefore recall those of the cartoon, as well as the rock and techno music: they would like to increase the level of tension but are instead decidedly repetitive to the listener. Playstation 3 trophies Bakugan Battle Brawlers offers 57 Trophies: 1 Platinum, obtainable by obtaining all the Trophies of the game, 2 Gold, 2 Silver and 52 Bronze. Trophies range from winning a certain number of fights using certain Bakugan to completing each game mode by achieving specific objectives. From console to case Bakugan Battle Brawlers apparently offers a good number of game options, but we soon realize that this alleged variety does not make the experience any less repetitive. The problem lies precisely in the main activity of the game, or rather the clash between Bakugan: although this is proposed in various formulas (one against one, two against two, all against all) it still remains the focal point of a game that develops only through dozens of clashes that are extremely similar to each other. To be honest, the amount of Bakugan that can be purchased and upgraded by spending the appropriate points earned in battle is truly commendable and players have the ability to create teams (or decks, if you prefer) of rather heterogeneous creatures. However, the choice often comes down to the best creatures in terms of stats and elemental attributes that will allow you to get the better of your opponents without paying too much attention to the circumstances. Furthermore, the rhythm of the action in the combat phases turns out to be not only inconstant, but also disappointing: the player essentially throws his Bakugan into the game arena and directs its movement in an attempt to hit one of the previously placed cards, capable to provide support or impose penalties. If the Bakugan thrown by the opponent is also positioned on our own card, a sort of mini-game will start in which you will have to press keys in rhythm, move the controller or shoot at moving targets: the outcome of the mini-game will trigger an animated sequence in which the victorious Bakugan will annihilate the other with one of its characteristic special attacks. Therefore, the actual combat lasts a few seconds and is anticipated by an obligatory introductory phase that is more frustrating than fun: not only is the difficulty of the clashes unbalanced, but the preparation phases, although extremely simple, are finally regulated by factors external to our ability of players such as the influence of the opponent's cards or the precision of the computer, an opponent often so infallible that he almost seems like a cheater.", "date": "2010-04-15", "grade": "S.V."}
