We played the Beta and eagerly awaited a more enjoyable and refined final version, then we played the new MMORPG for a good month, enjoying a tormented early access and then the growth of newborn servers, economies and their communities. Having reached the level cap and started the endgame, we finally decided to share our thoughts. It wasn't easy, we guarantee it. We tried to like WildStar almost desperately, but the guys at Carbine seem to have made a point of making him as dislikeable as possible. Between queues, bugs, extraordinary maintenance, bugs, elitism, questionable choices and more bugs, WildStar proved to be a rather immature MMORPG that would have deserved a few more months of Beta and greater foresight towards the users of 2014 and the competition. This does not mean that it is not an enjoyable title, but that the matter is rather complex and therefore we advise you to read our long review to better understand if it is a title for you or not. WildStar had all the cards in the rules to make it big, but in the end it got lost in a teacup Repetita iuvant? If in Beta we had tried all the classes that the game makes available, dividing them between the two factions that fight each other in the WildStar universe, in the release we decided to choose the Dominion faction and create a Chua, Spellslinger profession. There are no particular reasons: the Chua are very cute, the Dominions seemed particularly badass and the Spellslinger ... in short, a kind of cowboy who can deal damage and heal with a mix of firearms and runic spells, what else is there is it to add? After the short tutorial and choosing the verdant Levian Bay as the starting point, we threw ourselves headlong into the leveling phase which is mainly crossed via quests and PvE. Not that in WildStar you can't collect some experience points even with PvP and the Battlegrounds, once unlocked, but as in the vast majority of theme parks, even in this case the quests represent the best and most effective way to fill the bar of levels. Which is saying something, considering that the leveling phase soon proved to be incredibly monotonous and repetitive. The missions are in fact divided between World Story, Zone Story and Task: the first, sporadic at least for thirty-five levels, focus on the mysteries of the planet Nexus that the two factions contend; the latter, divided into episodes, tell us more about the region we are exploring and its vicissitudes and constitute the heart of the leveling; the tasks, on the other hand, are parallel missions that can be completed as you take care of the others and which pay much less. The structure would even work well, were it not for two major problems. The first concerns the arrangement of quests and hubs: it is not organic (careful, we are not saying linear) and it is no coincidence that many quests are ~phoned~ to the player as soon as he enters the interested area. Unfortunately, however, we often feel left to ourselves, lost without a clear path to follow that leads us in an orderly manner from one hub to another following the normal progression of the difficulty. This means that you risk skipping entire hubs or running into higher-level ones simply by wandering from one area to another to complete the objectives, arranged disorderly in areas that are perhaps a little too large. The other big problem, connected to the previous one, is the repetitiveness of the objectives. WildStar is a rather classic theme park, so you don't expect who knows what innovation in terms of design, however the succession of fetch quests based on killings or collecting objects soon becomes overwhelming. The number of kills required to complete some objectives borders on the ridiculous and it is never clear when to dedicate yourself to one task rather than another: therefore it happens that you find yourself ~grinding~ monster after monster to complete a mission, except then discovering that one of those left open will lead us to an area crammed with the monsters we just killed by the dozens elsewhere. This type of missions alternate with some more interactive ones that require you to memorize a sequence of colors or press certain keys at the right time: they are definitely nice, but practically the only variant that you encounter from the beginning to the end of the leveling phase. which therefore turns out to be rather flat and repetitive especially in the final areas, definitely too muchpo extended and devoid of treble. Even the Path system, advertised as a way to compensate for player preferences in terms of activities, has its ups and downs, proposing the same handful of objectives in each region from the first region, fortunately punctuated through a progression made up of rewards of various genre. If we add to this the numerous bugs that block the missions or prevent you from activating or completing some of them, the general picture appears a bit bleak. Shoot what happens to you WildStar's combat system is probably the best quality that allows you to tolerate the repetitiveness of the quest system and the horrific amount of enemies to kill. We believe we can define it, without fear of contradiction, as the best MMO on the market: it is compelling, dynamic and strategic, able to satisfy both ~trigger-happy~ and more tactical players. The telegraph system on which each skill or mechanic is based works great and the variety of attacks, skills and areas of effect devised by the developers for the multiple types of enemies and environmental dangers continuously regenerates the experience, always keeping us on our toes. WildStar is a kind of action game projected into a classic MMORPG, and it works in both PvE and PvP, probably the best way it is expressed. The diversification between the classes is satisfying (all can do damage but three can also heal while the other three can ~tank~) and the various mechanics that define them, once understood, give them enormous depth. A little less convincing, perhaps, the build customization system, based mainly on three factors. First, the choice of eight skills from over thirty unlockables per character: it works relatively (better than Guild Wars 2, by the way) but ends up crowding out most of the skills thanks to the infamous ~cookie cutter~ builds. Second, the points that allow you to enhance the various skills, possibly activating their special bonuses: we liked it a lot, but the fact that these points have a cap that can only be circumvented in the endgame has left a bad taste in our mouths. Third, AMPs: mimicking the canonical ~talent trees~ we've seen in World of Warcraft and a trillion other MMORPGs, AMPs initially allow you to only increase your character's stats, then learn new skills or special bonuses after used items that unlock them. At that moment we began to notice one of WildStar's biggest problems, when we realized that some AMPs - and in particular those crucial for every build, for example Trigger Fingers and Power Surge in the case of the Spellslinger - are found randomly by killing enemies in certain areas. Which means that, being very rare, their value at auction is disproportionate, even higher than that of the CREDD (that is, the monthly subscription). Let's be clear, having or not having a certain AMP doesn't drastically change the experience unless you're dealing with content of a certain level, but the flaw in the design is monumental and has raised more than one eyebrow. Therefore, a convincing ~half~ customization system comes out, with several strengths and as many defects that end up preventing the player from expressing his imagination to the fullest, curbing the ambitions of the design itself. And how hardcore are you? From the very first announcement, WildStar wanted to be the spiritual heir of the old World of Warcraft, the one all raid and attunement, before Blizzard's casual drift extended to the entire MMORPG market which had seen a new basin precisely in that user to draw on. It's no coincidence that some developers at Carbine Studios worked on The Burning Crusade, the expansion that many World of Warcraft veterans have always considered the most prohibitive in terms of commitment and difficulty, but also the most rewarding. The PvE instanced in WildStar is ~serious business~ and it is enough to try one of the first two dungeons, already at level 20, to realize that Carbine Studios wasn't joking. In reality, however, the difficulty does not lie in the complexity of the encounters or in the brute strength of the enemies (who still beat like King Kong) but in the emphasis placed on teamwork and communication between party members. An example of this is the mechanics of the Interrupt Armor, daughter of Guild Wars 2's Defiance: in practice, some enemies cannot be stunned or controlled immediately and a temporary window of opportunity must first be opened by reducing their resistance to crowd control. The only way to do this is, in fact, to use control skills on them; considering the recharge times, it is necessary for the players to coordinate theand interrupts and control skills between them, without wasting them randomly. Only this concept is able to give a hard time to randomly composed groups in which players do not communicate well, preventing them from defeating even the simplest enemies. The bosses also require even greater concentration due to the complexity of their telegraphs and the mechanics to manage while dodging attacks and trying to stay in the area of action of the healer on duty (who, in turn, he will go crazy trying to keep up with his companions who snap and run everywhere). The painted picture may seem chaotic, and in fact it is, but the fights are really a lot of fun and well studied, especially if you face a tested group of practical and communicative players. Considering then the variety of PvE content divided between dungeons and adventures (basically shorter dungeons based on the most disparate mechanics, from multiple choices to tower defense passing through MOBAs) there really wouldn't be anything to complain about. The problem, however, exists, and it is the simple fact that not all players are practical and communicative: we are talking about an MMORPG, a genre in which it is particularly easy to come across real cabbage heads. When Carbine Studios went the ~hardcore~ route and made it clear that the game, especially in the endgame, would be anything but a walk in the park, it didn't take into account that casual gamers would still buy and play it. Their problems, we could say inverting the medal, but the reality is that this mix of elitists and casual players ends up constantly blowing up almost every experience. The concept of gold medals, then, particularly incisive in terms of endgame, has created a form of elitism that is nothing short of chilling that cuts the legs in the bud to every activity: not infrequently you also expect a good thirty minutes in line to enter finally in a dungeon and see the group disband because, already at the beginning, this or that player is new to the current content or does not believe that it can be beaten by meeting the necessary requirements for the gold medal rewards. A problem exacerbated, then, by the impressive requests in terms of raiding: beyond the exceptional equipment needed, before tackling the initial raids you have to pass a very long test that requires a slightly exaggerated mix of performance and farming. In short, the result is a PvE that is at times prohibitive, more than demanding, and made even more unpleasant by the clash of personalities that frequently occurs in groups and that Carbine Studios, with its mentality, seems to have involuntarily encouraged. Casual-ities Luckily WildStar is not only hardcore raiding and PvE, but also PvP in all its forms and minigames, crafting and pastimes. If it is true that up to now we have painted a not particularly exciting picture of Carbine Studios' effort, it is fair to point out that these are certainly problems that can be solved from patch to patch and that in any case the contents proposed already in release are among the most abundant and varied that we have ever seen with a newly released MMORPG. One of the most fascinating is certainly the housing, a feature publicized by Carbine Studios which, in fact, is also one of the most successful. The ways in which you can customize your plot are impressive and range from the type of house to the weather, lighting, various ~accessories~ which can be gardens, mineral resources, party areas, simple decorative frills such as ponds or miniature reproductions of the settings explored during the leveling phase. Most of them, however, unlock mini-games or challenges that reward with objects and so on, allowing us to further enrich the interiors and exteriors of our home between soft toys, furniture, armchairs and so on and so forth. Housing therefore encourages us to tackle any other type of content in the game that, in one way or another, will make our home even more beautiful. The crafting system is also excellent, based on an ingenious progressive structure complete with objectives, ~unlocks~ and bonuses that allow you to unlock more and more recipes and possibilities by manufacturing the various items belonging to the chosen skill. PvP, on the other hand, is divided between Battleground, Arena and Warplot, casual and rated, in order to really satisfy every type of player. The Battlegrounds aren't exactly a work of art in terms of design, but they get the job done with the chaotic fun that is PvP in and of itself via the telegraph system. Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to try the Arenas, while the Warplots, just u", "date": "2014-07-06", "grade": "7.0"}
