{"name": "Mercury", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mercury.html", "text": "A blob for a friend Anyone who has ever had the (un)luck of breaking a mercury thermometer will certainly have been able to observe the particular behavior of this metal, simple to divide into many small ~drops~ and equally simple to reunite by placing two of these close to each other other. Evidently inspired by this intriguing phenomenon, the British designers of Awesome Studios have chosen a ~blob~ of mercury as the protagonist of their debut on PSP. With a playful scheme that takes something from Marble Madness and something else from Super Monkey Ball, Mercury invites the player to tilt more or less large game ~tables~, the levels, in order obviously to move the mass of mercury all inside them, possibly without letting excessive quantities of its own liquid fall from the edges. Obviously it's not all that simple, since as the levels progress, new gameplay elements are introduced which make the procedure increasingly bizarre and less immediate, requiring a considerable dose of attention combined with several phases of study and experimentation. For example, some bizarre objects on the game boards allow you to divide the blob into several parts, only to be able to color them blue, red or green. The reason? Simple: some ~gates~ will be passable, or even some switches will be activated only by drops of mercury of a certain color. But what if the gate or the shift switch are maybe magenta? Well, in that case you need to review what you learned in school in the drawing class, and combine two or more primary colors to get the one you want. If the explanation seems convoluted, wait until you get to the advanced levels... Also because, in addition to increasing in complexity and size, some tables require you to control several drops of mercury at the same time, to be moved with care and precision. In fact, Mercury tests logic and ingenuity as much as skill with the analog stick: a mix, this, certainly rewarding, but which could alienate many PSP owners. Satisfying frustration In order to give greater variety to their title, the programmers have decided to separate the levels on the basis of 3 large groups, differentiated by the objectives necessary for their completion. The first emphasizes the speed of execution, regardless of the percentage of the initial blob still in play; the second does exactly the opposite, requiring as much mercury as possible to be carried across the finish line. The latter is instead based on the need to activate a series of switches, possibly quickly and without wasting the precious metal. An interesting structure, which denotes the real care and attention with which this title has been produced; Mercury is in fact a product very far from the standards we are used to, and absolutely not comparable to a ~hit and run~ approach to which, on the contrary, the average user aspires on many occasions using a portable console. Nonetheless, the Ignition Entertainment production manages to capture the attention of those who are willing to accept its high demands for patience, calm and reasoning. This basically because Mercury is a very intelligent product, in the best sense of the term, and made by an extremely small team made up of people who worked with genuine passion. And this passion really shines through, whether or not you are captured by the game mechanics that are anything but mainstream. From a technical point of view, Mercury stands out above all for the accurate algorithm that simulates the behavior of the metal, truly excellent and always very credible. The rest is certainly not particularly flashy, while doing its job, but it is still perfectly in tune with the spirit of the game; just as the ambient music tracks are spot on, perhaps not destined to remain in the memory but impeccable as background. Comment Mercury is a product made with uncommon passion and care. That said, it should be emphasized that very few will be able to appreciate such a demanding game scheme in terms of patience, reasoning, calm and skill. The effort of Awesome Studios is in fact clearly a niche product, which collides head-on with a market that is instead increasingly inextricably embracing the cause of undemanding games, hit and run. For those looking for something different, as well as a challenge worthy of the name, Mercury is therefore absolutely recommended. For all the others, simply not. Pros: Cured in every aspect Intelligent and intriguing game mechanics Capable of giving great satisfaction Cons: Extremely niche Lvello of difficulty very high. A tilt sensor would have been perfect A few weeks after its debut on European soil, PSP can already count on an excellent variety in the numerous titles currently available. For puzzle game lovers, after the brilliant - in all senses - Lumines, Archer MacLean's Mercury also arrives on the shelves. However, the similarities between the two titles stop at the genre they belong to, since the approach is profoundly different.", "date": "2005-10-07", "grade": null}
