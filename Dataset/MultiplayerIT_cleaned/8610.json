In particular, to distinguish the brand they have always thought of a gothic atmosphere of great impact combined with a whole series of scenic moments borrowed from Hong Kong filmography, up to the figure of the protagonist, Dante, who still today represents without a shadow of a doubt one of the best examples of characterization in the field of video games. In whatever sauce it has been served up to the public over the course of all these years, in fact, the hero of the Capcom production has always been confirmed as a ~character~ in all respects, and not a simple avatar of the player. Devil May Cry HD Collection is the classic collection that aims to indirectly pay homage (basically it's a simple commercial operation) to precisely those titles that marked the birth of this authentic mythical character in the sector, and which includes the old games originally released for PlayStation 2 with the implementation of some new features; specifically the first three chapters of Devil May Cry with the addition of Trophy support, a couple of bonuses and theoretically high definition graphics to make the product compatible with the standards of current television screens. We will talk about why we wrote ~theoretically~ in detail later. For now, let's focus on other aspects of production. Devil May Cry The first title of the collection is obviously the progenitor of the saga. Originally born as a possible episode of Resident Evil and then converted into something else given the profoundly different style for mechanics compared to the aforementioned survival horror, Devil May Cry tells in a nutshell of the demon hunter Dante, in whose veins the power of creatures flows to whom he gives no peace, being half the son of a woman and the other of a powerful being called Sparda, and of his battle in defense of mankind against the forces of Evil. As far as the game structure is concerned, the title is divided into a series of missions of increasing difficulty in which the protagonist is generally called to fight against terrible demonic creatures, including end-of-area bosses, equipped with broadswords and more or less such as rifles, pistols and so on, while taking advantage of his martial arts skills and his supernatural powers. By killing the enemies it is possible to absorb red spheres, while progressing in the adventure it is possible to collect artifacts: all these elements can then be ~spent~ at the end of each stage to upgrade the main character, acquire new weapons or to make him recover the energy lost in combat. The gameplay, as mentioned several times, is obviously all exploration, action and fights which, thanks to a dynamic management of the camera, are still quite spectacular today, apart from the occasions in which the shot throws a tantrum and helps to make the gamer lose sight of the enemy resulting in discomfort in the fight. Also interesting is the possibility of interacting with most of the objects on the screen which, once broken, can give you some of the bonuses mentioned a few lines above. Devil May Cry 2 The frenzy, the Matrix-like fights and the typically action-film camera movements are also repeated in the second chapter of the saga. Between classic duels with double pistols and sword accompanied by spectacular jumps from one wall to another, everything seems to follow what has already been seen in the first episode. In reality it is only an illusion and things are very different from how they appear: in Devil May Cry 2, in fact, all the charm of Dante's character is lost, here presented as a real tamarro with an easy joke and at times attitudes ridiculous, deprived on the other hand of all those elements that had contributed to making him a real concentrate of charisma. In short, the protagonist has been ~emptied~ and made little more than a puppet dressed in a ~cool~ way. In the same way, the co-protagonist, Lucia (the real novelty of the title consists precisely in the possibility of using a second playable character), beyond a decidedly unforgettable design, lacks the depth necessary to transform a set of polygons into a real character worthy of the name. This heroine is then linked to what appears to be a huge bug in this high-definition version of the game: basically what in the original PlayStation 2 version was disc two containing the story ofLucia, here too is seen as something in itself, therefore it is not possible to pass from Dante's control to Lucia's without completely exiting the adventure. To what has just been described, a series of other negative aspects are added, from the exaggerated turn towards naked and raw action in terms of gameplay, to the narrow and lackluster plot, to the enemies with ridiculous artificial intelligence that nine times out of ten they always perform the same movements: on some occasions it is in fact sufficient to position yourself in a certain point to knock down even the toughest of bosses without this being able to do anything to hit the player. Of course, to sometimes make things a little more difficult there is an absolutely inadequate management of the camera with respect to the action, which therefore affects playability, but certainly in ~normal~ situations one should not appeal to defects in order to have toughest fights. Certainly not positive then the choice of the developers to greatly impoverish the phase of strengthening and evolution of the character, which in this second chapter of the saga is reduced to a simple series of weapon upgrades of dubious depth. In a nutshell, Devil May Cry 2 is the least successful of the series and therefore also of the collection. Playstation 3 trophies Devil May Cry HD Collection features many trophies. There are 34 for each of the three games, but the breakdown of the various prizes varies from title to title, so in Devil May Cry we have 20 Bronze, 7 Silver, 6 Gold and 1 Platinum, in Devil May Cry 2 we find 12 Bronze, 17 Silver, 4 Gold and 1 Platinum and finally in Devil May Cry 3, 16 Bronze, 12 Silver, 5 Gold and 1 Platinum. In all cases, the trophies are obtained by progressing in the adventures and satisfying particular requests of the games, from killing the Bosses to completing the missions according to certain votes up to completing the various storylines. Devil May Cry 3 Prequel to the previous two stories, Devil May Cry 3 sees a young Dante grappling with his evil brother Vergil, in a story that initially starts slowly and then becomes decidedly compelling as the adventure continues. It should be noted that the one contained in Devil May Cry HD Collection is the special edition of the game, the one to be clear that also allows you to use the aforementioned Vergil during the adventure and which among other things also boasts extra modes and an unpublished boss. The main novelty of the gameplay of this third chapter, which basically remains anchored on the action and on the joint use of blades, firearms and spectacular acrobatics aimed at obtaining the greatest possible number of Stylish Points, is instead constituted by the presence of four distinct fighting styles that allow you to perform various special moves during the adventure, effectively paving the way for different approaches to the game. There is the Juggler who includes shots and various dodges, the Sword Master, who offers different techniques with this very weapon, the Shooter, who focuses on the use of firearms and finally the Royal Guard which provides the player with the possibility to parry and counterattack. When using a particular style, specific experience points accumulate which end up causing its level to increase, with lots of new moves bestowed at each evolutionary stage. Upgrades can also be purchased for Dante's various weapons, which implies that in order to take advantage of certain skills it is necessarily necessary to equip a particular offensive tool. The game also rewards the variety expressed by the user in terms of combos with a greater distribution of points, inviting him to change Dante's weapons during the same action to create attacks that are as complex as they are devastating, discouraging the repetition of normal blows. So far the positive notes: in negative terms, however, the level of general difficulty should be noted, which despite having been made less difficult than the normal edition of the third chapter still remains high here and the impossibility for the user to be able to save the game during the single mission and therefore having to rely on the availability of specific artifacts to continue from a certain specific point after a departure. These are of two types: yellow, to restart from the beginning of the area where you died; gold color to start over from the exact point where you died. The type of item to use can be selected at the start of the game. Finally, we have a control system that doesn't perfectly handle the process of locking on enemies. In detail, there are some problems when switching between one lens and another, with the hook passing in an apparently arbitrary way tothe furthest opponent rather than the one in Dante's immediate vicinity. Overall, however, this third chapter is still one of the best in the saga and certainly a big step forward, indeed, perhaps more than one, compared to the second. Graphics and retouching Let's conclude our review by taking a look at the technical aspect of the entire trilogy and at the work done by Capcom for this re-proposition in HD. Well, it may sound strange given the very nature of such a product, but the biggest flaw found in the collection is precisely the general graphics sector, which is in itself a clear negative point against it. It should be emphasized that with this comment we are not referring to the textures or other aspects such as the polygons or the conformation of the scenarios, just to give two concrete examples, since it is known that in such productions they are basically the same as the original titles, for which the HD reworking of the same, apart from a greater chromatic brilliance or image definition, cannot have magical effects on the overall vision, transforming what was flat into something complex and in keeping with the potential of the new consoles. Rather the reference to what is written above is to be found in the same way in which all the work was done by Capcom: not only on balance the three Devil May Cry in some points do not seem to have been re-edited in high definition (we are not only referring to movies) and they seem simply readjusted only in screen size, but ironically when you access the game menus the graphics mysteriously go from 16:9 to 4:3. It almost seems that the Japanese software house has worked a little on savings and moreover, at least in certain moments, ~with the left hand~, as they say in the cinematographic field when a director shoots a film almost reluctantly. On the sound front, however, nothing to complain about: the dubbing obviously remains in English and turns out to be excellent in all the chapters present in the collection, the soundtrack does its job well, and the audio effects are more than good. Everything is enhanced by the good work done by the staff who took care of it, and which returns a clean and well-packaged sound to the PlayStation 3.", "date": "2012-04-09", "grade": "7.0"}
