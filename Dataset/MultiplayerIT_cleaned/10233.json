Contrary to forecasts, however, Capcom has decided to convert the game for European and American users: and despite the biblical - and completely unjustified - times that the process required, it was definitely worth it. Cartons to take in cartons Tatsunoko vs Capcom: Ultimate All Stars starts from the foundations laid by the crossovers that came before him, such as the excellent Marvel vs Capcom 2: the title consequently offers the possibility to fight using pairs of characters drawn from the most charismatic ones created by the software Japanese house or among some protagonist heroes of the Tatsunoko anime. The various Ryu, Morrigan, Megaman, Viewtiful Joe and Frank West are therefore joined by names such as those of Ken the Eagle, Yatterman, Kyashan and Tekkaman, certainly capable of making a few tears flow from the eyes of those who grew up on bread and cartoons Japanese. However, Tatsunoko vs Capcom: Ultimate All Stars is anything but a nostalgic operation for its own sake, and proves to be a very fun fighting game and above all capable of achieving an almost perfect balance between immediacy and depth. To begin with, two different control systems are tolerated, reserved for more or less expert players: using a Classic Controller you can therefore amuse yourself with the three buttons assigned to the attack (light, medium and powerful) and with the various super-moves to be performed using the classic ~crescents~, while the Remote + Nunchuck combo simplifies things, deputing all the standard shots to the A key and the special ones to the simultaneous pressure of A and B combined with a direction. In short, Tatsunoko vs Capcom: Ultimate All Stars fully falls into the category of games that are immediate on the surface, but which hide considerable depth. Beyond the excellent variety of moves, counters, tags and beautiful company (which can be chained in the most disparate ways), the title offers a rich dish of content in terms of modes: the lion's share is covered by a comprehensive Arcade section of personalized final sequences for each wrestler, and the inevitable Versus, Training, Survival and Time Attack make a fine show. To these are added a shop where you can spend the points earned on rewards of various kinds, a gallery to observe your trophies and a container of the various, nice minigames made available by Capcom. Dulcis in fundo, this western version of Tatsunoko vs Capcom: Ultimate All Stars boasts an unprecedented online mode, thanks to which you can face other human opponents in friendly or ranked matches: no lag problems emerged from our test, but it is clear how this depends on the type of connection available. In any case, it is a very welcome addition, which further extends the life of a beat'em up already equipped with a quantity of elements well above the average of the category. Great hadouken Although the release of the original dates back more than a year ago, Tatsunoko vs Capcom: Ultimate All Stars can still boast one of the best technical achievements ever on Wii. From a graphic point of view, the game features a completely three-dimensional cosmetics, capable of reaching peaks of absolute spectacularity. First of all thanks to polygonal models treated in an obsessive way, all equipped with top animations, fluid and very well linked to each other: the excellence of these two aspects is also underlined by the zoom and dynamic shots that accompany the execution of the special moves, capable of crackling choreographic effects. Therefore, the light effects are also excellent - of which the clashes are literally submerged - while the downside is made up of sometimes rather rough backdrops, which evidently had to settle for the leftovers of the polygon count manageable by the game engine. Also in terms of character design there is something to be happy about: even the most uncompromising fans of the Tatsunoko heroes will appreciate the skill with which their favorites have been reproduced, both in terms of the pure and simple look, both for the special attacks at their disposal, more often than not representative of actions seen in the television series. Closes the roundup a csound department absolutely up to the task, with perfectly themed voices and music. In short, even if orphans of Street Fighter IV, Wii users can now console themselves with a beat'em up that is certainly different from the last chapter of the historic saga, but still worthy of being taken into consideration by every fan of the genre: at the expense of a lower technical rate, Tatsunoko vs Capcom: Ultimate All Stars offers a very high fun factor, and a quantity of content that will keep it alive for a long time within the player of the Nintendo console.", "date": "2010-01-25", "grade": "8.8"}
