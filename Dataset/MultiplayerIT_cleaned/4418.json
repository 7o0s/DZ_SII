The conclusion of the Middle-earth: Shadow of War campaign brought a bitter end to the Talion saga, but the lands of Mordor still have stories to tell, two to be exact. The first is precisely The Sword of Galadriel, a narrative expansion set halfway between the ~standard~ and the ~definitive~ ending of the Monolith Productions title, which puts us in the shoes of the elf Eltariel. Her confrontation with Sauron did not go in the best way, and the skilled warrior found herself without two fingers, helplessly witnessing the fusion between the Dark Lord and Celebrimbor that gave birth to the famous ~eye~. However, Eltariel's task has not yet been completed: Galadriel sent her to Mordor to take care of the Nazgul and this threat is still concrete, also because their ranks can count on a new, fearsome element. Having recovered the New Ring and with it some unpublished abilities related to light, the deadly ~blade of Galadriel~ therefore finds itself facing a new mission within four settings already seen in the main campaign: Cirith Ungol, Gorgoroth, Nurnen and Seregost. The pursuit of unhappiness The Blade of Galadriel includes eleven main quests and over twenty side quests. The latter are basically based on duels with special orcs who, once defeated, will give us their equipment: a way like any other to increase Eltariel's skills in view of the final battle. In this regard, the skill tree is completely new, designed specifically for the lethal elf: the powers that can be unlocked allow her to ~illuminate~ enemies and disrupt them by throwing projectiles of light at them, activate light bombs, leave traps and also use the bow to create devastating explosions. It is a rather complete set, with some powers even superfluous compared to the challenge we will have to face. The ability to throw beams of light with which to saturate the opponents, for example, will only be useful during the early stages and at the end, but we can safely put it aside to fall back on more traditional approaches throughout the central part of the expansion. We completed the package in just over three and a half hours, however leaving behind numerous secondary quests and special challenges, which means that the total duration of the DLC can easily reach five hours, justifying the sale price of 14.99 euros . However, the value of The Blade of Galadriel goes beyond the mere substance or the presence of unpublished situations, which in fact are in hiding: you have to play it more than anything else for its narrative value, given that it provides a cross-section of Talion's history that covers the ~hole between the conclusion of the endgame and the much talked about sequence of the ~true ending~. An ogre for a friend While waiting for the latest expansion, The Desolation of Mordor, in which we will take on the role of Captain Baranor, the missions included in The Blade of Galadriel are enough to satiate any residual desire to try their hand at spectacular fights, silent eliminations and engaging challenges drawing to the solid mechanics of Middle-earth: Shadow of War. On a narrative level, the best parts are those in which Talion also appears, and one in particular could even move you if you are (rightly!) attached to the protagonist of the series, with his dramatic background. In between there are pleasant stories and nothing more, in which we will meet new orcs with whom to ally in view of the important battle that awaits us. Each main quest differs in its combat modes: in one situation we will find ourselves targeting dragons from the top of a tower together with an expert marksman, in another we will be blowing up barrels while a huge beast chases us, and in another etc. There are no substantial changes compared to the many things done in the basic campaign, as already mentioned, but there is no shortage of variety and it would have been nice to find something different also on the side missions front, which are limited to single fights as they become more complex for the conquest of weapons and objects of greater prestige. In conclusion, The Blade of Galadriel is perhaps not the perfect expansion that some expected, but it provides an important final look at the history of Talion, involving us in a series of very beautiful fights even if never as complex and chaotic as those that characterize The War of the Shadows. However, Eltariel's new abilities are interesting and provide some pleasant alternative maneuvers during larger battles, when the opponents are really numerousdare and it may be convenient to resort to the powers deriving from the light. On a technical level, nothing to say: the goodness of the initial system is confirmed, although it would have been legitimate to expect more from the use of HDR: the many landscapes of Mordor are rarely enriched by the game's lighting system.", "date": "2018-02-09", "grade": null}
