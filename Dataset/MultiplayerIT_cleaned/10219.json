Let it dry, then take some crayons and draw whatever you want. Recycling is useful and fun (?) as just demonstrated, whether it's a simple household waste collection or working with polyvinyl chloride to produce pipes for the drainage of liquids. In videogames the situation is similar, with previously expressed ideas, code and assets that are often taken up, processed and then used again. The latest downloadable content for Dragon Age: Origins, Return to Ostagar, follows this recycling path - too bad it fails to achieve a noteworthy result. Sometimes they come back The pack sells for 400 Microsoft Points, or the equivalent of five dollars in BioWare points, for PC users and the same amount on PlayStation 3, and adds a new quest obtainable through a new marker placed on the map, making it available at any time after the end of the prologue. Nothing new on the assignment methods therefore, with the player called to return a second time to Ostagar, place of the pitched battle from which the events told during the adventure begin, for a recovery mission that will see the Gray Wardens at search for some documents belonging to King Cailan, apparently of vital importance for the delicate balance of the battle against La Prole. In short, another critical situation to unravel, going a second time in an Ostagar for the occasion cloaked in a thick blanket of snow, with the player intent on retracing many environments already seen during his training course, reliving their suggestions thanks to some flashback movies. The idea in and of itself is not bad at all since somehow the need was felt to go back to such a significant place in the experience economy and the finding of important objects, such as Dunchan's weapons and armor by Cailan, don't mind, unfortunately the good premises are resolved in the cleaning of the environments, with some new opponents who make their appearance but a flatness in the level design justifiable if it were a normal quest, certainly not in the case of an additional content payment from which you should expect the exposure of some new idea, if not a real experimentation. The scarce hour of gameplay therefore flows without jolts and is always the same, with a shaman intent on summoning enemy after enemy and placed in the role of final mini-boss who does not understand where he comes from and what he wants, a heavy sense of deja-vu but above all the quite sensational inability - by the standards of the game and BioWare - to convincingly narrate what could have been an interesting story about events already settled in the player's head.", "date": "2010-02-01", "grade": "5.0"}
