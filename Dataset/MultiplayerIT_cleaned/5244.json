For this reason, one of the predominant trends of the last period is to assemble new games by taking pieces of ideas and solutions from existing titles, in the hope of obtaining a final result that has a different taste than usual. Maximum Car fully falls into this category, sporting Minecraft-esque graphics, an OutRun-esque setting, and gameplay elements reminiscent of Burnout. Let's find out if it's a winning mix. Traffic block As can be seen from the caps lock used for the title, Maximum Car is a product that refuses any hint of sobriety and elegance to bet everything on a ~tamarro~ feeling taken to the extreme, with the positive and negative consequences of the case: if therefore certain exaggerations make you smile, others prove to be extremely annoying, such as the vocal comments - however recorded with a very bad quality - which underline every salient action performed by the player. But let's go in order, starting to describe a playful structure that openly refers to a classic like OutRun, with the user having to drive his own car within courses characterized by enormous carriageways, long straight stretches and gentle curves to be tackled rigorously in drift. The short tutorial that accompanies the first steps in the game is more than enough to assimilate the simple controls designed by the developers: the acceleration is automatic, so you only have to worry about touching the edges of the screen to steer and swipe up to two sides of the car respectively to release the turbo or launch a missile. The main purpose of each of the Maximum Car races is in fact to arrive first at the finish line by overtaking or destroying all the opponents in front of us, using the rockets just mentioned or performing real Burnout-style takedowns, thus hitting a competitor car at high speed. However, the similarities with the famous Criterion racing saga do not stop here, since the player is rewarded for his unscrupulous driving, obtaining bonus points for overtaking, dodging, drifting and seconds spent in the opposite traffic lane. Everything works quite well, without acute details and with some fairly evident design ingenuity: as fun and immediate as it is, Maximum Car struggles to hide a certain underlying paucity, which manifests itself with tracks that all seem a bit the same and a palpable inconsistency of opponents who end up being little more than moving targets. Perhaps it is also for this reason that the developers have decided to adopt a much less common monetization system in the context of free to play: instead of demanding real money to unlock new cars to use on the track (which can instead be purchased with tokens that are generously donated based on one's driving performance), Maximum Car behaves like an arcade cabinet, demanding payment of a sum in order to be enjoyed by the player. You can get around that by allowing time between games or agreeing to watch commercials, but it's still a choice that will undoubtedly displease more than a few. Just as the ~cubic~ graphic design of the product is not for everyone, which makes it look almost like a Minecraft mod, making it undoubtedly typical but also very far from being spectacular. Maximum Car is fun, but tends to deplete its turbo quite quickly", "date": "2016-10-11", "grade": "7.0"}
