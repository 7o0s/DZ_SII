Fortunately this void has been filled by Play Pretend with the present here Le Parker: Sous Chef Extraordinaire, a title that tries to decline a classic gameplay with a bizarre but in its own fascinating culinary drift ... Le Parker: Sous Chef Extraordinaire is nice and graceful, but ultimately a little bland I'm sous chef, you are princess The player takes on the role of chef Parker, a legendary kitchen artist capable of making meringues so light that they can almost float: this skill of his is unfortunately disliked by the wicked ruler of the kingdom, who decides to imprison the princess, steal Parker's recipe for use her for his own evil purposes (evidently related to raising his cholesterol) and banish him from the castle. The aim of the adventure will therefore be to go through 32 levels fraught with pitfalls and enemies, recover the kitchen tools of the protagonist, save the damsel in distress and put the meringue formula back in the hands of its creator. Le Parker: Sous Chef Extraordinaire is both wacky and original in its narrative premises as well as classic - not to say banal - in the playful setting, which is inspired by the boundless tradition of two-dimensional platformers, fishing here and there without adding anything really new. The markedly vertical level design (with reachable areas above and below the camera point of view) is reminiscent of the Sonics of the 16-bit era, but the gameplay is more Mario-like, with enemies to avoid or defeat by jumping on his head and macarons that play the role of coins to collect to increase your supply of lives. Unfortunately, Le Parker: Sous Chef Extraordinaire is not inspired by the masters of the past as far as the control system is concerned, which here is extremely slippery and not very reactive: also the fault of a virtual pad that is really too small (strangely the options allow you to move it but do not to increase its size) which in our experience often ignored the inputs, leaving the protagonist at the mercy of events for a few brief but decisive moments. This is not the only technical aspect that the developers seem to have culpably overlooked: even the impossibility of reducing the zoom or at least moving the camera up or down to make sure that the areas outside the frame are explorable is a mistake blue pencil for a title that focuses heavily on the exploration of levels. Defects that in any case can be corrected with an update, while no patch will be able to remedy the greatest limitation of Le Parker: Sous Chef Extraordinaire, or that of being a cute and competent platformer but substantially devoid of acute notes. The adventure flows without giving great emotions either from the point of view of a decidedly bland level design or from the point of view of a level of challenge calibrated downwards, which can provide some additional stimulus only if you aim to discover all the secrets and beat the records in each stage. This does not mean that the Play Pretend product is a bad platformer: on the contrary, for the very low price it is offered, the game has the great merit of offering valid gameplay and a fairly substantial adventure without resorting to sneaky in-app purchases. advertisements and various half-bakes to which we are sadly accustomed these days. However, it is a title that struggles to excite, and which is likely to end up by the wayside in the short term. It's a pity, because in terms of stylistic choices and the audiovisual sector, the developers had decidedly got it right: in addition to the peculiar setting we already talked about at the beginning, Le Parker: Sous Chef Extraordinaire can boast really pleasant pixel art graphics embellished by a great attention to detail and a sound accompaniment perfectly in line with the fairy-tale tone of the story.
