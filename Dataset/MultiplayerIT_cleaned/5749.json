This, in essence, the incipit that forms the backdrop to The Westport Independent, a censorship simulator developed by a small Swedish software house and published by Coffee Stain Studios, the same behind Goat Simulator. Let's start immediately by saying that the similarities, from a graphic point of view, with Papers, Please are truly multiple and, if it weren't for the thanks to Lucas Pope in the final credits, one could easily shout plagiarism outright, but unfortunately the things in common between the two titles remain limited to a mere stylistic and functional comparison; the gameplay is far too sparse, since in the role of editor-in-chief you only need to select the paragraphs to censor, the appropriate title for the article and the editor to assign the publication to, all actions that require no more than a tap or click with the mouse and a few seconds of brain activity to complete the layout of our wonderful newspaper. Later in the story we will be asked to move some sliders to define the user target to aim for in order to increase sales and popularity among the crowd, with the consequent influence of public opinion regarding the burning issues that will appear on our desk; once the layout has also been fixed, we move on to a small interlude cutscene that sees fellow journalists as protagonists and we start all over again, for 12 weeks - or shifts - which are equivalent to about 40 minutes of play in total. Obviously a title like this makes its replayability factor the cornerstone on which to build the experience and to leave the user the freedom to discover what conflicting choices lead to during the exploration phase, but in this case we are sorry to note that, once once the adventure, the interest fades faster than you can imagine. The Westport Independent unfortunately fails to convey great emotions to the player This yes, this no As previously mentioned, the similarities with Papers, Please are undeniable and to fully understand the reasons behind this criticism of The Westport Independent you need to take a step back and start from the title by Lucas Pope: what made the game a classic is not both the gameplay, which is still excellent, but the story and the empathy that it manages to convey through a handful of well-crafted dialogues. You can decide to operate as the most impassive of border inspectors but it is still difficult to remain indifferent to the vicissitudes involving all those who are waiting to enter Arstotzka, whether they are scoundrels or simply husbands waiting to be reunited with their loved one. Thanks to the alternative endings that embrace a narrative framework that affects both the personal and the broader state spheres, Papers, Please has succeeded in an almost titanic feat, namely that of making an actually very boring job interesting. The Westport Independent, on the other hand, fails on all these fronts: the ability to arouse empathy in the player that makes such a title truly attractive and pushes the user to try and try different solutions to reach different endings is completely missing. Without these fundamental features, the game is just a sequence of screens that follow each other up to a totally anticlimactic and uninteresting ending even for those who manage to follow the vicissitudes of poor journalists week after week. Between one section and another there are some dialogues in which the editors comment on some of the news, but even in this case the information you have about your colleagues is given with a dropper and it doesn't matter if the most subversive among them is arrested point blank for suspected activities with anti-government rebels, since in the end we cared very little about his fate from the outset. Unfortunately, as you may have understood, despite the interesting concept, the developers have not managed to materialize a product that could have instantly become a classic, and instead we are faced with a bunch of good ideas exploited really badly.", "date": "2016-01-27", "grade": "5.5"}
