In short, you can have the most shocking chips available and the most micronic hardware in the world but if you then find yourself having to rely on a virtual joypad drawn on the screen, all the most promising premises risk failing miserably. Here are the solid foundations on which Drag'n'Boom is based: a control system designed perfectly within the possibilities offered by the touch screen, as required by the best tradition of mobile action games. It is a question of guiding a ferocious dragon within various levels, making it slide along the surfaces of these in order to pick up speed and take flight for short aerial sections, without disdaining the total destruction of all the elements that hinder its progress between soldiers, knights, fortifications and other unfortunate enemies. The movement system recalls the old and always valid Tiny Wings, but the addition of fire control is applied to its setting by one touch and away, which makes everything more complex by introducing a two-handed control complete with slow-motion for ensure greater precision and spectacularity to the whole. On board a dragon to control with two fingers: that's what Drag'n'Boom is Flame party The control system takes a few minutes to be assimilated, being based on the coordination between movement and fire, to be constantly adjusted with the use of both hands also to follow the intricate progress of the levels, with their undulating surfaces. The pace of the game is very fast, but to simplify everything comes the slow motion: the slow motion is not only a scenographic solution of a certain impact, but it also becomes essential to be able to manage the dragon's fire in the best way, giving all the time to act with extreme precision regardless of the angle and speed of movement. Indeed, the problem is the possibility of being able to abuse this feature, which tends to simplify the mechanics of the action too much: there is no limit to the use of slow motion, so at any time you can keep your finger pressed on the screen and keep the slow motion active at will, thus allowing you to dodge attacks, plan your moves and strike with extreme precision from a condition of almost invincibility. This, in addition to a level design that does not offer particular stimulating challenges, represents the main defect of a game that is also very fun in its early stages, thanks above all to the satisfaction that derives from such a dynamic and reactive control system. In short, driving the dragon around the levels is a real pleasure, and the insertion of various objectives to be completed with the various connected reward tiers stimulates the exploration and completion of the numerous stages with maximum commitment, looking in this way to get as many coins as possible in order to unlock the upgrades of the little dragon.", "date": "2017-09-20", "grade": "6.5"}
