{"name": "The Dog Island - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-dog-island-recensione.html", "text": "The last time we had to deal with cuddly and cuddly puppies was certainly when we had a copy of Nintendogs in our hands. Numerous other titles dedicated to animals in general and dogs in particular have since been placed on the market, with the force of an invasion of locusts, almost, we dare say. But it was with The Dog Island on Wii that for the first time we returned to experience real puppyish inclinations in front of the virtual representation of a puppy. It will probably be due to the enormously disproportionate truffles, which make the expressions of Dog Island dogs even more begging for affection and caresses, it will perhaps be due to their representation that somehow manages to interpret the eyes with which we look at our puppies, real or desired that they are, beetles beautiful to their mothers or titled by pedigreed aristocrats somehow the dogs of Dog Island know how to strike and sink the heart of anyone who loves the wagging beings who accompany our lives. Let's see if they can also have fun. Ucci ucci I smell the In an unusual way, compared to what has been proposed to us so far, we are not dealing with a simulator of some kind, whether it is training, veterinary, breeding or as possibly insertable in a video game from human knowledge. Rather, it is an adventure title with RPG elements, albeit bland. A sort of elementary Wind Waker mixed with Animal Crossing with dogs and other animals as protagonists, which will lead us to explore different settings, dialogue with a good number of characters and, in general, to experience all the complexity of the articulation of a story and its development. The first thing we are asked to do is to choose the breed of dog we want to interpret, among about fifty possibilities. It will therefore not be difficult to find your own race of the heart. Arrange our four-legged appearances we will be introduced to the actual game, through a series of small tutorials that will teach us to sniff around, paw, dig holes and do all this (or almost, nobody teaches us how to get up with the paw) what a dog can do. And much more, because the animals are all humanized and reside in a real canine country. With lots of festivities and fairs, postmen and shopkeepers. It therefore seems obvious that one of the first things we will be called to do will be to go home, where our adventure will begin to take on its connotations and where we will get to know our four-legged family and its vicissitudes. Paws on the shoulder In fact, at home we will find our mother worried about our little sister (or little brother) suffering from some mysterious disease that no one is able to cure. A bad relapse will force us to put out into the deep and follow in the footsteps of our father, of whom we have not heard since he set off in search of a doctor who is believed to be able to heal the sick puppy. The goal is Dog Island, which gives its name to the game and which we will reach on board a somewhat pirate-like ship whose toll we will pay with mops on the deck and fishing from the bow gangway. A storm, a dive between waves and rocks and some highly dramatic interludes that will lead us to palpitate for the puppy with whom we will not have failed to establish an emotional bond. We will then finally reach our destination, where the game will really begin, between explorations and missions of various kinds. The controls are quite simple to manage, after a few minutes of practice, everything happens through the simple pointing of the Wiimote and a skilful management of its keys. It is basically a game based on simplicity and relaxation, even enemies like snakes and bears manage to be tender and tend to fall asleep rather than chase us. The environments are quite large and guarantee several hours of exploration in environments inspired by various environmental and geographical types. From the Alps to the pyramids In our travels we will encounter pyramids and forests, snowy landscapes and deserts, making our adventure almost epic for a globetrotting puppy. We will also have the support of shops in which to buy potions and some objects, while to feed ourselves we can range in the not too large spectrum of possibilities that nature offers, at least in the game: fruit and insects. Not a big diet, but enough to sustain us. The RPG elements are extremely limited and more sideline than real meaning. Either way, we have levels to climb, health to increase, and our noses to sharpen. Graphically, the game does not show any particular claim, focusing almost completely on the characteraction of the characters, really cute, above all thanks to the exaggeration of the big wet noses that make their expressions particularly tender, while the environments are detailed in a much lower quality measure. However, they are pleasant, in their cartoonish style that somehow manages to overcome the limit of graphic detail, giving a pleasant and pleasant environment in which to move. Not Animal Crossing caliber, probably, but certainly acceptable. What really strikes you in terms of quality is the game's soundtrack, truly of rare beauty, thanks to some acoustic guitar pieces that really surprised us and contributed substantially to the enjoyment of the title. The sound effects are rather meager, however, more in variety than in quality. We would have liked some more modulation in the barks, for example, or in general in the effects deriving from the actions and vocalizations of the other characters. Comment The game essentially remains a product dedicated to a young audience, which it will not fail to conquer thanks to the tenderness of the puppies, probably irresistible even for a slice of older users who could find themselves bubbling secretly in the secret of their living room. A title with a certain charisma, unfortunately limited only by the repetitiveness of the missions that prevent it from being a little gem of its kind. The graphics could have been slightly more refined, making it more modern and less like a PS2 title, something that Wii too often settles on. The same thing goes for the sound sector, which while enjoying really beautiful guitars falls short on effects. Missions and mini-games are repetitive after a while and limit the enjoyment of the gameplay. A game that remains a really good and enjoyable product, for just missing the luster of more famous and better cared for titles. Absolutely recommended for young children and teenagers, but also for adults who want a few moments of tenderness and carefree adventures. Finally, the budget price at which it is sold should be taken into consideration. Pros Tender adventure for children, but also for adults Emotionally engaging Budget price Cons Repetitive missions and minigames Limited sound effects Environment graphics too close to PS2", "date": "2008-05-21", "grade": null}
