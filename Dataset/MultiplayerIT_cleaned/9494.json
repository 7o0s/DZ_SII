The game structure, with fairly short but challenging levels, makes it perfect for quick and easy use, without many thoughts or worries. The graphic style is what obviously makes a flying hamster (the protagonist) more likeable and fun: bright colors, strong colors like a Japanese cartoon (which anime culture is notoriously pervaded by this type of pet). The history of horizontal (and vertical) scrolling shooters is indeed full of bizarre characters: wizards, winged knights, robots, spaceships, but no one had ever dared so much. As a result, all the contouring also fits into the overall tone of the game. The cast of enemies is varied and in line with the hero of the adventure: so here are bees, goats, chickens, moles, giant sunflowers, brown bears, Egyptian penguins, but also very angry mushrooms. And the beauty is that our primary weapon is ... a nice spit! On the merry farm! Flying Hamster's fauna and flora are made up of dozens of bizarre characters, animals and plants not so much for their being in themselves, but rather for the context in which they are inserted and for the actions they perform (penguins in Egypt? Flying onions?! ). The game structure is in any case the classic one of any shooter of this type; we travel from left to right, and where the ~screen~ automatically moves in that direction, we are free to move in all directions, but being able to shoot (indeed, spit) only to the right. As in any good shoot'em up, the secondary fire is activated by holding down the key used for the primary, and our rodent friend can temporarily ~upgrade~ his spit by drinking beers or gulping berries. Apart from these momentary upgrades, there is no system for equipping the protagonist with objects or for improving his performance in battle, and for this reason the depth of the title is inevitably decidedly low (as one would expect from a title designed to entertain a few minutes on one smartphones, after all). The 1:1 touch control works perfectly, except for sporadic cases in which control of the rodent is momentarily lost. It is also true that among the options we are given the possibility to customize the control system and the automatic fire, but in essence the default one is the best. The six levels of Flying Hamster offer, despite their decided brevity, a broad glimpse of landscapes, colors, settings and enemies. The game makes use of the possibility of activating the Game Center or OpenFeint to put your scores online, but in general the ~replay value~, or the ability of the title to know how to renew and re-play, is quite low. Once all the levels have been completed, a higher difficulty is unlocked through unprecedentedly colored schemes and with tougher enemies / bosses to take down. The graphics, as already mentioned, are very colorful and super detailed (on Iphone 4G it's a real show!), full of details and nuances.
