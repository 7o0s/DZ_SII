Also this time the quality is very high, but it may not be enough for those who have already spent hundreds of hours with the previous Splatoon 2; consequently, five years have passed since the last chapter and in the meantime something like another ninety million Switches have been sold: Splatoon 3 is here for them too. True competitive Splatoon 3: whoever inks the most wins here! For the uninitiated, Splatoon is a true competitive game, where you shoot at each other (or rather, splatter), but only jets of color. Knocking out the opponent is a fundamental strategy, unlike other similar products, however, it's not the most important: colors are a weapon, but they are mainly used to paint the maps with the shade assigned to your team. The winner will not be the team that has ~splatted~ more enemies, but the one who has painted a greater area than the opponent with their own color. Of course, teams can recolor areas already captured by the enemy, and various weapons and special abilities will make battles more varied and strategically interesting. At any time, it will be possible to transform into a small squid that will be able to move much faster if addressed to the splatted parts of the color of your team, simultaneously recharging the ink which will allow it to continue hitting the map and enemies. An interesting, original concept able to offer the youngest a gateway to a genre that is usually unable to free itself from the violence (even just verbal: I don't kill you but, in fact, I splat you) in which it was born and in which it has since thrived. In Splatoon everything is vibrant, happy, sunny, bright, but in a different way from other Nintendo games. Because Splatoon is also modern, seductive, it doesn't have to honor any classic of the past and 100% represents the new generation of key figures in the organization chart of the Japanese electronic entertainment giant. The father of the game is the forty-year-old Shintaro Sato and Seita Inoue belongs to the same generation, in Splatoon 3 promoted from chief artist to director. Veteran Nisashi Nogami leads the orchestra, because a producer with ten more years of experience never hurts. That explains why Splatoon looks so different from other Nintendo games, while clearly remaining a product created in the hallowed workshops of Kyoto. There's no two without three Splatoon 3: special cannons, timed shields, explosive sharks to ride... there are several power-ups added in this third game The first Splatoon was a test, one of the successful ones since in Japan it turned into a new craze in the blink of an eye. The first Splatoon, however, also had the misfortune to debut on WiiU, a disastrously selling console, remaining in the West that game you've probably heard of, but never had the pleasure of trying. Like many WiiU games, Splatoon also had to wait for the arrival on Switch to reach well-deserved sales: released in 2017, after five years Splatoon 2 manages to place more than thirteen million copies worldwide. This third game serves to provide the series with new growth margins, the Splatoon 2 infrastructure had clearly reached its limit, and conquer those who had miraculously remained outside until today, even if only for simply personal reasons. Revolution postponed Splatoon 3: while waiting for the match to start, it is possible to stretch the brushes in this area Surely Splatoon 3 was not designed to revolutionize the series and it is not even said that there is a need. In terms of fundamental game mechanics, this third chapter is practically identical to its predecessor: the modes are conceptually the same, the progression system hasn't changed one iota, the structure of the battlefields and the central hub lends itself to same needs. If you are looking for concrete innovations, you will find them among the equipment and in a renewed story mode which however takes up and expands what was added through the Octo Expansion for Splatoon 2. It is not much, much more could have been done, but this is not it why this third game looks slightly out of focus. A cold welcome Splatoon 3: Splatville is a really fascinating hub, but its use does not differ much from what we saw in the previous game If for the veterans the critical element is the lack of relevant innovations, for the new recruits it is the surprising absence of an introduction worthy of the name and in grado, as in the previous chapters, to make you immediately understand what kind of experience you have in front of you and what you are required to do in the first hours in the company of Splatoon 3. It is not a big problem for long-time fans, who will still have to resume the orientation, but newcomers risk feeling terribly lost. A greater emphasis on introducing the user to the game world would also have helped him feel more at ease, while in the case of Splatoon 3 it happens that you find yourself in no time at the center of the albeit splendid Splatville, but without understand why. The only element that immediately draws attention is this strange old man who, from the grates of a drainage ditch, waves his arms to attract our attention... Agent 3 is back! Splatoon 3: the new pair of announcers is actually a trio That slot is nothing but the way that will take us directly to the delightful single player mode of Splatoon 3, seven abundant hours of gameplay, but able to offer dozens of different challenges, as well as the possibility of trying almost all the weapons present and well before to unlock them in multiplayer. How it works is simple: the world is divided into several islands and each one will be covered in a slime that can kill us instantly, but which we can dissolve by upgrading our cannon with salmon roe. To find them, we'll have to access the different levels that will be revealed just as the slime disappears, until we've cleaned up a large part, or entirely, of the island. At that point we'll move on to the next one. Multifaceted and compelling Splatoon 3: greetings from friend Salmonello, irreplaceable companion of the single player mode The beauty of the levels is that sometimes they allow you to choose the weapon, others will impose one, others will take it away completely forcing us to rely on the cockerel Salmonello, which we will be able to throw around letting him do the dirty work such as destroying crates, attacking enemies and operate mechanisms. Sometimes Splatoon's single player will have the breath of a puzzle game, while in some levels it will take on the role of an all-round action, consequently you will hardly get bored before you get to the final boss. However, we are still far from what a single-player title, even from Nintendo itself, would offer: this mode remains an offshoot of multiplayer, and it's a bit of a shame given how it has grown compared to Splatoon 2 and how much unexploited potential would remain to be value. Wouldn't it be nice to have a Splatoon where single player and multiplayer finally had the same dignity? Welcome Splatter Splatoon 3: Splatoon is a simple and fun pastime, but will it be deep enough to last long enough? A Splatoon full of minigames would also be nice, since Splatville hides everything from air hockey tables to cabinets of all shapes and colors, yet the only way to interact directly with others is to choose a competitive mode, with no lobbies in common. Actually, a new minigame has been added to Splatoon 3, and it's not all bad. During the gameplay we will in fact be able to collect cards to be used to play Splattanza. In this game the goal is always the same, to color the battlefield here divided into squares; to do this, however, we will not have to fire a single shot, but play the cards that we have selected for our battle deck in turn. Splatoon is a simple but fun pastime, a perfect description even for Splatoon itself, but will it also be deep enough to remain interesting for months or even years? We can't put our hand on fire... Lots of little news Splatoon 3: The Salmon Run is the co-op mode of Splatoon and supports up to four players simultaneously The other modes have also received interesting changes, or fun variations on the theme. The Splatfests, special days in which users will be divided into teams linked to a contrast of elements, such as mayonnaise against ketchup, can now also provide for the presence of a third team. This small change leads to much more chaotic battles than in the past, three minutes of wild splattates that will put all the participants' reflexes and nerves to the test. Splatoon 3 also returns Salmon Runs, or the cooperative mode of the Nintendo game that sees four different players work together to defeat increasingly powerful waves of Salmonoids and bosses, while trying to collect as many eggs as possible. In Splatoon 3 players will finally be able to pass the eggs exactly like a rugby ball, to put them safely in the appropriate basket in a much faster and strategically starting way.centenary than in the past. Note that Salmon Runs will now always be available, whereas in Splatoon 2 they only activated at certain times of the week and day. Color anarchy Splatoon 3: if you have any saves from Splatoon 2, you can pour them into the new game so you don't have to start all over again Paradoxically, the mode that has been tweaked the least in the mechanics is the main one. The Mollusc Scrum will be introduced through friendly matches up to the fifth level, then we will be able to test our skills in the ranked, in this third Splatoon renamed Anarchist Matches, in turn divided into different regulations (the classic Splat Zone, Mobile Tower, Bazookarp and Vongo Gol ) that will timidly change the course of the game... in the end it will always be essential to ink the level more than the opponent. Maps and modes will alternate every hour so that different times of day give users different experiences, just like in the previous Splatoon. The new special abilities that can be activated by pressing the right analog, and the new combinations of power-ups that we can assemble by customizing our character, will make the Melee Mollusca fresher. Each shoe, weapon, accessory and dress will bring different power-ups as a dowry: there are already a myriad of these to collect by playing, and just as many will come in the form of downloads. Among the many new more or less useful gadgets, the motor shark and the mollusk stand out: the first will allow us to launch ourselves at full speed towards an enemy by coloring the route and exploding at the destination, while the second is a power that allows lightning-fast movements around the field of battle by transforming their arms into extendable tentacles. Squeegee and Calamarchi Splatoon 3: The new levels aren't particularly graphically rich, but their design is totally devoted to fun There are also several brand new weapons in Splatoon 3. During our test, however, we were only able to consistently test two of these: the blade wiper, designed for players who prefer melee and speed above everything else, and the extraordinary squid. The calamarco, as the name suggests, is a very special bow capable of firing three different shots at the same time; the most interesting thing is that the amplitude of the three colored bullets decreases over time, but their strength increases. If you fire immediately, you have three distinct and well spaced shots, if you wait to fire the three bullets will approach hitting the same target in unison. It doesn't end there: the calamarco can fire the three shots horizontally and, if you let go of the trigger while jumping, vertically. The squid is undoubtedly one of the best additions: it is versatile but you have to learn how to use it, but it prefers medium distances. The special shots are much more varied than before and can provide help both in attack and defense, to the player who uses them and in some cases even to the whole team nearby; they also have more concrete effects on the playing field, which makes them much more flashy and fun to use and suffer. Sessantaeffepiesse Splatoon 3: what will be your favorite weapon? Graphically Splatoon 3 is very, very similar to Splatoon 2. There are better blur effects and character animations are much smoother than before. The 60fps are guaranteed during the matches, but some drops have been glimpsed in the central hub: the beautiful Splatville pays the price of loading a lot of details on the small Nintendo console. The music is superlative as always, in full continuity with what was heard in the previous two games. Other interesting new features of Splatoon 3 above all concern the so-called ~quality of life~, or that set of functions that make the use of the game more immediate and in some ways fun. Two examples above all: in some modes it will now be possible to stay with a group of players even after the end of a match, and it is finally possible to save and select different equipment kits in order to select them as needed before each battle. Plus, you'll be able to transfer your Splatoon 2 save to Splatoon 3 in just a few convenient steps, so you don't have to start from scratch.", "date": "2022-09-07", "grade": "8.5"}
