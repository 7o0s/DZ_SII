{"name": "Song Summoner", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/song-summoner_a.html", "text": "The game sees you in the role of Ziggy, a young inhabitant of a world where humans are governed and terrorized by the robots of the Mechanical Militia, heartless machines that aim to eliminate all music, and consequently all emotions and feelings, from the hearts of men. It is precisely these ruthless automatons who kidnap Zero, Ziggy's brother, at the beginning of the game; but the protagonist has in himself a great power, that of being able to use music to create powerful warriors, all he needs is a little training, and to provide it is the Soul Master, who teaches Ziggy all the secrets of his Cube Pendant, the pendant that is the basis of this power. After a few years Ziggy learns everything there is to learn and is finally ready to go in search of his lost brother. The premise is therefore trivial, and the quality of the story does not rise excessively during the missions: the lowest point is represented by the dialogues, simplistic and stereotyped, while to be applauded is the fact that the unraveling of the plot itself introduces, and in a very fast paced, always new gameplay elements. Furthermore, the continuous quotations of songs and historical groups that, starting from the name of the protagonist, fill Song Summoner will make all music lovers smile with pleasure. The Unsung Heroes is a strategic RPG in the vein, most of all, of Final Fantasy Tactics: same 2D isometric view, same movement, turn and combat system. Obviously there are simplifications compared to the classic formula, such as the fact that any character has the same movement capabilities as the others, the few special moves available, the limited size of the maps, the small number of objects to use and the of advancement of the warriors which does not include experience points, but the donation, at the end of each fight, of particular pearls which will be used to advance a character in one of the four available grades, from the lowest Bronze to the highest Platinum. Each point on the map then, as per tradition, does not always and only offer combat but also, for example, shops or a very useful ~Reharsal Room~, in which to advance the level through ~virtual~ fights the characters you have in your team but who have not been in the field often. Overall, the choices made turn out to be successful, because the game is fast and immediate while demonstrating a still considerable complexity, and then, above all, the maps, however small they are, are well made, and the enemies always offer a satisfying challenge, however much the AI is scaled down from the console classics. Furthermore, even the longevity, if we don't expect the levels of the historical sagas on the iPod, is more than enough. The control system, on the other hand, is problematic: intelligently designed to take advantage of the iPod Click Wheel, however, it turns out to be too sensitive. Nothing devastating, but a little annoying. The peculiarity of Song Summoner lies in the fact that the warriors available to Ziggy are born from the songs present on the iPod: in fact, starting from the proposed track, the game chooses both the class of the character (Soldier, Monk, Archer, Knight and Magician), and the characteristics, giving it a vote at the end. Especially in the beginning you will spend a lot of time fiddling with this process, to see what powers of nature will arise from your favorite songs, but probably soon, once you understand the mechanism by which one song performs better than another, you will turn to to building the best team possible and then to the game itself. We won't tell you the mechanism in question, but it turns out to be a bit disappointing in the end, even more so considering that this is where the raison d'tre of this game stops, as it is produced exclusively for the iPod. A good starting point, however, for a possible subsequent evolution. Excellent news on the technical side: the graphics are at the levels of a GBA, benefiting among other things from the excellent quality of the Apple LCD and especially worth mentioning are the artworks, perfectly in line, in style and quality, with the most canonical productions Square Enix. And for a game based on music, the soundtrack could only be up to par: few compositions, but all excellent and which moreover embrace many different musical genres. One final warning: Song Summoner consumes iPod batteries with unprecedented voracity; therefore arm yourself with patience and possibly a power supply! PRO An SRPG through and through Fast and immediate Great graphics, design and music AGAINST Limited character creation A bit banal plot", "date": "2008-08-14", "grade": "S.V."}
