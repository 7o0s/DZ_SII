The second chapter of the Avalanche Studios saga, starting from simple free roaming mechanics, strengthens everything with massive doses of action, delighting the player with extreme freedom of movement. The events narrated in the game are little more than a simple plot of espionage inspiration to stage the destruction of the beautiful island continent of Panau. It is simply a question of playing the triple game with the factions present on site, the indigenous Ular, the Maoist revolutionaries Reaper and the Roach, drug traffickers in good dress, all intent on undermining the local dictatorship and in the meantime carrying out the main mission on behalf of the Agency (read the CIA). SpiderRico There are several peculiarities that distinguish Just Cause 2 from similar titles. The grappling hook is the obvious one, and it takes on almost more importance to Rico than the weapons he wields. It can be used in many ways, both offensively and defensively. The minimum degree allows us to use it to quickly reach, consequently to get out of the way in the most fiery situations, indoor or high places, as if we were a sort of Spiderman in a black leather jacket. In practice, the entire level design is designed to be exploited by the gadget, which hooks a little on all surfaces, and allows us to navigate both vertically and horizontally on the map, greatly expanding our tactical options. However, it does not end here, we can use it to get on the vehicles on the fly, to snatch entrenched enemies from fixed positions, or to make snipers fall from turrets or balconies. It becomes essential when a helicopter starts buzzing overhead, in this case once the aircraft is hooked up we can, after killing the co-pilot, hijack it, but not before passing an easy and repetitive quick time event capable of causing the pilot to crash. It is impossible to write here all the uses of the useful gadget, but if you are particularly good (and lucky) it is also possible to complete entire missions without firing a shot since it can also be used as a sort of white weapon for close quarters. More generally, Just Cause 2 invites us to experiment, to try to use it with the utmost freedom, in fact the island of Panau, its buildings and its inhabitants become a sort of huge playground at the mercy of Rico, who can also jumping into the void using the parachute, making every place virtually reachable, and creating unexpected escape routes, like a ravine which, instead of representing certain death, can be flown over peacefully, leaving the pursuers behind. Search and destroy The progression in the game is marked not so much by the evolution of the situation within the narrative as by a mechanism that recalls ~grinding~ in role-playing games. The island is dotted with hundreds of government installations, from simple antennas to strongholds, via propaganda carts to fuel depots; razing everything to the ground the level of Chaos will rise which over time will unlock new weapons and vehicles but above all new missions, main and secondary. The mechanism works, it eliminates downtime and moments when you don't know what to do, but conversely it devalues the role of the narrative that already suffers from it since it doesn't seem to be a predominant part of the game. In practice, the more you destroy, the more Chaos you sow, the more strongholds you conquer and the sooner new missions will become available. A real grinding in the strict sense that never bores given the freedom of action given by the grappling hook and the dozens of means available, but in fact pushes us to explore the island continuously, never to remain idle , perhaps after twenty or so hours of play many may find the mechanism crafty and unnerving in the long run even if to be honest the respawn of enemies and the various alert levels of the government are never too frustrating. Speaking instead of the diversification of the missions, the work done by Avalanche Studios is certainly good, above all the assignments with multiple dynamics that enhance the role of the grappling hook and the parachute stand out, such as the one that saw us storm a base on top of the mountain , finished then hooked up to a helicopter from which to launch to hijack an enemy convoy on the ground. In general, more than the diversity of objectives, which all revolve around the classic escort, destroy, hijack and conquer, Just Cause 2 excels in the freedom of choice on how to carry outbegin our tasks, in how it is possible to look for the best approach for each situation. The only missions that suffer from repetitiveness are the ~stronghold~ ones in which you have to conquer an enemy base, really all the same, indistinguishable in their enter and destroy, but necessary since the conquered base acts as a headquarters where you can ~rest~ away from enemy attentions . A special mention should be made for the fleet of vehicles available to Rico, very extensive (more than one hundred units) and which includes motorcycles, scooters, quads, different types of cars, boats, civil and attack helicopters, propeller and jet planes, fighters whether commercial or commercial, each equipped with a particular driving model, and speaking of machines that are all too realistic in rendering the roughness of the terrain. Small problems Just Cause 2 is not free from defects which, if they do not affect the gaming experience, however, in fact preclude the road to excellence. It is immediately noticeable how the artificial intelligence is not particularly developed, the enemies, all equipped with good aim, are not capable of concerted movements or outflanking and base their danger only on numerical superiority. In short, the shooter phases lose a lot of bite if faced head-on given the absence of any method of coverage and only the creative use of the grappling hook raises the firefights. Not that they are totally unsuccessful, but facing immobile enemies who get riddled without problems is not exactly comforting, in this sense the extensive use of the grappling hook and the possibilities offered by the level design is most often dictated by the player's desire to experiment by actual needs of the moment. Secondly there are some small problems inherent to the grappling hook such as the difficulty in the most agitated phases of quickly hooking up to the designated area (there is instead a sort of automatic lock on enemies) and what happens when hovering on a helicopter or on the hood of a car it is not uncommon for the aiming system to hit the ball, not allowing us to shoot an enemy who is within the palm of the nose. Small things but that clash overall with the excellent game mechanics. Much more important is the problem concerning the checkpoints. Normally they are well positioned, but in the more complex missions, the activation trigger is linked to particular events and not to the amount of Chaos unleashed or to the progression on the ground, and given that you die a lot in the game, it is tempting to vary ~on the fly~ approach in the most literal sense possible, in the long run it can be frustrating to repeat entire sections. To conclude the examination of the things that don't convince, or rather just don't like Just Cause 2, there is an undoubted value that can turn into a criticality: the vastness of the island. Luckily for us it is practically impossible to get lost since the gps works well and ravines, lakes and mountains are not insurmountable obstacles thanks to the grappling hook/parachute combo (not to mention the helicopters) but it is undeniable that when it is impossible to use the fast transport of the trafficker on the black market, or in an area not previously visited, moving long distances can take up too much time even on board fast jets. The landscape from two thousand meters is incomparable, hold the stick still for several minutes a little less. Playstation 3 trophies Just Cause 2 rewards the player with 51 trophies, 1 platinum, 42 bronze, 3 gold and 5 silver. The bronze ones are not particularly difficult to obtain and are conquered simply by completing the missions or by performing particular moves, which in any case represent the standard game conduct. More challenging are some bronze and gold trophies that require us, for example, to complete the game on the maximum difficulty level or raze 100 military installations to the ground. The Mysterious Island The island of Panau is a real continent, boundless and equipped with an accurate level design, which in addition to designing cities and villages that take full advantage of the peculiarities of the grappling hook, manages to characterize every single area to perfection. Hence, sunny deserts and snow-capped mountain ranges emerge, metropolis bristling with skyscrapers and tangled forests, small villages, mysterious islands with a Lostian flavor, temples, huge port complexes and airports. In Just Cause 2 we are amazed by how the island has been ~filled~ with installations of all kinds, in short, exploration is encouraged, even beyond the simple achievement of the starting point of a mission. All this size and vastness has not made the game engine compromise too much, which does its job quite well, without major pop-up problems or frame rate drops, and above all from above, infree fall or full throttle aboard a fighter jet offers glimpses of great beauty, with bright and gaudy colors, also graced by ~romantic~ sunrises and sunsets. It would seem an almost perfect technical sector, unfortunately, however, not everything goes well. If Rico's model is characterized by good detail, the same thing certainly cannot be said for those of the enemies, all the same and with woody animations to say the least. On the other hand, the buildings and vehicles, whether air, land or naval, are well done, with appreciable textures and also equipped with a realistic system of aesthetic damage. More generally, it is possible to say that although the game sends an entire island to the screen, all explorable from the beginning and without loading in between, the level of detail remains at decidedly high levels and even in some cases it is striking for bump mapping and pyrotechnic effects special. The level of destructibility of the environment is also good, which, although limited almost all the time to ~only~ government buildings (which are several hundred) is capable of upsetting entire bases and installations, gratifying the player's destructive fury.", "date": "2010-03-26", "grade": "8.4"}
