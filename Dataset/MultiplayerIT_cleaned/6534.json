{"name": "Cult of the Lamb", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cult-of-the-lamb-recensione.html", "text": "Video games have always struggled a lot to tell about religion, understood in its broadest and most complex sense. Normally the authors try to connote it in a negative sense, relying on a fairly folkloric and now well-digested iconography, part of pop culture, whereby the faithful are seen as exalted and religious leaders as power-hungry egocentrics. They have hardly tried to represent its dynamics in a more detached and reasoned way, both in narrative games and in those of other genres, strategic aside. But what does it mean to manage a religious sect? Maybe someone who believes in a bloodthirsty deity? Find out by reading the Cult of the Lamb review. The birth of a cult Establishing a religion is not easy Cult of the Lamb begins with the protagonist lamb about to be executed as a heretic. Upon being beheaded, however, he is summoned by a chained deity calling himself The One Who Waits, who gives him the task of running his recently disgraced cult. Since this is the only way to save himself, the lamb accepts and, having eliminated his executioners, begins to work to help his savior. He will therefore have to be able to find faithful and grow the sect, of which he is the absolute head by divine election, simultaneously eliminating some enemy deities, called Bishops, connected to the chains of his benefactor. He will also discover that he is not the first to attempt the feat, since his guardian, i.e. the character who explains all the game mechanics when free, is in fact his predecessor, now too old to continue. From a narrative point of view, the title of Massive Monster, to whom we owe the beautiful platformers The Adventure Pals and Never Give Up, is more or less all here. Events will happen during the game, you will meet several more or less crazy characters and you will begin to understand the nature of our mission, but the narrative will still be very marginal and will often only act as a motivation to direct you towards certain objectives. Let's clarify an important point right away: Cult of the Lamb is more Animal Crossing than an action RPG like The Binding of Isaac or Moonlighter, despite successfully merging the two genres. The simulation model shares more or less the same basic rhetoric of the Nintendo title, albeit with the obvious and clearly visible aesthetic differences. The theoretical point of arrival of both is unlimited growth, which involves a constant accumulation of objects, whether they are structures necessary for the functioning of the community, or simple decorations. In the early stages you certainly spend more time fighting than building, but the further you get into the game, the more you tend to stay out of the dungeons for long periods to talk to the followers and give them tasks, to help them in their needs and to manage the resources available so as to make the sect ever larger and more powerful. Not that the action part is marginalized, but proportionally you are more outside than inside the dungeons. Management stage The cult must be made to flourish As you may have understood, Cult of the Lamb is divided into two distinct sections. In one, the managerial one, the lamb has to deal directly with the cult, building buildings, providing for the primary needs of the followers and making sure that the latter do not lose their faith. For example, it is not the case to make them sleep on the ground, therefore it is better to build beds immediately for them to rest, and it is not even the case to starve them, therefore it is better to start producing food by creating small farms, to then cook the fruits of the Earth. Let's say that in this sense the scheme followed is very classic and a whole series of structures correspond to the need, which not only satisfy it, but also gradually make the community more and more autonomous, so as to save the player time by gradually eliminating the more repetitive tasks. For example, in the beginning the resources are collected by hand, but soon one can equip oneself with structures which allow to entrust the phases of collection, and in some cases of processing, to the adepts. The basic resources are wood, rocks and hours, which we will need continuously for the entire game and which can be developed into semi-finished products, necessary to build more complex buildings. Naturally, the spiritual needs of our community have a central role. Each adept has its own character and tends to respond differently to our actions. For example, a skeptic will see his devotion values rise more slowly, but will be immune to heresies, while a lazy person will lose faith if we make him work too hard. The devotion Devotion is everything What is devotion for? Practically to grow the sect and the character, since it is connected to two distinct albumsyou were of skills, one in which you unlock advanced buildings and level up your cult, the other, more skimpy, in which you unlock skills and powers of the Lamb, linked to the crown that The One Who Waits gave him at the beginning of the game. In fact, it is around the devotion that the authors have focused their vision of religion, with the most faithful adepts who are seen as useful idiots and the more independent ones as problematic, excellent to sacrifice to frighten others, or to be put in stocks to be re-educated, so as to gain more power. In reality, the tones of the entire game go in the same direction, with the followers who are ultimately simply resources to be exploited for the purposes of The One Who Waits and to make the sect ever stronger and more efficient. Some might see it as a critique of capitalism, as well as religion, but in reality the game system invites the player to become what he theoretically would like to satirize, prompting him to develop strategies to exploit his subordinates with ever greater efficiency, with the latter no chance is given to really subvert the system. The tools available to the Lamb are different and, if desired, they allow the worship to be sweetened, making it less ruthless, but they never give the possibility of overthrowing it. In particular, after building the temple, you access a series of options that allow you to further customize the creed of the community. By interacting with the central altar, it becomes possible to hold sermons, or use the crowns obtained by carrying out missions and overcoming dungeons to launch new doctrines, essentially religious precepts that can unlock rituals or that simply serve as an address for the sect. The graphics are nice For example, it can be ensured that the presence of the elderly increases the devotion of the followers, or that they do not complain by eating very poor dishes. If the doctrines end up being the most important form of characterization of the cult, the aforementioned rituals are its most spectacular manifestation. Each ritual allows you to obtain different effects on the community. For example, with one you can increase the general devotion, while with another you can resurrect a dead character. Either the most deserving adepts can be made to ascend to heaven, or the most problematic ones can be sacrificed, just to give two other examples. We are not alone One of the places you can visit In addition to the clearing where the cult is founded and made to flourish, the Lamb will be able to visit other places, accessible from a general map of the region. For example, he will be able to go to a lighthouse, where he will obtain side missions (collect a certain number of objects, build a certain decoration and little else) and he will be able to fish (the fish are excellent to cook), or he can go to visit fanatics mushrooms, harbingers of other work to be done (read other missions). In any case, he will be able to get some devotion, some extra resources and he will be able to find new objects for worship, in the form of blueprints, or tarot cards, which we will talk about in a bit. Furthermore, by going to find the old priest of the cult, who has taken up residence in a remote cabin, we will be able to participate in a mini-game with dice, useful for accumulating a little extra money (or for losing it). By carrying out the missions assigned to us, we will obtain resources, projects and gem fragments. Once we have a full gem, we can use it to unlock extra equipment for the lamb. If you have read this far, you will have understood that Cult of the Lamb is overflowing with game systems, which make the gameplay not so much complex, as intricate and always full of things to do. During the game you must therefore learn to manage the time available, trying not to lose sight of our duties as a religious leader, otherwise devotion will collapse. We fight! Another boss When we have finished managing the cult, we will be able to enter one of the dungeons governed by the Bishops, whose destruction is our main objective for most of the adventure, and start a crusade. Dungeons, which lock in order, are made up of a series of interconnected zones. The maps are randomly generated and allow you to visit areas full of resources to collect, others in which to meet special characters, who can give us advice, resources or challenge us, still others in which to save potential cultists from the adepts of other deities and, finally, other still in which, simply, to fight.rival adepts, to powerful wizards, passing through creatures of various shapes, such as insects that charge the lamb with their stingers, or giant knights armed with long swords. There are also walking bombs, so to speak. The lamb is obviously not disarmed. At the beginning of each crusade he gets two weapons: one for close combat (swords, hammers, daggers, gloves and so on) and a curse, essentially a spell which, for example, allows you to shoot fire bolts, or generate shock waves or more. The initial level of weapons and curses, as well as their effects, is determined by what you have unlocked in the crown skill tree. Problems must be solved, otherwise no devotion Like any self-respecting roguelike, Cult of the Lamb offers a character growth system with fixed elements, i.e. that are maintained even in the event of death, and others that are lost when you are killed or emerge victorious from a dungeon. For example, weapons change with each crusade, as well as tarot cards. The latter are cards that are obtained in dungeons (unlocked by purchasing them from shops or directly during the crusades) and which give various effects. For example they can improve the attack speed, or give a cursed heart to the Lamb, which damages enemies when lost. The combat system itself is really simple: each weapon has its own single attack, as well as each curse. At most you can make combos, to cause more damage to enemies. For the rest, the lamb can only dodge the opponent's blows by rolling here and there. The player must therefore try to avoid enemy attacks as much as possible, then strike at the right time. The variety is high The type of enemy and the difficulty set at the beginning of the game determine the level of challenge you will face. Each crusade will end with the destruction of a boss, i.e. a bigger and badder enemy, with the most varied and challenging attack patterns. Nothing insurmountable and, at least for the first half of the game, you die very little. Then things get more difficult, but never too much. Despite the basic simplicity, the combat system of Cult of the Lamb works, because it does not oppress the player too much. Sure, it's a bit superficial, especially when compared to that of other exponents of the genre, but it does its job. It takes about ten minutes or so to conclude a crusade, then you can return to the cult to spend the resources obtained and to solve the problems that have certainly accumulated in the meantime. It lasts the life of a religious leader. Graphics What is happening? From a stylistic point of view, the title of Massive Monster plays entirely on the contrast between the cartoonish, almost childish trait of the drawing, in particular that of the characters, and the presence of gore elements. Then we have the characters who are all anthropomorphic little animals, smiling and with big eyes, who however are sacrificed in brutal rituals, go to their bodies throughout the area of the cult forcing us to collect their ~products~, die in atrocious sufferings in case of illness and have bloodshot eyes when angry. If we want the style is somewhat reminiscent of Happy Tree Friend, with whom it shares the same level of cynicism, so it is certainly not particularly original, even if it must be said that it is executed really well, with the graphics that have been able to mix 2D elements very well and 3D, without creating excessive gaps. Even the soundtrack is successful, at least in its being completely functional to the action.", "date": "2022-08-13", "grade": "8.0"}
