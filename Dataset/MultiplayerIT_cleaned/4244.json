It is a sort of double translation because at a first level this operation must already be done for most mobile titles, but in this case it is really a question of entering a different reference system: on the other hand, for a traditional player to find himself faced with a title that essentially plays itself is disorienting. However, this has already been said and idle games are now well established on the mobile market, so let's skip the generic considerations and see how this principle has been applied to Disney Heroes: Battle Mode. The first strong point of the game, obviously, is the brand that it carries with it: being able to boast of the Disney name already means starting from a rather advantageous plan in a title of this genre, which is based on the collection of characters. If this excellent starting point is then well exploited by a clean and functional structure then one realizes that a license of such proportions has not really been lost, an impression also confirmed by the presence of a free-to-play system that practically does not bother never the player with the purchase of the micro-transactions, allowing for a smooth experience without the threat of paywalls, at least following a human pace of play. However, the mechanics of the clash is almost completely automated, requiring the player only minimal interventions such as touching the faces of the characters to launch special attacks, with the only active contribution required in the management of the fighters which in any case always remains rather guided. The strange story is set within a video game about Disney characters (all very ~meta~), in which a sort of virus has made various famous icons ~crazy~ and the group of heroes is called to restore order to the streets. The Band of Disney Heroes It is a question of composing a team of five heroes taken from various series of the Disney Pixar universe and launching them along progressive levels, which essentially always develop in the same way: three waves of enemies to defeat, with the last one usually more powerful than the others and times containing a boss. Combat is largely automated, with the player only triggering special abilities when the loading bar reaches its peak and advancing the party between waves, so active participation is mostly focused on setting up the battle. team, which represents the core of the whole. Here the collecting element comes into play, with the possibility of progressively unlocking new characters by increasing the level of the group and conquering the ~Hero chips~ (or by turning to micro-transactions) and making them evolve continuously. Brooches come into play when upgrading, to be collected in battle or purchased with micro-transactions: each fighter has a set of brooches to complete in order to move on to the next level, which determines an increase in stats and special abilities. The latter two categories can also be individually enhanced by spending coins (which are earned by playing or - guess what? - with micro-transactions). In short, on the party management front there is a lot to do at different levels, and this is the real element that provides for the active involvement of the player, although everything is very much set on a pre-established path, i.e. there is no possibility to choose different specializations and skills for each character, but we simply find ourselves filling the slots prepared for evolution. All this leaves combat a mostly passive entertainment function in seeing how the group we have set up behaves on the field. The various other modes that can be unlocked later such as the Elite and Friends campaigns and PvP with the Arena and similar game types are also based on this aspect.", "date": "2018-05-24", "grade": "6.9"}
