The PC version also offers exclusive support for ray tracing and Nvidia's DLSS technology, which allows you to take advantage of superior performance and experience the game in a new way. The subject of our review of LEGO Builder's Journey is the computer version, distributed on Steam and Epic Games Store. It is built LEGO Builder's Journey is the journey of a little boy and his father Before diving into the technical details, let's catch up with those who missed LEGO Builder's Journey a couple of years ago. Light Brick's work is first and foremost a rosewater puzzle game. The adventure takes us inside a series of levels, small dioramas built, of course, with LEGO bricks. Our task is to guide a character - precisely a child - to the exit point. How to do? First of all, by placing LEGO pieces. Each level offers a limited number of connections, from which it will be possible to attack the bricks that the game makes available. So don't think you can create entire environments out of nothing or give free rein to your imagination. LEGO Builder's Journey is designed for quick play sessions (not for nothing, it was born on mobile), in which there is no room to make too many mistakes or struggle over possible solutions. The only thing to do is create a path over which our character can (semi-automatically) jump. LEGO Builder's Journey This new version adds new content, namely some additional levels, but on balance expect the same kind of experience already seen on iPhone and iPad (here the review). LEGO Builder's Journey is a silent adventure that tells a very simple story, linked to a father and son who find a way to be together thanks to courage and creativity. Nothing memorable, mind you, but enough to make sense of the approximately two hours of gameplay needed to get to the end credits. Controllers or mice? As mentioned, this review relates to the PC version of LEGO Builder's Journey. One of the first differences from the mobile incarnation is related to the control system, which is compatible with both mouse and controllers. In both cases, unfortunately, there are some inconveniences. Each level offers a series of bricks to interact with, which must be selected, moved and set in other pieces. If you choose the mouse, you simply have access to a pointer, with which you can perform any action. All you need is a click to choose the brick, a couple of clicks of the left side of the mouse to rotate the piece or a long press to position it. With the controller, however, the pointer disappears and you switch from one brick to another with a swipe of the analog (the selected one has a white outline). With the mouse you are obviously more reactive, but also due to the camera, much less mobile than we would have hoped, it is sometimes difficult to be able to position the piece in the right place, as the game struggles to detect our pointer. With the controller, you have the opposite problem: grabbing the correct piece takes some analog back and forth, but at least it's easier to move the piece to the right juncture as the operation is more automated. It is not an insurmountable problem, mind you, but it is unfortunate that a puzzle game of this type, which aims at immediacy and simplicity, makes our life complex even in the simplest parts. And there was light LEGO Builders Journey is visually magnificent However, let's talk about the highlight of the PC version: the new graphics. LEGO Builder's Journey supports ray tracing and DLSS. The original versions, despite having a good style and a respectable technical sector, in fact failed to truly restore the sensation of having plastic pieces in front of you. LEGOs, after all, are nothing more than shiny, colorful pieces that reflect light. Now this is also true in the game. LEGO Builder's Journey features not only reflections, but also shadows, global illumination and ambient occlusion  all with ray tracing. The light, calculated in real time, reaches even the smallest crevices between the bricks and each shadow maintains the shape of the object that produces it, influenced at the same time by light sources, fog and reflections. The result is bordering on perfection, especially when enjoying the game in high resolution and at maximum settings. The fog, the light, the shadows, the reflthey: everything is excellently done in LEGO Builder's Journey The final glance is clearly superior to the original version and helps make each scene more alive, brilliant and physical. Of course, it doesn't hurt that the design of each area is delightful, with many small settings ranging from natural areas bathed in light to dark industrial areas. Obviously all the ray tracing effects require various efforts from LEGO Builder's Journey, which would struggle to maintain high resolution and frame rate without DLSS support (with maximum settings and DLSS set to quality). With an RTX 2060, in fact, you would travel just under 20 FPS: thanks to NVIDIA technology it is possible to exceed 36 instead. Starting from the 3060, thanks to DLSS, 48 FPS are easily exceeded, with even a maximum of over 100 FPS with an RTX 3080 Ti. At 1440p, however, the maximum value is 75 FPS with a 3080 Ti. If you aim for this resolution, you need at least a 3060 or a 2080 Ti to maintain, thanks to DLSS, a frame rate above 30. The 30 FPS is enough for LEGO Builder's Journey You can of course also opt for sub-maximum settings, giving away some detail here and there, and set the DLSS to benefit performance, but in our opinion your priority in a game of this type should be graphics quality. LEGO Builder's Journey is in fact an extremely static puzzle game: sacrificing fluidity (without dropping below 30 FPS, of course) does not affect the experience in any way. The biggest reason why you should buy LEGO Builder's Journey on PC is in fact to take advantage of your RTX and admire NVIDIA's technology at work. In any case, we specify that even older PCs can start the game thanks to a ~classic mode~. Below we offer a comparison between the classic mode and the high quality ray tracing version.", "date": "2021-06-22", "grade": "8.0"}
