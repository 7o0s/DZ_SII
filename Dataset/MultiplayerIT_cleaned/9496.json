{"name": "Aspettami Shepard!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/84633-mass-effect-2-aspettami-shepard.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3Mass Effect 2 has convinced those who follow Multiplayer.it so much to obtain, in a year full of excellent games, the title of best game of 2010 of the readers. Obviously, PC and Xbox 360 players voted for it, the only platforms on which this Bioware masterpiece has been available up to now. 2011 opens in the best possible way with PlayStation 3 users who can finally take part in a real video game feast, both from a cosmetic point of view and from a real gameplay point of view, with the second chapter of this sci-fi epic which, inevitably, will mark this generation of hardware from multiple points of view. The past year is almost invisible and, if you have an internet connection, there are very few reasons not to dive into the universe of Captain Shepard and the Normandy. Orders Commander! Commander Shepard's adventure picks up exactly where it left off with the first chapter, after the meeting with the Destroyers and the infernal battle that broke out on the Citadella, seat of the Council, a body that brings together government representatives of all races in the galaxy. After a series of events, which we don't have the heart to tell, and after an encounter that radically marks the protagonist's life, the Commander's task will be to set up a crew capable of facing an epic and exciting battle. Since the first chapter is not available for PlayStation 3, by entering the code found in the game package, it is possible to download an interactive comic that narrates some of the most important events and which allows the player to make some of the choices that influence the state of the world when you start this second chapter. The idea is good and in a few minutes it is possible to know all the fundamental aspects of what happened previously. However, since we are dealing with drawings and not computer graphics and having necessarily had to cut into the details, we lose much of the pathos and emotion that we felt playing the first chapter in first person, leaving the impression that it would have been better a collage of computer graphics sequences that resumed the cutscenes of Mass Effect. Furthermore, there is the possibility of downloading all the expansions released in the last year, but you must necessarily have an internet connection, since otherwise the package is poorer than what you can buy, now at a budget price, both for PC than for Xbox 360. Mass Effect 2 however, is perfectly enjoyable even by those who have never dealt with the crew of the Normandy, even if inevitably only those who have already gone through the emotional experience of the first chapter will be able to fully appreciate some passages, especially those dealing with the return of old key characters. These, in a couple of cases, leave their place on the Normandy to other supporting actors who are simply fantastic, with, above all, Miranda, Jack and the assassin Thane who inevitably fascinate in the quests dedicated to them. In fact, the narrative structure has taken even more the trend of a modern television series (many quotes from the famous Lost) with the result of being able to tell the personality and character of the protagonists with a depth that had never been seen in a video game, especially considering the number of characters the writers had to dedicate themselves to. The choices available to the player, always oriented towards the alternation of noble or evil attitudes, are innumerable and have such consequences that, unless you get lost in completing each quest and obtaining each upgrade, two different games will hardly lead to two finals identical. Always with the option to carry your save back to the next installment of the saga, further increasing the ramifications of the story, assuming you manage to survive the final battle. Something less and so much more Narrative aside, where Mass Effect 2 breaks free from the RPG tradition is in the choices made by BioWare to make the gaming experience enjoyable to an even wider audience. The most disruptive is that of the elimination of the inventory: where in the first chapter hours were spent changing weapons to the characters and selling all the accumulated objects that filled the equipment slots, here there is a shared heritage, made up of the different types of weapons and upgrades, which become immediately available to all protagonists compatible with them, as soon as they are synthesized in the laboratory of the Normandy. Now, in fact, it is not a question of opening collection boxesion dozens of weapons, but to explore the depths to find the blueprints necessary to make the objects to strengthen the crew and the spaceship. The minerals must be recovered by scanning the surfaces of the planets that make up the galaxy, among which we move in what resembles a sort of World Map of Final Fantasy in an interstellar key, complete with fuel consumption and probes necessary to extract the metals. It is in these phases that some of the hidden secondary missions come out, with the total abandonment of the exploration sections of the surfaces of the first episode aboard the Mako, the jeep capable of rising for short flight sections, a real heel d'Achilles for the repetitiveness that characterized them. Now, once a destination has been identified, you find yourself directly projected into an area to explore and into the heart of the action, guaranteeing ever-changing situations and fairy-tale settings, where in the first Mass Effect it was a repetition of identical rooms and deserts of endless pebbles. The elevators in which it was necessary to stop for whole minutes waiting for the backgrounds and textures of the new areas to be updated have also disappeared, even if the loading screens that replaced them are in some cases quite long. In addition to this renewed variety of situations and settings, what gives depth to the game is a much more precise balance of the different classes and a clearer differentiation between them, which forces a much more careful choice of powers to be developed and, above all, companions to take on the various missions. Playstation 3 trophies As with the achievements on the Xbox 360 version, earning platinum on PS3 is just a matter of time and perseverance. You have to beat the game multiple times and finish all sub-quests, as well as accomplish specific tasks related to combat. It takes time, but whoever gets caught up in the game will inevitably get excellent results. Changes One of the aspects on which it is evident that the team has worked more carefully is the mapping of the controls, in order to make the gaming experience even more fluid and enjoyable. The player-controlled party is still composed of three elements, only this time the thrown weapons have been eliminated, thus freeing up two buttons on the joypad and allowing three of Captain Shepard's special powers to be executed immediately, and one for each of the others two crew members, drastically reducing the need to resort to the power selection screen. This means that now most of the fights take place in real time, thanks also to a much more intuitive pointing system, which, combined with the finally optimal fluidity of the graphics engine, makes the action phases of the same level as the game parts. exploration, giving life to a package that as a whole can only leave you amazed by the quality and care placed in all aspects, from level design to the smallest details. The locations are really many, if you think that it took us more than thirty hours to complete the game without almost lingering on the side quests, and finding ourselves faced with ever-changing settings. To move Mass Effect 2 is still an optimized version of the Unreal Engine, but with astounding results that represent one of the peaks reached in this generation of hardware, with some memorable settings and with the characters that have reached an even higher level of detail, with even less problems than the original. The conversion for PlayStation 3 uses the updated libraries of the engine that will underpin the upcoming Mass Effect 3 and immediately sports a new lighting system and much more defined shadows than those seen in last year's edition. In the face of these improvements, however, the already slight AntiAliasing (i.e. the filter that allows you to eliminate the annoying lineup along the diagonal lines of the models) and the normal mapping on the textures, which in some cases are at higher resolution, are missing. but which on average therefore have less depth. Overall, therefore, we can say that the versions are equivalent, if we exclude the supremacy of the most powerful PCs, of course. Honorable mention, once again, to the sound accompaniment which, between effects, voices and music, fills the ears of those who play for hours. Even the dubbing, strictly in Italian like the subtitles, is of excellent workmanship with the return of the voices that characterized the first chapter, with the exception of the protagonist Shepard. In fact, the voice actor Claudio Moneta, after recording about 80% of the speech, fell victim to an accident that forced him to stay in hospital for a long time.mpo, making it impossible for it to complete the job. In a hurry he was then replaced by Giacomo Zito whose vocal timbre is similar and equally pleasant.", "date": "2011-02-01", "grade": "9.5"}
