{"name": "Knockout Kings 2001", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/knockout-kings-2001_a.html", "text": "In the heart of the game! There are three basic modes to start playing with: slugfast, career and exhibition. The career mode is the most interesting mode to play in single player in which you will have to try to win as many matches as possible to climb the world rankings. The lineup of boxers present is really great and among the old glories you will find Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, while among the new champions there will be the inevitable Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield. Boxers are divided into three different weight categories: light, middleweight, and heavyweight. In addition, the game also allows you to unlock secret boxers but on this particular one you will have to deal with it yourself otherwise I would ruin all the fun! There is also an Edit Mode to create your boxer from scratch by setting its main characteristics. As far as playability is concerned, if you have already played some other title you will find this style also in the 2001 version. It is possible to make all kinds of shots, defensive movements and illegal movements that can actually be done in the box. The problem however lies in the fact that these movements are quite complicated to perform and they are less used during a match. This drawback degrades the game to a test of quick reflexes and reduces your action to a single option, which is for you to parry and return your opponent's blows. Graphics and sound! Graphically KK2001 is impressive thanks to the extensive use made in the game of CyberScan technology, which reproduces the boxers in the game exactly the same as their real-life counterparts. This exceptional graphics combined with the excellent animation with which the boxers have been equipped gives KK2001 a very realistic atmosphere and image. Outside the ring, the crowd animation and the details of the arenas act as an excellent outline to the environment where the match is played and contribute to the sense of realism that KK2001 wants to spread. The only graphical issue encountered occurs in the slowdown that occurs when you knock down an opponent. Since the knockdown was the most exciting moment of the match, it deserved more care in its implementation. The sound pack includes music that fits well with the style of the game. You can also hear the voices of famous referees from the boxing world such as Mills Lane and Richard Steele. Furthermore, the commentary of the matches is entrusted to the duo Mills Lane and Richard Steele for analysis and commentary, while the announcer responds to the name of Jimmy Lennon Jr.. The commentary, despite being well made, could become repetitive in the long run, as indeed it happens for sports titles. Try to imagine throwing the same punch over and over and hearing a voice repeating it over and over again! pro: A good title where you can vent all your anger without the scruples of preparing a winning strategy. Just beat it up and in style thanks to the beautiful graphics that KK2001 offers! contro: Unfortunately you will be limited by having to reduce your matches to a coming and going of parries and shots, all this due to the arcade imprint of the game which determines its poor success as a real simulation! It's time to put on the boxing gloves! After the 2001 version for PsOne of its popular boxing simulation, EA produced a version of its Knockout Kings 2001 for the very powerful 128-bit black console. The result is a very nice title graphically and with an excellent number of selectable boxers from both the present and the past. The gameplay offered by Knockout Kings 2001 is especially suited to those type of players who base their enjoyment on choosing their favorite boxer and punching their opponents even better against a friend using the two player mode. For those who are looking for a comparison more similar to reality wanting to use different attack and defense strategies, in this case KK 2001 cannot be considered a title worthy as it is too simple from that point of view for lovers of real boxing .", "date": "2001-03-29", "grade": null}
