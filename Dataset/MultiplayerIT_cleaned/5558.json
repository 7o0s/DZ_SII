{"name": "Toccata e fuga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/167094-warbits-toccata-e-fuga.html", "text": "It's been more than fourteen years since Intelligent Systems brought their vision of turn-based strategy to the Game Boy Advance with an unforgettable title for many gamers: Advance Wars. The strength of the game was undoubtedly in its ability to simplify complex mechanics, allowing anyone to become a skilled strategist in just a few games. Well, Risky Lab wanted to clearly draw inspiration from that classic for its Warbits, taking advantage of a platform, the mobile one, which has always been at ease with the strategic vein, thanks in particular to the immediacy of controls via touch screen . The single player campaign of the game, which unlike the Nintendo title does not rely on a plot proper, puts us in command of a small army within twenty different missions, increasingly more complex, in which we will have to adopt the tactic best to prevail over the enemy, exploiting the peculiarities of each unit. Beyond the single offer, however, Warbits also offers a rich multiplayer sector, both locally and online, with the possibility of accessing asynchronous games for two or four players via Game Center. The system works very well, there are already quite crowded lobbies and it is therefore possible to find a match in a matter of seconds, using the notifications to find out if our opponent has made his move and then act accordingly. Of course, making arrangements with a friend remains the best solution if you don't want your online battles to go too slowly. Warbits is a solid, fun and challenging turn-based strategy game - a great Advance Wars clone Rogue strategy Once the first levels have been completed, which act as a tutorial, the gameplay of Warbits meshes great and immediately manages to involve, while also offering an absolutely non-trivial degree of challenge. In fact, focusing only on numerical superiority does not always produce the desired results, and it is therefore necessary to memorize the skills of each unit to know which one to use and when, what range certain attacks have and how it is possible to counter the advance of specific opponents. The interface is of great help in this respect, constantly providing us with a complete picture of the possibilities of movement and attack, as well as offering additional information if needed. The great variety of vehicles and soldiers also takes care of enriching the experience: there are ground troops who can attack or conquer garrisons to produce credits (to be invested in the production of new vehicles), several armored vehicles with different characteristics of resistance, maneuverability and offensive effectiveness, as well as aircraft useful for both transport and the offensive. It is not possible to speed up the turn of the enemies and in the more advanced stages this involves some annoying waiting, but beyond this the system works very well, it is very solid and fun. The similarities with Advance Wars, as mentioned at the beginning, are many: when a clash occurs, a sequence does not appear with the units engaged in the battle, but beyond this the box structure, the energy system and many other aspects of the experience are strikingly reminiscent of the work of Intelligent Systems. Considering the mobile nature of the product, the decidedly accessible price (2.99 euros) and the validity of the multiple multiplayer functions, we can however say that the lack of originality and the not exactly marked personality of Warbits do not constitute defects of who knows what entity, nor prevent you from fully enjoying a production which, even on the technical front, boasts great attention to detail and cleanliness: each unit has a specific design and beautiful animations, the general rendering is very cartoon-style and the final result is very pleasant, albeit generic at times.", "date": "2016-04-22", "grade": "8.5"}
