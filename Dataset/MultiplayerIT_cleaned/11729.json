Being able to further clear videogames among the general public means, in some way, no longer making them resemble the videogame clichs we are used to. In this the DS was truly a master. Titles such as Brain Training, Big Brain Academy or the crossword and Sudoku simulators have allowed Nintendo to disguise its video games behind a veneer of scientific daily training. Instead of adding parts and functions to your laptop, Nintendo has preferred to focus everything on incredibly differentiated and specialized software, thus making the machine decidedly multifunctional, but also simple and within everyone's reach. A matter of glance... This preamble to introduce the new ~Training For Your Eyes~ developed in collaboration with Bandai Namco, yet another parascientific training title that will delight all the many adorers of the millionaire title advertised by Kidman. TFYE follows in all respects Brain Training starting from the advice of a well-known and important Japanese professor Hisao Ishigaki, an expert in eye gymnastics related to sport- to arrive at the general style and serious tones. The title aims to train five fundamental aspects of our eyesight, but also provides us with many small curiosities and tips to see ourselves better and to understand how our eyes work. Dynamic visual acuity, glance, eye movement, peripheral vision, and hand-eye coordination are all accurately measured through tests. The results are then compared with the previous ones through the graphs to which we are widely accustomed by now. Our ocular age is then calculated, which starts from 20 years of age and goes up, in a completely analogous way to the already known brain age. A series of personalized workouts is then chosen daily which aim from time to time to make us practice the basic exercises, with our weak points, with our strengths and so on. Once all the activities have been completed, a little eye relaxation is recommended so as not to strain the eyes too much, a relaxing female voice advises us  in Italian of course  the movements to be performed  always the same ones  to relax the neck and eyes The package is completed by the clean and serious interface, nice tunes and advice on how to put into practice what you ~learned~ during training in sport. Peripheral vision though... The cornerstone of the title obviously lies in the ~training mini-games~. Not many, they are divided between more abstract training ones and those related to various sports disciplines. All satisfying and well done are gradually unlocked to make the progress a little more varied. Completing at least one of the exercises proposed as daily training allows us to imprint our ~stamp~ on the date of the current day. With so many stamps, the various activities are unlocked. Everything works tremendously well if you follow the training advice step by step, carry out sports activities and read the various visual curiosities. No more than ten or fifteen minutes a day and the game can be really long-lived and interesting, but if you want to tackle longer sessions  which is not allowed by the title itself, except by cheating on the DS date  boredom and lack of variety are decidedly lethal. Given the spirit of the game, however, this is easily understandable and acceptable. A little less pleasant is the feeling of ~already seen~ that could arise in some. Many games are similar to others already seen in titles such as Wario and Mario or Big Brain Academy and Brain Trainer, but in any case the good workmanship and the different frame make this slight defect overshadow. Technically it does its job very well, everything is very clear and intuitive and the sports titles often use very pleasant digitized photographic images while still maintaining a certain essentiality. Ten workouts for me... A small box to describe abstract training exercises is certainly useful! Magic Boxes: remember the game of three cards, you have to identify under which box - after it has been moved and shuffled - the ball is located. Keep an eye on the Numbers: to improve the glance you have to memorize and report increasingly long sequences of numbers. Sequence of symbols: you have to mark a sequence of differently oriented ~C~s that quickly appear in special boxes on both screens. The combination: you have to select the right oriented ~C~ that appears in the boxes surrounding the central ~C~. Hunt for the squares: remember the minIn the Super Mario mole game, you have to hit the red squares before they disappear. The letter counter: always with a good glance the goal is to count how many times a specific letter appears in a very fast moving sequence Find the circle: identify the ~O~ among the ~Cs~ that appear all together for a fraction second. Count the ~Cs~: How many ~Cs~ with the same orientation appear quickly on both screens? Are they the same?: indicates whether two ~C~s that appear quickly are oriented in the same way. One on one screen the other on the other... Numerical order: you have to touch the numbers scattered in a grid of twenty boxes in ascending order, watch out for rotations! Wii sports with the stylus? Even sports activities deserve a special box! Volleyball: Smash the ball when it enters the rectangle above the net, watch out for the walls. Boxing: Hit your trainer's boxing gloves and dodge his replies. Table tennis: do you know the Wii Play pin gong? Here's the same but with the stylus Basketball: recognize your teammates on the white team and indicate them as quickly as you can. Baseball: Hit the ball when it enters the square. Soccer: With a swipe, kick the ball to a partner on the upper screen or send it directly into the net. American Footbal: Avoid opponents who try to tackle you with quick lateral movements. Comment Training For Your Eyes fits perfectly into the philosophy of Touch! generation. The style is exactly that of Brain Training. It obviously loses a bit of freshness and sometimes it seems to be faced with something already seen and, as has already happened with More Brain Training, it is a title that performs its task well without adding anything more. The pretext of visual training introduces the various mini-games well and intrigues the right one. This does not mean that those who have always played video games are ocularly ~younger~... So, in the end, does training really improve visual skills or does it just teach you to play better? Or, who has been playing for years has sharpened his visual functions and now therefore does better in the tests? But didn't all nerds wear thick lenses?! Pros Nice and well made Perfect for the Touch! Generation Entertaining and instructive Cons Videogame limited Sometimes it tastes like ~already seen~ To be played only for ten minutes a day and no more", "date": "2007-12-17", "grade": null}
