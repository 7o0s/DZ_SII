As you probably know, a series of events led to the publication of its first act at the beginning of 2014, postponing the second and final chapter to a later date: in the end, backers and non-backers had to wait more than a year, in addition to what has already passed from the Kickstarter campaign, to fully enjoy the return to the graphic adventures of Tim Schafer, father of Grim Fandango and Full Throttle. In the best tradition of episodic works, the story of Broken Age was interrupted at the most beautiful moment, but that's water under the bridge: we are finally back in the shoes of Shay and Vella to give our definitive opinion on this game, for which we had already spent words of praise on the occasion of the previous meeting. Now it's time to find out if everything is confirmed. Broken Age successfully takes us back in time to the golden age of graphic adventures Grow up together The second act of Broken Age was released as an update of the first chapter, integrating within it invisibly to the player's eyes. For this reason, we have decided to dedicate this definitive review to the whole adventure, resuming the game from the beginning to express our opinion: the same advice, moreover, is also given to us by Tim Schafer and his team, who they urged players to start the story over from the first act to fully enjoy it. So let's pick up everything from the beginning, remembering that Broken Age puts us in the shoes of its two protagonists: Shay and Vella. The first is a boy who lives confined to a spaceship that also hens him, keeping him in an ultra-protective way away from the outside world; the second is instead a girl linked to a terrible destiny: to be offered as a sacrifice by her village to Mog Chotra, a monster who periodically requests her tribute to leave the inhabitants of the places she visits in peace. At this point, it is difficult to talk about the second chapter without avoiding spoilers on the first, so if you have not yet played the latter, we advise you to continue reading in the bold type below. Otherwise, know that Broken Age picks up where we left off the two protagonists, at a time when you could already understand what was going to happen in the second episode. Thus Vella ends up in the spaceship/monster and Shay in the outside world, through a fairly classic exchange of places and situations. Now that it has come to a conclusion, we can say without a doubt that Broken Age is a mature story, in which the division into two acts not only reflects the two different settings in which the two protagonists find themselves having to act, but is linked in precise way to as many phases of the life of each person. The story shows us the transition from childhood to adult life, faced by everyone in a different way, even traumatic, especially when we realize that some things that we took for granted actually aren't, and that sometimes even those who love us do not tell us the whole truth. At the start, Shay wants to break the monotony and escape the omnipresence of the mother/spaceship to finally live an authentic life, while Vella finds herself in a diametrically opposite situation, where she (along with her grandfather) is the only one who wants to defeat Mog Chotra, unlike the rest of the family who prefer to succumb to the monster's will, while still loving the girl. In the second act, the two will find in their ~imperfect~ childhoods the way to complete the adventure, effectively becoming adults. The narrative style is the one we have been accustomed to from Tim Schafer, a master of graphic adventures who manages to alternate sometimes even dramatic revelations with surreal and amusing moments. If you want to nitpick, in addition to the story of the two protagonists, there would be other elements that are only partially explained, or even just hinted at, thus leaving those who ask themselves a few questions that go beyond the fate of Shay and Vella dry-mouthed . The difficulties of life What was promised in 2012 as a ~back to basics~ graphic adventure turned out to be one, albeit with due proportions. What we were able to see on the occasion of the publication of the first part of Broken Age, does not change within this sequel, reflecting the evolved dynamics of the genre: the times in which an action was selected and then the object to which to apply it , moreover, they had passed well before the genre of graphic adventures experienced its sad sunset,leading us towards a system capable of making the player interact with the elements on the screen via an intelligent pointer. As far as the puzzles are concerned, on the other hand, things get quite different: we complained that Broken Age never raised the bar of difficulty, which is instead done in the second act, almost as if Double Fine wanted to symbolize this too way the transition from the ~easy~ life of childhood to the complex one of adulthood. In much less metaphorical terms, the development team has probably responded to the feedback offered by the players on the previous occasion, much simpler than this second act. In some cases, the puzzles present here turn out to be able to embarrass even the most experienced graphic adventure enthusiasts, even changing their typology: no longer just interactions with objects, but also observation tests, where you can spend several minutes before get over it. On a couple of occasions, the obstacles put in place by the developers are really reminiscent of those of the adventures of the past, fueling the nostalgia for the times when solving a puzzle could mean taking pen and paper to work out the solution. Unfortunately, the only flaw comes towards the end, when there is an abuse of the same type of puzzle destined to get a bit boring. Video game art As for the aesthetic aspect of Broken Age, we can only confirm everything said on the occasion of the first chapter: the whole adventure looks like an illustrated book, with some settings that can simply leave you speechless. In the second act, the exploratory phase drops significantly, leaving room for a few new places to visit: those who hoped to discover more places will probably be disappointed, but we don't feel like blaming Double Fine for this decision. The exceptional voice cast put together by the developers also returns, including Elijah Wood and Jack Black, as well as other well-known and lesser-known names, whose acting prowess delivers a decidedly over-the-top overall performance for a video game. It does so also thanks to a multiple-choice dialogue system that perfectly entertains the player (it also happens to use an object inappropriately, just to see the reaction), offering never-trivial exchanges and funny jokes, best translated into the Italian subtitles but appreciable above all by following the original language version.", "date": "2015-05-01", "grade": "8.9"}
