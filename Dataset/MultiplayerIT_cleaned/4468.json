Playing Gorogoa, it is immediately evident and very clear how Jason Roberts' effort is something special, extraordinary and precious: a unique product, different from any other, in which a brilliant idea has become reality through a work of complexity and precision that inevitably needs a pinch of madness. Or genius. Or, more likely, both. Outside the window Gorogoa is above all a work of art, and let it be clear that the writer has always been extremely reluctant to associate this concept with the world of video games. Yet it would be impossible to categorize a game differently so strongly and inextricably linked to the amazing creative work of the author, where it is clear that the videogame medium is only the means that was chosen by the same to express his genius. Because it is clear that Jason Roberts is first and foremost a very talented artist; indeed, in reality the matter is even more interesting, since Jason Roberts is a computer engineer from Silicon Valley who had never made a video game until now. Gorogoa is therefore his debut title, the result of an idea born and elaborated for more than seven years in a sort of long and complicated labor limae. The story opens with a boy who, looking out of his bedroom window, sees a huge and colorful creature crossing the city overlooking the roofs of the houses. Consulting a book he discovers that the same monster is depicted as a sort of divinity adored by his followers; the plot then develops between folklore and abstract art along the couple of hours needed to reach the end. Basically, Gorogoa is a graphic adventure with puzzles completely devoid of text that takes place on an area divided into four square panels: in each of them you can freely position, by dragging it, a hand-drawn image representing a place within which you can move in a predefined manner, acting on certain interactive areas. For example, from inside a room you can touch books placed on a shelf and then narrow the shot on them, or rather act on a window to find yourself projected in front of the hill that until a few moments before could only be see in the distance. Each illustration is linked to another, but the extraordinary thing is that in the process of zooming in and out, interacting with objects and solving puzzles you can find yourself transported in an instant from one place to a completely different one, without any solution of continuity.

Everything is connected The connections, transformations and changes in fact pass entirely through the transitions conceived by the author, which transcend space and time, giving life to absolutely incredible sequences, in a sort of magic. In all of this, the illustrations can be manipulated, superimposed, disassembled and reassembled to find the interpretation necessary for solving the puzzles. A window, for example, can literally be undocked from the rest of the background and moved to another panel to show a completely different place. Sometimes you have to place two images side by side to generate a new sequence, and thus be able to continue: the detail of a finely decorated box placed inside a messy room can also be the lower part of a huge tower, to be positioned under its natural other half to find the solution to the riddle. Describing Gorogoa in words, trying to explain its mechanics is difficult, if not impossible: there are no terms capable of replicating what one feels when playing with it, the amazement and admiration that arisentantaneously and grow more and more with each further passage, with each moment in which one stops to contemplate the detail and care with which the hundreds of illustrations are drawn and how they are connected to each other. However, reducing Gorogoa to a pure display of artistic skill in drawing would be extremely simplistic, because in the progression the player never feels like a mere spectator: on the contrary, the mechanics offer a strong sense of involvement to the point of making him an integral part of this dreamlike and mysterious world, in which also the level of difficulty and the intelligence of the puzzles are calibrated in such a way as to guarantee continuous gratification. The only real problem therefore lies in the longevity, given that many may find too short an adventure that runs out within a couple of hours: from our point of view, the intensity of the experience amply compensates for its brevity, but it is a subjective evaluation that is up to the individual user.", "date": "2017-12-30", "grade": "9.0"}
