{"name": "La recensione di Florence", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/195524-florence-la-recensione-di-florence.html", "text": "We have become accustomed to considerations such as ~it's not a game, it's an experience~, ever since videogame experimentation has opened up to the exploration of new narrative paths. We have also learned, over time, to look at some of these productions with a certain suspicion, because after the amazement and initial interest, the critical spirit has taken its place again and we have begun to take some measures even on this new wave expressive. What is certain at this point is that products of this type cannot be evaluated according to the traditional yardstick, because in fact they are not videogames in the strict sense of the term, but present themselves as new hybrid forms of storytelling and entertainment. Florence fits neatly into this broader category, but before being dismissed with the usual ~it's a peculiar title, not for everyone~, consider a couple of things: first, the authors are the Mountains team, who previously collaborated on Monument Valley and therefore have considerable foundations in the mobile sector, moreover supported by a publisher like Annapurna which has quickly become a brand of attraction in ~alternative~ productions. The second is that Florence talks about a topic that has strangely been treated little (and badly) in the videogame field, namely love. Precisely that source of inspiration that can be considered fundamental and eternal in the various fields of artistic expression, has never managed to find an important space in video games, another distinctive element of this particular medium and its controversial relationship with art in general. And the subject is treated with a particular grace: far from affectation and paroxysm, the love between Florence and Krish seems real and heartfelt, precisely in its being represented in such a simple and only apparently light way, between common situations and gestures with which it is easy to get in deep contact. But it's not even limited to this, because Florence frames love in a deeper and broader vision, becoming a kind of light hymn to life, growth and its precious teachings. Suddenly love The story, in itself, is nothing particularly original, between incipit, development and conclusion, but it is the way it is presented that characterizes the whole experience. It is somewhat the same aspect that has been particularly exalted in other titles with a purely narrative structure such as Gone Home or What Remains of Edith Finch, even if these could still count on a complexity and a stratification of readings that Florence completely lacks, more focused on the graphic representation and stimulation of memories and sensations typical of falling in love and subsequent phases. The playful part is reduced to the minimum terms, broken up into mini-games that require minimal effort but which are found to be organized according to a logical sense according to the phases told in the story: the boring and stupid pairing of equal numbers to present the gray job to to which the protagonist is linked, the distracted and monotonous scrolling between social posts and ~likes~, the embarrassment in choosing what to keep and what to remove from the library when the two decide to move in together or the composition of the balloons for the dialogues that it becomes easier and easier as the ice melts and the couple begins to get along, to then become very fast and almost furious in the quarrel phases. This is probably the aspect that most stands out in Florence, i.e. the way in which the ~game~ action, if it can be defined as such, perfectly underlines what takes place in the story of the two lovers, otherwise wonderfully illustrated by the art by Mountains and the instrumental soundtrack. It is therefore a kind of new form of graphic novel, which necessarily relies on a simpler communicative system as it is devoid of words but capable of speaking to us deeply and directly precisely because of our active involvement in its unfolding.", "date": "2018-02-23", "grade": "7.8"}
