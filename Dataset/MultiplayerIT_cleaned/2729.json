Ustwo, the developers also of Monument Valley, Assemble with Care and Land's End, have already shown that they know how to build highly fascinating atmospheres, but never as in this case has this feature become a fundamental element of the game. Alba: a Wildlife Adventure (or Alba: Missione Natura in Italian) tells the story of a girl who returns, one summer, to the Mediterranean island off the coast of Spain where she spent her holidays with her grandparents as a child, surrounded by wild nature , the cultivated fields and the small coastal town. This time, however, he discovers that the island is about to be shocked by a major change that could change its appearance forever, namely the construction of a huge hotel in place of the historic nature reserve. This discovery awakens her naturalist spirit in Alba and forces her to take action as never before, with the will to change things and the full awareness of being able to do so regardless of the unequal struggle that arises before her. In short, it is an ecological story, but it also tells the story of the growth of a little girl, staging an example of empowerment that abandons any paternalistic tone, simply relying on the enthusiasm of two little girls who want to defend the nature of the island at all costs. kicking off a hopping revolution. Having hastily founded the Alba & Ines Animal Rescue Club (CSAAI, ~temporary name~) with her childhood friend Ins, the solution to save the nature reserve and block the construction of the eco-monster could be to collect of 50 signatures for the naturalist cause, but in one week it is not a simple undertaking. Alba therefore finds herself having to complete a long list of tasks involving the repair of wooden structures scattered around the island, cleaning the areas of garbage, rescuing animals and various jobs useful to society and capable of enhance the environmental heritage of the island to be able to attract the largest number of inhabitants to their cause. Told in this way it may seem like a simple edutainment for a childish audience and Alba: a Wildlife Adventure can certainly be seen in this way too, but the way it presents its problems and the construction of the gameplay elements make it a real game. enjoyable by all. It is not a simple caricatured imitation of a children's adventure, but a sort of summer simulation, experienced precisely from the point of view of the little ones in contact with nature, immersed in a splendid and evocative setting. A petition to save nature The construction of a mega-hotel on such a tiny island accustomed to staid rhythms in contact with nature obviously impresses everyone a bit, but most of the inhabitants are also fascinated by the idea of progress presented by Mayor Toni, in cahoots with Paco, the unscrupulous builder: such a hotel could boost the local economy and bring in a lot of tourists, many think, realistically reflecting the differences of thought that can emerge in such situations. What Alba and Ins have to focus on, then, is simply to clearly show the inhabitants what treasure is hidden before everyone's eyes: the wonders of nature, animals and life in balance with the environment have always been the strengths of the island and to remember it, it is enough simply to bring it back to its former glory and ensure that this balance is re-established. Every single action Alba takes affects the reputation of her nature club and leads to more signatures for the anti-hotel petition: is it saving animals in need, photographing rare species, rehabilitating bird-watching and hiking facilities or simply help citizens in various problems and requests, always connected in some way with nature and animals. Every good deed is rewarded with new signatures until the coveted threshold of 50 subscriptions is reached and the unveiling of a certain intrigue that seems to lie behind this ~deal that cannot be refused~ proposed by the mayor to the citizens. The actions to be performed are elementary and simply require touching certain points on the screen, practically leaving the elements of challenge, if they can be defined as such, to the exploration and search for the right paths to take. It is a contemplative game, in which we must above all explore the island and discover new ravines, with the constant search for new species of soulthere to discover: a constant at Alba: in fact, photography at Wildlife Adventure requires a certain tactic and skill more than any other activity. In fact, it is necessary to find species of more or less rare animals in order to fill the entire album of the island's fauna, but in order to be able to photograph them it is necessary to understand what their habitat is, approach them with great caution and be able to take a photo from the optimal distance, moving moreover the device just as if we were taking the photo ourselves. They are simple activities but which fit perfectly into the particular atmosphere of the game, and this is precisely the element of greatest strength of Alba: a Wildlife Adventure. The Mediterranean and sunny island is a small paradise to which one always returns willingly, perfectly represented, albeit with stylized and unrealistic graphics but capable of capturing the essential and restoring a perfect image of the Mediterranean maquis and the typical flora and fauna of coastal environments, all supported by excellent natural sound effects and, occasionally, some Spanish music that echoes from the radios scattered throughout the village and the cottages.", "date": "2020-12-16", "grade": "8.5"}
