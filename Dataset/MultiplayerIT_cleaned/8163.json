The idea of a structure so open to ~social media~, with an industrious and enthusiastic community that was constantly churning out new characters, karts and tracks, supported by solid and fun gameplay, was definitely valid and full of great potential. Two and a half years later, however, here we are reviewing a product born precisely from that experience but which has all the airs of a rejection for the puppets created by United Front Games, set aside in favor of a recognizable brand like that by LittleBigPlanet. In fact, LittleBigPlanet Karting stands as a real reboot, a reinterpretation which, however, in merging the two structures has lost some important piece along the way, indulging in an excessively casual approach. The introduction of the game is in full Media Molecule style, with a video showing a series of people stuck in traffic whose ideas form the ideal world that we will have access to after a few moments, all narrated very well by the usual Alberto Olivero, the whose voice will guide us through the tutorials, also providing us with a description of the various scenarios as we unlock them. Alone or in company The single player campaign of LittleBigPlanet Karting consists of a good number of scenarios, within which we will find ourselves facing races of various types: from normal races in which the first to cross the finish line wins (best of three laps) to arenas in which you clash using weapons, passing through checkpoint-based events. Placing on the podium in each competition translates into unlocking the next stage but also secondary challenges that can be played both alone and in multiplayer, and which in some cases offer new situations, even boss fights. In this sense, the offer effectively represents a mix between ModNation Racers and LittleBigPlanet, both in structural and aesthetic terms, and there are also many ~visual~ references to the world of Sackboy during the action. However, things change when it comes to analyzing the gameplay, and it is precisely in this area that questionable changes have been made compared to the original work of United Front Games. The turbo bar has in fact been eliminated in favor of a momentary boost that activates immediately after performing a ~double drift~ or an aerial rotation during a jump. This is an important difference, which we didn't like because it has the demerit of ~flattening~ the competition, depriving us of the possibility of avoiding homing weapons (which therefore hit in any case, unless a countermeasure is implemented , as we will see shortly) and giving us an unnatural advantage over the other competitors, because somehow we will have to come back when we find ourselves in last position. This lack is aggravated by the physics of the karts, which do not give any feeling of ~grip~ on the track, allowing us to do whatever we want but in a too fake and cartoonish context, in which the individual's ability counts for very little and it's more luck and episodes that make the difference. Arms and oxen from your countries As in any arcade racer of this type, in LittleBigPlanet Karting the tracks are littered with items to collect: from packs containing editor items to boosts, ending with weapons. The latter change color randomly and are characterized by the same icon, so it is really difficult to be able to choose the one we want, and often we have to be satisfied. The term turns out to be more than ever correct, as the balance of our offensive (and defense) tools leaves much to be desired: ranging from multiple or single homing missiles, which practically never miss the target, to bombs and electric discharges that strike straight in front of our kart and for which we therefore need to ~take aim~, but it is really difficult to do so given the continuous presence of jumps and hairpin bends, as well as the discussion on grip made just now, which makes the tracks something similar to a soapy surface. Then there are the ~ray~ impulses to hit nearby opponents, the launch of oil (practically useless) and two weapons of practically identical value, which transform our vehicle into a boxing glove or a rocket and allow us to project forward by beating anyone in our path. Finally, there is a very useful tool for the purposes of the race, which ~winds the tape~ making us gain quite a few positions in an instant. If damaging the other competitors is not easy, the same cannot be said of the opposite, indeed in practice there is a lack of maneuvers that allow us to avoid attacks, unless we ourselves have a weapon. By activatingwhen the shield-shaped icon appears, in fact, we will be able to consume our blow in a ~defensive~ way, canceling that of the enemy, but it is a strategy that does not always work as it should and which in some cases is systematically insufficient ( when they fire multiple missiles at us, for example). Playstation 3 trophies As expected, many of the forty-five Trophies contained in LittleBigPlanet Karting are obtained by completing simple operations related to the editors: create the first track, the first character, the first kart, decorate your pod and so on. Several Trophies can also be unlocked by competing online, while the Trophies obtainable thanks to the completion of the levels that make up the single player campaign are all secret. The value of the community If in terms of the single player campaign LittleBigPlanet Karting does not excite, the collaboration with Media Molecule has inevitably translated into the presence of fairly powerful editors for the creation of characters, karts and tracks, a factor which in turn has produced dozens and dozens of creations shared by the community and capable of multiplying the gaming experience, especially in multiplayer. Having redeemed the online pass, we in fact grappled with some ~cycles~ of online matches, finding matchmaking to work very well, really fast and effective, as well as the total lack of latency problems. Of course, at this point in the PlayStation 3's life cycle, seeing a voice chat that is still so immature leaves us very, very disappointed, also because Sony had a lot of time to find a unified ~software~ solution to the problem, and didn't want to exploit it. During the competition with human opponents, the casual approach to the gameplay is perhaps a little less noticeable, but it is still there to have its say, while we appreciated the minimal interface to vote for the next track by majority and the speed in passing from one event to another. On the editors front, however, we move between ups and downs. Using the unlocked objects (even with the Move controller, if desired) it is possible to create quite imaginative creations, but with the obligation to remain anchored to the LittleBigPlanet style, whereas in ModNation Racers it was so possible to range that users created in a flash a a bit of everything from superheroes to Nintendo characters. In the creation of the tracks you can move with a little more freedom, but the final result is not crazy if we think that two and a half years have passed since the release of the United Front Games racer. Finally, not even this time did we want to introduce an element that in our opinion could mix the cards on the table and enrich the experience, i.e. a functional as well as aesthetic customization of the karts: we can consider it a missed opportunity. In terms of technical implementation, on the one hand the frame rate appears very solid and there are no drops that instead afflicted ModNation Racers, but all this at the price of a significantly lower speed sensation, which inevitably brings with it a lower degree of involvement. Nice selection of music, as usual.", "date": "2012-11-23", "grade": "7.0"}
