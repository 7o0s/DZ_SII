Apart from Zelda, to enrich its library we think mainly of minor titles and independent products that the Japanese company is holding in high consideration (and worthily advertising through official channels), due to their fundamental strategic role in the breaks that separate a triple A game from the next. This certainly does not mean that at the moment there is no high-quality stuff to play - among the indies available there are several titles that have been able to stand out from the crowd, and many more will arrive in the coming months - however some of these works risk being ignored among the many presentation videos, and in fact one trailer in particular left most of the players indifferent due to its minimalist look and apparently not very modern formula. Let's talk about Graceful Explosion Machine, an old-fashioned scrolling shooter that has gracefully accompanied many of our sleepless nights, and which certainly deserves much more consideration from Nintendo Switch owners. The reasons? Quite a lot, especially if you've been playing video games for a long time and love real challenges. Few people know Graceful Explosion Machine: too bad, because it's a real surprise! Graceful or dead At first glance it is easy to understand why the title of Vertex Pop has passed under the radar of many Switch users: graphically it is of an impressive simplicity and, despite the colors, it does not catch the eye either for originality or for style. However, this particular choice is desired and directly connected to the gameplay: Graceful Explosion Machine in fact had to be as visually clear as possible, or it would have been unmanageable for the vast majority of gamers. Let's explain better: this game is based on a scrolling shooter, in which you play the pilot of a small orange ship in pursuit of dangerous aliens who have destroyed your planet to take possession of precious natural resources. The campaign, therefore, takes place on various planets under assault by a mysterious alien race; planets that you will have to save by destroying every enemy that comes within range. So far everything is within the norm, but after the initial tutorial levels the first peculiarities appear: first of all, the game has few bullets on the screen, but such a number of enemies as to be in any case comparable to a Japanese Bullet Hell (shooter where the screen is normally full of projectiles to avoid with absolute precision on high difficulties); moreover, your ship rotates on the two-dimensional plane thanks to a key - thus shooting in only one direction until it is moved manually - and to survive it must necessarily use all the weapons at its disposal, since the effective basic firing overheats after a few seconds leaving you uncovered. It might seem trivial, but we assure you that it is not at all, because there are four ~moves~ in total - dodging, homing missiles, spinning sword and sniper laser - and using any of them except dodging leads to the consumption of an energy bar which only partially fills as time passes, and fully as you collect valuable gems dropped by enemies upon death. Perfect equation Were you able to put the pieces of the puzzle together? Good, because this shooter thrives on the perfect balance of its mechanics and the variety of enemies. In practice, from level to level we find ourselves dealing with increasingly numerous and differentiated aliens, and some of them are specially designed for a certain type of weapon; this situation forces you to make the most of every tool to survive, where you are always forced to stay in the middle of the fray to recover the aforementioned energy. Things then take another leap forward when you want to score as high as possible, because the mechanics are also built around the game's unique multiplier system: if you don't kill enemies fast enough your multiplier will drop back to zero, preventing you from obtaining a passable score on the global rankings (they are divided for each picture of each planet) and also losing one of the three life points available to the ship resets it, forcing you to be perfect at almost maniacal levels to abuse the maximum number of enemies . It soon becomes a kind of drug, which drives you to repeat the levels continuously - always divided into three phases of increasing difficulty - and leads to unrepeatable curses in the very difficult advanced planets. In short, it is oneincredibly refined and competent shooter, perfect for anyone who loves a gameplay capable of rewarding a player's skills and putting precision and reflexes to the test as only certain Japanese titles can do, only partially plagued by a couple of defects - which derive precisely from the its unique nature. The first is the lack of content: the game has only four planets divided into multiple missions, and is therefore quite short if you don't get caught up in its perfectionist and competitive nature. Furthermore, the only variant to the basic missions are ~challenges~ that allow you to play all the levels of a specific planet in series, and reach levels of difficulty that border on pure madness. In short, it is an elitist title, designed for players who enjoyed burning coins on the Gradius cabinet to play a perfect game, and with little to offer to all the others. As a pastime to carry around on the Switch, however, it really has potential, and understandably it runs beautifully on the Nintendo console, without any jolts.", "date": "2017-04-21", "grade": "8.0"}
