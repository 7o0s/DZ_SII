{"name": "Industry Giant II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/industry-giant-ii_a.html", "text": "The game Let's start from the beginning: as already mentioned, in IG2 you will have to create an industry from scratch and you will have a certain number of millions of dollars with which to put yourself into the running. You may find yourself a bit bewildered at first, given the sheer number of products that will be possible to create. You can enter the mining, food, textile, furniture, etc. industries. etc. In any case you will have to start by constructing the buildings necessary to obtain the raw materials, for example a sheep farm (for wool) or a cotton plantation in case you want to try your hand at the textile industry, or an open-air mine for ore mining, and so on. Usually then there will be a need (but not always) for an intermediate building that transforms the raw material into workable material. For example cotton will need to be worked into fabric first. Finally there will be a need for one last building that works the various materials to obtain the final product. Some types of product (for example jeans) will need more than one type of material, also requiring rubber, and therefore you will need an oil well and a chemical factory. The mechanics of the functioning of these buildings is simple, each building must be placed in a certain area which may or may not be favorable to its purposes (the cotton plantations will be placed where it is warmer), after which at your order, the building in question will start producing and placing the material in a ~warehouse~, in a warehouse that you will have to place nearby. The other intermediate buildings will take the material from this warehouse and process it returning the result. This whole game mechanic reminded me a lot of the various The Settlers, Caesars, due to the long line of resources that it is necessary to have to get to do the simplest things. In Industry Giant 2, you will also have the possibility to choose what to produce (some buildings will be able to produce more things, for example the cattle farm will be able to produce leather (for the textile industry) or meat), how quickly and how much to pay the workers . The speed of production is important since not all buildings have the same production rate, so it will be necessary to juggle speed too to avoid being overwhelmed by the overabundance of certain types of products (also you will have to avoid saturating the market). From producer to consumer! And now? Your clothes will be waiting in the warehouse before being delivered to the shop what to do? You will need to build transportation, either via a train station, a truck terminal, or a port (and later, an airport). Naturally you will have to choose between various sizes for the stations, unfortunately for the railway ones, despite the high number of ~parking~ tracks for the trains, the incoming and outgoing ones will be only two, which in the advanced stages will create numerous queues and force you to adjust the situation a little by creating separate stations, for example one for unloading the goods and one for loading, in order to avoid queues. Once the station is built, you'll have to connect it to another station located near a city, by building tracks (you'll have to do the same thing for trucks, building roads if there aren't any already). Unfortunately it is not possible to build double tracks in a single ~box~, but you will have to do it manually by building other tracks next to the existing ones, which briefly runs out of space. As many of you will imagine, the station will need a warehouse located nearby from which to take the goods and an additional warehouse in the arrival station to unload what has been transported. Finally, the shop (each type of industry will have a particular one) will need a... warehouse (!) from which to take the goods that will be sold. Clearly the placement of all these various buildings will be of key importance: the shop cannot cover an entire city (unless it is very small) and therefore the warehouses will have to be placed so as to be able to cover the whole city with two or three shops strategically placed that take goods from the same warehouse (otherwise you would need to build multiple train stops for the same city). And now? Once the finished product is in the shops, you just have to wait for the money to arrive. The more money you have, the more products you can supply. However, there are some very important things to say: as far as the products are concerned, there is a differentiation based on the season. Toexample, for the textile industry, you can produce winter clothes and summer clothes, obviously the winter ones will be sold very little during the summer and vice versa. Furthermore, the demand for a particular product also depends on the price (which you can change from the shop) and on the size of the city (so you should start by clearly supplying the big cities). The game would really seem to be all here .. Once the various buildings have been built, all you have to do is wait to make money and start building the infrastructure necessary for the production of other types of goods. As time passes, new types of products will become available. Despite everything, Industry Giant 2 can be remarkably exciting and as is the style of games of this genre, even just seeing everything you've built ~function~ can be a reason to play it (otherwise no one would play Sim City anymore). But! There is a but! We have not counted on micromanagement! Throughout the review I have often mentioned the railways as a means of transport. Which is quite easily explained: in addition to being the most convenient, it is also the least stressful to use. In fact, as is obligatory, each train will be able to carry a certain number of carriages in which to place a unit of ~goods~ (whichever it may be). The truck can only carry one, so you'll need more trucks. So far, nothing strange. The problem arises if for any reason you would like to change something in the aforementioned trucks, which being managed individually, you will have to do it for each truck. Luckily, you can update them all together, but if you want them to change destination, you'll have to do it individually. Without a doubt, if they had been managed as ~fleets of trucks~ and not individually, they would have made the task easier for the player. Let's not talk about the trains, which being virtually without AI will not know which route to choose. For example, let's say that for station A and station B there is only one rail where two trains pass. When they meet they will slow down considerably and then resume the march. If you were to build a second rail, the trains will not intelligently notice their presence, but you will have to configure them manually by activating the necessary switches, a task that weighs on the player and which becomes very complicated in the later stages of the game when you have dozens of trains and numerous stations. Conclusions We are not dealing with the definitive heir to Transport Tycoon, that's for sure. Industry Giant 2 is a game that despite the serious flaws still manages to attract fans of the genre (the others pass the hand because they could find themselves lost in front of a product of this type). In terms of graphics and sound we are average in the genre (but much more could have been done).. however, there are some touches of class (when it's New Year's Eve you will see particle fireworks over the cities). In my humble opinion as a computer science student, some of the flaws perhaps derive from a certain inexperience of the development team in programming, the most ~serious~ thing (but which makes you smile and think) and that to access the main menu while you are in the game, the program will save the position and then reload it when you want to go back to the game (the classic ~resume~)... Something that hasn't been seen since the days of the Commodore 64 (and that perhaps wasn't even there, in fact I think it's the first time I've seen such a thing). Minor issues aside, many other flaws could have been solved through the implementation of a certain AI. In conclusion, IG2 is not a product for everyone that exposes some flaws serious enough but not such as to prevent the game from entertaining its fans. Industry Giant II Produced by Jowood Productions, Industry Giant 2 is basically a real-time management game dedicated to the magical world of industry, as indeed the title itself suggests. Going into the details, we find that IG2 is very similar to Railroad Tycoon 2, but has some fundamental differences. In fact, if RT2 had the aim of simulating a railway transport company, putting the production of various goods in the background, Industry Giant 2 instead has the opposite purpose, placing industrial production and all related aspects as the fulcrum of the simulation ( including precisely, the distribution of products to the shops).", "date": "2002-08-06", "grade": null}
