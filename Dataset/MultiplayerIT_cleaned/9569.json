{"name": "Monopoly", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83065-monopoly-il-denaro-non-dorme-mai.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360 The title needs no introduction, being in fact for years, better for decades, a ~simple pastime~ in vogue for all ages. The aim of the game is to move the checkers belonging to individual players on the board using two dice. Everything is played on the value of the squares where the various ~markers~ stop. The key to the game is all here: the first player who stops in the box forced by the roll of the die can choose whether or not to buy the property or land, if he decides not to buy it it should be auctioned or the operation could be canceled by passing the turn to the opponents. However, remember that the goal is obviously to become monopolists, therefore the richest in the city and to have the others declare bankruptcy. The game enhances our desire as an economist / strategist to bankrupt our opponents, with a sometimes long but very rewarding process. Economists on the loose! However, we must think before acting, for this reason among the game options we have the possibility of being supported by a tutorial where Mr Monopoly gives instructions and explains how to play, increasing the duration of the game, obviously there is also the possibility of playing without. It is possible to choose between two types of view, that of the classic game board where you can move the pawns, or the one that allows us to experience the city digitally. Starting the game we have the possibility to play only in the Monopoly city and the Classic board, the other options will be unlocked according to our progress in the game. You start with a total of standard money equal to your opponent's one thousand five hundred M in Monopoly money, you cash out two hundred M when you go from the ~GO!~ and the game lasts until there is only one player left. The railway stations to buy are particularly popular as the single rent of them could double based on the number of stations purchased. There are also unexpected events, one of these could be a fine of fifteen M for speeding, for example. The characters to choose from are really nice and suitable for all ages but in particular they reflect some types of people such as the captain, the pilot, the dandy or the country boy who are still assigned the personalized pawn chosen in pendant with the protagonist opting for the ship, the classic car, the cylinder or the wheelbarrow. The fun during the execution of the game lies - as Mr Monopoly suggests - in competing in the auctions: you start from a price and you have to play up and down, never bet too much compared to your opponent! In fact, he will first try to greatly increase the price and then drastically lower it in order to take away more money than expected. You have to be smart and have the speed on the keys and know how to manage the raise or lower mode by ten while you are in the middle of the auction. The personal progress of the game is visualized in a real way inside the city: each participant has a building that grows or falls with respect to the win of the single game and this increase or regression is illustrated to us at the end of the round. Having fun is good for you is a fact, so try to give yourself a moment of true enjoyment with Monopoly, at any time even spending a pleasant evening with friends staying up until the wee hours because, as we well know... money never sleeps!! !
