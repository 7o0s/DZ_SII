{"name": "Down in Bermuda", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/down-in-bermuda-la-recensione.html", "text": "After a period of launch in Early Access, it's time for a review of Down in Bermuda in its most complete version, currently available exclusively on Apple Arcade but also coming soon to PC, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. It is an adventure structured in puzzles arranged along various islands, thus combining elements of exploration with the solution of real puzzles, which range between various designs and types. The story tells in a very hermetic way of an aviator who crashes during a terrible storm and finds himself shipwrecked on a strange archipelago full of bizarre ruins, animals and mysterious mechanisms: obviously it is the infamous Bermuda Triangle, whose secrets appear in this much less disturbing game than one is usually led to think, thanks also to the sweet and dreamy graphic style like that of an illustrated children's book. The aim of the game is to find a way out by wandering among the islets that make up the archipelago and solving the puzzles hidden within them. In practice, the entire maps are all made up of puzzles scattered around the setting, which we can explore directly by scrolling on the scenarios, enlarging or bringing the shot closer or by rotating it to observe every corner of the islands in detail. The peculiarity of Down in Bermuda is the fact that it presents different types of puzzles to solve but all based on contextual interaction with the elements of the scenario: it is not a classic graphic adventure, with the collection and combination of objects, but action directly on the visible objects on the screen, through the simple touch on them. In this sense, the game is somewhat reminiscent of the ~hermetic~ puzzles of Amanita Design's adventures such as Samorost, in which part of the challenge is precisely understanding which elements to act on and what the reactions might be to interaction with some objects, the strangeness that also here pervades the entire explorable world. However, more structured puzzles can also be found, requiring a more traditional application of logic. A mystery wrapped in puzzles This mixed puzzle structure keeps the game somewhere between a more classic puzzle and a continuous ~pixel hunting~ in search of hidden secrets in the scenario. In fact, the protagonist must be able to collect a sufficient amount of energy globes that allow him to open new portals and visit further islands, and these spheres can be found everywhere: some are conquered only by solving puzzles, others are simply hidden inside the scenario, which generates the need to try to interact a little with any suspicious element of the settings, looking for possible surprises. This is perhaps the weakest element of the gameplay, because it involves groping touching practically everything we see around, given that some interactions are not that much predictable, which refers to the simple ~hidden object~ type adventures that depopulate in the mobile sector but do not really shine for inventiveness in puzzle design. Similarly, some puzzles are not based on a particularly complex logic and can be solved practically by operating levers and pressing keys at random as they appear or are highlighted, without great reasoning. However, it must be said that these more simplistic elements serve above all to thicken the gaming experience, also making the exploration of the scenarios an active element of the gameplay and making sure that there are no dead moments between the more structured puzzles. As a result, the level of challenge is not exactly high, in some cases linked more to the need to scan the whole scenario in search of objects to break or move to find the globes than to real puzzles. However, you have to see Down in Bermuda as a game with a calm and relaxing pace, certainly not a constant exercise for the brain like other adventure / puzzle games like The Witness. Meanwhile, between a pulled lever, a pressed button and some combination of figures to find, we also witness a cheerful and funny theater of colorful characters who reveal the strangeness of the Bermuda islands, in a funny modern fairy tale style that can please both older than the younger ones.", "date": "2021-01-11", "grade": "7.0"}
