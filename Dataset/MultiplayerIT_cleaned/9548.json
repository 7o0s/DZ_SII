{"name": "Sei fraggato!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83338-quake-arena-arcade-sei-fraggato.html", "text": "Eleven years have passed since the release of Quake III: Arena, the historic first-person shooter from Id Software, totally devoted to multiplayer. Ideally continuing the path already traced by the Quake Live browser version, an edition specially designed for Xbox 360 finally arrives. Distributed in digital delivery on the Live Arcade channel (1200 MP), optimized for 720p, and with the discounted full support for the service online Microsoft. To begin with, it is nice to see that this is not a lazy port, but a conversion not without some exclusive features. First of all, the presence of ten new maps created specifically for this game, and a revised key mapping for the joypad. All the previously available maps are present, making up a rather considerable set (we are talking about forty total maps). If we exclude the support for high definition, aesthetically however very little has changed of the Id engine, thus demonstrating the weight of the years. But a product like this is not chosen for its technological supremacy, but rather for the goodness of the gameplay and, why not, a touch of nostalgia. And there is little to claim in exquisitely playful terms, despite the archaic and essential structure, Quake Arena Arcade still amazes today for the cleanliness of the game design, the incredible frenzy and the commendable balance. Proving that its status as a legend in the field of fps is well deserved. The formula is the simplest imaginable, a certain number of players is thrown into a map of variable dimensions, ditto the conformation, and you fight to the last drop of blood. The aim remains the same, to be the first to reach the established number of kills, or frags, while whoever falls is immediately put back into play. Then there are the usual more strategic modes, such as capture the flag, but there is no doubt that the main value of Quake is best expressed in the aforementioned deathmatch. Xbox 360 goals As usual for Live Arcade titles, 200 points are available across a dozen objectives. Not exactly easy to achieve, especially because they are almost totally focused on online clashes. Several hours of dedication will therefore be required to win the perfect score. quad damage The Pi Studios, responsible for the conversion, have tried to meet the needs of console users, adding a key for 180 degree rotation. The same mapping of the keys, although totally configurable, proves to be particularly apt, assigning the jump to the left trigger and the change of weapons to the main ones. Despite everything, however, we are always talking about a title designed natively for mouse and keyboard, which unfortunately turns out to be rather uncomfortable for the certainly more moderate movements offered by a pad. Given the unusual speed that distinguishes the action, and the lightning reflexes required to not succumb, it is not easy to be able to target enemies. In this regard, we recommend lowering the movement sensitivity on the axes, in order to guarantee better precision. Graphically we certainly can't cry out for a miracle, the hd levels make their good effect, the polygonal load and the textures are decidedly less, on the other hand everything moves without the slightest uncertainty in the splendor of 60fps. As with its predecessors, the main appeal of the product is represented by multiplayer games, but the single has not been neglected, adding a solo campaign and the possibility of fraggarsi with opponents controlled by the CPU (up to 16). This is an opportunity to enjoy the remarkable artificial intelligence, capable of offering a high-thickness challenge, computer skill is often confused with that of a player in the flesh, and it is a feature that even after all these years is difficult to find in similar products. The brilliance of the game itself moves on the same level, capable of exerting a perverse charm thanks to its historic touches of class, the charisma of the weapons, the incisiveness of the sounds, the sick atmosphere of the levels, which has a lot to do with that of other Id sagas, see Doom or Unreal Torunament. On the other hand, we did not like the total absence of local multiplayer via split screen, a desirable possibility given the venerable age of the engine, replaced by the very little popular system link between multiple consoles. Considering the lack of appeal of the single player campaign, the main attraction of this version is the online game through the Live service, fully supported with rankings, modes and so on, but the quality of the matches is very fluctuating and at the moment the community is present turns out to be pquite thin.", "date": "2010-12-23", "grade": "7.0"}
