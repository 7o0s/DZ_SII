Perhaps no one has ever told the truth about what happened over ten years ago, when Namco decided to develop its new Tales for Xbox 360, a console that was far from popular in Japan. According to historical producers Hideo Baba and Yoshito Higuchi, Tales Studio wanted to develop for a next-generation console, but work began before Sony presented PlayStation 3, which is why Namco used Xbox 360 as a springboard. The game was released in 2008 and was very successful internationally, but at home sales were struggling to take off also and above all due to the low diffusion of the Microsoft console. This convinced Namco to develop a revised and corrected version for PlayStation 3... and it was then that Tales of Vesperia became a true legend. Namco, in fact, never localized the PlayStation 3 version in English. The years went by with rumors and increasingly vague announcements. Tales Studio closed shortly after, Tales continued to come out almost every year through thick and thin, Hideo Baba changed company and Tales of Vesperia for PlayStation 3 remained in Japanese despite the pleas and petitions of fans. Every now and then an American voice actor claimed to have recorded a new dialogue, then corrected himself, and meanwhile some former employee told on social networks of a phantom exclusivity contract that Microsoft would have signed to ensure that the only western version of Tales of Vesperia remained the Xbox one 360. We will probably never know what really happened, but who cares after all: ten years later, Tales of Vesperia is back on the shelves, remastered and in a multiplatform version. We've played the PlayStation 4 version and here's our review. The legend of Vesperia The bright star Ardor Vesperia shines in the sky of Terca Lumireis, a planet where magic and technology mix in the so-called blastia, everyday devices that channel the invisible energy called aer. The blastia are used to fight and also to feed means of transport and public services: when the blastia of the water system in the popular district of the capital disappears into thin air, the mercenary Yuri Lowell is forced to investigate the theft on behalf of his neighbors . Yuri is a former imperial soldier, a disillusioned young man who left the army to pursue his ideals. A series of coincidences force him to escort Estelle, a naive princess who is looking for Flynn, a bodyguard of the sovereign who also happens to be Yuri's best friend. What begins as a simple journey becomes, needless to say, a complicated odyssey with the fate of the world at stake. The Tales are famous for the plots that deliberately respect the stereotypes of fantasy and Japanese animation aimed at teenagers, but also by the same standards as the Tales of Vesperia series it is actually one of the more adult Tales in terms of themes and characterization of the characters. Don't be fooled by the soft and well-groomed line of the always excellent Kosuke Fujishima: the protagonists are much more multifaceted than it seems. Yuri, in particular, is one of the most successful heroes of this franchise. He hasn't lost his memory and doesn't have a tormented past: he is an adult trying to do the right thing in a world that makes it increasingly difficult. In a short time, Yuri becomes the point of reference of the group, a kind of father figure also willing to get his hands dirty for the good of all, an aspect that during the story gets to project a disturbing shadow on an otherwise positive and optimistic character . The rest of the cast is outlined equally well, net of some less successful characters like Judith. It is the little ones in particular who amaze, revealing an unsuspected degree of maturity even for a Tales, a series that in any case often relies on the figure of the child prodigy, just think of characters like Anise in Tales of the Abyss or Genis in Tales of Symphonia. Karol joins the party relatively early, and his transition from petulant adventurer to intrepid guildmaster is described with great ease. Patty is the surprise of the Definitive Edition, having been introduced only in the Japanese version for PlayStation 3. It's not a stretch, on the contrary: the writers have rewritten many scenes to integrate her smoothly into the adventure, giving her a role of primary importance. Besides being a hoot to control - she can change different fighting styles - Patty is a funny and mature child at the same time, haunted by the fame of a grandfather she never met.to. In Ardor Vesperia, the guild founded by Yuri and Karol, he will find a dysfunctional and affectionate family. Ultimately, Tales of Vesperia is a story full of feelings. It doesn't have a revolutionary screenplay, mind you, and we've seen and strayed at some narrative junctions, but it's very well written, it delivers quite a few low blows in unsuspected moments and is told through sparkling and never dull dialogues. The merit also goes to the unprecedented Italian localization which, while taking some liberties here and there, flows like a pleasure and gives a touch of personality to many characters. The direction is sufficiently dynamic, but it must be emphasized that Tales of Vesperia is a last generation title which in terms of spectacularity leaves something to be desired; even so, the painstaking detail in how characters pose or move during dialogue remains a step up from more recent Tales. Purists will be happy to know that it is also possible to select the Japanese dubbing, in addition to the English one, but on the music front, it must be admitted that Tales of Vesperia is one of the less incisive works by Motoi Sakuraba who, at the time, found himself experimenting with a new registration system. The soundtrack is still spot on and always catchy, but most of the tracks struggle to stick. We remind you once again: Tales of Vesperia has ten years behind it and buying it as a latest generation JRPG would be a huge mistake, remastered or not. The beauty of the cel shading employed and the colors chosen to represent the soft and graceful models of the characters on the screen immediately catch the eye, but a closer look will notice more than an ugly texture in low resolution and a certain poverty of detail in the settings. Namco's artists have mostly bet on the detailed backdrops and on the effects that transform the fights into pyrotechnic displays, especially every time Rita or the other magicians cast their spells. The Art of Combat Tales of Vesperia is an exquisitely traditional Japanese RPG. If in the last Tales we moved from one city to another exploring huge scenarios that imitated open worlds, in Tales of Vesperia we go back to wandering around a three-dimensional miniature map of the world, first on foot and then by ship or airship, a vintage detail that fans of the genre will probably like very much. The structure is the classic one of the old school JRPGs: the skits and the dialogues anticipate our objectives which usually translate into the exploration of some labyrinthine ~dungeon~ full of enemies to fight, chests to open and puzzles to solve. And then, of course, there's a boss to defeat at the end. The variety of settings is remarkable, while respecting the canons of the fantasy genre: woods, caves, dungeons, deserts, ancient temples, mobile fortresses and so on. Sometimes you come across some puzzle to be solved with a minimum of intelligence and the Sorcerer's Ring that Yuri wears on his finger and which allows you to interact in various ways with the environment. In short, nothing particularly sophisticated, but the ~dungeons~ are well designed and never boring; moreover, enemies are visible and can be outflanked, dodged or stunned to gain an advantage at the start of combat, should one decide to engage them by making contact with their models. At that point the game loads into the battlefield, a three-dimensional scenario where the player deploys up to four characters and controls a specific one, though up to three friends can command the rest of the party. In case you play alone, a large number of behavioral options allow you to customize the strategy of the artificial intelligence that interprets our battlemates, and it is also possible to manually select the targets and the Arts to use against them, perhaps assigning them to shortcuts on the joypad. Tales of Vesperia employs yet another variant of the Linear Motion Battle System, called Evolved Flex-Range Linear Motion Battle System, although in reality it is not so different as to justify such a long name. By holding down a key it is possible to move freely around the battlefield, but when we choose a target and decide to attack it, we do it following a straight line: it therefore becomes very important to choose the angle, especially if we intend to hit multiple enemies with a combo or an Art. The Arts are special attacks and spells, divided into various types. They are mostly learned by leveling up or solving some side quests, while the Arts arcane are unlocked by using a basic Art a certain number of times. Then there are the Altered Arts, which are activated under certain circumstances, and the Explosive Arts or Mystic Arts which inflict more damage than the others but can only be used after loading and consuming the Over the Limit indicator that temporarily boosts a character. Chaining Arts into increasingly elaborate combos is part of the fun, but it's also the most efficient way to dispatch enemies once you've mastered the Fatal Blow technique. Each Art is distinguished by a color - green, red or blue - which weakens more or less certain types of enemies. Once the target's resistance to a certain type of Art has been exhausted, it is possible to take advantage of a very short moment to inflict a decisive attack (or extremely harmful, in the case of bosses) which also guarantees various bonuses. The Fatal Blow mechanic is interesting, but opportunities to use it rarely occur during normal fights, which wear off within seconds once you master the control system. Instead, it becomes more useful, if not fundamental, when facing the bosses: the latter in some cases really give a hard time and require a certain preparation, even at a strategic level, not only as regards the equipment. In fact, Tales of Vesperia relies on an interesting skill system that becomes more and more complex and profound as the hours of play follow one another. In fact, weapons and accessories confer some specific skills to the various characters: some skills are passive and increase this or that statistic, others guarantee new opportunities for movement, still others change the Arts and so on. Some also drastically affect the character's fighting style and each ability remains active as long as the item in question is equipped. By defeating enemies, however, characters can permanently learn a skill, keeping it even after switching weapons: at which point, however, they will have to manually enable it in the appropriate screen. Each skill costs a certain amount of points, and each character's pool is limited; this means that, at a certain point in the game, you will have to carefully decide which skills to activate, taking advantage of any synergies. In short, it is clear that Tales of Vesperia is a title that gradually reaches a considerable level of depth, while always remaining accessible and never chaotic or complicated to manage: in this sense, it is indeed relaxing and linear in progression, but above all it pushes the player to fight to learn skills, often changing equipment to try new strategies. We are still talking about a JRPG that lasts at least forty hours, several more if you decide to uncover every secret. The Definitive Edition, in fact, adds two controllable and permanent characters to the cast: the aforementioned Patty, completely new for those who played the original Xbox 360 version, and Flynn, who was only temporary in the original. There are also various unreleased side missions to complete that unlock weapons, Arts or titles, fattening an endgame that was already nurtured ten years ago. In this respect, Tales of Vesperia is reconfirmed as one of the best Tales out there.", "date": "2019-01-09", "grade": "8.5"}
