A dutiful gentleman who never loses sight of tea time? Maybe scruffy from overwork, yet still a sucker for good manners? Well, the figure of the inspector that is provided to us by the developers of Straandlooper is very different, definitely out of the norm. In Hector: Badge of Carnage - Episode 1, in fact, we play the role of a big, fat, listless policeman, with a distorted idea of fundamental values and a few too many vices; perfect mirror of a city in disarray, with a terrorist who has just barricaded himself in a building after taking a bunch of people hostage and wants the police to follow his orders exactly. The agents are fired upon by the criminal, and the snipers on the rooftops are so hot that they end up accidentally hitting some passers-by. In short, the situation is desperate and there seems to be only one person capable of putting things right (also because they couldn't get worse): Inspector Hector. Ok, but where did it go? A cop disaster Hector wakes up dazed in a cell at the police station after spending the night with an unidentified prostitute who has taken his pants. Empty bottles on the floor, an oversized used condom under the mattress and the iron door closed by some careless colleague who ran with the others to the crime scene. In short, the building is deserted and our dear inspector has to find a way to get out of the cell. Clearly, right from the start, the player is therefore asked to think in a certain way, to find absurd solutions to absurd problems, to avoid sensible reasoning. And so the combination of a string and the condom mentioned above provides us with an improvised ~fishing rod~ to be lowered into the toilet to retrieve the metal clip that will magically open the cell door. Reaching the station concourse, however, will only be the first step. Have you forgotten that we are without pants? Who knows if that bizarre boy handcuffed to a chair will be able to help us... Hector: Badge of Carnage - Episode 1, despite its vulgar and irreverent humor (at least unpublished on the App Store and in any case rare for the genre to which this product belongs ), looks like the most classic of ~point and click~ adventures, which on the iPhone clearly bases the control system on the touch screen: one touch to observe an object, two touches to interact with it (when possible), a ~slide ~ horizontally to traverse the scenery and a combination of sequential taps to merge two items in the inventory or use them to interact with the background. Hector's Bizarre Adventure Although it is only the first episode of a series that will certainly cause discussions for its pungent script, the game organizes the puzzles as ~acts~ and automatically excludes obsolete interactions: once a certain character is exploited for the purposes of the story, it will no longer be possible to talk to him . Speaking of dialogues, for each of them the interface provides a series of alternative sentences that need to be gutted only in some cases: luckily the developers have seen fit not to ~force~ us to do anything, and to figure out by ourselves which objects can be useful for the continuation of the adventure and which dialogues should be explored. As in all ~point and click~ adventures, however, the stalemate is around the corner: when you don't know how to move forward, you find yourself repeating the same actions over and over again until enlightenment arrives, very much indeed. rewarding after spending tens of minutes trying. If the story and the dialogues are certainly the strong point of the Straandlooper title, the same can also be said of the technical realization, truly excellent: the approximately two hundred megabytes that make up Hector: Badge of Carnage - Episode 1 consist of extremely well designed graphics , animated in an ~intelligent~ way and characterized by an excellent use of colors. Likewise the sound sees the characters recite each sentence with a marked English accent with relative subtitles (the developers ensure, however, that they are making contact for an Italian translation), something that is not seen every day in games for iPhone and iPod Touch. In conclusion, the control system proves to be quite precise even when the interactable areas are much smaller than our fingers.
