{"name": "Blade II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blade-ii-2.html", "text": "Presentation Blade II is distributed in Italy by Halifax and in the version that you will find on the shelves of your trusted store, the game will be multilingual, therefore also with Italian subtitles. I remind you that this review is based on the English version of the game, which apart from the subtitles is exactly the same as ours. After starting our Xbox and inserting the DVD of the game, Blade II welcomes us with a short intro on the world of comics by Marvel to make us obviously remember the origin of the character we will play. After this sequence, a movie will begin that will show us the cinematic version of Blade, in the new film produced and released in Italian cinemas in the summer period that has just ended. The movie shows us some clips of the film with highly spectacular scenes such as the duel between Blade and the elite vampire soldiers and countless other frames. Having seen the aforementioned film, I can only recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy some high-level action seasoned with some decidedly splatter elements and the bluster of our vampire hunter. Out of curiosity, the DVD of the film Blade II should be released in January here in Italy. After this presentation we arrive at the main menu of the game, we will have the possibility to start a new game, to resume a game that has already started (load game), to observe our progress in the game (save progress), to enter the options menu and finally to enter the dvd extra section. However, this last section is very sparse and frankly it could also be easily left out since it contains the credits of the game (which could still be included at the end of the game) and the initial movie showing clips from the second film. The game menus are very simple and intuitive and can be explored with the A key to select and with the B key to go back. Gameplay By selecting the new game mode, we will have the opportunity to make 4 choices, of which only two are available at the beginning. They are nothing more than four campaigns each divided into a certain number of missions to complete. Starting the game we will have the possibility to choose whether to practice with the comfortable trainers where we will be able to better learn all the movements and actions that our Blade will be able to perform in a special arena. After completing the training we will be able to start the first campaign divided into missions, after completing the first we will be able to access the second and so on. However, all completed missions can be replayed to discover new secrets and increase our score, but I'll tell you about that later. The missions are decidedly linear and the related objectives are shown during the loading of the mission as well as the secondary objectives which, if completed, guarantee us a bonus score. The locations of the missions range from the subway to underground car parks, skyscrapers, buildings, etc., the classic disco could not be missing, where Blade will obviously give his best in the excessive use of anti-vampire weapons and deadly martial arts. As for the control method, the game uses the left analog stick to move, the right one to fight with punches and kicks (the fighting management is in full 3D), with the X key to jump, with Y to reload the weapon, with the right trigger to activate levers and buttons and finally with the digital stick to select the weapon. At first, the combination of these keys could be not very intuitive and easy, but after a few games you become familiar with this type of control and the initial problems will be immediately overcome. As for the points system mentioned above, the game assigns a certain number of points for each enemy killed, for each glyph collected and if the secondary objectives are completed (almost revealed at the beginning of the mission). Once the mission is finished and completed, a special table will show the time taken, the enemies killed, the glyphs collected and the completion of the secondary objectives. For each element, points will be given which will be added to those already in our possession. The points are very important to unlock all the weapons in fact the most sophisticated will be available only when we reach a certain number of points. Weapons include the classic silver-stud pistol, powerful shotgun, pure-steel boomerang, heavy-duty armour, fist pump, serium syringes, and flashbang grenades. For each mission, however, we will be able to take only aSome weapons, since space is limited in slots, which however will increase as you continue in the game. During gameplay, Blade's health will be indicated by a green line at the bottom of the screen flanked by two other lines, one blue and one red. The blue line represents Blade's ability to regenerate, acquiring some life in critical condition. The red line, on the other hand, will increase by killing vampires and will be able to go up for three levels: in the first the classic sword will be enabled, in the second, in addition to the sword, Blade will have an enhanced shield while reaching the third level the time in which we will have the sword and the shield will increase. In conclusion Blade II presents a gameplay that is quite difficult at first but which is appreciated only after a little practice, longevity is on a decent level while the only flaw in my opinion is the possibility of saving only at the end of the level. In some cases (for very long levels) there will be checkpoints where to save but in most cases we will have to restart the level from the beginning in case we are overwhelmed during the mission. Graphics and Sound Blade II is a multiplatform title in fact it is also present on PS2, despite this the title in question settles on a discrete graphic level. The Blade character is made up of a good number of polygons and his animations are quite convincing without excelling in spectacularity, which you can verify for yourself by observing the various screenshots in the article. The level of detail of the enemies is a little lower than that of Blade and the polygonal models are not particularly evolved. As for the environments, the textures are of good quality as well as the light effects (which can be improved) and the shadows that are projected on the walls, the effects of explosions and bursts of firearms are convincing. A particular note should be made to Blade's special moves, during a fight, it may happen that the action slows down and through a close-up view our hero deals the final blow to the vampire on duty who will later be pulverized (the effect is the same seen in the two films). These sequences are pleasant to look at, in fact they make the combat phases less monotonous, in some cases Blade himself will comment on his special moves. In terms of sound, although the game uses Dolby Digital 5.1, the soundtrack is almost inaudible while the sound effects remain at a sufficient level. Conclusions Blade II turned out to be an honest game, a pure arcade that enjoys fighting and impersonating the charismatic vampire hunter. However, the title in question is also afflicted by some features that may not be liked, such as the only possibility of playing in single player, the underdeveloped sound department and the possibility of saving only at the end of the level. The latter choice certainly increases the final longevity of the title but could also be a cause of frustration especially during complex and particularly demanding levels. In conclusion a good game even if it could be improved in some respects. Pros: Fun and playable Great atmosphere Fair longevity Cons: Not great graphics and sound There is no multiplayer mode Insufficient extra section The origins The character of this game owes its origin to the world of American comics, in fact, for the first time he made his debut in the comics sector, enjoying great success in the United States, under the Marvel label. Thanks to the great success achieved, Blade later landed on the big screen played by the tough Wesley Snipes in 1998 and in the summer period just ended in Blade II, a film from which this Xbox game is partly based. I remember that the first game inspired by the invincible vampire hunter appeared on the PSX platform, without however experiencing noteworthy success. Now the famous nosferatus hunter tries again under the Activision label which for the occasion relies on the solid and tested software house named Mucky Foot, already authors of well-made titles of which I personally remember with pleasure Urban Chaos for pc. Blade II is developed for Xbox and PS2, so consequently it's a cross-platform game, which I must state right away, avoiding hasty prejudices, let's enter the world of Blade...........", "date": "2002-11-25", "grade": null}
