{"name": "Praetorians", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/praetorians-3.html", "text": "But what?!?! The camera does not rotate ? This is the comment that many of you will be able to make when they realize that the game view is - alas - partially fixed. The camera can zoom within an acceptable range, so as to show you the troops in detail or, with a wide overview, your entire army, but it cannot rotate, leaving lovers of the freedom of movement typical of other titles with a three-dimensional even less performing; because it must be said, the graphic impact is more than positive, and the detail - both of the units and of the environment - is very high. Not negligible therefore this drawback, which in the long run fades into the background however, because you will soon find yourself immersed in the vicissitudes of the battle, and perhaps having a 360 view would have made things more complicated In fact, in the creation of Praetorians the fiery types of Pyro Studios have focused their attention on the dynamics of warfare and the complexity of the tactics you can adopt. The accumulation of resources is instead a secondary aspect, which is provided by the inhabitants of the fortified villages that you can and must control: the villagers will provide food and supplies and will allow you to train the various types of units that will form the ranks of the your army. Once you have formed your legions, you can group them and make them march towards the enemy, with the rhythmic sound of their footsteps marking the pressing rhythm of your thirst for conquest. This is an RTS where you think in large numbers; the units are churned out thirty at a time, and you cannot control them individually, only group them or divide them to form large armed phalanxes or small assault groups. Epic Songs... or maybe not? Being an important production, high level audio was expected. Instead, both the sound effects and the music are good, but in the standard. It almost seems that the developers have decided to settle instead of aiming for something truly evocative, epic and prominent. The final mix is decidedly ambient, with little personality and sometimes boring. Moreover, the quality of the orchestral simulation is not exceptional (the choirs disappoint a lot). More could have been done. Let's go into the details: first of all, the soundtrack is only 8 tracks. A couple more wouldn't have been evil. The best track is definitely the battle track. The percussions are really nice, but then comes the choir which spoils the realism of the production. Some instruments (like the harp) are barely audible. It is a pity that the track is short: it could have developed in a more convincing way. The introductory piece is not bad either, but with the usual notes: the percussions are very beautiful, the choir is bad, the atmosphere barely borders on epic but has something ~bitter~ and boring. The melody doesn't stand out strongly but blends in with the arrangement. To be a video game soundtrack it's not bad, but considering the title, more was expected. Forget, your Legions! Praetorians' strategic approach is not exactly new. I remember at least one other recent title, Celtic Kings, which had shifted the focus of the game on the careful control of armies minimizing the problem of resource collection to the simple domination of one or more villages. Praetorians takes this approach and perfects it, making numerous types of units available and above all forcing the player to exploit the skills and peculiarities of each one to complete the objectives of each campaign. First you will have to learn to use the basic troops: the auxiliary infantry has multiple functions, and often they are troops wasted in mere combat. In fact, it is up to them to build the garrisons of the conquered villages or watchtowers, repair bridges and other functional structures, assemble war machinery such as catapults, ballistae, breakthrough rams and siege ladders. And these kinds of drives can't work alone. That's right: finally you can experience the realism of a siege maneuver by assigning to a catapult the men necessary to load it, maneuver it and (urgh !) to push it to its destination  enough with the motorized catapults guided by microchips that we have seen since the Warcraft era! Clearly you will also have to escort similar vehicles given their poor defense possibilities and long loading times. And this is only the beginning; as you progress through the single player campaign, new units become available: archers, spearmen, legionnaires, knights, all organized into compact troops ready to move at your command; each troop has its own peculiarities: the legionnaires are slow ma well armored, and can form the famous tortoise, spearmen can attack from a distance but become weak in close combat, archers can position themselves on the ground to extend their range and launch flaming arrows. Then there are the special units, similar, if you like, to the Heroes of Warcraft III, but don't be scared, everything in this game is very realistic and therefore there won't be any imaginative magical attacks or bizarre things like that. The doctor can treat wounds and poisonings, the centurion rides proudly into battle raising the mood of the troops or presides over the villages by recruiting new soldiers, the explorers can launch wolves or falcons to probe the surrounding area. Handling the special units will also require tactical acumen, as they are alone and vulnerable to mass attack, but they are also very valuable. It goes without saying that a similar volume of soldiers requires the development of appropriate attack and defense strategies; combining the resources of each unit type proves more essential than ever to win the battle. Also because the enemy, this time, is not as imbecile as you think Not all barbarians are stupid Praetorians also surprises with the high degree of reactivity and tactical ability of artificial intelligence. Don't be surprised if an outnumbered assault to your advantage turns into carnage: the A.I. he knows his stuff, and he won't be slow to prove it. Each action will have to be properly calculated to avoid huge losses, given that the villages can provide a limited number of troops, and the enemy knows this well. Furthermore, he too will make good use of his ranks, putting you in difficulty at the first opportunity. Ambushes, surprise assaults, flanking maneuvers and sieges are just some of the tactics that both you and your opponents can adopt, exploiting the territory to your advantage and always remaining in suspense, since each move is only a small step and not never gives the certainty of victory. Sometimes a large force of legionaries can be decimated by a small group of archers stationed on a hill and hidden by trees, only to be finished off by ambush swordsmen. The conquest and siege maneuvers then offer enormous potential and must be planned in detail since towers and catapults are really powerful, but they must be defended properly. Prepare the stairs to let the troops go up (yes, good, like in The Two Towers, but with a little more realism), engage the archers on the towers with the catapults, coordinate the breaking through of the gate with the assault on the walls they are all phases of the battle that must be managed with Swiss precision, considering that the enemy has an advantage and will take very little to thin out the waves of attackers. It is therefore no longer a matter of brute force alone: here you have to use your head. At this point I could spend a few words on the main drawback of this game  did you think it didn't have any?  which certainly does not concern the gameplay but rather the technical profile: given the effort made in the creation of such a tactical power, the poor sound system left me dumbfounded, which consists of a handful of not very evocative BGMs and a dubbing of the units decidedly flat and monotonous. However in the boxes here somewhere you should find a more in-depth commentary by our good Vanethian, which illustrates the musical sins of Praetorians. All I have to do is praise the good graphic engine, detailed and complex, and the loading speed, even if there could have been more graphics and gameplay setting options, redefinable keys, etc. Even the pointing and control system is not always precise and perhaps a little difficult to master, but it is a minor defect that over time can be won without problems. A pearl of realism. Praetorians is different from the usual RTS. I must say that the little attention to resource management, and the focus instead on the battle and the choice of formations before the clash was a great idea. It's just a shame that once you prepare for battle, there's not much you can do to influence the outcome. We can only watch and hope to win. But that's not a flaw in the game. In fact, at that time there was no possibility like now to be able to quickly communicate tactical changes during a conflict. The outcome was already decided even before the battle. Mediterranean, crossroads of peoples Such amazing strategic refinement could not remain relegated to the single player campaign alone - however, pregetable because, in addition to being well articulated, it also includes a plot that unfolds as Caesar's troops make their way into the lands of the barbarians. In fact, Praetorians also supports the game via LAN or TCP/IP, allowing up to eight players to clash on special maps by taking control of three different peoples: in addition to the Romans, the Gallic barbarians and the very tanned Egyptians are also available, each with its own specifics units and peculiarities (camel warriors are really fun). Of course, it is also possible to introduce I.A. opponents and form teams, sharing the different skills of each. For those wishing to engage in multiple clashes without being connected to a network there is also the skirmish option, but believe me, the AI, however smart it is, cannot replace a healthy organic brain well trained in the stratagems of pitched battle... In conclusion: history teaches us that things change. Before we were used to voluminous strategic games with many colorful units, a not excessive realism and a not too stimulating level of challenge, unless you play with the maximum difficulty level, and in that case it is only a matter of greater resistance and aggressiveness of the enemy. Now the new standard, of which Praetorians definitely becomes the banner, imposes an A.I. refined, a realistic response of the units, a degree of difficulty calibrated even at low levels, in order to offer stimuli and encourage careful evaluation without however putting the player in front of unbeatable opponents: as if to say, it's just a matter of strategy, and sorry the turn of phrase but this time I would say that the sentence fits perfectly. Not free from moles, the audio sector in primis, the Pyro Studios title however stands as a worthy rival to other giants in the sector which, in my opinion, focus in many cases on the scenic impact rather than on the true core of a Real Time Strategy game, that is to involve and satisfy the player, giving him the feeling that what he planned and put into practice worked and was fundamental to completing the mission. And this Praetorians fully realizes it, so much so that I feel like recommending it to everyone, fans, lovers and occasional strategists with a still uncertain mouse; you won't be disappointed with everything the game has to offer. In conclusion: history teaches us Pros Pure strategy: challenging and realistic the AI finally deserves the name The graphics do justice to the realism of the gameplay Cons The audio is not up to par with other aspects of the game The graphics engine could have been more flexible The Romans are back! Oh !! I don't hide a slight grimace of skepticism as I am about to install Praetorians, wondering if I won't have to review yet another Age of Empires clone with some variation on the theme. In fact, if you think about it, a historical strategy set in ancient Rome is not exactly a pearl of originality in terms of game concept - so I muttered to myself while the completion bar lazily progressed on the monitor. Finished installation, loading without too many salaams or introductory sequences and here I am immediately on the battlefields. The scenario is Northern Europe during the conquest campaigns against the local tribes (Aedui and similar), therefore definitely a deja vu, but from the first clicks of the mouse a certain difference was immediately revealed compared to what I expected find. The field atmosphere that permeates the game allows you to settle in perfectly in a very short time; the units march at a decisive pace towards the objectives and - intriguingly - it is necessary to carry out an in-depth campaign / tutorial to master all the tactical possibilities offered, which suggests that there is a lot of irons in the fire from this point of view.", "date": "2003-03-01", "grade": null}
