Also because there have been so many remakes and remasters in recent years, some successful, some less so. Assassin's Creed III Remastered, we say it immediately at the beginning of the review, fortunately belongs to the first category of products: the game, set during the American war of independence, in fact presents itself to the public with improved graphics, some small novelties on the gameplay front and all original DLC. In detail we talk about the additional packages Missions Benedict Arnold, Hidden Secrets and The Tyranny of King Washington, with the episodes Infamy, Betrayal and Redemption. Last but not least, the full game Assassin's Creed III: Liberation is included, for a truly substantial offer in terms of content for owners of PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. The American Revolution After playing it for many hours, even after the 1.01 update, we can say that Assassin's Creed III remains a good title after many years, able to offer an adequate number of hours of gameplay especially in light of its being mainly single player. The story flows smoothly in its ups and downs, with a cinematic plot in which adventure, historical reconstruction and fantastic events balance each other quite well, leaving little room for rhetoric; the gameplay is old-fashioned, with a certain degree of freedom in dealing with game situations and with the addition of small additions that have served to make the stealth sessions more ~complete~, as well as to improve the crafting system and the graphic interface. Furthermore, technically, thanks to a good ~adaptation~ job, it looks quite good, although it is never stunning. The result is a title not free from defects, some of which are obviously historical, but still beautiful to see and play, as written before. Closed the events of Altair and Ezio Auditore, the game ~moves~ the war between Templars and Assassins, the search for a solution to save the world and that of the last artifacts, in the New World. The game, in fact, is set during the period of the American War of Independence: the protagonist, as our readers will remember, is Connor, a native American half-breed whose story is linked to that of Desmond Miles, whose sections located in the present day act as glue for a story that unfolds along a dozen sequences set between Boston, New York, the border and some excursions to the Caribbean. The game structure of Assassin's Creed III Remastered is inevitably the most traditional of the series, with the exploration phases characterized by the presence of many activities to be carried out, even optional. Among these, hunting and secondary missions stand out, useful for deepening the plot or for collecting money, experience and objects to enhance the character, his estate or the Eagle, the ship available at a certain point in the game. It is also possible to participate in a series of challenges related to exploration, go in search of treasures, such as that of Captain Kidd, with missions that are partly reminiscent of those of the Tombs of Nero in the second chapter, or recruit assassin adepts to send to around America for the purpose of gaining skills and bringing back money and items. In short, the single player experience of Assassin's Creed III is quite full-bodied and multifaceted, with the addition of a series of maritime missions useful for increasing the variety of the action and providing more choice. Playstation 4 trophies Assassin's Creed III Remastered offers players 55 Trophies to unlock, distributed throughout the adventure. They are divided into 46 bronze, 7 silver, 1 gold and 1 platinum and are obtained by completing particular moments in the story or by achieving some objective. The new Assassin's Creed III Even the approach to fighting remains clearly anchored to what was seen in the chapters of the past generation of consoles: to eliminate his opponents, Connor can use different types of long and medium-range white or firearms. These can be recovered around the game world, bought in shops or created through an interesting crafting system. And it is precisely here that one of the novelties of this edition is found, namely the possibility of building more weapons than the original, even some of those previously available only for a fee. To do this, however, you need to have the relevant project, to be found by exploring villages,forests and rivers then, as always, the correct material and, finally, a craftsman capable of building them. The latter, in fact, must have an adequate level of experience to be able to set to work. All the weapons, combined with the protagonist's special abilities, also to be acquired and improved during the adventure, make battles much simpler, thanks to an artificial intelligence of the enemies that is not always up to par. For the same reason, the stealth phases rarely offer a high challenge rate, given that the level of attention and alarm of the guards is limited, and they certainly do not shine for their acumen. But these are still ~features~ that fans of the Ubisoft saga now know by heart and on which they have often overlooked. In any case, it is precisely during the sessions in which we act in the shadows that we can notice the other changes we mentioned at the beginning. Ubisoft has in fact introduced a handful of features not present in the original into the game, such as the possibility of hiding in the bushes, whistling to get the attention of some guards and being able to perform stealth kills from behind by default with the hidden blade. Other new functions are to be found in the graphical interface, in particular in the mini-map at the bottom left of the screen: inside it, in addition to the position of enemies and objectives, in the stealth phases the direction in which the guards are facing is now indicated , while in case of conflict, the possible paths and hiding places useful for escaping and evading pursuers are highlighted. In this sense, the sensation of running freely by hopping over obstacles remains one of the strong points of Assassin's Creed III, with a marked spectacularization of the parkour elements, and the various dynamic actions that can be performed without excessive frills, except when you bump into something due to some uncontrolled movement of the protagonist or a camera that is not always positioned in the best way. Aveline's Adventure This edition, as we wrote in the article, includes Assassin's Creed III: Liberation in a remastered version. This title has also been upscaled to 4K on the new generation consoles and PC, while on the ~smooth~ ones it runs at 1080p, with improved lighting, environments and graphic effects even compared to the old computer remaster. The result is a respectable conversion, which visually does not reach the qualitative level of the remake of the third episode, especially at the polygonal level, but still makes itself respected, considering the starting point, i.e. a game originally released for PlayStation Vita. A better glance As regards the technical part, the definition and some graphic aspects have been optimized according to the potential of the new hardware. In addition to a higher resolution (with support for 4K and HDR on PS4 Pro, Xbox One X and PC) which is 1080p on the base PlayStation 4, we have for example an improvement in the rendering of lights and the environment. The first now relies on the PBR system for a visual rendering of the light sources based on physics, while with the second the scenarios are more ~full~ thanks to the presence of a greater density of crowds in the cities, and a greater number of natural elements that invigorate vegetation and fauna in outdoor areas. The combination of atmospheric and particle effects then do the rest, making the environments much more beautiful, which in themselves could already enjoy an excellent visual representation and a spot-on level design in the original. In short, for Assassin's Creed III Ubisoft didn't do magic, but it didn't even stop at the ~homework~ typical of certain conversions, really trying to make the game more beautiful, as demonstrated by the presence of more complex textures and new models polygonal for the main characters. The latter are appreciated for the quality of the faces, even if some seem a little too fake, and for the detail reserved for the clothes they wear, on which the weaves of the fabric that compose them or other decorative frills stand out. The combination of all these factors effectively returns a graphics that does not make one cry out for a miracle, but which, due to the measures adopted and the general stability guaranteed, by eye, by its thirty frames per second, is also appreciated today. Above all in certain eventful phases, during the battles, at the change of seasons and in the panoramas, when from the snow-capped peaks of the mountains or on board the ship you can admire breathtaking sunsets or sunrises. Moving on to the audio sector, the music is excellent, which adequately accompanies each singlephase of the game, from the calmer ones to the more action ones, and all in all the dubbing in Italian is good, well acted for large stretches of the adventure depending on the moment or the mood of the characters. On the other hand, the sound effects, from gunshots to environmental ones, are average, but which are functional for the purpose.", "date": "2019-03-28", "grade": "8.0"}
