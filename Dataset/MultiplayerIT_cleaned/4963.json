If we already said it at the time of the review of The Cave and we repeat it again today it is because the ~Grumpy Gamer~ (name he gave to his blog) is really one of the reference people who hide behind some of the greatest masterpieces which between the 80s and 90s contributed to the success of graphic adventures. A genre that has now been in decline for a while, after which Gilbert himself has managed to find the outlets of the past for his humor and creativity only sporadically, making himself noticed in recent years in projects such as DeathSpank and the aforementioned The Cave. More than good games, but different from Gilbert's historical genre and far from that spark of immortality that titles like Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island and many others were able to trigger in the hearts of gamers of their era. A love that has never faded, as demonstrated by the millions that Tim Schafer has raised with Broken Age, relying on Kickstarter to succeed in publishing a graphic adventure after so long. Ron Gilbert did the same some time ago, raising over 600,000 dollars with the promise of taking us all to Thimbleweed Park, in an old-style graphic adventure with no discounts. Finally today we can find out if he really succeeded. Thimbleweed Park takes us back twenty-odd years, to the golden age of graphic adventures Murders and pillows The story of Thimbleweed Park starts from a murder on the outskirts of the city, which Angela Rey and Antonio Reyes begin to investigate, a couple of FBI agents who look like they came straight from the X-Files. She expert and cynical, he young and ambitious, to compose a duo that to shed light on the criminal event will inevitably have to do with the eccentric local population: we will not be at the levels of memorability reached with Stan, Herman Toothrot other characters from the past, but dealing with the local ~sheriff-a-rino~ and his multiple identities won't go unnoticed. Similarly, on more than one occasion a joke will come to make you smile. But let's get back to the plot: we are in 1987 and Thimbleweed Park is a small town, typical of the American hinterland, where most of the eighty inhabitants grew up in adoration of old Chuck, owner of a pillow factory with a glorious past who disappeared of natural causes from few days. Delores, his niece, is a video game programmer who has returned to town to mourn, forced against her will to deal with the rest of the heirs to divide Chuck's fortune. All while his father Franklin, Chuck's brother with whom he came into conflict due to their intentions to transform the factory, has disappeared from sight. Meanwhile, scurrilous clown Ransome is forced to contend with a curse that won't allow him to wash off his clown makeup, instigated after he insulted an old hag at a performance at the local circus. From the initial murder to Ransome's crime, the various parts of the plot seem unrelated to each other at first, but it won't take Rey and Reyes long to understand that the plot touches all the characters of Thimbleweed Park. It is no coincidence that the story is also told through some of the protagonists we mentioned above, showing us, for example, the moment in which Delores gets her job as a developer by disappointing her uncle who would have liked to see her at the head of the pillows, or the one in which Ransome is cursed by the old woman with whom we will then have the opportunity to return to deal with in the course of history. The last of the controllable characters is missing from our list, on which we will not say anything because we believe that his identity is one of the surprises that can be found within Thimbleweed Park. For the rest, we leave you the pleasure of discovering everything that is hidden from the eyes of the two agents, leaving you glued to your chair and eager to move forward. All together passionately In terms of gameplay, the presence of five playable characters is not left to the player's choice, but follows the flow of the story told by the game. For example, in the prologue we will find ourselves checking the poor murdered man, to then pass the ball to the pair of FBI agents. In general, the player can decide to switch from one to the other using the icons with that are located in the upper right corner of the screen, except in particular moments in which it becomes impossible to do so. In the flashbacks dedicated to the various characters, for example, we will only be able to control the direct interestto, to then move on vice versa to the game phase in which you even get to have the option of selecting any of the five protagonists, leveraging their skills and the interaction between them to solve the puzzles. The fear that we had previously expressed about the management of so many characters turns out to be only partially founded, that is, leading us only in rare cases to find ourselves displaced with five different inventories to consider in order to be able to move forward in the game. A sign of a good level of care in terms of design, at the center of which Ron Gilbert has always declared that he wanted to put puzzles and their solution as it happened in the graphic adventures of the past. Compared to the latter, Thimbleweed Park offers more linear puzzles overall, but at a more difficult level it still does not disdain to offer some challenges capable of keeping the player less reflective and/or willing to immerse themselves in humor busy for half an hour too long which forms the backdrop to the adventure. Even if the intention is to address mainly long-time players, Ron Gilbert and his business partner Gary Winnick (with whom he signed Maniac Mansion) have nevertheless decided to dedicate a simpler mode to players not accustomed to the old graphic adventures, or simply less patient towards an obstacle that can block to the bitter end. Although in the old days the suggestion to move forward could only come from a friend or from the solution in a magazine, the design duo decided to integrate a help system into Thimbleweed Park, but inserting it perfectly in the context of the game. For example, it could happen that a character ruminates on something he has to do, or that by talking to someone, an indication of the missing puzzle piece arrives. In times like the ones we live in, where the entire adventure played by others will be available on YouTube in a few hours, the idea manages to fit perfectly into the game, thus allowing it to be softer but at the same time trying to keep the player in the own atmosphere before turning elsewhere to pass a certain point. Look at the rubber chicken Even if graphic adventures have met their sad sunset, this does not mean that they have not had the opportunity to evolve. One of the steps taken in this direction concerns the elimination of the interface with verbs, widespread until the early 90s and then subsequently abandoned to make room for an increasingly intuitive mouse pointer with respect to the actions to be performed. Considering that Ron Gilbert has never made a secret of his love for the interface with verbs, his return to Thimbleweed Park did not surprise us from the first moment. Indeed, we must say that the choice to return to the interface of Monkey Island and other masterpieces has allowed us more than anything else to go back to breathing the air of the past, with the impression at times of taking a leap back into twenty years and more to go back to our room in the company of the inseparable Amiga. The pixel art graphics were naturally conceived to contribute in the same direction, but it must be said that by now they are also on the agenda in other titles and for this reason they have lost part of the nostalgic effect obtained when we started again make use of it. Gary Winnick took care of the characters directly, while Mark Ferrari, an artist already working on Loom and on the first Monkey Island, was called into question for the backdrops: the overall result is quite good, even if at times as already observed in the past the two components appear a little too detached from each other. We conclude with the audio sector, characterized by an excellent dubbing which, however, stops only in English: however, Italian is present immediately as the language for subtitles, thanks to the additional objectives achieved by the Kickstarter campaign. The soundtrack is also well made, with some tunes that after a while will enter your head thanks to the work of Steve Kirk, already heard in the videogame field with Voodoo Vince on Xbox and Star Wars: The Old Republic.", "date": "2017-03-30", "grade": "9.0"}
