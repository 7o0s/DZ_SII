{"name": "WWE 2K23", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-2k23-recensione.html", "text": "It is difficult to explain how underrated the discipline of wrestling is in Italy. Once again, in fact, we have missed the opportunity to bring a show, indeed forgive us, in this case a sport-show, to our country and give job opportunities to people. It is certainly not the fault of Posa and Franchini, pioneers of Wrestling in Italy thanks to Sky, but of a message that has passed over the years, or that it is a discipline to make fun of with goliardic names and effortless verses to accompany everything , perhaps even flexing the biceps. Let's therefore start from the assumption that in recent years you have never seen one of the intertwined stories overseas, that you do not know what the Fiend was, who Bray Wyatt is and why his way of performing has attracted attention even film critics. We're again assuming you're unaware that The Bloodline is clearly inspired by cinema's greatest underworld-based films, and we're assuming that the last you heard of Edge, it was probably video game magazine. Starting from here, you will discover that Wrestling is so much more and that 2K has certainly done a great job to give dignity to video games based on this discipline as well. We are therefore ready to tell you our impressions on the return of wrestling in style in the WWE 2K23 review. Barrel and camera WWE 2K23: Stone Cold in action Let's start by telling you that if you played or saw WWE 2K22 last year, the new chapter follows in all respects what we saw 12 months ago. The gameplay is the same: powerful and impactful. The right mix between ~fighting~ (the combo system remains unchanged) and legacy of the past, with interactions that still slide on invisible walls. The latter effect, while annoyingly still present, has indeed been greatly reduced. The great innovation, in fact, is to be found in the animation sector, now wider than ever. Not only moves and stunts, but real contextual animations that occur between characters, but also between characters and the surrounding environment. The most striking example is the use of ropes and corners to catch your breath, lean on them or use them as a handhold on which to get up. We are therefore not faced with a revolution but with various improvements that expand the excellent foundations laid last year. We are satisfied with what we have seen and we believe that the simulation proposal of the discipline has reached a very good level. The management of stamina is interesting, which forces you to alternate between aggressive attacks and strategic slowdowns. This handling is the key to looking for a wrestling simulation that follows a fight flow very close to the real life counterpart. What is certainly striking is the spectacularity of certain moves and actions. To make everything pleasant even the use of the camera. What WWE 2K23 proposed with the shot is in fact very similar to what WWE Smackdown Here comes the Pain did in 2003, still the best wrestling game ever created. In fact, during some moments, the direction of the action is modified favoring more ~cinematographic~ shots, while leaving the players in control of the fight. The emphasis that is created on those actions replicates what can be seen in television shows, creating an appreciable resemblance between the virtual and the real. The modes of WWE 2K23 WWE 2K23: war games The real strength of the Visual Concepts production is certainly the mode park: MyGM, MyRise, MyFaction, Showcase and Universe. The player is truly spoiled for choice, as he will be able to take on the role of different roles within the hierarchical pyramid of the WWE. From Superstar, to GM, owner to event booker, there truly is something for everyone. The backbone of all the modes is the same as always, even if in each of them it is possible to find a whole series of minor innovations that deserve mentions. MyRise now has two separate stories that tell two very different scenarios of the wrestling narrative. On the one hand we have The Legacy, the story of a boy born into a family of wrestlers: the classic heir, the Cody Rhodes of the situation, who bears the burden of a demanding surname. The story called The Lock instead tells the tortuous path of a predestined, who must make his way between independent companies and acclaimed comebacks. Both of these stories are satisfying, full-bodied and full of twists. This year's MyRise is definitely the best ~career~ mode proposal in recent years. As far as MyGM is concerned, the novelties all lie in the managerial possibilities. Visual Concepts has expanded the title park, extended the playable seasons pribut in the end a whole series of unexpected events (shake ups) are inserted which make the replayability of this mode truly stratified. WWE 2K23: This is how Bobby Lashley was played Similar speeches for Showcase and Universe, since both modes are very similar to the past. Universe increases both the cinematic edge and the possibilities for creating immersive stories thanks to the Momentum. It is a system that allows superstars to experience moments of momentum, thanks above all to spectacular or painful victories, capable of influencing the events of a rivalry or a career. The Showcase mode, on the other hand, is rather similar to what was done with Rey Mysterio last year, but in WWE 2K23 the protagonist is John Cena. Although we liked the idea of having this superstar as the protagonist, we would like to say that this mode now feels the weight of a somewhat abused formula that serves to justify the presence of a cover wrestler every year. We close with the MyFaction. In our opinion, the weakest mode of the package certainly has more difficulty emerging among the others. The scarcity of the WWE 2K23 roster does not suit the FUT style of the MyFaction, more names would be needed and consequently more cards available. A starry outline WWE 2K23: Bianca vs. Rhea Technique and graphics therefore do not betray, the methods shine, despite everything, and the gameplay is consolidated. Where then can the game still improve? In our view on the roster. It's a shame that you don't get to have all of wrestling's most iconic wrestlers; net of licenses and those who are no longer part of the federation, we would have liked to see many somewhat forgotten legends again. On the other hand, both the sound and musical sector and the creations section should be underlined. The possibilities offered to the player regarding the creation of characters is immense and truly appreciable. The beauty of all this then lies in the possibility of sharing one's creations (athletes, arenas, logos, etc.) with the community, often going to make truly surprising immortals, memes or fates. This aspect is then the great lifesaver of the roster discourse made little 'On the contrary. The community, in fact, manages to hide the gaps which, in our opinion, concern the game's fighter park in terms of number. Net of some small uncertainties, the workmanship of the models is certainly also worth underlining, which is truly incredible. Even the type of match has been expanded with the arrival of the War Games, a stipulation that has become very popular in recent years but which on balance is a variant of something well known.", "date": "2023-03-22", "grade": "8.0"}
