The bandage she wears is not used to cure the traditional ~lazy eye~, but to hide from others a bionic graft that allows her to hit targets located at a great distance with absolute precision, by pulling the strings of a violin which is actually a powerful rifle sniper. This is the incipit of the ~playful part~ of Short Peace: Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day, directed by Goichi Suda and created by Crispy's, the team behind the entertaining Tokyo Jungle. Between one long animated sequence and another, the game projects us into a sort of horizontal scrolling endless runner in which we control Ranko and we have the task of proceeding as quickly as possible towards the right side of the screen, until we reach the shift exit. A frenetic but not automatic race, full of obstacles to overcome by activating the jump (and holding it down to ~float~ for a few moments), producing spectacular slides to pass barriers in the closing phase and, above all, using the aforementioned violin as a weapon to wipe out the many enemies that run towards us. Short Peace: Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day combines four great anime and one bad game There is no hope After a few minutes of excellent animation, the first impact with the game is rather traumatic. We are in fact talking about a decidedly simple action platform from a structural point of view and characterized by modest graphics, with the polygonal model of the protagonist being very small and an inconsistent design for the many enemies that appear from the right side of the screen to slow down the run . Added to this are some problems with the rendering of the graphics during the fastest phases, in this case a sort of rather evident tearing which makes the action even more confusing. Speed in Short Peace: Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day is everything, so the various acceleration ramps that are around can help us reach the finish line faster, especially since chasing us from time to time is a ~ presence~ different, whose touch is lethal. The only way to escape the game over when the pursuer is a few steps away is to open fire with the rifle by pressing the left back button. This maneuver gives us a few seconds of respite, but its success depends on a bar located in the lower part of the screen, which is filled by eliminating enemies but which is made up of only three shots. In short, if we find ourselves without ammunition and our pursuers catch up with us, there is nothing to do and the stage must be restarted. Which, considering some of the dynamics that regulate the gameplay, as well as an often not perfectly responsive control system, often becomes very, very frustrating. However, it is a rage that will last a couple of hours at most, considering a few extra attempts for the more difficult levels, given that the ten missions are basically completed in a few minutes each and we are therefore talking about a game with a very short overall duration. Playstation 3 trophies There are only fourteen Trophies contained in Short Peace: Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day. To obtain them you have to complete the levels and boss fights without missing a beat, reach the maximum possible speed for a certain period of time, perform the longest jump and eliminate only a few types of opponents. Finally, there are also Trophies upon reaching the final sequence, as per tradition. The do-it-yourself boss In addition to the narrative component, which however soon takes an absurd turn in perfect Japanese style, pulping assumptions that are perhaps not original but at least worthy of being developed in a sensible way, to give a minimum of dignity to the Short Peace experience: Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day there are on the one hand the boss fights, on the other the four animated short films on the blu-ray, peculiarities of which you have certainly heard of. Let's start with the bosses, because their implementation is quite interesting and constitutes a variation on the theme that is different every time, although even here there is ample room for frustration and curses (in fact, a small calendar bundled with the game would have been appreciable). In fact, it starts with two killers to fight in an environment that develops vertically, here too with the urgency of not making a mistake in a single movement, on pain of shredding in the machinery that proceeds from below; and continues with a shoot'em up section in which we face a huge dragon, trying to memorize its maneuversand attack and to target its weak points. However, the last battle is by far the most successful, a fun tribute to some classics of the 8-bit era of which, however, we do not want to anticipate anything, given what has already been revealed so far. The animated shorts boast extraordinary quality, even one of them received an Oscar nomination. We are talking about ~Possessions~, directed by Shuhei Morita, but ~Combustible~ (directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, an author who really needs no introduction), ~Gambo~ (directed by Hiroaki ando) and ~A Farewell to Weapons~ (directed by Hajime Katoki). Stories sometimes very different from each other, but united by a similar philosophy, which often delves into the dream to let us experience the typical emotions of the best Japanese productions. To watch the anime, subtitled in Italian, you have to enter the PlayStation 3 video application, as if it were a Blu-ray, thus exiting the game.", "date": "2014-04-28", "grade": "5.0"}
