Form and substance On paper, Ozone appears to be anything but revolutionary: the game requires the user to guide a sphere through 50 different mazes, avoiding obstacles and enemies and collecting a certain number of yellow orbs in order to unlock the exit and move on to the next stage. However, it is in the execution of these simple mechanics that the Geardome title acquires all its appeal, revealing itself as one of the most interesting products currently available on the App Store. To begin with, the protagonist is a particle full of air, which is progressively emptied of its content with each movement imparted by the user via the virtual pad: this aspect alone would be enough to guarantee a discreet strategic depth, given that it is necessary to limit the waste by making the most of the trajectories and rebounds with the walls. The developers, however, have been really good at filling their product with a whole series of elements which, combined with an intelligent level design, contribute to making every single level compelling. First of all, the labyrinths are infested with traps to be carefully avoided (on pain of losing precious air) and enemies to be eliminated using the three weapons that one can come across on the way: it is a plasma cannon that shoots projectiles in a straight line, a lightning that automatically fries hostiles within its range and a bomb with very high destructive power. There is also no shortage of power-ups of various types useful for example to guarantee temporary invulnerability to the sphere, or to recharge its gas supplies, almost always juxtaposed in order to solve environmental puzzles of various types. The more complex stages also contemplate keys that open remote passages, an aspect that leaves room for never botched backtracking, but rather an integral part of careful puzzle dynamics. Tackling the labyrinths of the game is also a pleasure destined to be very long-lasting: global longevity is in fact guaranteed not only by the 50 levels made available, but also by the possibility - offered by the next update - of playing user creations, achievable with a free editor downloadable from the Geardome website. Impeccable in terms of gameplay Ozone takes full advantage of the potential of the iPhone also as regards the audiovisual sector, simple but at the same time of great impact. Without showing too much muscle, the graphics of the product boast a unique style and enviable cleanliness, showing off bright colors and pleasant plays of light, as usual maximized by the excellent performance of the Apple device screen. Even better is the sound, which rests on very pleasant chillout music (which can also be freely downloaded from the Geardome site) which blends perfectly with what happens on the screen and on dreamlike effects that effectively accompany all the movements of the sphere.
