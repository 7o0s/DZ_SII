{"name": "WWE Smackdown! Shut your mouth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-smackdown-shut-your-mouth.html", "text": "~Lay the smackdown.~ It's still him, ~The most electrifying man in all of sports entertainment today~ joined by Hollywood's ~HULKMANIA RULZ!~ Hogan to dominate this title, it could not be otherwise being two of the most loved and esteemed wrestlers among the public and not, real pillars and anchor-men of this show that shows no sign of diminishing in its success. The omen of a change of course is confirmed once we get to the menu, where THQ wanted to get serious; the myriad of different options and modes seems to confirm it: between exhibition, special matches, career mode, wrestler editor and submenus such as Royal Rumble, King Of The Ring, Hardcore Battle, and dozens of others, the variety is not lacking. But the real workhorses in this new version are, in addition to the implementation of multiplayer for up to SIX (yes, SIX) players, the Career Mode and the Edit Wrestler. The latter in particular is the best editor ever seen in a fighting game; the customization of your wrestler is nothing short of amazing, being able to choose from hundreds and hundreds of details that will make your wrestler unique. From eyebrows to eyes, through lips, hair, tattoos, decals, objects such as glasses, horns, masks, helmets; it will therefore be possible to modify any aspect, always taking into account an impressive and meticulous level of detail. Not only will you be able to create your own brand new wrestler ready to dominate all the superstars with his power, but it will also be very easy to recreate the real wrestlers not included in the game. Space for Rowdy Roddy Piper, Ultimate Warrior, Randy ~Machoman~ Savage and other great heroes then!. It's not over, a true superstar is not only such in the ring, but also outside; you can choose entrance cinematic, music, animation, taunt, voice, shouts and audience placards at your entrance. Instead, using the introductory sequence editor you can create real animations to associate with your character, in an easy and intuitive way similar to the block method with which music was composed in MUSIC 2000 on psx. The career mode has also been renewed, where you will play the role (or tights, it should be said) of a superstar (even created by you) for an entire competitive season; we will start with SMACKDOWN! vs RAW, passing through Armageddon, Survivor, Heat and dozens of other events that will culminate in the absolute victory of your alter-ego of the world title. The first person view that will accompany you while moving between the various locations (VIP Room, car park, arena, the various stadiums and many others) will immerse you totally in the action which, despite being ~guided~ in the events, will leave you ample margin of decision, thanks to the possibility of accepting challenges, meddling in other people's fights, provoking another fighter, creating real factions of allies and opponents. A mode that reserves many surprises even by replaying it several times, and the possibility of unlocking an exorbitant number of extras (including arenas, sets of moves, elements for your fighter and much more) is a valid incentive. ~Know your role..and shut your mouth!~ The surprises certainly don't end there; the technical sector has also received particular attention, finally managing to create the right combination of presentation and substance. Graphically WWSSYM offers a solid engine, improved by those bugs that afflicted the previous chapter; most of the models are of astonishing realism, both in terms of graphics and animation. Not all of course, but the most famous wrestlers can boast of a practically perfect alter-ego. The sound fully recreates the show emphasis during the match, and all the original music and speech are a great accompaniment. In any case, the real strength is represented by playability; simple, intuitive, but damn fun. A balanced mix of strategy and skill, where finally a frantic pressure on the buttons is no longer necessary to get the better of it, but the right timing in executing the moves and countermoves, knowing the skills and characteristics of one's character. The presence of Arenas and different rules for each type of match increase its variety, but above all its longevity. If we then consider the multiplayer, we are faced with another of those practically eternal games. ~1...2...3..PIN FALL!~ This new THQ title turns out to be a very pleasant surprise. While still presenting some manufacturing flaws, such as sometimes inaccurate collisions, some polygonal models are subdued when compared head-to-headivories like those of The Rock or Brock Lesnar, graphically mediocre audience and the usual hardware graphic defects such as jaggies and some sporadic glitches, none of these undermine the playability and fun. The game mechanics would still need some adjustments, but it is undeniable that we are facing the best American Wrestling title ever released so far. An excellent challenge, a well-calibrated difficulty, longevity ensured by the unlockable extras and the amazing editor are certainly the workhorses which are accompanied by a decidedly worthy sound and graphics presentation for a new generation console. If FIRE PRO WRESTLING D was practically perfection in the simulation field, WWESSYM is a perfect rendition of what American wrestling represents as a TV show, where you will finally be the protagonists. A game recommended with eyes closed to any lover of this sport-entertainment and a serious invitation to try it to anyone who wants to have fun, especially in the company of a friend. Pros: Perfect atmosphere Great challenge Magnificent editor and really functional career mode Cons: Some graphical glitches Those who don't appreciate the genre may find it a bit monotonous in the long run Above average loading times Usual WWE license, usual THQ exclusive, usual The Rock on the cover, so usual unplayable and short-lived wrestling title? Nothing more wrong! Yuke's finally churns out a title with counter flakes, ready to satisfy not only the most ardent fans but also the most demanding players, which is WWE not only in name, but finally also in fact. Warm up your muscles, bathe in sweat, take off your knee pads, put on masks and tights, bounce on the ropes, ready to offend you to the death...the gong has sounded...Just Bring It!", "date": "2003-01-14", "grade": null}
