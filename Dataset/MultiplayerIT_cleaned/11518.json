Often we find ourselves forced to use the lateral movements of the character to try to adjust the aim, and in some cases it is even possible to notice an unlikely difference between the use of one weapon and another, which drastically narrows the circle of weapons to use. With the exception of the very last game levels, where a massive dose of scripts gives the Germans a sketchy aggressiveness, the artificial intelligence stands at truly embarrassing levels, with enemies who for most of the time limit themselves to standing and shooting every much. Sometimes, even, it is possible to walk calmly towards a Nazi soldier without him showing a shred of reaction, and to kill him nonchalantly with a club once they get there. The theory is not enough The hand-to-hand combat techniques, not particularly usual in first person shooters, are quite useful because although New York is a very large and fascinating city, the game environments created by the Sparks are often rather narrow and claustrophobic, like small rooms, corridors or subway stations. Enemies can be grabbed and mallet, or used as human shields to get out of the most tangled situations. Even the interactivity with objects, signaled by a hand-shaped icon that appears above them, is imprecise and frustrating: in the case of small handles, buttons and so on, it is necessary to find the exact center of the object with crowds, or the interaction will not be possible. Ditto with potatoes the ~puzzles~, which boil down to the simple ~push the button to open the door~ or little else. The plot, based on the aforementioned interesting premise, is not developed properly and often leaves some holes that lead the player to boredom, as well as various contradictions. Graphics and sound Comment Turning Point: Fall of Liberty is a huge missed opportunity. A potentially fantastic plot is in fact rendered useless by a poor technical realization, which relegates the game to the infamous limbo of mediocrity and leaves one with a bitter taste in the mouth to see one of the rare original subject ideas thrown away on an extremely inflated theme like WWII. A title that undoubtedly deserved more investment of money and human resources from Codemasters. After having seen games like BioShock, Half-Life 2 Episode Two, Call of Duty 4 or Halo 3 in recent months, this Turning Point: Fall of Liberty seems just anachronistic, as if it was developed 5 years ago and then converted into haste and fury for current systems. Recommended only to true FPS enthusiasts who are sick if they don't play every single exponent of the genre that appears on the market, or to the maniacs of the 40s. Pros Original and charming basic idea Cons Clunky and imprecise controls Old and flat game mechanics Very below average technical realization Turning Point: Fall of Liberty is available for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The tested version is the PlayStation 3 version. Turning Point: Fall of Liberty starts from a rather original and fascinating pretext. How would history have gone if Winston Churchill, the famous British statesman who led the United Kingdom during the Second World War, had died in the famous car accident he suffered when he was visiting New York, and which in reality only caused him a serious injury to a leg? Codemasters tries to answer us with its alternative reality, putting in Churchill's place a politician so less able and less charismatic that he is unable to prevent in any way the expansion of the Nazis, who once conquered Europe think well of invading even the United States by bombing. The game puts us in the role of Dan Carson, a construction worker who, while he is at work on top of a New York skyscraper under construction, sees airships and Nazi bombers arriving on the horizon, which begin to raze the city to the ground. Carson will therefore have to join the resistance to push back the German enemies, naturally counting on our expert help.", "date": "2008-04-01", "grade": null}
