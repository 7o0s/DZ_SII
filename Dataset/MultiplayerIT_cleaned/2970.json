Because completing the 1:1 replica of the legendary RX-78-2 took precedence over everything else, because Gundam in Japan is this: practically a religion. Now that this religion has been spreading around the world for a few years, we've finally started to see some officially imported games, and the review of Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs. Maxiboost On talks about the latest addition to the PlayStation 4 catalog : a conversion of the homonymous arcade dated 2016 which is still very fun, but unfortunately also quite old-fashioned. If you are a true fan of the Mobile Suit created by Hajime Yatate and Yoshiyuki Tomino way back in 1979, however, you might want to read the next few lines of this review: the game, after all, is dedicated to you. Piloting a Gundam The control system of Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs. Maxiboost On is not exactly super intuitive and it will take a few hours of practice, and maybe watching a good tutorial on YouTube and the like, to become familiar with the movements and the paraphernalia of each mobile suit in the very rich roster that has over a hundred. The in-game tutorial is quite bland, in fact, and just describes most of the game mechanics verbatim without going into them too much. The various mechs are very different from each other both in terms of speed, resistance and firepower, and in terms of paraphernalia, which includes special attacks, abilities and reloading defensive tools. These differences are reflected in the value assigned to each mech, a value that is deducted from the team's total vital meter each time a mech is destroyed and which of course must be completely reset to win a match. It is a ploy that in theory would serve to balance the roster, but in practice it is clear as day that some mechs are clearly better than others in several respects, starting with the behavior of some special attacks that seem designed to hit more easily than others . Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs. Maxiboost On is a three-dimensional arena fighter in which the importance of movement in space plays a fundamental role: it is very important to learn how to cancel attacks and chain them together when necessary, but also to understand when to consume the Boost that allows you to accelerate, sprint and fly, among other things. In this sense, the arrangement of the keys - fortunately reconfigurable - immediately suggests the arcade nature of the game which, in fact, even recommends the use of an arcade stick, but if you use a simple DualShock 4 you have to be a little patient before being able to move and fight effectively. Once you have overcome the obstacle of the control system, having learned the rudiments of game dynamics, you begin to become familiar with the different mobile suits. Some are better suited for ranged combat, others for melee combat, still others are hybrids and guarantee a good result with both approaches. The so-called EX Burst serves precisely to compensate for these discrepancies, or to maximize the strengths of a certain mobile suit. Indeed, after selecting the mech, we will have to choose between three different EX Bursts: Fighting, Shooting and Extreme. Once the Overdrive indicator is at least half charged, in fact, we will be able to activate the selected Burst and gain a temporary boost to melee attacks, ranged attacks or movement capacity. The EX status also allows the use of a kind of ~super move~ that deals massive damage when it hits and is not interrupted by opponents. Choosing the right EX Burst, then, is the final step in understanding the combat system and the role each mech plays best in battle. Playstation 4 trophies Adding the platinum trophy, 5 gold, 7 silver and 23 bronze trophies gives a total of 36 trophies to earn. You will need to play a lot: you will have to win an increasing number of online challenges, complete the various single player modes and unlock every collectible. Alone or in company Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs. Maxiboost On is mainly an arcade title: the multiplayer mode is the heart of the Bandai title, both offline via split screen, but above all online on the competitive side between Ranked and non-ranked matches. In fact, the Online Battle mode allows you to face other players without commitment or by climbing a leaderboard, whether playing with a friend or in the company of complete strangers. Unfortunately, however, we struggled to find other players to fight with or against: the waiting times proved to be biblical, in the face of a netcode which, however, did not give us any problems when we finally managed to find someone in the our area. It is in fact possible to search for games in your area or all over the world, but in the second case you risk connection problems which can turn into bans in minutes since the game cannot distinguish a disconnection from an interruption from the infamous ~ragequit~. If you have at least one friend who shares your passion for Gundam and video games, however, the Branch Battle mode is the one for you: playable solo, in online co-op and in offline co-op, this mode is a sort of Arcade Mode where you fight a series of thematic matches. Each time you win, the squad leader gets to choose the next encounter on a grid, rating any difficulty based on the mechs selected at the start of the game. Between secret bosses and particularly insidious matches, the Branch Battle mode can become exhilarating. It goes without saying that playing in company is much more fun, especially if you communicate by voice: it's easier to coordinate attacks, choose targets strategically and plan your movements so as not to stumble into the so-called friendly fire. Lone wolves, on the other hand, might prefer the Maxi Boost Missions mode designed specifically for the PlayStation 4 version of Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs. Maxiboost On. In this mode, the player levels up as he wins matches and works his way up on various boards presided over by a challenging final boss. The level ups increase the number of slots which can be assigned different bonuses, called Data, which are obtained by winning certain matches and which allow a relative customization of the selected mobile suits. In addition to these pseudo RPG mechanics, the Maxi Boost Missions mode also rewards the player with GP, a currency to spend on the Customize page of the main menu to purchase new interfaces, illustrations, emblems and other collectibles. Since 2016 with fury There's no getting around it: Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs. Maxiboost On is a fairly dated title that doesn't exactly make a great impression on PlayStation 4 Pro and that Bandai hasn't even optimized very well, since it occasionally loses a few frames. It is still the conversion of a 2016 cabinet, but Bandai could have actually converted the sequel, released in arcades in 2018 with a renewed engine. Having said that, in the face of an impeccable sound sector - the OST includes the themes of the various anime, as well as a fairly faithful Japanese dubbing, but it is possible to customize it with your own music tracks - we are faced with an all in all discreet product, which it stands out in the mobile suits reproduced with great care: the cel shading with metallic textures are a combination that effectively replicates the style of the anime and at the same time recalls the Gunpla, the legendary models to be assembled by Bandai. It is clear that Bandai has focused mainly on polygonal models and in particular on the most famous mobile suits, skilfully reproducing their animations, details and characteristics. The scenarios, on the other hand, are more neglected: quite dull, however, there are about thirty of them and they guarantee an excellent variety of maps and situations.", "date": "2020-08-08", "grade": "7.0"}
