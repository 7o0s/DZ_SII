It happens that, without too much advertising, a small title is born, a game that could delight PlayStation 3 users for a long time. Developed by Tarsier Studios, but a direct evolution of that Rag Doll Kung, it was created in 2005 by Mark Healey, who later worked on the masterpiece Media Molecule, the title puts us in the shoes of highly jointed puppets, in frenetic fights between (precisely) Kung Fu moves, Street Fighter-style energy balls, collecting flying fish and lots of humor. All handled naturally and believably by the Havok physics engine. From China with fury Humor is the first peculiarity of the Tarsier title that catches the eye, a mystical orient  la Kung Fu Panda, forms the backdrop to the ascent towards the title of ~Plastic Fist~, in which our Master, a puppet version of that seen in Kill Bill, it introduces us to the thousand attacks that can be performed, dispensing maxims of wisdom alternating with tricks on how to cook shrimp and other fish delicacies. After creating our alter ego, with an editor that vaguely resembles that of LittleBigPlanet, it is in fact possible to choose hair, face, hands, feet, trousers, jacket and so on, you throw yourself headlong into the single player challenges, which act as both as a tutorial and as a main game mode as it is necessary to limit one's scores, which contribute to the world rankings, and as a privileged way to unlock all the extras that can be used in the editor. Initially it is a question of carrying out the attacks, special and otherwise, to become familiar with the control method and with the offensive tools, then instead the alternative game modes such as fish in a pan and king of the hill will also be revealed. From the outset, the game clarifies the control method, which exploits the peculiarities of the Sixaxis in an apt and fun way. Meanwhile, the attacks that can be performed with the square button and the triangle button can be performed in all directions using the right stick, in the same way the sticks or nunchucks are used using the same stick. The combos of normal attacks are the order of the day, and contrary to what it might seem at a first careless game, button mashing does not reward the player. At the base of the special moves is Chi energy, which can be used both as a defensive and offensive power. To increase the aforementioned energy bar, simply perform combos or throw the opponent into the air, using the R1 + square combo, and then hit him as many times as possible before he hits the ground. When a minimum of Chi is obtained, the Sixaxis becomes the protagonist: to restore some health, simply turn the pad over, the puppet will enter levitation mode, but in any case it can suffer enemy blows, while for real attacks we must be ready to sweat the proverbial seven shirts! To throw balls of energy it is necessary to shake the pad as many times as the Chi accumulated (we can also grab and relaunch the one thrown at us as in the Dodgeball), instead to produce a strong explosion of energy we must push the button assigned to the parry and move the pad up. The attack instead that will make us dislocate the arms is the so-called Firefly, through which it is possible to make a sort of fiery ~super shoulder~ in all directions. Knowing how to use this move perfectly is crucial given the thousand possibilities that the game offers us, in fact it is possible (depending on the Chi accumulated) to continue hitting the opponent in rapid succession, or throw him in the air and then beat him, or still throw him down and then give him the coup de grace. If against a single player everything is rather easy and reasoned, in four it becomes decidedly frenetic, a sarabanda of special shots, holds and counter-holds, in the best tradition of what we saw in Super Smash Bros. Everything works perfectly, the great leaps allow you to escaping at the right moment, perhaps to catch your breath thanks to meditation, and knowing how to use special moves becomes crucial, it is not enough to simply push the buttons at random, also because parrying works quite well, and as previously written, it is the basis of an important move special. Blows and fish in the face The impression is that the guys from Tarsier have been able to wisely expand what was proposed in the first Rag Doll Kung-Fu, and ultimately this Fists of Plastic is a good, immediate and fun title, also equipped with a good dose of technicality, this is a characteristic which greatly extends the longevity of the title past the sbornia of the first, very busy, hours of play. Although, to be honest, there is a lack of being able to customize the move park, creating your own combos and special attacks, given that the protagonist and enemies differ only in clothing and appearance. The Havok physics engine then worthily supports the evolutions of the puppets, just look at the grace with which the contenders swing on the platforms and then launch themselves, perhaps with a flaming Firefly, on the opponent, or how they collect the bouncing green fish to throw into the pan full of boiling oil, this mid-term challenge of the single player mode. Multiplayer is the natural outlet of the game mechanics, unfortunately for technical reasons related to the integration of physics in a ~non-problematic~ netcode, up to 4 players can challenge each other only locally. On the net it is only possible to see your own scores climb the world rankings. Among the various game modes, in addition to the already mentioned catch the fish, it is worth mentioning the King of the hill and the Dodgeball. The first rewards the player who stays on the highest platform for the longest time, performing figures and poses at the same time, while the second sees players throw an explosive blue bubble filled with Chi energy at each other. Like a game of yesteryear, four friends sitting comfortably on the sofa can give each other a good fight, in different types of game. Unfortunately this lack greatly castrates the longevity of the title, and in fact Rag Doll Kung-Fu: Fists of Plastic becomes the classic title to be played occasionally when friends are visiting, not being able to benefit from the possibilities offered by online use. It is clearly possible to play with bots acting as human opponents, but as fun as it is, it will always be less fun than dodging a ball of energy on the screen and at the same time a Firefly that swipes a friend's pad a few centimeters from your nose. If we add to this a single player mode which, having finished the challenges in a short time, rests only on the run-up to the top of the world rankings, a not particularly rosy picture emerges, a satisfying but short-lived experience. From a graphic point of view the game is certainly well done, the physics combined with an ~Oriental~ graphic style, even if declined in a strongly parodic way, is appreciated without conditions, with excellent animations and a good level design, even if the general impact is far from the imagination and visionary originality of LittleBigPlanet. Comment Rag Doll Kung-Fu: Fists of Plastic is the classic title to play, after perhaps long sessions with the big single player calibers released in this last period, as a tiring interlude, but only mentally though, given that the appropriate use of the Sixaxis will make us sweat the proverbial seven shirts. Fun and immediate, in a wise balance between technicality and button mashing, the Tarsier title however stops at the best moment, given that more could have been done in terms of the diversification of attacks, but above all the absence of online multiplayer castrates the title , halving its longevity and entrusting multiplayer games, the true heart of the game, only to local use, which obviously is not always possible. Pros Fun and immediate Perfect use of the Sixaxis Impeccable physics realization Against Few single player challenges Same moves and attacks for everyone Local multiplayer only", "date": "2009-04-14", "grade": null}
