{"name": "Beyond Good & Evil", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beyond-good-evil_b.html", "text": "Reporter profession Jade is twenty years old, she is a beautiful emerald-eyed freelance photographer, and lives in Hillys, a town made up of a small archipelago. The splendid landscape and the relaxing quiet of the island where Jade lives are only the temporary mask of a civilization at war with the mysterious alien DomZ; and it is precisely the children of the victims caused by the DomZ attacks that Jade takes care of, managing a small orphanage together with her adoptive uncle Pey'j, a semi-human with a porcine appearance (in the literal sense) who raised our protagonist from an early age , since his parents mysteriously disappeared without a trace. In this climate of fear, the Alfa Squads seem to be a fixed point, a group of chosen soldiers who constitute the main resistance to alien attacks, sponsored by newspapers, television news, the government, who have the task of fighting aliens and helping citizens in danger . But all is not what it seems. Jade soon runs into the IRIS, a sort of rebel association that supports the most disturbing of hypotheses: the DomZ, capable of possessing the bodies of their victims, may have infiltrated the main government nuclei, conveying public information and exploiting it for their purposes, with the Alfa Team which at this point take on the faded outlines of a mere window dressing. Obviously Jade begins to collaborate with IRIS, chasing the Truth with her trusty camera, her intuition and her courage, but she will soon discover that the threat extends deeper than you might think... This is broadly the incipit of Beyond Good & Evil: the storyline is simpler than it may appear from the beginning to the X-Files, but does not spare the player of a considerable number of truly exciting twists, managing to involve him with an intriguing and well-orchestrated script and wonderfully characterized characters, who stand out for their funny and at the same time realistic personalities, as in the case of the deliberately very stereotyped Double-H or the humanity inherent in the anything but human Pey'j; the most interesting aspect of the plot is however its intrinsic meaning, which leads the more attentive user to reflect on the very meaning of information and on its power which in a society like ours is the true instrument of domination and, unfortunately, it is not always in the hands of the right people to control it. The Legend of Jade As already mentioned, Beyond Good & Evil draws heavily on the Zelda saga, and in a sense it could be considered the PlayStation 2's The Wind Waker. Basically, Beyond Good & Evil is played the same way: normally the user controls Jade in a third-person view, allowing her to perform various actions such as walking, running, leaping forward or interacting with the elements with which it is possible to do so; during the fights, however, the controls vary slightly so that with a key it is possible to attack enemies, with another to dodge and so on. The lock-on system designed for clashes which, on balance ... does not exist is interesting: Jade intelligently directs her blows at the enemies with the highest priority of being beaten, and just direct her with the stick towards one of they because she turns her dai-jo (a sort of stick) against the opponent on duty, hitting him with a series of attacks whose intensity and length varies according to the timing with which the corresponding key is pressed, so that a quick press initiates a simple three-hit combo while a slower, rhythmic series of inputs generates a slew of spectacular acrobatic attacks. Furthermore, usually by pressing another key Jade can launch a sort of charged attack as deadly as it is spectacular or ~order~ a possible battle companion to perform a particular action, allowing her to exploit it properly: the propulsion boots of Pey'j, for example, stuns enemies just enough to prevent them from attacking by planting a good beating on their snouts. In addition to the fights, Beyond Good & Evil presents the traditional features of the case: dungeons intricate enough to arouse continuous interest in the player, full of puzzles and vaguely platform-like sections (where the jump is performed automatically by Jade near a chasm, it is necessary of a certain skill to direct it to the right platforms), where backtracking is present but never annoying and during which, in the vast majority of cases, it is necessary to adequately exploit the items and tools that are recovered along the way or the skills of any companions of adventure (one more eexample provided by Pey'j who, as a good mechanic, is able to disassemble obstacles with his wrench). Of course, the classic bosses are inevitable where relying solely on dai-jo is equivalent to suicide: in most cases you will have to rely on particular skills of Jade or her companions, to be combined with a healthy dose of brute force in intelligent way, giving these epochal clashes a particularly strategic flavour. Obviously Beyond Good & Evil is not made up of only dungeons to be tackled in sequence: Ubisoft has left a lot of room for exploration, providing the player from the outset with the possibility of moving around the Hillys archipelago with Jade's hovercraft which, armed of a pulse machine gun, offers amusing shooter-like sequences where in addition to hitting the enemy without giving him a break, it will be necessary to avoid hitting passers-by and innocent vehicles, damaging them the police will consistently reduce the credits in our heroine's wallet. Once off the hovercraft in the city of Hillys or in any other explorable place, there is an air of freedom when you have the opportunity to explore the area, run errands by purchasing accessories for the hovercraft or healing items, accepting to carry out tasks that go beyond the quest main for the pure purpose of earning some credit and even participate in mini-games of various kinds, including speed races between hovercrafts, challenges to bizarre variations of billiards and hunts for wanted people. Such a powerful cauldron of videogame genres, even seasoned with real stealth sections that mimic The Wind Waker as Link's latest adventure did to Solid Snake and Hideo Kojima, always presents a flaw, an uncertainty that undermines the entire, delicate playful balance of the concept but, incredible to say, Beyond Good & Evil has no uncertainties and flaws at all: everything works wonderfully, in a playful harmony rarely found in recent years, which skilfully mixes a great variety of possibility without flinching. Beyond anything you have seen so far I would say to start from the only technical flaw of the game, a frame-rate that sometimes drops significantly showing some slowdown in the most chaotic situations. Stop. The rest is amazing and ruthlessly throws Beyond Good & Evil into the Olympus of the most beautiful games seen on new generation consoles. The design, to begin with, has a vaguely Disney-like impact: the world of Beyond Good & Evil vaguely resembles that of Disney's Treasure Planet or Titan A.E. of Dreamworks, an explosive mix of sci-fi settings and everyday elements, enriched by a truly obsessive attention to detail, which is expressed in the comings and goings of passers-by on the streets, in the careful interior design (complete with news and radio in the background) and in the delicate contrast between nature and hi-tech. Even the characters demonstrate a work of a certain caliber, not free from influences of various kinds but absolutely original: for example, Jade resembles a lot, in her decisive and confident gait and in her strong and courageous expressiveness, Hercules' Megara or Mulan of the film of the same name, but is a character in itself, made with great attention both from a visual and character point of view; the semi-humans like Pei'j or the children of Jade who populate Hillys, then, fit into the everyday life of the setting with great class, recalling once again the aforementioned Treasure Planet and Titan A.E. The whole is modeled three-dimensionally in a soft and never angular way, which together with the vivid and accurate coloring and the careful use of lights and shadows, gives the distinct sensation of being in front of a cartoon, probably also due to the letterboxed format. Another aspect in which Beyond Good & Evil excels is the sound one: on the one hand we have a varied and very high quality soundtrack, full of truly enchanting songs suitable for any situation; on the other hand, an Italian dubbing which - for once - proves to be up to the level of the remaining technical sector: well acted, colorful and lively, it is striking not only in the non-interactive sequences but also in those junctures during which the tension is broken by the jokes witty and always spot on that exchange characters on the screen, referring to little facts and characters that contribute to making a world that, at this point, we seriously hope to see in a new incarnation more and more vivid. Comment Beyond Good & Evil is a surprise, in the PlayStation 2 playroom, a gameor which was greatly missed, which satisfies all players by mixing many genres inside it without any of them coming into conflict with the others. The playful variety and depth, supported by an interface that is not only intuitive and functional, but even created in such a way as to contextually fit into the world of Jade itself, is combined with an exceptional, detailed technical realization, free of noteworthy defects (a sporadic slowdowns or some really rare shading bugs), embellished by an apt soundtrack and an engaging dubbing, devoid of the lackluster interest usually shown by Italian voice actors. But Beyond Good & Evil, in addition to being a good game, is also a good story, a current story, which makes you think, which makes you think, realistic and compelling, which as its only flaw is that it doesn't last a little: about ten of hours as soon as it is required by the main quest to be completed. Beyond its short duration and the few reported imperfections, Beyond Good & Evil proves to be one of the best games of the year and probably one of the best titles available on PlayStation 2, to have at all costs. Pros Excellent technical execution Beautiful storyline and well-characterized characters Varied, deep gameplay, perfect mix of multiple genres Cons Occasional slowdowns Rather short Everyone knows that The Legend of Zelda has made school. This is what happens to all videogame cornerstones, suffering or enjoying (depending on the case) countless attempts at imitation, sometimes successful and sometimes less successful, but which always transmit that strange sensation of deja-vue which can make one smile or pour bitter tears. Michael Ancel is a game designer who has always looked carefully at the videogame landscape to give life to his ideas: in 1996 he generated Rayman, one of the best two-dimensional platformers that the history of video games remembers, and in the following years its three-dimensional sequels. After a long period of silence, Ancel returns to work by pulling out of the top hat a game on which no one, on paper, would have bet a penny, but which when tested on the road stands as a new point of reference for a genre so far dominated by the masterpiece by Miyamoto. But what makes Beyond Godd & Evil worthy of the Japanese masterpiece is not so much the purely playful aspect as the depth of the messages it transmits, real, tangible, daily cultural messages, which make us reflect heavily on our society and on what most characterizes it, and that even at this moment it is making contact with your brain, the reader: the information. And the question is the oldest in the world: what can information do in the wrong hands? Can information have power over society? Well, ask Jade", "date": "2003-11-24", "grade": null}
