{"name": "Difesa alta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/146818-resogun-defenders-difesa-alta.html", "text": "First title for PlayStation 4 to debut in the Instant Game Collection reserved for PlayStation Plus subscribers, Resogun has put on the table a captivating reinterpretation of the ~circular~ dynamics that characterize some of the shooters developed by Housemarque. In this case, however, our goal in the game is not to explore the spherical arrangement of an asteroid, but to adopt a ~two-dimensional~ approach, opening fire only to the right and left as we circle a nucleus, pursued by myriads of enemy vehicles ready to tear us apart. Immediate, fun and incredibly spectacular, thanks to the peculiar graphic style and the use of voxels to compose everything that moves on the screen, Resogun is updated again almost a year and a half after its launch, through the release of the second and final DLC . The news Purchasable for 4.99 on PlayStation Store and developed by XDEV, Resogun: Defenders adds two new modes to the Housemarque product experience: Protector and Commando. The first, with an endless base, takes up the mechanisms that we know well, translating them, however, into a defensive perspective. The focus is therefore no longer to eliminate all the enemies on the screen and the consequent bosses, but to collect the humans who are projected into the scenario and escort them towards the usual teleportation, going to lay the foundations of a settlement to defend. An element of progression is represented in this case by the possibility of enhancing the shot and the hyperdrive in an unprecedented way, but also of being able to transport, at a certain point, more than one person at a time. The result is a mix of frenetic and again very spectacular situations, a variation on the theme that Resogun owners will appreciate, once again putting their skills to the test after the four difficulty levels of the story. The second mode, Commando, deals instead with distorting the traditional gameplay of the game, putting us in the role of a soldier who has the task of defending a house during a dangerous meteor shower. At this juncture you no longer shoot left and right, but one hundred and eighty degrees, in pure twin analog shooter style, using on the one hand skills that we already know (the shot and the smart bomb), on the other hand new maneuvers such as jumping. There are twenty waves in all, increasingly more complex, with power-ups to sweat and really complicated situations to deal with, while trying to avoid the house being damaged but also being hit directly by enemy fire, which would translate into an instant game over. With a view to adding content to a package that, initially, certainly didn't boast a particular body, both methods have something to say; even more so if we lose a few minutes to create our ships or our characters from scratch, giving them peculiar characteristics and, perhaps, reproducing the features of our heroes to add further involvement to the action. Too bad for the general endless setting, which limits the thickness of the experience. Resogun: Defenders enriches the experience of the Housemarque shooter with two fun modes The contour The contents of the Resogun: Defenders DLC boast an excellent value for money, especially considering their original and alternative nature. On the one hand, in fact, we have the traditional mechanisms of the Protector mode, which places us in front of a new challenge while keeping intact the elements of the game that we know well, therefore the circular movement of the spacecraft, the management of upgrades and specials, and so on ; on the other there is the interesting novelty of the Commando mode, a real spin-off halfway between platform and twin analog shooter, with increasingly numerous and lethal waves to face, crowned by the arrival of a particularly large and dangerous to threaten the house we are charged with defending. Furthermore, this second mode can be played in both cooperative and competitive multiplayer: in the first case you collaborate with another player to face the rain of asteroids and the arrival of hostile vehicles, always with a view to the twenty waves, while in the second case (Battle) you compete in an arena that is very reminiscent of that of the most famous videogame brawlers, trying to wear out your opponent by exploiting the pitfalls of the scenario to your advantage. The experience does not end here, however, given that a free update was also released shortly before the launch of Defenders which makes the game interface more current, while also adding a large number of challenges, which constitute an incentive to return to the game. DualShock 4 in handeven after completing all that can be completed and setting lavish high-scores. Some of the challenges resume the modalities seen in the Resogun: Heroes package, others refer instead to the new DLC, and in all cases represent a reason of great interest for those who, as mentioned, have exhausted the basic contents of the Housemarque shooter but still have desire to put themselves to the test, albeit in different situations.", "date": "2015-03-16", "grade": null}
