{"name": "Donkey Konga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/donkey-konga_a.html", "text": "Animal rhythm Going to fill a gap that may not be very serious but still present in the Gamecube's play offer, Donkey Konga presents itself to Nintendo users as one of the simplest assimilation rhythm games ever seen. Obviously, the gameplay of the Namco title is based on the use of bongos as percussion instruments to be played consistently with the indications that scroll on the video. In fact, the Donkey Konga game screen has a horizontal strip on which a series of four different icons are displayed to the rhythm of music relating to the same number of actions that can be performed using the peripheral: the yellow circle corresponds to a hit on the left bongo, the red to that right, the purple requires a simultaneous beat of both, while finally the blue toothed symbol calls the player to a clap, which can be received through a microphone installed inside the bongo. The presence of elongated versions of the same figures then coincides with the request to repeat the same gesture frantically, resulting in powerful rolls on the bongos or in series crammed with applause. As per tradition, the physical action relating to a particular icon must be carried out with as much timing as possible, based on the passage of one of the above colored circles inside a transparent disc. The greater the sense of rhythm demonstrated, the greater the donation of gold coins to the user, which can be used to unlock the various bonuses made available by the game. These are resolved in mini-games, in particular sound effects for the bongos and in more difficult versions of the 31 songs that make up the Donkey Konga soundtrack. Which, incidentally, demonstrates a selection of tracks that leaves room for some perplexity. Not only for the non-original workmanship of the pieces (all the songs are in fact not always very successful covers), but also for the questionable relevance of some of these with the peripheral and the style of the Namco title. In short, playing Oye Como Va, Para Los Rumbreros or Danza Ungherese No. 5 on bongos makes a certain sense, which can hardly be said for songs like All The Small Things or Tubthumping. However, it is easy to overlook certain defects considering both the decidedly broad target to which Donkey Konga is aimed, and the fun factor offered by the Nintendo product, generally on always high levels. Music choice The Donkey Konga tracklist could perhaps be criticized for the quality of some of its pieces, but certainly not for its variety: in fact, the Nintendo product has 31 songs belonging to a good series of different genres and styles. There are therefore pieces of pop and modern rock (Canned Heat by Jamiroquai, Alright by Supergrass, Lady Marmelade by Li'l Kim, Aguilera, Mya and Pink), old glories of the 70s-80s scene (I Want You Back by Jackson 5, September by Earth Wind And Fire, 99 Red Baloons by Nena) as well as evergreens such as Don't Stop Me Now by Queen and Back For Good by Take That and Latin American melodies. There are also some pleasant excursus in classical music and various music taken directly from the gaming world of Nintendo. Wild Bunch Playing Donkey Konga is fun, and a lot too. Graced by a usability that defining immediate is almost an understatement, the Namco title manages to immediately capture the user by involving him in percussions and handclaps that become really difficult to resist. Where the quality of some tracks in the tracklist can be questioned, the same cannot be said of the structuring of the same as regards the arrangement on the screen of the icons relating to the actions to be performed on the bongos, always decidedly spot on. With its three selectable difficulty levels, Donkey Konga guarantees both fun for less experienced players and a considerable challenge for those who want to push themselves into the more advanced stages. Of course, like the vast majority of rhythm games, the Nintendo product does not make the single player mode its strong point, on the contrary: however it presents a series of interesting multiplayer options, capable of making it a fun party game. The Challenge and Battle modes allow two users to face each other in a sort of survival mode and in a competition to see who makes the best score, complete with bonuses with which to increase one's advantage at the expense of the opponent. Then there is the Rehearsal Room, open to a maximum of four players, in which it is possible to embark on particular jam sessions, and the three different unlockable mini-games, not exactly exciting but still useful for giving further variety to the title. In any case, however, Donkey Konga proves to be a successful rhthm game, which perhaps deserved some more attention in terms of tracklist and graphic appeal, not fundamentalental in a product of this kind but here of a not indifferent stylistic paucity. Comment Donkey Konga is everything one could expect from a Nintendo-style rhythm game, or rather a game that makes immediacy and simple fun its two greatest strengths. Structured to be appreciated by an almost universal catchment area, Donkey Konga is the typical title to pull out in the presence of family or friends to launch into bongs and collective handclaps, thanks also to a series of interesting multiplayer options. Fun and captivating, the Nintendo product suffers however from a selection of songs that are not always perfectly fitting and from an all too minimalist cosmetics with questionable artistic value, elements which however do not prevent it from establishing itself as an excellent choice for fans of the genre. Pros: Fun and immediate Usable by anyone Excellent as a party game Cons: Some unconvincing songs Graphics reduced to a minimum Short-lived in single player After mats, guitars, keyboards, drums, DJ cymbals, maracas and so on and so forth, the rhythm game genre is enriched with a bizarre new game peripheral. Thanks to the joint work of Namco and Nintendo, in fact, even Gamecube can now boast a plasticky instrument with which to be able to launch into the most disparate musical accompaniments. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Donkey Konga and his bongos", "date": "2004-10-22", "grade": null}
