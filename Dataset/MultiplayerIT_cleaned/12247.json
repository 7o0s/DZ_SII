{"name": "Burnout Dominator - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/burnout-dominator-recensione-2.html", "text": "Dominate the street Let's start immediately with the bad news: in Burnout Dominator the Crash mode has been completely eliminated, or the one in which you had to throw yourself at full speed in the middle of busy intersections in order to create the most devastating chain accident possible. A difficult choice to justify given the excellent success that the aforementioned game option had in the previous chapters, and probably dictated by the desire to contain development times and costs. So what remains of this episode is the main mode, the one related to car racing; fortunately the ~juice~ of Burnout has always been of excellent quality, and Dominator is no less from this point of view. Although therefore a ~minor~ chapter of the series, the programmers still wanted to make some changes to the game mechanics, without resting too much on their laurels. The main novelty is basically in the management of the turbo; just like in the past, to fill this bar it is necessary to carry out a whole series of very risky maneuvers, such as driving against traffic, brushing against other cars, jumping and drifting or causing accidents to opponents. In Dominator, however, the aforementioned turbo bar, once completely filled, changes its color from red to blue, turning into ~supercharge~. By pressing the backbone R on this occasion you will get the classic dizzying increase in speed, but the difference lies in the fact that by performing other pirate maneuvers during the turbo you will obtain the multiplication of the supercharge. The result is that it thus becomes virtually possible to travel the entire route with the turbo on, with the only limit therefore of the player's skill. The consequence is a shift in the center of gravity of the game, which no longer revolves solely around the ~fight~ against opponents with the main aim of throwing them off the road, but thus acquires a more strategic component requiring greater skill from the pilot. This clearly without distorting one of the characteristic aspects of Burnout, or the highly spectacular accidents; of course, in principle it would be better if these concerned only one's rivals, but in the event that they involve one's own car, it is possible to resolve them to one's advantage both with aftertouch (moving the racing car with R+analog, for being hit by incoming racing cars) and the Crashbreaker (triangle button, an explosion with a shock wave that destroys everything that passes nearby). Tablet The main mode, called World Tour, allows you to choose between 7 different car categories (classic cars, racing cars, hot rods, modified cars and so on) to face 13 types of competitions. These range from the classic challenge to those who arrive first, but also varying in races for those who drive crazier, or on the distance of drifts or even the elimination of opponents. An excellent variety that allows Burnout Dominator to remain attractive and fresh even after many hours of play. Too bad that an online multiplayer mode is completely absent, further sad confirmation of the very limited use that has been made of the PSP's capabilities so far; the only multiplayer options are therefore linked to an ad hoc network of up to 6 users, or to the best time challenges with a single console. On the other hand, the ability to download new tracks via wi-fi connection is appreciable, with a consequent increase in longevity. As for the technical component, unfortunately the EA production is not one of the best products to demonstrate the capabilities of the Sony laptop; on the altar of the fluidity and speed of the frame rate, always anchored and stable, polygonal complexity and textures have in fact been sacrificed, degrading everything with a truly marked aliasing. Of course Dominator is not a bad game to look at, but it seems rather to do the homework without trying too hard to bring out the full capabilities of the PSP. Without a doubt everything takes a back seat in the ecstasy of the races, but the fact remains that the Renderware has certainly not been exploited to the maximum in this edition, much poorer than the PS2 version. On the other hand, the sound component is very good, with a musical selection certainly not for fine palates but very suitable for the purpose and well-made effects. Comment Burnout Dominator is a minor chapter in the series, however made with competence and ability. Far from being a simple commercial operation to monetize while waiting for the fifth next-gen episode, Dominator is able to be appreciated by every lover of the series. Too bad for the important lack of crash mode, and for a graphic component that can be decidedly improved. But all in all we can considerare production EA an advisable purchase without particular reservations. Pros Very entertaining as always Robust main mode Effective soundtrack Cons Technically lackluster No crash mode No online multiplayer Not everyone has embraced the next-gen, either for economic reasons or for reasons purely related to the desire to wait for much more prolific periods in terms of available games. And so even the software houses think twice before bringing their most famous franchises to the new consoles, or at least try to protect themselves by maintaining strong ties with platforms that can count on a decidedly substantial installed base. So here is that Electronic Arts has decided to put Burnout 5 in the pipeline for Xbox 360 and PS3, but also creating an exclusive chapter for PS2 and PSP subtitled Dominator. After reviewing the version for the black monolith, it's therefore time to test the portable one...", "date": "2007-05-29", "grade": null}
