However, EA has managed to give a remarkably complete approach to its product, if only in terms of the game modes offered: in addition to the classic friendlies, it is possible to play tournaments, train on free kicks and penalties and watch an effective tutorial for immediately assimilate the game mechanics. Not only that, there is also the interesting Scenario mode in which you have to ~run~ into difficult situations (for example, down by two to zero half an hour from the end) in an attempt to solve them for the best. All being able to count on the usual huge database of FIFA licenses: therefore all the Serie A teams and the major European championships are present, as well as national teams and some bonus teams. The squads of each club are updated and full of illustrious names such as Ronaldinho, Rooney, Shevcenko, Totti and so on. Of course, don't expect to notice great similarities with the real counterparts: due to the already specified technical limits and the remoteness of the game view, the various athletes can only differ in skin color and hair color. Graphically, FIFA 07 does its job, even if it's definitely not the best we've ever seen on mobile. As mentioned, the shot in the game is isometric - similar to that of the very old FIFA International Soccer - and allows a good view of the playing field, however sacrificing the details of the players and the vision of the stadium, which is quite limited. The athletes actually move with few animations, moreover very little related to each other, an aspect evident above all in the goalkeepers' dives, who complete their ~flight~ in three shots that are decidedly not nice to see. Good replays complete the picture of a non-sumptuous cosmetic creation, inferior to similar productions but all in all acceptable. Soft swipe Coming to the playful part of FIFA 07, it must be said immediately how the EA product solves the problem of the control system by using only two keys to perform each game action. Traditionally the most difficult step for any mobile title, the controls work very well here, with buttons that perform a double function depending on the level of pressure. Therefore, a quick touch of the two keys allows alternatively a low shot or a short pass, while a longer solicitation allows you to make half-height trips or long balls. The control system is context-sensitive with regards to crosses, so when a player is on the wing it is sufficient to press the pass button to throw the ball into the center of the area. Sufficient in the possession phase, the management of the character on the screen is to be forgotten when defending: normal tackles simply do not work, therefore one is forced to systematically resort to slips, with obvious risks in terms of cards. Unfortunately, the opponent AI in FIFA 07 leaves a lot to be desired, with opponents always backing away from the ball carrier, making it far too easy to get to the shot: this is poorly compensated for by the often capable goalkeepers of parades bordering on the absurd. FIFA 07 matches therefore follow one another at a rather bland pace, ~enlivened~ only by the sporadic free kicks and penalties, the execution of which is also very questionable. In short, the EA title can be played, but nothing more. PRO * Lots of game modes * Good selection of teams AGAINST * Understated graphics * Definitely low AI", "date": "2007-01-28", "grade": "S.V."}
