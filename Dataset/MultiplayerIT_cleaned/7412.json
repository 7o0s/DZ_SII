That little gem of Unexplored: The Immersion which in its small way, indeed very small, has managed to carve out a good slice of fans with its minimal and colorful style. The fortune of the series is given by its most distinctive feature, that much sought-after procedural that made it shine among hundreds of other titles that abuse the epithet ~Roguelike~. If in the predecessor random generation was limited to three freely explorable and more or less repeatable levels, here we are faced with an immense work of improvement and research, a gigantic evolution in terms of code design and possibilities for exploration and variation of the experience. History One of the beautiful levels of Unexplored 2 The story is simple, as you may have guessed from the title of the article: we will play the Wayfarer, a character created randomly or through a small but effective editor, in his sacred journey to destroy the scepter of Yendor, an artifact that with its mere existence is destined to destroy the whole world. In theory the narrative ends here and is limited to a ~get from point A to point B~, fine. Instead it is precisely the journey, the journey, just to continue quoting the supreme, that makes all the difference in the world. Or perhaps we should say ~I~ travel. Yes, because without fear of being proven wrong, we can say that there will be a before and after Unexplored 2. The feature that makes the gaming experience exceptional is something that has left us baffled: every time we die with our character we will lose everything and we will start our journey again and up to here everything seems to portend yet another roguelike. But no, because it is not only this, but with each of our deaths the world will change accordingly, but it will not be a procedural change as an end in itself, but dynamic. Indeed, once passed through, the game will show us the map and what happens to it in the years following our death, with the various clans that will compete for the available areas and the empire (yes, if we want there is also Star Wars from able to quote) that inexorably advances, to take possession of the scepter of Yendor. Exp, this unknown A landscape from Unexplored 2: The Wayfarer's Legacy But let's get to the fun part. The game begins with the creation of our alter ego, whether procedural or created by us it doesn't matter, the beginning will always be the same: we will take possession of the scepter of Yendor and we will have to go and destroy it. In the city where we will become aware we will be able to talk to some non-player characters who will explain certain mechanics of the game world to us and will unlock points on the map that would otherwise be accessible only after having discovered them, navigating off the cuff. In doing so, with the scepter on his shoulder and some other basic equipment, we set off on our adventure. Once out of the city we find ourselves in the game world map, which can be explored by clicking on one of the areas adjacent to the one in which we find ourselves, thus being able to move by advancing time and making us vulnerable to a series of bad weather and negative statuses such as fatigue , cold or heat. After arriving in the desired area we will be able to decide whether to explore it, trying to recover objects, meat or clues to unlock other areas, or continue in the main quest. A landscape from Unexplored 2: The Wayfarer's Legacy The key thing that you will have to keep in mind is that there are no experience points or skill trees or various upgrades. The only things that can help us along the way are those that we will be able to find, also through the clues given by the various characters encountered along our way. But these are swords, spears, spells, shields and armor, rings and necklaces that, as a good roguelike, we will lose once we die. This will happen very often: between enemies, bad weather, environmental traps and explosives you will very often find yourself having to start the journey over again. Another new feature that pleasantly surprised us is that of dialogues and interactions with various objects, altars and inscriptions. A sort of dice game in which we will find ourselves randomly receiving an answer to questions related to what we are analyzing or to the character we are talking to. The game map of Unexplored 2 This aspect made us reopen that door dedicated only to D&D that we have kept closed for too long. See how dialogues evolve based on what we can or cannot say, being able or not to decipher a stele to know where to go or where to look for an artifacttto, it's really intriguing and gives the whole thing a sense of ~true and genuine~. We have to admit that it took us a few hours and a few dozen deaths to fully understand its potential, but once you enter the game system, we assure you that you will never leave it. One of the best experiences is to go in search of this or that artefact, recover it and then maybe die in an awkward way, go back to that precise point and never find the treasure we lost, because in the meantime years have passed and maybe if someone else is possessed, thus having to start looking for clues to understand what could have happened. And so on with everything that happens, between clans feuding and allies becoming enemies, the journey that will lead us to the destruction of the scepter of Yendor will be more dynamic and varied than ever. Technique and art One of the giants of Unexplored 2 From an artistic point of view this Unexplored 2: the Wayfarer's Legacy is a feast for the eyes. Obviously we're talking about a particular product that strongly turns low poly with a delicious toon shader, but it does its dirty work and does it very well. All settings from the most stark to the most sophisticated, with buildings, waterfalls, forests, animals and various oddities, are really pleasant to explore. The scepter of Yendor then, if equipped at night, emits a very particular colored light that accompanies us in the exploration of the caves and dungeons which, with their soundtrack, manage to immerse us perfectly within the game world. Just the soundtrack is another point in favor of the production: we go from epic tracks to more pressing music, which in general always accompany our raids properly. Unfortunately, the controls, the animations and the sense of disorientation that grips during the first part of the adventure take care of dirtying such a peculiar and well-made production. The movements almost seem to glide on the ground, as if it were always wet, with a sort of animation queue that makes escapes or movements that require more precision tedious. The animations of the attacks and of the characters in general are poorly cared for compared to the rest and the thing that bothered us most is precisely that sense of disorientation that one has in the first hours of the game which we are sure will discourage newbies or those who in any case expect a action title more dedicated to classic exploration. Unexplored 2: The Wayfarer's Legacy Another small note that we always want to point out even if for many it may not even be a point against is the lack of localization in Italian, above all due to the fact that there are enough things to read and understand.", "date": "2022-05-26", "grade": "8.5"}
