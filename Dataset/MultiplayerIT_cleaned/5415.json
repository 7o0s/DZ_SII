It is a bitter observation that all the veterans of the franchise have made as soon as it was discovered that Monster Hunter Generations (Monster Hunter X, in Japan) effectively recycles the maps and monsters of Monster Hunter Freedom, Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, Monster Hunter Tri and Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. For those who have already spent an embarrassing number of hours scavenging materials in at least a couple of the aforementioned episodes, Monster Hunter Generations may seem like a ~more of the same~ to the nth degree. Those who are now approaching the series, or have started on Nintendo 3DS, instead have the opportunity to take a strange dive into the past. And in any case, the matter is not so simple, because the work done by Capcom is far from a mere copy and paste: Generations puts so much meat on the fire that considering it below a regular release would be unfair, as well as reductive . Ironically, there's a lot more to this celebratory edition than meets the eye. The past and future of hunting meet in Monster Hunter Generations The super four Mizutsune, Altalos, Gammoth and Glavenus: they are the ~cover~ monsters of Monster Hunter Generations, four creatures who embody the evolution of the series over the last ten years in their appearances and behaviors. In particular, we really appreciated the design of the Glavenus, a gigantic T-Rex capable of lashing out with a kilometric and explosive tail and which, in a certain sense, represents the boss of the quartet. Those who play Monster Hunter certainly don't do it for the plot, but Capcom had enriched the Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate campaign with cinematic sequences, dialogues and supporting actors that linked the various missions and narratively contextualized the introduction of some monsters such as Gore Magala or the Seregios. In Monster Hunter Generations none of this happens. From the beginning we can move freely between the four villages of Bherna, Pokke, Kokoto and Yukumo to interact with the various inhabitants and accept their requests, which usually appear in the form of missions at the usual guild counter. Fans of the series will recognize the visitors who gradually peep into the villages, but there is no underlying logic and our preys are offered to us mechanically and without a real why, introduced by very short, very uninspired cinematics. In this sense, Monster Hunter Generations wants to be a much more immediate title that guarantees the player complete control of the situation: most of the features are available immediately, including the Cacciamiao with their village, but others will have to be unlocked by completing some missions specifications. It's a trivial mechanic, perhaps, but it gives players the incentive they need not to dive right into the multiplayer mode, ignoring the offline component. After all, the offline mode is a real test, as well as the best way to train against monsters before facing them online. Veterans will recognize most of the proposed targets: the Rathalos, the Rathian and the Tigrex are inevitable, the amphibious monsters such as the Lagiacrus and the Royal Ludroth are welcome, redesigned to annoy us only on land since you cannot fight underwater. In total we will find ourselves facing 105 monsters, seven more than in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, even if the new ones, including the four of the Ave Maria, are only seventeen. We were sorry not to see the two spectacular Morans again, compensated by the welcome returns of Alatreon and Amatsu, as well as the new entry Nakarkos. In short, the variety is certainly not lacking, and the missions, although a bit repetitive, manage to mix the species and objectives well, guaranteeing a good longevity. Which brings us straight to the very sensitive issue of G-rank: no, there isn't. Hunting online Those who have played Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate will not find huge differences compared to the past: Generations offers more or less the same search and room creation parameters, agglomerated in a not exactly intuitive interface. You can only chat limitedly in the preparation area, then on a mission you have to rely on macros and preset phrases. The netcode works like a charm and we haven't encountered any problems in our gaming sessions. No G, no party? When it became known that Monster Hunter Generations does not offer the infamous G-rank missions, many players literally panicked. After all, it has always been the G-rank missions that have kept us busy for hours and hours in multiplayer mode: they represent the so-called endgame, the moment when the going gets really tough and the tough start to farm. The G-rank problem, however, stems from a completely wrong assumption. Firstly, it must be considered that the previous Monster Hunters landed in the west were the ~revisions~ of the original counterparts released at home almost a couple of years earlier each time. For example, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate is actually the Monster Hunter 4G overhaul of Monster Hunter 4, and Monster Hunter 4 did not include G-rank missions upon its original Japanese release. That said, what G-rank really is ? Basically we're talking about the same monsters we've already faced in low and high rank missions, only more harmful and more robust. Yes, the new materials allow you to craft the best weapons and armor in the game, but then fighting yet another Zinogre or Brachydios becomes just gymnastics. Monster Hunter Generations doesn't have G-rank monsters, but in some ways it offers something better: deviants. They are the new endgame, and effectively replace not only the G-rank quests, but also the random guild quests that were the main focus of perfectionists in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. The difference lies precisely in the fact that the luck or bad luck of the players has nothing to do with it. Dealing with a deviant isn't easy right from the start: first you have to unlock him by completing the corresponding missions, then you have to buy the license to fight him. Then you have to survive. If you believe that the Nix Lagombi is half a sock like its normal counterpart, you are very wrong, and we are not even bothering the deviant Glavenus. Deviants resemble their original counterparts, but feature all-new attacks and behaviors that will throw even the most seasoned player off guard. The armor that can be crafted from their parts may seem rather flimsy, but once completed and upgraded they represent the pinnacle of Monster Hunter Generations: they grant extraordinary abilities and bonuses that go perfectly with certain combinations of weapons and styles. In this regard, Capcom has redesigned the system for upgrading weapons and armor, replacing the rarest materials with an indicator that is filled by accumulating objects belonging to a specific type, and the rarer they are, the less they are needed. In this way, Monster Hunter Generations alleviates the pains of the most unfortunate players, focusing on a more generic and flexible ~farming~. Furthermore, each weapon can also evolve into completely different forms, requiring fewer materials as long as the previous form has reached an adequate level. It is important to underline that these tweaks do not cancel the ~farming~, but only reduce it slightly: it remains an integral part of the experience, therefore those who did not like it in the past will not change their mind now, also because the game tends to give out much less zenny than in the past, forcing players to successfully complete missions and sell accumulated materials to fill their wallets. This is a controversial choice, considering the number of items that can be crafted. Ultimately, the G rank in Monster Hunter Generations is not there, but this does not mean that it is less demanding than its predecessors, which were much more artificial in terms of longevity. Hunting with style is an art Leaving monsters, weapons and armor aside, Monster Hunter Generations introduces some new gameplay features that will inevitably change the series forever. The combat system has always split the opinion of the players in two, between those who love its reasoned slowness and those who really can't stand it. Beyond the technicalities that distinguish every single animation of the players and monsters, in fact the combat system hasn't changed much in recent years, if we exclude the brief and questionable parenthesis of the underwater battles in Monster Hunter Tri and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate or the much cooler introduction of verticality and jump attacks in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. From this point of view, Monster Hunter Generations takes a decisive step forward by implementing hunting styles and arts. The former essentially change the move pool of each weapon. The Guild style maintains the combos already learned in previous episodes - where Capcom has not imposed some small changes, as in the case of the insect glaive - while the Shadow style allows you to carry out some attacks only after performing perfect dodges. The Aerial style turns dodging into a real hopping that allows you to use enemies as springboards to attack them from above, while the Offensive style, as the name suggests, allows you to equip up to three hunting limbs instead of one or two as do the other styles. The hunting arts are real ~super moves~ that charge over time and with each attack; there are several for each weapon and various power levels are unlocked, but there are neutral and strategic arts such as the Absolute Dodge or the Healing Oasis that are suitable for players who are less cautious or more devoted to team support. It's important to understand, though, that each style gives and takes away from the traditional weapon move pool. The Aerial style can deprive us of the last attack of a combo on the ground, for example, replacing it with an exclusive move that we can only launch in mid-air. In general, the variety granted by the combinations of styles and arts is simply crazy, but it is clear that Capcom has not managed to balance all the weapons and arts very well, since some of them lend themselves to certain styles much more than others . This is the case with the swordaxe, for example, which in Aerial style gains a bonus attack in contact with the enemy, becoming even more effective than the insect glaive when you want to ride a monster. The Shadow style, on the other hand, makes the bow one of the most devastating weapons ever: an expert player can simply become untouchable. The synergies between skills, arts, styles and weapons have also lowered the overall difficulty level by a notch. Capcom must have tweaked the monsters' hitboxes and animations, because they seemed to us significantly less aggressive and resistant than in the past, but it is still true that, in addition to generally inflicting more damage, in most cases they already knew our opponents by heart . Despite these controversial aspects, the arts and styles have made Monster Hunter Generations' combat system even deeper, while still guaranteeing an entirely new level of immersion. As if these innovations were not enough, Capcom has also implemented the Hunt Meow mode that allows you to play as the Felyne that we have lovingly raised between one mission and another. In addition to choosing two or two companions, while the others hunt for monsters or objects behind the scenes, the player can select a particular Miaohunter and control him directly in the mission. The Meowhunter does not inflict the same damage as normal hunters, but it has a whole series of abilities and mechanics that should not be underestimated, starting with the fact that it does not consume stamina and that it can faint more times than a normal hunter. A special indicator determines when we can use the special skills that we have previously equipped, which effectively allows us to prepare a Cacciamiao capable of having its say in combat or of supporting our fellow players to great effect. Unfortunately, the possibilities offered to normal hunters far exceed the performance of the Hunt Meow mode: it would not surprise us to see very few online. The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect of Monster Hunter Generations is one of the best we've ever seen on the small screen Nintendo 3DS. We advise you to activate it to enjoy hunting in an even more spectacular way, but remember that you will lose definition and fluidity slightly. Old Generations To conclude, it is worth dedicating a few lines to the technical sector, even if there isn't much to add compared to what we said last year in the case of Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate: after all, Generations uses the same, identical engine, and this it means that you have to come to terms with a generally dirty image and with a very low texture resolution. We tested the game on New Nintendo 3DS and found an absolutely granite frame rate in every situation, even if slightly affected by the activation of the stereoscopic effect which, however, is still stunning and engaging. The true strength of Monster Hunter remains the over the top artistic direction, especially in the representation of monsters, weapons and armor, as well as the ecosystems in which the missions take place: evocative and very rich in details that change depending on whether they are explored during the day and at night. Unfortunately the maps prior to Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate have aged decidedly badly, even if Capcom has retouched them to add a touch of verticality through ledges and destructibility", "date": "2016-07-12", "grade": "9.0"}
