{"name": "Beat Down: Vengeance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/beat-down-vengeance.html", "text": "The minestrone of digital barrels The idea behind Beat Down was perhaps (or perhaps not) to start from Spikeout, which took up the concept of the scrolling fighting game in three dimensions, to add game mechanics borrowed from other famous games and create a sort of evolved super-fighting game : set in a vast city full of non-linear events in which you interact with non-playable characters and change your appearance (Grand Theft Auto); equipped with a vast series of blows, closer to a fighting game in matches and, indeed, equipped with real one-on-one fights (Tekken / Virtua Fighter). Instead of having a series of linear levels, in fact, Beat Down presents a city in which the character chosen from the initial roster must mature and carry out his revenge against the traitors of his own mafia ~family~. And instead of a limited series of hits, it offers the player a list of moves in full 3D fighting game style. The clashes take place with a pointing system that makes the game similar to a match fighting game and, often, this formula prevails (albeit unhappily) on the activity of mass beating. The game largely consists of facing the hordes of enemies with the combos available and then moving from area to area, facing a boss with a one-on-one fight and moving forward by eating chicken, collecting cans and smashing crates. After all, we're in a fighting game. However, there are significant innovations, inspirations which, if properly developed, would have brought about a positive turning point for the whole genre. Sadly, undeveloped ideas also remain. One of these is the question of the city in which to roam freely, but also the introduction of non-playable characters as possible allies prove to be wasted opportunities. Let's take the dialogues, which take place in the exploratory phases. Talking to the characters in the environments doesn't provide much information: more than anything else, a pretext to beat and rob them later, and to change clothes to avoid being recognized. Dialogue with kicks in the mouth The non-recognizability of the character is one of the elements of a conception borrowed with little style from GTA and which would like to refresh the beating action. The consequence of being recognized as outcasts of a gang is to risk perennial lynching and not to be served by the shopkeepers of objects and clothing. And then, this game design ~inspiration~ has led to a shift in programmers' interest from the solidity of the fights to the implementation of clothes that players can buy to customize the look of the fighters. Appearing constantly different, buying clothes and accessories and changing the look of the characters and even being able to change their characteristics with the use of facial plastic surgery, however, very soon becomes a necessary and boring routine to be able to shoot in relatively undisturbed environments, with the result to create a vicious circle in which the player has no more interest in interacting with the environment for fear of having to spend more money on ridiculous customizations (or waiting for loading for each individual environment). The pleasure of undressing and vulgarizing a fighter beyond belief or making a fighter ridiculous lasts very little. And on the other hand, not even the unprecedented possibility of saving some defeated to enlist them as one's allies offers much to the game mechanics: two-shots are practically unexecutable and inapplicable, while the humiliated and enlisted ~soldiers~ refuse to take part in all the struggles. The struggle as chaos All this talk about the uselessness of ideas that are only potentially interesting to enrich the game leads in fact to the main problem of Beat Down: the poor implementation of the control and combat system. To begin with, targeting enemies is automatic and badly done. It is a kind of poorly copied Z-targeting, which makes it impossible to choose the reasoned enemies to face by always hooking up to the wrong one. The variety of shots available, as well as being poorly calibrated in terms of economy of damage and relative speed of execution, thus proves to be useless. At the easy level you proceed by pressing the keys at random, at hard you succumb without any possibility of rationally facing a challenge on par with the CPU. Chaos takes precedence over the player's attempt to make meaningful shots. In the character encounter mode, there doesn't seem to be any reason to prefer one heist to another. Everything happens practically at random, whether we are talking about the amount of damage of one blow compared to another in relation to the speed of execution, orand try to build styles of play starting from the characteristics of the fighters. To make the situation worse, outside the one on one mode, the cameras are placed, very skilled in making it impossible for the player to see the situation; but also inexplicable and grotesque elements in terms of game design such as cars that whiz by on their own, inappropriately quoting GTA and wandering in the midst of the spaces of the clashes with the result of treacherously and repeatedly investing the player and the enemies. The struggle as chaos In addition to the poor realization of the clashes and the substantial uselessness of ideas such as those of the city, the enemies to hire and the characteristics to overturn, there is also a last level that makes Beat Down unsustainable: that of the aesthetic and narrative presentation of the game. In the midst of dialogues so full of badly recited and artificial slang as to be ridiculous and vulgarity and pseudo-adult situations so kitschy and badly ostentatious as to be embarrassing, it is difficult to think that the little uninspired low-brow humor that animates the game is really attempting to reflect on the paucity of its own operation. In any case, nothing would have been gained in terms of interaction. There is only one case in the game where an original gimmick is well implemented in the game, but the programmers, paradoxically, have understood the opposite: the one in which you go on a bad trip. By ingesting bad drugs to heal or too much alcohol to gain energy, the player has a bad trip and sees everything foggy and slowed down. On paper, this should be against the player. Instead, only in bad trip mode, slower and therefore rationalizable, is it possible to have decent control over an otherwise practically uncontrollable game situation. On paper, Beat Down would appear to be the definitive breakthrough in fighting games. You can beat up bad guys using sexy poles that can be dressed and undressed at will. You can roam an entire city changing your look, altering your features and talking to non-playable characters. There are tons of special moves and combos to perform and you can forcefully enlist opponents to create your own gang. But everything remains on paper: chaos in control annihilates interaction, and poor game design makes pleasant moments rare. Of Beat Down then many wasted ideas remain, a low-profile technical presentation, the uncontrollability of the fights, the mannered nastiness of necessarily unfair games and the ridicule of a non-existent narrative. If this is the future of fighting games, the times when people complained about Super Double Dragon were, by comparison, golden years. Pros Many original ideas Extreme customization of fighters Cons Impossible control Poor game design Low profile technical realization Many good ideas wasted Cross-platform Beat Down: Vengeance is also available for Xbox, a console on which it is essentially identical. A slightly higher level of detail in the graphics is not a reason to improve a gaming experience that remains very disappointing compared to expectations. Beat Down: Vengeance is a clumsy attempt at a commercial exploit by Capcom which is well explained by two trends taking place in the current videogame landscape. The first is a disease of false villainy that infests the worst video game writers, convinced that from GTA onwards it is enough to stage scripts and phrases in slang and rinsed gangster-style to make hasty and bleak videogame projects attractive. The second trend that explains Beat Down is instead a certain re-emergence, as a retro and fake fashion, of the old scrolling fighting game: this is a videogame species, which is certainly not enough to hastily re-engage in the 3D environment for it to develop without stop at the playful semi-abortion. Beat Down is a mess: a minestrone in which ingredients such as two-dimensional fighting games, Tekken, Spikeout and Grand Theft Auto (and a dash of The Warriors) are mixed awkwardly and produce an indigestible meatloaf. Even assuming that in Beat Down there was the good intention of reviving a certain idea of a fighting game in the contemporary era, hybridizing it with other mechanics, making it progress and expanding its ambition as a playful genre, it could not have reached a bad stage of realization than to follow an unacceptable result. Capcom's pastrocchio makes you regret every single genre it draws on, including some of the worst outcomes of the classic scrolling fighting game.", "date": "2006-01-04", "grade": null}
