{"name": "Chi Vuol Essere Miliardario?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chi-vuol-essere-miliardario-4.html", "text": "Regulation As I think most people reading this review know, the rules of the game are very simple: after passing an introductory speed test, you must attempt a climb made up of fifteen questions, with four possible answers for each, to finally reach one billion, the maximum jackpot. However, as in television, despite the advantage of having infinite time with the console and the possibility of cheating -put an encyclopaedia at your side- you will have as a bonus three different aids, available at any time you wish, which concern the elimination by the computer of two wrong answers, a very well simulated phone call home and help from the entire public who will vote their opinion in a percentage poll. If you think that none of the thousands of questions included in the game can put you in trouble then, below whose turn it is! Perfect illusion Although it is not a hardware-squeezing game equipped with shocking graphics and amazing special effects, this console conversion of ~Chi Vuol Esser..~ performs very well under the technical side, thanks above all to the care for the few but essential details such as the studio where the program and the system of questions taken verbatim from the television version take place, without forgetting the rule of ~even the eye wants its part~ too neglected in the production of more commercial games and therefore intended for a slice of the public wider. Furthermore, this software has really been localized in an excellent way, with a good variety of excellently sampled phrases, music suitable for the atmosphere and the presence (vocal only on Playstation, unfortunately) of the presenter Gerry Scotti, half director and half conductor who with his voice adds an extra touch to the overall atmosphere. How long will it last? Without a multitap and a few friends, you'll end up getting tired of the single game very soon: despite there being a large number of questions, in fact, Chi Vuol Esser is not made for solitary games and, saying this, I can't help but confirm its its family game nature. In conclusion, I can recommend this game as an alternative to classic board games for those who want to spend some fun evenings with the family but, I believe that in a period full of major releases like this, a famous license is not enough to attract even the most demanding players . How long will it last? Pros: Immediate High longevity Perfectly recreated atmosphere Fun with multiple players Cons: Simplistic Loses comparison to its PC counterpart Will last a few days on its own Too expensive for what it offers The quiz mania It has been about a year now that Who Wants to Be a Billionaire?, the Italian version of a very popular American show (and I am just now getting the news of a colossal scam in the English version of the show with a competitor who allegedly won the jackpot by cheating and then writing a book on the story!), depopulates weekly in the homes of several thousand Italians, with the hope one day of being able to cash in the longed-for ~check~. Now, during the Christmas period, the most distressing quiz of the last twenty years is preparing to become a videogame blockbuster for PC and for the already defunct Playstation.", "date": "2002-01-13", "grade": null}
