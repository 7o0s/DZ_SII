{"name": "Patapon - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/patapon-recensione.html", "text": "The pace of war In fact, in Patapon there are no colored and whistling balls nor relaxing and light-hearted game mechanics; on the contrary, the themes are rather crude and dark, since they revolve around the desire for revenge of a tribe - which gives its name to the game - against the bitter rivals Zigoton. The player is obviously required to control this small army, made up of cute but fierce stylized beings with a round body. Creatures all similar to each other but at the same time different, incredibly characterized and full of personality despite the small graphic dimensions; precisely for this reason a particular bond of empathy is created with one's own ~platoon~, such as to arouse a real feeling of unease in the event that some soldier falls in battle. Yes, because the main theme of Patapon are battles, however managed in an absolutely original way; the Japanese programmers have in fact decided to create a kind of mix between a real-time strategy game and a rhythm game, in which decisions and orders are in fact communicated through a sequence of 4 keys pressed in rhythm. The first levels of the more than 30 overall are basically used to introduce this very particular gameplay and to teach the player the various combinations, each associated with an action. You therefore start with the simple command that invites your army to advance, to then move on to attack, defense, dodge and charge. This as you get the drums, or the sounds related to the different front keys of the console; for example, the sound Pata is associated with the square, while the Pon is associated with the circle. To order the Patapon to move, it will therefore be necessary to press the sequence pata-pata-pata-pon. Rather easy in words, but not as easy in deeds, especially in the face of the need to follow the 4/4 rhythm with great attention, and at the same time keeping an eye on what is happening on the screen to decide countermoves and strategies. Furthermore, by inserting a handful of commands in series without missing the rhythm, it is possible to switch to ~Fever~ mode, during which your army will enjoy greater offensive and defensive potential. But the depth of Sony production certainly does not end here, since the strategic component also develops in the purely organizational phases that meet between one level and another. The small group of Patapon equipped with spears with which the adventure begins is in fact soon joined by archers, knights, infantry with lots of axes and so on, with different characteristics that marry more or less well in relation to the different levels and to the enemies present in them. Furthermore, the Patapon themselves can be equipped with weapons, armor and helmets capable of improving their statistics. Pon pon pata pon A key component of the game are materials, which can be obtained by eliminating animals, enemies or various bosses. It often becomes essential, in order to continue in the game, to be able to recover enough materials to improve one's army or create new soldiers. And this is where the main, if not the only flaw of Patapon comes in, namely the marked dose of backtracking required. Repeating internships already passed soon becomes not a classic ~extra~ for hardcore gamers, but a fundamental and essential aspect to continue the adventure. And although the possibility of more or less deepening of this aspect is also offered in this case, perhaps allowing you to repeat a battle with a boss dozens of times to earn an object of particular value, even those who are inclined to a more superficial approach to the game will have to come to terms with this obnoxious game design choice. Nonetheless, the game largely tries - with appreciable results - to make this aspect less oppressive, thanks to the variety with which it is possible to tackle the levels; not only, as already mentioned, by choosing different troops, but also by modifying the ~climatic~ conditions with the so-called miracles, or additional commands (the mini-games actually) with which to make it rain, change the direction of the wind or even invoke an earthquake. Despite everything, however, it is undeniable that Patapon is characterized by a rather slow and articulated progression. Furthermore, remaining within the scope of the defects, it must be taken into account that the need to issue each single command with a series of 4 keys (with the relative ~sung~ response of the creatures) can appear a bit tedious and irritating to someone, especially in the case in which you have to restart after an error. But frankly it would be really ungenerous to give too much weight to such shadows within the overall picture offered by Patapon; an original product, straoordinarily deep and demanding, very rewarding and equipped with an audiovisual component that oozes personality from every pore. Comment Patapon is not the game to buy if you are looking for a light, easy-going and relaxing product along the lines of Locoroco. On the contrary, Sony's production deserves the attention of every PSP owner inclined to try something new, original, challenging and rewarding. A product full of personality but still not without some flaws and characterized by a certain cumbersomeness and slowness in its progression. This is Patapon: the classic atypical game for many but not for all, destined to make a sensational entrance into the heart and head or to simply leave one indifferent. In any case, to try. Pros Technically splendid Original gameplay Very challenging and deep Cons Excessive backtracking A bit too slow and cumbersome for some", "date": "2008-03-21", "grade": null}
