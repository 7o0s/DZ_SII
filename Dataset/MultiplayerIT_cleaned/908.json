{"name": "Donkey Konga 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/donkey-konga-2_a.html", "text": "The rhythm of the jungle Donkey Konga 2, in the best tradition of musical sequels, does not introduce particular innovations or modify the game structure, basing its raison d'tre in the new series of songs available to users. For those unfamiliar with the Nintendo title, in a nutshell it is a question of beating the bongo-shaped device based on the signals indicated on the screen, which obviously follow the melodic track of the song. Hitting the right drum, left, both, or clapping represent various actions that can be performed in the game, in an attempt to make as few mistakes as possible to achieve a high score. Like any self-respecting title of the genre, also in the case of Donkey Konga the best results are obtained through the multiplayer modes, which allow up to 4 players to challenge each other simultaneously in sessions with absolutely hilarious effects. Everything seems to be fine... but then why is the final grade only an abundant sufficiency? The reasons are basically two. The first is the musical selection: although the Kyoto house has expanded the number of songs present in this second chapter, reaching well over 30 units, it is not an exaggeration to say that a good half of these have nothing to do with the tool we are called to use. The result is that in cases where there is not a sufficiently robust percussion track on which to overlap, the programmers have decided to use the sung part for this purpose, with a bizarre and certainly not exciting result in which the lyrics of the song are completely obscured by the shots made by the player. Paradoxically, the Latin music section, the most suitable for being accompanied by percussion, is also one of the most limited. To this it must be added that the enjoyment of the songs in general is undermined by the fact that they are not the original versions, but covers made by perfect strangers, in many cases with rather distant results from the artists they try to imitate. A good portion of the selected tracks are mostly decidedly old, and not belonging to a qualitative level capable of making them ~classics~: ~Don't Let Me Get Me~ by Pink, ~All Star~ by Smash Mouth and ~I'm A Slave 4 U by Britney Spears are melodies that we certainly didn't miss. I remembered you better Secondly, it is really difficult not to see how the game mechanics proposed by Donkey Konga has not aged well at all over the few months that have passed since the first episode. In fact, the surprise effect and the involvement dictated by a completely new peripheral have vanished, what we are faced with with this second chapter is a really weak product if played in single, soon repetitive and that does not find relief even in a tracklist worthy of the name. The extras available, to be unlocked through the coins won with one's performance in the main mode, fail to offer authentic added value, being on the contrary little more than a filler. Unfortunately, not even the slight changes included in the game structure are fully convincing, which can be summarized in a series of bonuses/penalties, slot machines and ~rock paper scissors~ (!!) duels that are part of the multiplayer challenges with the aim of varying the scores and giving uncertainty to the challenges. However, their importance within the overall economy turns out to be unbalanced, affecting too much in the final score and thus overturning games channeled even markedly in favor of a more skilled player. More frustrating and annoying than fun, we assure you. Even from a graphic point of view, the novelties are reduced to a flicker, and just as in the first chapter, the simplicity of the gameplay is accompanied by an equal technical simplicity that often leads to mere aesthetic poverty. Comment Donkey Konga 2 is one of those sequels that don't deserve to be called sequels. This second episode, released just a few months after the original, can in fact be cataloged without major problems within the data disk category, offering practically unchanged contents and effectively offering only a completely new tracklist. Unfortunately, this last aspect, which is fundamental to decree the success of a music game, turns out to be a serious weak point of the package packaged by Nintendo, with a selection of songs in many cases unsuitable, in others of simply mediocre artistic quality. Without its backbone, Donkey Konga 2 lays bare a prematurely aged game mechanic, which without the novelty effect of the first chapter finds reason to exist only in multiplayer mode. A purchase indeedque attractive only for those who have never dealt with the predecessor, or for those who really viscerally loved the ape's debut in the musical genre Pros: Immediate mechanics Fun in multiplayer Over 30 songs Cons: Boring in single player Insufficient tracklist Changes unconvincing mechanics What has just ended was undoubtedly the year of the monkey for Nintendo. We are not referring to the Chinese horoscope, but to the much better known Donkey Kong, which appeared in a large number of productions for both GC and GBA. Among these was Donkey Konga, Nintendo's debut in the rhythm game genre supported by the peculiarity of using an absolutely atypical and original instrument, the bongos. But you know, what is innovative the first time is hardly innovative the second time...", "date": "2005-06-22", "grade": null}
