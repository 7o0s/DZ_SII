Exactly as for Part 1, the title developed by EA Bright Light is presented to all intents and purposes as a Gears of War-style third person shooter, with Harry, Hermione and Ron engaged in an unspecified number of fights with magic wands against Voldemort's forces. The game follows the plot of the film faithfully, however emphasizing the action phases and placing them at the base of the gameplay. PC version The character we control, which varies according to the situation, can in fact lurk using any shelter present in the scenarios, and from there carry out their attacks towards increasingly numerous and cunning enemies. It goes without saying that the quantity and quality of the spells at our disposal plays a leading role in the game dynamics: at the beginning we can only resort to the Stupeficium spell, or a single shot of light that loses a lot of effectiveness from a distance and repeated until the opponent is defeated. The reticle that determines our aim tends to get bigger and lose precision as we ~shoot~, so the best tactic in clashes is that of short bursts. On some occasions, the Death Eaters in Voldemort's service will attack us from afar, and to shorten the distances we will necessarily have to expose ourselves and proceed quickly towards a shelter closer to the target. In such circumstances, we will be able to use the Protego spell in order not to suffer excessive damage: it is a shield that protects us from spells, even if for a few moments. Pampulu, pimpulu, parim pam pum! While Harry and his friends look for a way back to Hogwarts castle, crossing increasingly dangerous areas, the gameplay of the game remains fundamentally unchanged: we are often entrusted with the task of protecting a friend who may be trying to open a door, and therefore resist to the assault of a wave of enemies; on other occasions, the combat phases are subordinated to the achievement of certain zones of the scenario. The developers have therefore insisted on the shooter dynamics which, however, it must be admitted, appear well implemented and fairly fun, in particular thanks to the spells that we will gradually be able to add to our repertoire. PC version When the opponents in turn begin to use Protego, for example, to break their barrier we will have to resort to Expelliarmus, a very powerful bolt of lightning that can also be used simply to ~stun~ the enemies for a few moments, while maybe hitting them with Expulso , a magical burst of great effectiveness and precision. Our magic wand can even take the place of a sniper rifle, thanks to the Petrificus Totalus spell, ideal precisely for shots from a great distance. Our ~arsenal~ is completed by Confrigo, a slow but extraordinarily powerful shot, and Impedimenta, which basically works like a series of three homing missiles. To all these attacks is added, at the end, the ability to turn into fog to reach shelter faster. A very complete endowment, in short, which will not fail to exalt Harry Potter fans and at least allow those who resent the character to let off steam on the Death Eaters with an actually substantial number of different attacks. Turn and hope, hope and turn Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 boasts the same structure on both Wii and PC. Once you have completed the Story mode, you can try your hand at the Challenge mode and therefore replay all the levels in search of the best time. However, the biggest limitation of the EA Bright Light production lies in the duration: it took us less than three and a half hours to complete the game. There are some situations that are more demanding than average, especially in the second part of the adventure (we don't want to reveal anything, but trust us: there are rather complicated and very engaging phases), but the balance of difficulty clearly aims at casual users and/or to younger gamers, although the genre of membership of this tie-in may suggest something different. Wii version The gameplay varies according to the control system used: on the Nintendo console, the infrared pointer of the Wii-mote ensures excellent precision and perhaps makes things even easier, while the use of the d-pad to select the various spells on the first resultsThis is quite cumbersome as a solution, and needs to be well ~digested~ before producing good results. Playing with the Xbox 360 controller, the situation changes considerably, because the aim must be adjusted via the analog stick and therefore the ~firefights~ can last much longer. The game boasts an excellent sound sector, given that the music is that of the film and the Italian dubbing was done by professional actors. The voices are not the same as we will find in the cinema, but it is clear that there is a good direction behind it (for once!). The voice actor of Harry Potter, for example, can make you turn up your nose at first because he has a decidedly more adult voice than the one we are used to associating with the character, but the interpretation is more than good, even with some peaks of intensity which are rare to find in Italian localizations of video games. Therefore, ~inconsistencies~ are welcome if this is the final result, and congratulations to the distributor for taking care of this aspect of production. Moving on to the graphics, the two versions we tested are inevitably very different. On PC, the game can count on high resolution, good textures, well-detailed models, a good polygonal count and excellent light effects, which make some spells very spectacular when cast in dark scenarios. The Wii version, on the other hand, has to make do with far fewer polygons, modest special effects and low (if not very low) resolution textures.", "date": "2011-07-18", "grade": "6.0"}
