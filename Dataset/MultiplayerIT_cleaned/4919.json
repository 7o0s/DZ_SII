Released on PlayStation 4, PC on Steam and Xbox One, De-formers has three main game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Form Ball and it is possible to play up to 4 players on the same platform in split screen and up to 8 players online . Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch are two identical modes that differ only in being played by 8 players 'all against all', in the first, and in teams 'four against four', in the second; in this type of game you have to score more points than your opponents to win. Form Ball, on the other hand, is a mode that is very reminiscent of Rocket League and in which, divided into teams of four, you have to throw a huge soccer ball into the opponent's goal and score as many goals as possible. There isn't much else to say, the game makes simplicity and immediacy its strong point and, in our opinion, its weakness, given that from the very first game of Death Match you will have the sensation of being inside of a visually very clean and colorful game but, at the same time, also extremely chaotic and difficult to master, completely lacking any form of tutorial or solo mode against artificial intelligence. There are some tutorial movies distributed by Ready at Dawn itself but they are not accessible from within the game and you have to search for them yourself. Furthermore, the price of  39.90 for a game that does not offer more than what is described seems really excessive to us especially considering that, although with the coins that are earned by leveling up it is possible to buy both accessories and over 40 skins for customize our jellies (there are some really fantastic ones), to have them immediately you will have to open your wallet again and take advantage of the micro-transaction system with real money. De-formers is a fun game of arena brawling between jellies but suffers from a rushed release Class de-formation The Deathmatch, both in teams and all against all, catapults you into one of the eight arenas present and, before starting the actual game, allows you to choose the aspect, which allows you to use one of the purchased skins, and the class to which it belongs. There are five classes that diversify your gelatinous counterpart: the Guardian, the Striker, the Ranger, the Marksman and the Speedster and it is possible to guess (remember that there are no tutorials in the game) their role and the difficulty of use only in 30 seconds before the start of the game, quickly observing the summary diagram. The stars indicate the difficulty of using the class, while a small pentagon graph, at the tips of which there are the characteristics of Agility, Shoot, Health, Ram and Size (actually the game is localized in Italian but some parts, like features, mysteriously lacking in translation), helps you better understand the differences between the various classes. Before going into detail, it should be noted that there are various ways to take out your opponents: you can shoot them with the various projectiles (called Tribs and also rubbery) scattered throughout the game arena and can be found by destroying the many objects present , charge them as if you were a battering ram and lift them off the ground to launch them into the void, as each arena floats in the air. You can also defend yourself by transforming into a large cube for a short period of time and thus become immune to charges and projectiles, or wriggle free once you are the victim of an opponent's lift. Returning specifically to the classes, the Ranger is the base, the easiest to use and which, while not excelling in any of the skills, allows you to do a little bit of everything and is therefore suitable for new players. The Marksman is the class that has the highest rate of fire; the Striker has a higher charge and thrust power than the others; the Guardian excels at defense with a higher life total while also being easier to hit due to the larger size, and the Speedster is blazingly fast. Deformed physics Within the game arenas and only in the Deathmatch mode, various power ups appear which give advantages to the jelly or his team: the Magnet, for example, allows you to absorb the Tribs from a greater distance, or there are bombs which they stick to objects, opponents or those that explode after making a couple of bounces (the Rimbalzelle, even if it seems the name of a precotto to be cooked in a pan!). Explosion detonates the area around you, while the Aura activates a circular surface within which it is possible to heal your life bar, indicated at the bottom left of the screen, and that of your allies. Meteor and Torpedo are powerful hits aimed at an area of the map, Fury temporarily empowers you by turning you into a large and violent jelly, and Concealment allows you to become invisible for a limited time. If the power ups present are not enough for you, random Disasters also occur during the Deathmatch such as Spin and Tilt which respectively make the game map turn and tilt, Rise which makes it bounce up and down or Gravity which changes the gravity and makes you float towards the direction in which your thrust was applied at the moment in which this event is activated (therefore also upwards causing an inevitable death), finally, Grumo could arrive, a destructive giant life form that rolls killing everything that stands in front of him. The Form Ball is quite another thing: forget all the power ups or disastrous events to enter the Ancient Arena, the only map, for now, suitable for this mode and from which it is not possible to fall since it is made in such a way as to have walls all around you and two doors complete with a net inside which you will have to bag the mega ball that arrives in the center of the field at the beginning of the match and after each goal. In Form Ball, destroying the opponent by shooting or charging him raises your score but above all has the ultimate goal of not letting him score or taking him out of the boxes when he counters you during an attacking action. Playstation 4 trophies The De-formers trophies are linked to both level advancement and the number of kills made in any mode, moreover, there are also many related to the Form Ball mode such as the number of goals, assists and saves made in the match . Professional deformation Let's start with some sore points: the game controls are not configurable (apart from the inversion of the Y axis for the camera) and, although the Playstation 4 pad does its job very well, it is a bit wooden in managing the camera and viewfinder to shoot (which move at a speed that cannot be changed with the right analog stick), moreover, it is not possible in any way to adjust the distance of the camera from the gel. This last element is particularly annoying and adds even more confusion in the presence of arches or hills behind you; however, it is in the Form Ball that it has the most glaring problems, even going so far as to lose polygons when rolling on the edge of the wall and trying to move the camera. Graphically, as anticipated, it is very clean and colorful and the many skins are the distinctive feature of De-formers: they range from animals to food (those of the piece of sushi and pancakes are brilliant), unfortunately, however, apart from four aspects available from immediately, both the skins and the accessories such as hats, glasses, backpacks, special sound effects and graffiti for the landscape (Overwatch-like) are paid, unless you want to play a lot to get the silver coins useful for buying them . Furthermore, the latter are not the only exchange currency of De-formers: for the skins there is another type of currency, namely the filaments that are obtained only by advancing in level or by paying with real money and which can be exchanged in silver coins. It could be said that it is precisely the price that constitutes the real problem of De-formers and, having not had a boom in sales, the complaints of the community are flocking both on PlayStation4 and on Steam for PC due to games that are slow to start or starting with fewer players than expected, not to mention the very frequent game crashes that force you to restart the application. Paradoxically, a real applause goes to the music sector with truly spectacular tracks that skilfully use violins, banjos, harmonica and guitars and are well diversified between the game maps (one could say that they have spared no expense for the sound sector). De-formers is potentially a good game and the inclusion of seasons and a competitive leaderboard (not yet active) only increases this potential but, even if Ready at Dawn will fix all current problems with future patches, the feeling it is that of a hasty release which, at the moment, is absolutely not doing it justice.", "date": "2017-04-24", "grade": "7.0"}
