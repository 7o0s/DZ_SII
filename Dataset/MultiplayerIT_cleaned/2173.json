{"name": "Star Wars Racer Revenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-racer-revenge_a.html", "text": "The return of SW Racer<br> Characters and story Racer Revenge begins a few years after the development of the first historic racing game admired by all in Episode I (if you haven't seen it, what are you reading this review for?). Anakin has grown and echoes the character we will soon see in theaters in Attack of the Droids. Sebulba also returns to the scene, eager for revenge for the setback he suffered and retired from the scene for some time. A dozen other characters represent the various alien races that you can select to try your hand at timed races or in the challenging Intergalactic Championship. Participating in races allows you to accumulate credits thanks to placing on the podium or by eliminating your opponents. The credits will be needed to improve your pod and hope to proceed in the categories (three in all). This is not a very original setting but it works well and is enhanced by the possibility of returning components to have more money with which to enhance a different characteristic (manoeuvrability, acceleration, shields, etc.) which could be more functional than others for the next track. In fact, this way you can completely reconfigure the pod before each race, let's say in bland F1 style. By advancing in the categories you will access some pilots locked at the beginning of the game. Although the manual places emphasis on the character and rivalries of the available characters, you can't really notice any differences in behavior between them during the race, if only for the fact that you are going too fast and have to pay too much attention to the obstacles to distinguish one opponent from another. Overall the Star Wars environment is recreated with some effectiveness, but in several planets the feeling of a lack of inspiration in the design remains... The return of SW Racer<br> The SWRR graphics are a show on and off: sometimes exciting, sometimes disappointing. Some settings are made with care and inspiration, especially when it comes to sunny desert expanses, but the industrial structures and underwater cities are too gloomy and monotonous. As if to say, the intention is good but the eye of the artist is missing. Even when the game tries to impress with special effects the target is narrowly missed. An example for all is the rain of the track in the forest, which is distributed on the television. The result is realistic, but anyone who has played MotoGP 2 can't help but remember how the same affection has already been produced much more effectively by Namco programmers. The feeling of depth is good, but you won't pay much attention to it because the screen is often invaded by obstacles to avoid and the frenzy will always accompany you. The design of the edges of the slopes is very disturbing: although there are often open environments where you can move or even make u-turns, in the bottlenecks you will find that just touching the edge of the track is equivalent to a collision with an invisible wall, with immediate slowdown and waste of time. In this case Wipeout is certainly much more elegant. The return of SW Racer<br> SWRR animation runs at 30 fps. It was said in the preview that this would have been a precise choice of the programmers. In my opinion, the result is effective, because the technical compromise made it possible to avoid the use of most of the expedients that usually serve to hide the inaccuracies of the horizon: no fogging out of place and bad clipping reduced to a minimum (in fact I happened to notice it, but not more than a couple of times after many sessions of play). The pods and characters are highlighted by the different shots, but apart from an effective light / energy effect that connects the rotors and the animation of the flags there is not much to note. In conclusion, a good job, which could be enriched. The Sound As soon as the Star Wars refrain over the slide-out titles kicks in, I know you're going to get a jolt of excitement! However, a soundtrack is not enough to make a video game memorable, or rather not a soundtrack already known as in this case. So let's see what Lucas' boys proposed, distinguishing between sound effects and accompanying music. First of all the sound of the pods: slightly differentiated, they follow the effects of the film and are very pleasant and realistic (at least I think since I've never seen a live pod). The various drivers will accompany their overtaking with a series of incomprehensible gutturations in their native language, usually amusing and in any case useful to increase the confusion. In the event of an accident, however, you will hear ~very human~ heartbreaking screams! The race is accompanied by the commentaryor Italian of the bit-headed speaker we saw in the film. These are not particularly rich or fitting interventions, but we are used to even worse (see Pro Evolution). Playability and control system Once you've straddled your pod, there are two ways to drive it: the traditional one makes you use the left stick to steer and the keys to accelerate or brake. In this case it is not possible to perform sudden braking of a single rotor to face the hairpin bends to the limit, as instead happens in Wipeout Fusion. Anyone who played the Psygnosys/Studio Liverpool masterpiece will be immediately frustrated by this shortcoming. The second driving method, which we would define as pro, is very interesting, involving the use of both sticks to drive the two rotors separately. The possibilities are multiplied and control is greatly enriched. The problem is that this system is very complicated to master and I'm sure you'll soon give up trying, because the effort/gain ratio is very poor. The experience during the races is rewarding if you are looking for a wild ride without too much strategy. It's fun at first, but never fully exhilarating. Overall, the player's involvement depends a lot on his passion for the Lucas saga: entering a SW scene is the dream of many, but once you try it, it's done, and repeating the experience a second time will not have the same taste. Longevity SWRR is not a difficult game. At the end of the first category you will begin to fight against your opponents viciously, but you will soon be right thanks to the improvement of your half wheel. There really aren't many incentives to replay the circuits to get better medals where you still lack gold, nor can I say that I find the idea of beating the current destruction record exciting... In short, the single player game will run out soon, let's say in three/four Sunday sessions, and then if you want to dust off this title you will have to involve a friend in split screen. In that case the challenge improves, being able to count on the ~virtual~ elimination of the opponent. My belief is that you both have to be big Lucas fans anyway, otherwise you'll divert your energies to GT3 or Wipeout Fusion. Conclusion: Why Wipeout is better? While not boasting clearly higher top speeds, Wipeout returns a better racing sensation thanks to more varied and inspired tracks, a much more credible surrounding scenography and above all the presence of weapons. I don't feel like definitively rejecting Lucas' creation, but certainly futuristic racing enthusiasts still have to wait for the throne to fall... and they've been waiting for six years now!Lucas official website https://www.lucasarts.com/products /racerrevenge/ The return of SW Racer<br> Put on your helmet, connect the cooling system, turn on the injectors... you are about to face the fastest and most destructive race of your life! You are sitting on an inert and vulnerable pod, ready to unload the thousand megaton power of the two large rotors that are there in front of you, almost blocking the view, and which will carry you away at breakneck speed!
