The SEGA and Creative Assembly work was a bolt from the blue for the tie-in ecosystem, finally capable of positioning another leading exponent in that small group of successful videogame adaptations from films. The curious thing, in the examination, is that Switch, apart from a few indies that have become famous, does not abound in triple A survival horror titles, therefore SEGA took a while but in the end - convinced by the numbers and by the proximity to the holidays - it was determined to complete the offer. Years later, Alien: Isolation remains a very convincing work, structured and intelligently presented, coherent and full of details, references, quotes, cross-references as well as a playful stealth scaffolding that holds up very well to the advance of the market. After spending some time roaming the corridors and rooms, it is difficult to point to Isolation as a cross-generational title: there is much more next-gen influence than what (at the time) was the current gen, or seventh generation. Xenon everywhere Maybe you've already played it, maybe not: the incarnation of Alien on Switch resumes the basic offer, obviously adding all the extras released such as DLC, the implementation of HD Rumble and joy-con motion control, the possibility to play on the go with headphones and the wonderful console stand-by experience. Isolation managed to create a sensational and unexpected rebound from the bottom reached by the disastrous Colonial Marines, bringing an Alien-based videogame experience to the absolute peak. The exceptional work of the Creative Assembly guys juggles today as then: narrative, gameplay, play structure, longevity and charm of the experience are strong characteristics of the title, expression of a game design studied to perfection that does not bore but pushes forward in a mix of terror and curiosity. The concept of isolation, apart from a few small moments of apparent conviviality, is the cornerstone of the experience that manages to juggle well on Switch, especially by equipping itself with a good pair of headphones. We know we are monotonous but we want to stress the portability element again: although not with the impact of other ports before this one, being able to carry a recent triple A title in the backpack continues to represent an incredible added value. It is not a determining factor, it is more a certainty that gladdens the purchase: the nuance is halfway between providing the possibility of playing Alien: Isolation at any time and the pleasure of actually doing it, an option that until today it was simply non-existent. The consequence is simple: the static nature of videogames on the couch, often associated with a type of approach that is essential for important titles, collapses when faced with the convenience of being able to do both that and play perfectly on the go, taking advantage of the painstaking work of the Feral Interactive team, already authors of the excellent port of Grid Autosport. Beautiful even in a small way Here we come to the fulcrum of this review: Isolation is splendid to look at and to play in portability thanks to an almost always granite framerate hand in hand with a technical aspect which, net of a few elements from expert eyes, remains very pleasant and artistically very rich. The original work is then transposed with absolute dignity, enriched with all the additional contents, perfect to play even in docked, still capable of electrifying on the move all those who for one reason or another had not yet managed to get the hang of it. hands. Alien: Isolation remains a fascinating setting, cold, non-linear, distressing and capable of drawing a furrow with the past while remaining respectful of the enormous legacy thanks to tons of clever quotes. There remain flaws related to the artificial intelligence, evidently not corrected over the years: if the Xenomorph still shines for anxiety and anguish constantly injected into the player, the rest of the enemy supporting characters do not shine in the same way, but perhaps it is a deliberate choice to still stress more emphasis on him, the alien, the true protagonist of the whole experience and for this reason the only believable, terrifying beating brain, constantly lurking and ready to send us to the other world. This is not the first survival horror experience on Switch but it is certainly the most substantial and with the most decisive production value, perfectly recreated between the refractions, the play of light and shadows, the modeling of the alien and the injection of audio effects at draw a terrifying but rewarding journey, even more enhanced by being able to take it for a walk.", "date": "2019-12-11", "grade": "8.0"}
