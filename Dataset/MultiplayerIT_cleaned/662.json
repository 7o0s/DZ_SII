{"name": "World Racing 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-racing-2-recensione.html", "text": "The harsh law of the road Having exhausted the routine tests to demonstrate to the world that you are able to bring 200 horses like worn herdsmen even at breakneck speed, with an all in all acceptable risk, you will immediately be catapulted into Career Mode, the heart of what we could consider the first part of the game and which also acts as a filter to access the second. Things are very simple: in this mode you will be assigned missions, which can also be made up of several consecutive tests and for each of them the game will offer you which cars to choose from among which to choose your vehicle of competition. The most interesting thing is that it's not just about racing like desperate people towards the finish line, because World Racing 2 offers different modes and numerous requirements necessary to be able to complete a stage. In some cases you will also have to pass through certain checkpoints scattered along the track, accumulating a certain number of points for drifting or for having maintained a speed peak within the time imposed by the regulation. There are also CPU-controlled one-car head-to-head races and time-tested races where damage must be kept below a minimum. All this while road traffic rages around you or the adverse conditions dictated by the terrains that change according to the geographical location of the circuit. The great advantage of this choice is that of offering over 120 races trying to break the monotony that a basically arcade driving game ends up imposing, and in this World Racing 2 it succeeds only halfway: in fact, despite the proposed variants, the driving is linear and the cars drive easily even at high speed, so there is no real challenge that forces you to race with your heart pounding, giving the best of yourself. On the other hand, the speedbucks come to our rescue, the hard cash that you will earn depending on your performance and which will allow you to unlock circuits and racing cars that significantly increase the longevity of the game. Well yes, many efforts will not only allow you to unlock new missions, but based on certain conditions, such as performing stunts on two wheels or drifting, you will get prizes in the currency of World Racing 2. This is a more subtle system than as it seems, because although performance in terms of driving, whether daring overtaking or time-limited finish lines are naturally rewarded, every collision with other cars or the choice to use the many shortcuts will deduct money from the final prize pool. The ratio leans in favor of mistakes, so it's very easy to end a race without a penny in your pocket. On the other hand, World Racing 2 is still a game of medium difficulty, so let's see immediately how to squander the nest egg so illegally earned. PC hardware All you need to run World Racing 2 is an Athlon XP 1800+ or a Pentium 4 1.8 GHz, with a 64 Mb AGP card and 256 MB of RAM. However, it is a game that pays off only if you can fully enjoy the graphics combined with high speed without loss of performance. We tested it with an Athlon 64 3000+ and a 128MB GeForce 6600 GT card with 1GB of RAM. With this configuration, the performance turned out to be ideal at a resolution of 1024x768. Turnkey with zero interest Here we are at the right time to take out the checkbook, because World Racing 2 offers what we can consider a second part of the game, full of gameplay and functional for multiplayer, which is called Free Ride and which can only be accessed by swiping speedbucks. In practice, it is a question of unlocking new tracks by paying them with the earnings of the Career mode, but above all new cars, which you can use both for Free Ride races and in multiplayer against the opponents you decide to face on the net. This mode offers the pleasure of adjusting every parameter of the circuit, choosing the victory conditions and the number of opponents, who will however have to compete with cars that are the same or compatible with the one you have chosen. A vast dealership will allow you to access a series of vehicles ranging from prototypes to vintage cars, to be repainted or enriched with colored stickers as you like (and here more money flies out of your wallet). Don't think it's a minor extra; in fact, it will provide you with the raw material to be able to fully appreciate the online mode and above all it will give you the opportunity to try your hand at unique game options such as the KO, where the slowest is eliminated at each lap of the track, up to the last with only two cars contending for the podium. There is therefore a lot of irons cooking in the firepot of World Racing 2, but what's really addictive about a game like this? Probably the thrill of seeing hard-earned money go up in smoke with every impact, in a blaze of broken metal and glass, so let's not hesitate any longer and enjoy the show in the next paragraph. The trial of the moose To appreciate a high-level damage system it is necessary that the entire graphics sector is up to the situation and World Racing 2 sells well behind the showcase. The models are cared for and equipped with numerous parameters that regulate the physics of movement. We have directly tested under our tires that the cars are affected by the terrain on which they run, with graphic devices such as the persistence of the damage caused to the surrounding environment for the entire duration of the race, whether it is shards and remains of cars or actual elements of the landscape defaced by unconscious pilots. It is even possible to wash the dirt off the car by splashing at full speed on a puddle of water. They are of course details, but those that make a player smile who has sweated over the game's packaging. As far as real cars are concerned, the system that regulates their gradual destruction is a feast for the eyes: paint and scratches on the doors, hanging mirrors, semi-broken glass and following the loss of one piece after another until you see the hull that breaks in two. The whole thing is absolutely superb even if it is unrealistic, since even in appalling conditions you can drag yourself to a gas station to get the car back on track. The scenery adds beauty and color to the game, thanks to the reflections on the cars and the landscape elements of some of the most beautiful destinations in the world, and yes, there is also Italy; we are not talking about peaks never reached before, but about a solid and pleasant graphic sector. Cross-platform The dispute between the PC and Xbox versions is not so much in terms of performance, since World Racing 2 makes a good show of itself on both platforms, but rather in the direct competition of similar titles. If you own a PC and want an immediate and fun driving game then the Playlogic title can become a good choice, while for Xbox users there are several superior alternatives to this World Racing 2. Unless you haven't already tried them all. World Racing 2 is a nice driving game, immediate, fast and above all equipped with a spectacular damage system. There are many beautiful cars and numerous game options, but it is still an arcade racing title without any real innovations, which could entertain you for hours without losing your mind. There are many series of titles dedicated to four wheels and in particular the console market offers some must-haves for enthusiasts and laymen of the genre. It therefore remains to be seen if you have already experienced the best and still have a thirst for arcade, in which case you will find in World Racing 2 a solid and satisfying title. Pros Damage to exciting cars Lots of cars and numerous game variations... Cons ...but all revolving around the same idea The real challenge is missing Seats too comfortable All right, so far there hasn't been much talk about defects, but something afflicts World Racing 2, even if it's not some serious shortcoming, but a generalized feeling that will pervade you after a few hours of driving. In spite of its variants, in fact, it lacks tension, bite, the driving is very simple and even if the opponents become more and more difficult, you will find yourself watching yourself as you proceed without too many jolts one track after another. It's not easy to have innovative ideas in a genre like this, but also considering the very strong competition, World Racing 2 ends up struggling to find its own vital space that really makes it stand out among the many arcade driving titles. However, it remains a game that offers hours of honest entertainment and strives to compensate for the shortcomings with lots of content to keep the player's interest alive. Too bad for the bad music and the unnerving configuration of the controls, which could get on the nerves of more than one player. One more reason to strongly advise you to opt for the joyoad if you are playing it on PC. Around the world in 90 cars The Playlogic guys seem to have treasured the teachings that the public has imparted to them with the cold welcome given to the old Mercedes-Benz World Racing, which has now been on store shelves for two years, and worthily replaced by a shiny and attractive World Racing 2 A substantial difference can already be guessed from the name, because the new game dedicated to crazy racing around the world boasts a fleet that reachesg and 90 models, faithfully reproduced from the price lists of over 17 car manufacturers. There are clearly also Alfa Romeo and Volkswagen, perhaps closer to users' garages than some racing cars. Let's say right away that Wolrd Racing 2 does not compete for the constructors' championship and although the cars are customizable, they are only aesthetic finishes that have no weight in terms of performance, but hold on tight because if on the one hand we cannot mount too many new parts on the other hand we will instead have the pleasure of seeing our car fall apart one crash after another, in a crescendo of graphic effects that will end up reducing the model to a tragic mass of metal. Needless to say, this gives us a primitive joy dutifully denied by Gran Turismo. It is therefore clear that the feeling of World Racing 2 lies in the speed and adrenaline of races held on tracks taken from the most disparate environments around the globe, where you run on a razor's edge if you aim for first place. We will see how this happens immediately after obtaining the driving licence.", "date": "2005-12-29", "grade": null}
