This is the case of Transistor, an action RPG developed by the guys from Supergiant Games, the same ones from Bastion, and landed on the AppStore and just over a year after its launch on PC and PlayStation 4. At the time, Sony also gave a show of trust towards rather small teams that outside the canons and rules of big-budget projects manage more easily to throw themselves onto unbeaten paths to give maximum vent to their creative impulse. Although the title showed a few too many shadows especially on the gameplay front, the artistic sector had enough to globally raise the production both in the eyes of critics and the public, who welcomed Transistor with positive opinions. With the game practically done, the challenge for the developers to bring their little gem to iOS was certainly to set up a control system that was well suited to the touch screen and to the much smaller displays than those of large, comfortably positioned televisions in the living room. Transistor arrives on iOS devices with excellent conversion, giving its best on the iPad Back to Cloudbank In summary, for those approaching the title for the first time, in Transistor we impersonate Red, a famous singer from the Goldwalk district who, following an ambush that took place in the evening after one of her shows, loses her voice, but manages to escape death thanks to the sacrifice of a dear friend pierced by a sword. This one, named Transistor, has the power to imprison the soul of a dead person allowing Red to take his friend with him, however becoming the target of the Orchestral group who try anything to snatch it from the protagonist to use it for own shady purposes. Red's is a story of revenge, seasoned with romanticism and political intrigue, decidedly fascinating but not fully successful, above all due to insufficiently detailed protagonists and an underlying linearity that leaves no room for sensational twists. In a very similar way to the main version, by advancing in level or meeting specific secondary characters, Transistor acquires new functions to be used during clashes: these can be used as primary skills to attack enemies or as passives to be combined with the previous ones to increase their power. effectiveness or trigger secondary effects. In terms of gameplay, the adaptation work for the mobile version is partly successful, undermined only by the width of the screens of the various Apple devices which in part influence their actual usability. Red's movements and interactions with the environment are managed through the touch on the screen of the place you want to reach or of the point of interest to which specific contextual actions are linked, while for combat the strategic inclination of the Supergiant Games title. The four primary skills are displayed on the right side of the screen conveniently a tap away, and can be used directly on enemies or chained during attack rounds. Combat is in fact one of the strong points of Transistor because it alternates isometric battles in real time with turn-based planning phases where it is possible to focus better on strategy and sequence a series of moves more calmly, making the most of the synergies between shots . In the first case, after activating the desired skill, just touch the target enemy on the screen to see Red head towards him and sink the blow as soon as he arrives within shooting range, while in the second case, just next to the skill icons there is the one for stop time and plan your turn of attack. Everything works very well, the controls are fluid, precise even with many enemies on the screen and Red's reactivity is valuable, but as mentioned at the beginning, everything suffers terribly from the width of the screen on which Transistor is used. Red is always beautiful Since the iOS version is common to both iPhone and iPad, it goes without saying that playing it on the 4-inch Apple smartphone is inevitably more chaotic than enjoying it in the 9.7~ size of an iPad Air. It is more a question of the available space, where in the first case the skill icons are all too close to each other and it is easy to make a mistake by selecting one attack instead of another, especially in the most agitated phases. most advanced of the title, where we will find ourselves facing many enemies on schermo, it happens all too often to make a mistake in selecting the target, forcing the player to almost always fall back on turn-based combat. On PC and PlayStation 4 planning was used above all against the most difficult opponents, but in this case abusing it ends up excessively slowing down the flow of game action in a perpetual alternation between the planned attack and running away waiting for the bar recharges fully in order to initiate the next attack. On the iPad the situation is diametrically opposite and the larger display inches allow more accurate and intuitive management even during the most crowded and frenetic battles, but presumably the improvement can already be perceived from the use of an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. beyond the limits of the control system, on Apple platforms Transistor maintains all its beauty unaltered supported by the undoubted quality of the Retina display. The bright colors, the beautiful backgrounds and the effects benefit from the pixel density, returning a clean and detailed image. The artistic peaks are accompanied by an equally deserving soundtrack that gives its best with a good pair of headphones, decidedly preferable to Apple speakers for clarity and depth. The dubbing always remains in English, with subtitles and menus completely translated into Italian. In terms of longevity Transistor doesn't last very long, it took us a good four hours to complete it, but in this sense we appreciated the possibility of picking up the adventure exactly where we left off, going from iPhone to iPad without any problems in transfers progress and saves.", "date": "2015-06-22", "grade": "8.0"}
