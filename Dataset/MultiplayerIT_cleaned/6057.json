{"name": "Atto di Forza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155683-forza-motorsport-6-atto-di-forza.html", "text": "Launched in 2005 with the express aim of establishing itself as the ~Gran Turismo~ on Xbox and of course to compete closely with the very strong PlayStation brand, the Forza Motorsport series has been accompanied by a constant process of evolution and maturation, catalysed by the formidable talent of the Turn 10 and from the visceral passion for the world of engines of its spiritual guide, the creative director Dan Greenawalt. However, this long chain of successes suffered an unexpected setback in 2013, with the debut of the fifth iteration on the current Microsoft flagship. Although it was a very good job from a technical and playful point of view, thanks to the usual and excellent production values, Forza Motorsport 5 mainly sinned in the calculation of the contents, as well as proposing some unfortunate solutions in the management of credits over which the specter of microtransactions hovered. Over time these aspects have been revised, expanded and refined, making the current product undoubtedly better than the originally published code, nevertheless those spots have still partially scratched the crystalline reputation of the series. A little less than two years after the launch of the controversial chapter, Turn 10 is ready to redeem itself with Forza Motorsport 6, announced with great fanfare on January 12, 2015 during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit and promoted as the most beautiful and complete episode of the saga. Will it be like this? With Forza Motorsport 6, Turn 10 sends the controversies related to the launch of the fifth chapter to the attic With open cards If you have tested the demo (if not, fix it, you will have the wonderful Ford GT 2017 in the full title as a gift) you already know what to expect from the very first steps in the new chapter of Forza Motorsport, given that the demo version, with the exception of a couple of changes , represents exactly the introduction of the career, where you will find the live-action trailer, the parade on the streets of Rio de Janeiro, three qualifying races and the first exhibition on the Indianapolis oval. The main menu, dominated by a delicate blue color, is unequivocally inspired by the Xbox One dashboard, with the numerous items set in squares and rectangles which are in turn organized into six distinct pages. In the Home we find access to the Career, the Message Center, the Forza Hub App and the so-called Prize Throws, a legacy of the Forza Horizon 2 Wheelspin that is activated for each new level of experience reached; in Go to the Race there is an overview of the main multiplayer and single player modes, while Cars, Tuning, Customize and Options offer almost total management of all the features of Forza Motorsport 6, from buying cars to upgrading them, passing through for the acclaimed paint editor up to the spectacular Forzavista mode. Before launching into the analysis of the Career mode, it is necessary to mention the number of contents, given that the latter were the main fruit of the discord in Forza Motorsport 5. The over 450 cars available and, above all, the twenty-six settings, for a total of ninety configurations of tracks, represent a significant step forward compared to the recent past, whose greatest benefits are felt right within the main mode, given that in the fifth chapter it was ~plastered~ due to the cyclical reproposition of the (few ) loops and no sense of progression for the totally open infrastructure. Responding to the requests of the community, Turn 10 has returned to a more classic subdivision by power groups, organizing the climb to glory in five main volumes, namely Superstreet, Sporting Icons, Grand Touring, Pro Racing and Extreme Motorsports, to be unlocked in sequence starting with the most common car categories. To move on to the next volume it is necessary to face competitions grouped into series, where it is possible to compete with different categories of cars but always within the power range envisaged by the volume. In Superstreet, for example, we find special Hatchbacks such as the Punto Abarth and the Vauxhall Astra and the ~Heroes of the day of the rally~, with the ever-present Subaru Impreza and Mitsubishi Lancer setting the tone. In the ~Motorsport Stories~ section, which also displays the percentage of completion of the game, you can go back to each previously unlocked series and try to beat it with a different category of cars. Career progression is sometimes accompanied by invitations to so-called Exhibitions, competitions included in a support section full of exciting proposals. They range from trackdays with overtaking to Endurance racing, passing through re-enactments with historical modelsup to the nice Top Gear entertainment, such as bowling and challenges with the Hot rods, but also the very close duels with the ~digital cousin~ of the famous Stig. Speaking of Top Gear, among the many commentators accompanying Forza Motorsport 6 we find both Richard Hammond and James May, however the histrionic Jeremy Clarckson is missing due to the infamous dismissal from the BBC program. One of the most curious novelties of the new career lies in the so-called Modifications, the perks we have already mentioned in the demo test. These are basically cards which, purchasable in packages of increasing prestige, allow you to earn additional credits and get some advantage in the race. Team cards refer to your team of technicians and can offer, for example, better brake performance or car grip. They should be read as the classic ~stroke of genius~ of the engineer on duty who manages to get the best out of the vehicle during the setup. The Azzardo ones are the most curious, since they force the player to submit to some settings - such as the blocking of the internal view or the absence of electronic aids - but they increase the earnings in case of victory, representing an excellent expedient for experienced pilots . Finally, the Enhancement cards allow you to win more credits by performing specific maneuvers in the race like perfect curves and trails, or perhaps they can give you an advantage on the starting grid. You can equip up to three cards at the same time, some of which are extremely rare to find. On the whole, it is a nice and interesting novelty, completely optional and which in no way undermines the balance of the career. Another feature of Forza Motorsport 6 lies in the absence of medals, which in the previous chapter were distributed in a curious way, with gold awarded to the first three positions in the standings and bronze up to tenth place. In the last effort Turn 10 to move on to the next challenge of the series it is essential to always hit the first three positions. In addition to the solid main mode we find the classic Rivals Mode, with hundreds of events to play against the ghosts of other players, Free Game, where you can try any car and track with a plethora of settings, the very rich Multiplayer sector (even for two players at split screen) and Leagues. These work like FIFA Online Seasons and Killer Instinct Leagues, with a rewarding promotion system. In this specific mode you compete with collisions deactivated so as not to compromise your own performance and that of others with the counters. Having ascertained the vastness of the contents and the playful offer, the next step is to immerse ourselves in the most important aspect of the production, or rather the gameplay, which we have put to the test both with the joypad and with our trusty Thrustmaster TX Ferrari 458 Italia Edition. Power overtaking After having tested a good number of cars, we can only confirm the goodness of the renewed physical-dynamic model, capable of expressing a significant leap forward compared to the very valid one of the previous chapter. Beyond the weight of the vehicles rendered more effectively, it is the contact between the tires and the asphalt that transforms the gameplay of Forza Mortsport 6 into pure videogame poetry, which, although not driven by the sophisticated algorithms of a pure simulation, returns to the pilot virtual thrills and fun at every turn. The keystone lies in the splendid management of the counter-steering, so fluid, precise and elegant as to make all the sim-arcade released on the market pale. Not only. During the test with the demo version we had only appreciated some slight improvements in the Force Feedback support, still too lax to be equated to the vigorous one of the PC titles, however after having tested several cars we must underline that for at least some of them, probably due of the rigid setup, the result achieved is almost perfect. As examples we can cite the Vauxhall (the British Opel) Corsa, the Ford Focus RS and the splendid BMW M235i: with these cars the effect is so powerful and sudden that touching the curbs you risk being literally thrown from your steering wheel. If the physical model is solid and exciting racing under the sun, something unexpected and wonderful happens with the rain: Forza Motorsport 6 bypasses the concept of sim-arcade for an instant, offering the virtual driver the most realistic and satisfying wet track experience ever experienced in a racing game. Unfortunately, the yardstick with one of the titles that makes you happy is missingriding its workhorse, i.e. the very Italian Assetto Corsa, but the result obtained by Turn 10 with the aquaplaning effect and contact with puddles of water is simply sublime, especially with an ad hoc peripheral, given that even the less threatening rivulets can cause a very strong jolt, causing you to realistically lose control of the car. The downside of this great new feature in Forza Motorsport 6 is that it isn't involved in a dynamic process, and it's only specific to certain circuits. It would have been interesting to be able to test it in Prague or on the Monza circuit, introduced for the first time in the saga together with the splendid Brands Hatch, Circuit of the Americas, Daytona, Lime Rock Park and Watkins Glen, but for the moment we have to make do with those available. The same can be said for the night, which from a purely playful point of view introduces less tire grip at the start of the race due to the lower temperature and obvious visibility problems (Le Mans and Spa at night with the Sport Prototypes are real hell). To replenish the limited playlist of Forza Motorsport 5 circuits, Turn 10 has introduced the city course of Long Beach and the Nurburgring Nordschleife with two successive patches: it cannot be excluded a priori that in the future night and rain can also be extended to other tracks present in the title. The physical model, as per tradition, is extremely scalable, offering an experience strongly devoted to the arcade with all the aids enabled and a simulation one making a clean sweep of SCS, ABS, TCS, direction indicators, rewind and so on . In addition to the liveries and aesthetic modifications, more numerous for some cars linked to the universe of tuning, it is possible to manage the set-up in the workshop with a sophisticated and complete menu of settings, as well as purchase the various upgrades to make your cars more competitive. racing cars. Still absent, unfortunately, the qualifications and the flags to impose penalties, which would have further benefited the realism factor and the involvement of the competitions. Xbox One goals Forza Motorsport 6 offers the traditional 1000G to unlock in a pattern similar to that of the other titles in the Forza series. We go from the classic social background shares of Assets, Liveries and Photos for the lowest objectives up to the completion of the various game modes for the highest ones (completing all the career showcases awards 40). There are some dedicated to covering a certain number of kilometers in multiplayer mode and many related to completing a number of races, in some cases with a specific manufacturer or a specific car. In total there are 56 ~Achievements~ to conquer. Solid reality Dan Greenawalt said that the pursuit of sixty frames per second for Turn 10 is a ~religious~ goal, a solution considered fundamental for a product of this genre that we fully support. What's astounding about Forza Motorsport 6 is that this value is solid in all circumstances, from the brutal downpour on Brands Hatch to the majestic reconstruction of the city of Prague, and even more incredible is that it achieved it by adding eight cars more than the ones present in Forza Motorsport 5. Even the old circuits have been partially embellished, such as the beautiful Laguna Seca, where a realistic dust is now visible raised in the second part of the track. While the additional resources could have been used to reinvigorate the anti-aliasing filter (the setlists are still present), add a crew during pit stops or improve some reflections related to night lighting, the Turn 10 have opted to make the game even more immersive. racing experience, implementing a total of twenty-four cars on the track. The cars are truly exceptional from the point of view of polygonal modeling, especially in Forzavista mode, which had already flexed its muscles in Forza Motorsport 5 thanks to the obsessive reproduction of interiors, engines and paintwork. By doing parallel tests on this and the previous chapter, we noticed that the damage system is more incisive due to dents and dirt, however there is not always homogeneity in the yield. Open-wheel cars, for example, are decidedly more resistant than the others, and frontal impacts sometimes have a less significant impact than those made with edges. By setting the damage to a simulation level, it is still possible to compromise the race even with a single accident, which could have devastating effects on the suspension, gearbox, aerodynamics.", "date": "2015-09-08", "grade": "9.5"}
