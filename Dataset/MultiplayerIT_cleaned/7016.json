Such a difficulty, of course, is not automatically a defect, and indeed it is a typical feature of video games of the past that has definitely been lost over time, only to then reappear on a grand scale on the indie scene and in general in the proposals of the various services of digital delivery, as is precisely the work of Wobbly Tooth. But it's not even an advantage regardless: you have to check what it comes from, how it's managed, if it causes frustration, if, despite all its difficult being, a game still manages to entertain. How does this small independent production behave in the face of facts? Motocross in the world of toys, on Nintendo 3DS: a successful meeting? Sgomma nails goes full throttle Since Trials 2, that of motocross stunt games, with a side view (or at most three quarters) and the use of a physics engine, has become a real sub-genre, which we hope someone will summarize as soon as possible in one o at most two words to avoid calluses on the fingertips of the poor journalist. Which genre is the subgenre, then, is another matter. Racing games? Sports game? Platform? A bit of all this and even more, to tell the truth, because in running, one runs, the competitive spirit, at least against the clock or the score, is always present, and the view and the conformations of the tracks, designed in such a way to allow the vehicle to make huge leaps to hit platforms located in otherwise unreachable places, owe much, if not all, to the more classic 2D platformers. Toy Stunt Bike, born like many other eShop offers initially for mobile devices, strengthens the presence of this sub-genre on Nintendo 3DS, so far represented, in a rather convincing way, only by Urban Trial Freestyle. The formula does not change one iota, if we exclude a slight shift of the camera more towards the protagonist's shoulders, to reach the ~three quarters~ we were talking about before; what the programmers have decided to vary to give a touch of personality to their little one is the setting. Mindful of the very old, and evergreen, Micromachines by Codemasters, the guys from Wobbly Tooth have transferred Trials 2 and its followers into the world of toys: toys are the motocross bike and the pilot, and so the various ~circuits~ are built in the various rooms of a house, from the kitchen to the bathroom, from the bedroom to the garden. Consequently, ramps, platforms and various obstacles come to be made up of the most normal objects that can be found inside a house: chairs, tables, cutlery, jars up to cups, both those for coffee and those a little larger , white, which generally constitute the goal of family members every morning. A fun and nice choice, which adds personality to a formula which, however, for the rest, as we said, remains completely unchanged: you start from one point and you have to get to another in the shortest possible time, overcoming obstacles, completing jumps and stunts, trying to avoid crashing. Each of the sixty levels, five for each room of the house, has three objectives (race against time, reaching a certain score through stunts and finding the three flags scattered throughout the stage, sometimes in quite hidden places), which in turn, if obtained, they unlock the next levels. For example, if you are at level 1, achieving all three objectives will allow you to play levels 2, 3 and 4; with only one instead you have access only to the second; it is not necessary to fulfill all three requests at once, you can, and indeed you must, given what we are going to say later, concentrate on just one goal each time, which is a good trick to increase replayability, as well as a an extremely welcome way to make the almost immediately very difficult race a little more digestible. The 3D effect In line with the whole technical sector, and that is present, but without being noticed too much. It doesn't do anything incredibly wrong, but neither does it do anything incredibly right, nor, in hindsight, anything at all, except for giving that extra bit of depth to internships that are nice in the idea but without infamy or praise in their implementation. The petomamlet You will have understood by now: from the very first levels, Toy Stunt Bike is really tough. And not that tough guy who ok, maybe beating time can be done, already iThe score to reach for the stunts is a little high, then if you want to find the flags as well then you have to sweat the hell out of it. No, more often than not it will seem impossible to simply move forward, there are so many times that we will try, without success, to make that particular jump or land properly on that platform. All this, first of all, due to a level design that always seems to hover on the border between the diabolical and simply wrong: then it turns out that in reality it is never wrong, that after dozens and dozens of unsuccessful attempts the obstacle, in the end, it is overcome, but the fact that these insurmountable obstacles begin to present themselves in regular succession from the second, or third if you are really very expert, level is still quite unforgivable. Then the accusing finger is pointed at physics and related controls. Obviously we are talking about a physics that for obvious reasons must be unrealistic: we discover, for example, that one of the ways to land on the high platform after a jump is not to simply leap off at full speed, but to perform a 'acrobatics (basically two, forward and backward rotation, and relative wheelies when on the ground) that magically makes us gain some speed. Everything is fine, except that the very management of the stunts is problematic: by acting on the control stick, the bike will take what seems like an eternity to start turning, only to then suddenly start doing it like crazy, making the really tough landing on two wheels. Mind you, in the end you get used to it, however the strangeness of such behavior remains, really unnatural and very ~user unfriendly~ which, added to the level design mentioned above, somewhat makes you less willing to apply yourself to master the best the motorbike. Fortunately, aware of this nature, the game doesn't penalize you much for mistakes: several checkpoints are found along the routes, and by resuming running from those, the stopwatch will also restart from where it was at the time you cut it. Indeed, since there is a key, the backbone R, which has no other function than to hurl the poor plastic pilot forward, one might even think that in reality one of the objectives of the game is precisely to entertain with spectacular accidents and always new ways to hurt the puppet. It could be, but it is a pity that the animations are really limited and always the same, soon also decreasing that subtle pleasure that one undeniably feels in seeing such a scene. The animations, on the other hand, fit in the same line as the graphic and technical sector in general: the settings are nice but little more, the objects not very detailed, the textures not very clean, the fluidity solid but not much, that's it , fluid... Nothing to do, for example, with that Urban Trial Freestyle which on the same hardware showed all its limits to a careful eye, but as a whole surprising for richness, spectacularity and speed. Finally, the sound is also totally forgettable, and for the music and for the effects that should, however, underline moments such as accidents. This would also be a way to make them more digestible and even fun, and make Toy Stunt Bike a game, albeit difficult and frustrating, with a certain charm and that somehow pushes you to go on despite everything.", "date": "2014-07-09", "grade": "5.0"}
