{"name": "Zoo Tycoon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125929-zoo-tycoon-piu-zoo-per-tutti.html", "text": "Zoo Tycoon is an extremely recognizable brand for long-standing PC gamers: a management strategy with a classic flavor that sought to combine a macro-management component to expand one's plot of land with the typical micro-management of the various Theme titles, above all those disclosed by Bullfrog: Theme Park and Theme Hospital. Years after the last title in the series, Microsoft, the original publisher, has seen fit to pull this saga out of the cylinder of unused franchises to bring to the screen a sort of reboot capable of exploiting the potential of the new Xbox One and of Kinect 2.0, meeting a certainly younger and less savvy audience but being very careful not to distort the legacy of the series. Handling the daunting task is Frontier Development, the same team behind Kinectimals for Xbox 360 and the experience gleaned from that game at the time is evident in this Zoo Tycoon. An old-fashioned management system for Xbox One? Hard to believe, but Zoo Tycoon is just that! More managerial or more adventure? The dual nature of the title is clearly evident in every single aspect of the gameplay: the precise intention of distorting the original style of play as little as possible without neglecting the new audience to which it is aimed, has heavily influenced the design of Zoo Tycoon. On the one hand, we find a third-person view where we can move our avatar, which is decidedly not very customizable, around the zoo that we have painstakingly built. The controls are classic, with the double analog to move the character and camera and the A button to interact with the elements of the scenario. It is even possible to call a buggy, a small animal-shaped car reminiscent of those found on golf courses to quickly run around the paths of the park. In this phase it is not only possible to admire the great attention paid to the details of kiosks, habitats and various decorations, as well as to witness some small animated skits, such as when you try to interact with the park animators, but above all it is possible to get in touch with the animals that populate the structures used. Through three particular constructions that can be installed in each ecosystem, the player will be able to feed the living beings in captivity, wash them with water or stimulate their senses and their desire to imitate those who appear before their eyes. Not all interactions are possible with all animals since, for example, for obvious reasons, we will not be able to feed lions or tigers, nor will we be able to expect a rhinoceros to try to imitate our gestures. In these phases Kinect comes into play, which can be used to mimic all possible gestures but which always remains, constantly, an optional element of the game, given that any action can also be performed with the pad without any type of limitation. At any time, however, we can press the Y key and switch to the management view: from above, from a bird's eye view, fully customizable in terms of zoom and rotation with the simple use of the two analogs. And it is precisely in this phase that it is possible to get in touch with the more traditional soul of the gaming experience. By means of a simple circular indicator we will in fact be able to manage all the buildings already present in the zoo or create new ones by exploiting a series of menus with various levels of depth which allow us to easily pass from the habitats (the ecosystems containing the animals) and the mini habitats (versions in houses that house a limited and well-defined number of animal breeds) to kiosks (to feed and drink guests or entertain them with souvenir shops and various types of mascots) and decorations (from fountains to squares, passing through vegetation and various types of furniture). There is also no shortage of structures, four to be precise, namely the bathrooms and offices capable of accommodating the caretakers, cleaners and breeders. In fact, you must consider that the nerve center of Zoo Tycoon's gameplay is all poured into the habitats. Each is available in three different sizes (a separate matter for the mini habitats that live in total autonomy and with a minimal degree of management) and can host a variable number of animal species suitable for that specific ecosystem. Based on the size of the cage, we will have a certain number of construction slots available which will allow us to place the automated distribution points of food and water for cleaning, but also to build equipment to make the animals active and beautify the habitat same. There are all kinds of them: from tubs for rhinos and elephants to immerse themselves ini to scratching posts for tigers and lions, to slides for bears and rope games for chimpanzees. To close the circle of possible constructions we also find the interactions described above. The player's task will be to properly manage these construction points to offer everything necessary to each animal housed in the habitat, also because very often we will not only have to deal with different breeds of the same quadruped but also with completely different animals that however they live in harmony in the same biome (for example giraffes and elephants or antelopes and monkeys). The management of these elements is quite intuitive even if there are some flaws related to a perhaps excessive simplification of the menus. First of all you find yourself having to navigate through too many selections and it can be a little nerve-wracking when you find yourself repeating the same action three or four times. At the same time, there seems to be a lack of screens that allow you to have a general overview of the zoo you are managing. For example, it could be convenient to quickly see all the structures present in the area without having to look at them one by one from above, or again it would have been interesting to have a list of animals and related breeds present in a specific habitat or, more generally throughout the entire zoo, without having to scroll through them individually. Zoo Tycoon is littered with these little flaws relating to a lack of optimization and gameplay cleanliness and which betray the desire to hit two different player targets without being able to fully satisfy both. Xbox One goals Zoo Tycoon offers 44 achievements for a total of 1000 points. The most complex and profitable ones are very difficult to achieve and involve the adoption of each individual animal breed with their color variants (100 points) and the liberation of one animal of each type (75 points). Then there are the points relating to the completion of the various game modes and a whole series of objectives relating to special activities such as cleaning a certain number of excrement, replenishing cleaning and food points and completing the various interactions several times. After about ten hours of play, we have managed to unlock 30% of the objectives. More and more ~difficult~ As the size of the zoo increases, it becomes obvious that the player cannot spend precious time manually replenishing the food and cleaning points of the various habitats or individually removing excrement from the cages. This is where the cleaners and keepers come into play, respectively able to keep the park or the cages clean. Of a completely different use are the breeders who can be assigned to biomes to increase the chances that the animals present inside can reproduce. In fact, quadrupeds have a specific level of experience that increases over time if all their needs are met and which determines their value as a park attraction. The puppies are by far the most sought after by the guests of the zoo, at the fifth level they become adults, from the tenth they are able to reproduce and once they reach the fifteenth level, the maximum possible, they can be set free in nature to make the animal gain fame. park based on the animal's degree of risk of extinction in the wild. From this point of view, Zoo Tycoon carries out an excellent guide and teaching job, especially suitable for the youngest, since at any time it is possible to access the encyclopedia to read all the information on the animals; above all, during the adoptions of the quadrupeds to be placed in the various habitats, it is possible to observe in detail the differences between the various breeds of each animal and to know the situation of its diffusion in the real world. More generally, with the pressure of the left trigger it will be possible to delve into every aspect of the zoo, from the general liking of the park to specific indicators relating to the biomes and animals welcomed to arrive at the status of supplies and maintenance of kiosks and decorations. Continuing to talk about the game interface, it is essential to mention the only two indicators relating to the player's performance at the top of the screen: money and the number of people in the park. Also in this case the work of simplification of the activities by the player is clearly visible and although it is possible to set the cost of the park entrance ticket or the price of drinks, food and souvenirs (but only on three levels: low , normal, high plus the free level for admission to the zoo), it is clear that the cash flow and the trend of guests is the result of statisticsand hidden from the player and related to the size of the park itself and the well-being of visitors and animals. There is a constant feeling of helplessness in the face of the impossibility of acting directly on specific elements of the game economy and the financial management summary screen is of little use. It all seems to be the result of an automation of the actions that can be performed and after the first two, three hours of experiments, you will find yourself always doing the same, identical actions at the beginning of each game to make sure that the zoo gets on the right track . After that, the road is completely downhill and at most you have to wait a few minutes to make sure that there is enough money to adopt that animal or build that other structure. The difficulty is set so low that you will almost never see a turnaround in cash flow or visitor numbers unless you decide to start selling most of the zoo's buildings. In reality there is also a third indicator, the one relating to fame and which represents the level reached by the zoo. Every construction and animal management activity carried out in the park leads to the increase of fame. Once you reach a certain threshold, increase the level of your activity and unlock new items. The latter must be sought before they can be actually used, spending some money and waiting a few seconds before they are actually usable. There is also a more general research system that allows you to have access to permanent bonuses with a lower cost of managing the kiosks or a higher general probability of breeding your animals or even an advertising boost to make the park better known in the world . As for the game modes, we find a tutorial made up of ten lessons, the campaign divided into 20 scenarios (difficulty easy, normal, difficult) and the two additional options, challenge and free, which allow you to start from scratch with a zoo brand new without any lens. The first offers the player a variable initial budget, while the second guarantees infinite money. There's also a sort of multiplayer: by creating a park on the cloud, you can invite up to three friends to work on your creation. Too bad, however, that there is no sort of matchmaking to find games in progress or to join strangers on the fly. A choice probably linked to the developer's desire to avoid unhealthy behavior since it is not possible to limit the work of the invited people. The care of animals, the neglect of the rest Technically Zoo Tycoon is enjoyable and well detailed, especially as regards the realization of the large number of animals fielded. Despite a rather colorful and cartoon-looking design, the quadrupeds manage to maintain a semblance of realism especially in their numerous animations, all very credible and probably the result of field research work that betrays the developer's past. However, such beauty and accuracy clashes with a detail of all the other elements of the scenario, in particular of the kiosks and decorations, decidedly subdued and sometimes also made with decidedly grainy low-resolution textures. There is also some rather substantial drop in frame rate, especially when you get to the more advanced stages of a level or free mode. On this front, the maximum size limit imposed on the zoo and which begins to come into play when the player moves towards a full-bodied expansion is of little use. The choice of using such a large number of on-screen writings is not clear to us, especially during the initial tutorial, which are decidedly difficult to read when you are at a certain distance from the screen or the home equipment does not include an 80-inch TV. In 2013, from a new generation game, it is expected that the most important indications and suggestions are perhaps signaled by voice, rather than through numerous texts written with small fonts. We also point out that Kinect is constantly present in the game not only for the interactions described at the beginning of the article but also for a whole series of voice commands (there are so many) that it is possible to impart for most of the tasks that can be performed during park management . All these commands are absolutely optional but unfortunately the degree of accuracy is not particularly high perhaps due to the high number of commands which, among other things, often look a bit too similar. Another negative note concerns the loading at the beginning of each zoo: really too long.", "date": "2013-11-26", "grade": "7.0"}
