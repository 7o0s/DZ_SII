As the football season gets underway, EA Sports is once again ready to make its simulation dedicated to this sport available to all football fans. An appointment that is always eagerly awaited, this year in particular thanks to the excellent work done by Konami with eFootball PES 2020 (our review here), which has seen the Pro Evolution Soccer series definitively return to excellent levels. With such fierce competition, the curiosity to see Electronic Arts' response with FIFA 20 has become increasingly pressing until today, the day in which we can sum up this title after an entire summer spent sifting through press releases and trailers. While in these hours FIFA 20 is published online for EA Access members, let's find out all the details of the game officially released on September 27 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. News: once upon a time The trilogy of Alex Hunter and his Journey has now been archived, for FIFA 20 the main novelty studied by EA Sports consists, as you know, in the Volta mode, with which the Canadian team takes us back to the street pitches years after the sad end of FIFA Street. Whoever accesses the game menu finds himself in front of a new section, which he can access in order to choose between the types of game that Volta has to offer. Firstly, the fact that Alex Hunter has retired does not mean that FIFA 20 no longer has a story mode. Entrusted precisely to Volta, the story of this title puts us in the shoes of an emerging player, part of the team led by the star Jayzinho, an athlete who really exists in the panorama of street football present in the game together with his other colleagues. Just the champion's injury seriously endangers the team's participation in the world championships of its category, thus pushing our protagonist to roll up his sleeves to go and find new teammates around the world. The plot actually seems to have been specifically designed for us to visit all the pitches and modalities that Volta includes, thus combining business with pleasure to familiarize us with the settings and the game system we will discuss later. The list of categories in Volta includes three against three with a flying goalkeeper, four against four with or without a flying goalkeeper, five against five and professional futsal, i.e. what is commonly called five-a-side football. The latter can also be played with real players, taken from the eleven football teams present in FIFA 20. Taking inspiration from Ultimate Team, in putting together your own team of Volta it is necessary to keep an eye on the level of harmony of the players beyond to the ability of the individuals, determined by the form that each of them prefers and by the type of field. Once you become familiar with the game system you can start going around the world with the Tour mode, challenging other more or less known champions in the world of street soccer, or go online to compete against other players and climb the top of the divisions and the leaderboard. Finally, there are the customization options both for the protagonist athlete and for all the other members of our team, through the editor that allows us to modify the physical characteristics (including gender) but above all the aesthetic ones, unlocking clothing elements with points acquired as you play. The modes: from Career to Ultimate Team If Volta deserves to be at the top of the news list, it doesn't mean that the other modes of FIFA 20 are exempt from having new elements to talk about. Including Career, a single-player component that has remained too identical to itself over the years, which EA Sports has decided to revitalize by adding some element that somewhat recalls the communication aspects of Football Manager. In fact, the introduction of pre- and post-match press conferences serves to define the mood of the team and of the individuals, with the risk of running into a dressing room not satisfied with us if things go particularly badly. Furthermore, from time to time the players themselves ask for a private interview with us, typically to claim a little more space in the first team or to thank them for the playing time granted, also in this case linking the individual's mood to our answers . With a few games behind us, however, it seemed easy to keep the morale of the t highruppa, unless you are committed to giving clearly negative answers. Going forward, the press conferences prove to be a bit immature and lose their novelty effect, thus prompting those with the pad in hand to choose to skip them when this is possible. An editor similar to Volta's is also available for the Career, where you can transform the appearance of the coach we play to feel more comfortable in his shoes. Moving on to Ultimate Team, the competitive structure of this successful mode remains anchored to the dynamics of Division Rivals and FUT Champions, with the addition of some interesting side dish news. The biggest difference compared to FIFA 19 is the addition of other objectives, which complement the daily and weekly ones. Among them we find, for example, the seasonal ones, particular tasks to be carried out within a month to obtain further rewards. A new design of the squad management menu puts the main elements concerning the single player within a single screen, thus saving us from having to go back and forth between menus to manage the various aspects of the single and squad. Also noteworthy is the arrival of friendly matches within FUT, which thus give the possibility of playing together with one's friends using one's own team. The type of game that can be played varies from the classic one to other slightly more colorful modes, which add useful fun to get away from the stress of the competition. There's no getting around it: Ultimate Team was and remains the most appealing mode even compared to the competition, with an enviable depth that leads it to be the center of attention even months after the game's release. The Pro Club closes the list, which however we have not yet had the opportunity to try since in recent days there was not yet enough population on the servers. Playstation 4 trophies FIFA 20 is accompanied by a total of thirty-two PlayStation 4 Trophies. In addition to the inevitable platinum that can be obtained once all the others have been collected, the football simulation includes five gold, fourteen silver and twelve bronze trophies. To complete the whole collection you have to get busy within the various modes that make up the game, starting with the new Volta where you can complete the story and reach the maximum overall for the protagonist. The gameplay: finally on the pitch To talk about the game dynamics of FIFA 20, an initial distinction must necessarily be made between traditional football and Volta's football. Starting from the latter, we can say that fortunately the final version of Volta contains a few steps forward compared to the demo released days ago, compared to which the FIFA 20 that will arrive in stores proves to be more fluid and harmonious. Moving between the confined spaces of the smaller pitches no longer seems so unnatural as we had personally noted previously, even if some problems related to artificial intelligence remain. Especially in the three-on-three mode, the player who remains to cover the small goal often tends to advance without having adequate coverage, thus forcing us to take another one and rush him to defense to avoid having the goal area completely unguarded. things work better when you start to go four against four and beyond, bearing in mind that it is still possible to choose the form that we feel is more congenial to our type of game. Once in the game, Volta allows you to have fun with the spectacular feats of the freestyle masters, which are produced in a series of acrobatic touches on which greater indulgence is granted than in the traditional game. Some tricks are performed automatically by players with more class, while others with the combination of the L2 key and the use of the right stick giving rise to truly spectacular actions. However, you have to be careful not to leave too much space for the opposing team, because at the more advanced levels of difficulty the CPU knows how to properly pierce those who don't care to defend, giving a hard time with their dribble and for this reason requiring attention in the phase coverage. The ball seems to have the necessary level of heaviness to prevent it from taking off with every shot we make, thus allowing the execution of calibrated low shots. Hitting the small goal isn't always easy, just as it isn't obvious to score face to face with the goalkeeper. The only negative impression given to us by Volta concerns some somewhat confused phases of the game, in which the skill in defensive positioning loses effectiveness in the face of randomness. With the complicity of the barriers that prevent the presence of doeslli side, the rebuttals end up deciding in a somewhat excessive way whether the attacking team manages to score or not, leaving the defenders almost helpless. As for the movements, the slide has rightly been eliminated to make way for a standing tackle that is a little more vehement than the traditional one. Archived the gameplay of Volta, let's move on to the classic one of FIFA. Beyond the names studied by the marketing departments, the very first impression one gets when taking the field pad in hand is that of finding oneself faced with a rather conservative edition, within which it is however possible to progressively detect some changes in some game dynamics. In particular, the pace seemed a little more staid, while retaining a predisposition for the immediacy and spectacularity of the action that has become a trademark of the series especially in recent years. Some changes of direction now seem a little less effective, just as it is not possible to perform tricks in series without risking losing the ball. The fastest players still seem to have an advantage over those more gifted in other physical characteristics, but thanks to the limitations just mentioned, the hope is to no longer see the abuse of some dynamics that haunted online matches. gave mixed sensations, probably dictated by the different situations in which one can find oneself during the ninety minutes: in the case of shots and passes the ball seems to have the right level of heaviness, while in the event of tackles the ball gives the impression to be a little too light. The feeling is that the manual defense is still a little penalized by the rebounds, which therefore end up rewarding the attacker with a greater impact than reality even if the defender's intervention is made with the right time and intensity . Moving on to the artificial intelligence of our team, there seems to be a better positioning in the defensive phase, while in attack the teammates appeared a little more proactive than in the past. As for the teams controlled by the CPU, at higher difficulty levels the markings obviously become tighter, giving us less time to develop our action. A particularly marked defect seems to be linked to the incursions on the wing: in fact, it happens quite often that the opposing full-backs ~decide~ to lose our wings, aiming in the case of a one-two who is in possession of the ball instead of making a cover shot . On the style of play, the various teams try to develop their identity through close play and various levels of pressing: fortunately the times in which even Chievo produced themselves in exhausting tiki-taka seem definitively archived. One last note concerns the new management of set pieces, entrusted to the use of a viewfinder to which the right stick is placed side by side for the type of free-kick to be carried out. Perhaps it will only be a matter of time and getting used to, but the old method still seems to us to be the best compromise between simplicity of execution and effectiveness. Graphics and sound Now almost at the end of this videogame generation, FIFA 20 does not make particular aesthetic leaps compared to its predecessor. The choice of EA Sports was therefore to focus on an improvement from a choreographic and directorial point of view, with the introduction of new shots that go, for example, to capture the warm-up of the players before the match or the choreography of the curves. From this point of view, new customization possibilities have also been added to Ultimate Team, where we have greater control over the distinctive features of our club. At a glance level, the presentation still stands at high levels, also holding up against the competition. It certainly helps the license of the Champions League, whose unrivaled charm is exploited properly in the ways that the developers have linked to this competition. Going into details instead, FIFA 20 fails to reach the peaks reached by eFootball PES 2020, especially as regards the appearance of the players and the quality of some animations. Even the number of faces reproduced by recalling the real one is severely limited compared to the competitor, where it is instead possible to appreciate similarities even in the less famous players. The attention to detail of the Volta pitches is very beautiful, the types of which range from the parking lot to the warehouse, passing through clay fields and more, with a rather meticulous attention to detail. The usual high-quality soundtrack is accompanied by the commentary", "date": "2019-09-19", "grade": "8.8"}
