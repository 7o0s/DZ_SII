In fact, while wanting to grant the team all the extenuating circumstances of the case, IronFall: Invasion is a mediocre product, which ends up being crushed in the fatal grip between its triple A title ambitions and a realization that is simply not up to par. The invasion of robot aliens That something is wrong in IronFall: Invasion it is clear from the beginning, given that the game is based on a plot confused, sketchy and generic: the protagonist is Jim, super-soldier in the service of who knows who, who must fend off the invasion of an army of robot aliens from nowhere. Even if brought to the extreme synthesis, this is really the disheartening background of a story clearly developed only to act as a glue between the various levels, but whose absolute poverty is really difficult to overlook. Just as it is hard to digest a design devoid of the slightest crumb of originality: the hero is a (bad) carbon copy of Marcus Fenix, the enemies are robots that seem to come straight out of a title from the early 90s and the scenarios they are based on hackneyed clichs. Unfortunately, things don't improve in terms of pure and simple gameplay, despite the fact that the developers of VD-DEV have tried to really imitate Gears of War in every way: the three-quarter view, the cover and fire system, the mechanism of active reloading, even the animations and camera movement that accompany the shot of the protagonist are taken from the Epic series. Nothing to crucify an independent team of only three elements for, except that absolutely non-original ideas are combined with an almost always insufficient realization. To begin with, the level design is a boring succession of rooms and corridors, with only very trivial puzzles to break the monotony of a canvas that always involves reaching an area, eliminating all enemies and moving on to the next to repeat the same procedure. The artificial intelligence of the robots then borders on absolute zero and helps to further put the action to sleep, characterized by a low level of challenge that undergoes sporadic (and annoying) wheelies only in some sections in which you take command of another character . It will certainly not be IronFall: Invasion to mark a new course for third-person shooters 3D effect One would think that in a globally mediocre title like IronFall: Invasion the 3D effect is also inferior to the standards, and instead it is one of the most successful aspects of the product: with the slider at maximum the feeling of depth is really convincing and well made, even if to enjoy all this you have to pay the price of a frame rate literally halved. I can't control myself Even presented during a Nintendo Direct as one of the first titles to natively support the C-Stick of the New Nintendo 3DS, IronFall: Invasion unfortunately also misses this target, offering an unsatisfactory control system precisely due to the poor precision of the second analog input quality to manage the aim: even working on the settings of the sensitivity of the view, keeping the reticle steadily on a moving enemy (especially at close range) becomes a prohibitive undertaking, taking further fun out of a title that already didn't offer much at the start. The software also includes a setting for playing using the stylus, but it is an incredibly inconvenient and underperforming solution, which eliminates all those who do not own the latest version of the Nintendo laptop from the potential catchment area of IronFall: Invasion. However, it would be ungenerous to say that the entire work done by VD-DEV is to be thrown away, especially if we consider that a team of only three people managed to come up with a respectable graphic design: the settings are quite large, the polygonal models appear full-bodied, the light effects are not lacking and the screen update is fixed at 60 frames per second, at least with the 3D effect disabled. The game's sales system is also interesting: you can download a demo for free that allows you to tackle the first level, and then you can buy the single-player campaign and the multiplayer component separately for 9.90 for each packagechetto. Speaking precisely of the latter mode, IronFall: Invasion once again demonstrates good will but poor performance: it is therefore possible to try your hand at deathmatch all against all or divided into teams, online or locally, even being able to bet with the in-game currency on the match winner. It is a pity that the small number of maps and modes are added to the persistent control problems and that there are very evident imbalances in the effectiveness of the weapons and in the management of respawns, elements that make the multiplayer matches of IronFall: Invasion confused battles destined to tire really in a short time.", "date": "2015-02-16", "grade": "5.0"}
