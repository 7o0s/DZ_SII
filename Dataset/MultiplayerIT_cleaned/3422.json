To appreciate the changes made to the game by the Japanese development team, recently exonerated by 2K Games for the WWE 2K series (another brand that has been dragging on for some time and which we hope will start a process of substantial renewal in terms of gameplay this year), in fact, a few moments are enough, just enough time to finish projected for the first time on the battlefield. The adoption of the Unreal Engine 4, instead of the old graphics engine used up to Earth Defense Force 5, significantly stabilizes the frame rate and contributes to the improvement of all the elements related to it, from the character movement system to the gunplay . History and classes Earth Defense Force: Iron Rain introduces important changes in terms of narrative background, in a sort of Western-style reboot that will probably make EDF historical fans turn up their noses, but which had now become necessary due to the inability to give a effective sequel to the story of the alien invasion reproposed over and over again by Sandlot, between regular episodes and remakes. Thus we find ourselves at the helm of a mercenary rather than a member of a government army, in a merciless fight against aliens focused also to the collection of precious crystals left on the battlefield by slain enemies. The precious stones and coins earned on missions can be used to modify the physical appearance of the character, unlocking new uniforms and colors, but also and above all to increase his vital energy and purchase more powerful weapons within traditional categories that include assault rifles, rocket launchers, missile launchers, lasers, grenade launchers, special devices and blades. Even the class system is revolutionized, and so the four configurations available for our soldier take on the connotations of simple technological appendages and accessories, to be applied as needed given that it is possible to change between one mission and another, rather than remaining tied to a single typology. We have the Trooper, a basic configuration capable of reacting quickly to attacks and instantly getting up to escape; the Jet Lifter, equipped with thrusters that allow it to ~fly~ exactly like the Wing Diver by exploiting the limited (but rechargeable) energy of its core; the Heavy Striker, armored and equipped with an energy shield, but decidedly more agile and exploitable than the cumbersome Fencer, which from this point of view was really frustrating to pilot; and finally the Prowl Rider, a brand new class that replaces the Air Rider: a sort of lethal samurai armed with a sword and capable of hitting even the biggest monsters using a boost that projects him into the air. Gameplay and structure Beyond the changes made to the story and the characters, as well as the general technical cleaning operation which has undoubtedly had positive effects on the usability of the experience, Earth Defense Force: Iron Rain does not deviate from the formula that made the series famous , openly challenging the inevitable accusations of dullness and repetitiveness of the action. The fifty-two missions of the campaign, characterized by a fairly consistent degree of challenge already at the intermediate difficulty level, in fact have a very linear connotation. We are simply asked to clean up the scenario or defend certain objectives from the attack of alien enemies, which can be divided into various waves and change in number and type as we go along. To succeed in the enterprise we must rely on the many weapons that we will be able to unlock over time, to be chosen also thinking about the opponents we will have to face, in particular as regards the homing missiles: the most powerful are really deadly, but they require hooking times and very long reloads. The vehicles, unlockable from a certain point onwards, also deserve a special mention, which include not only armored vehicles and aircraft but also huge mechs with which to dispense death and destruction. In addition to the inevitable giant insects, among the ranks of the enemies we find the now traditional selection of ships and robots, with the same emphasis as always on the huge bosses, which in the case of Earth Defense Force are really huge. The gigantic steel arachnid of the first levels, pTo give an example, it measures a few kilometers and dominates the tallest buildings of various sizes, pulverizing them with the simple gait of its steps. Environmental destructibility also finds fertile ground in Iron Rain to give life to epochal clashes, with hundreds and hundreds of opponents on the screen and highly spectacular sequences, especially if faced in online cooperative multiplayer mode for six participants and with a minimum of organization. Side note: the game also includes a local co-op via split-screen, going in this sense pleasantly against the tide. Technical realization As mentioned in the opening, Earth Defense Force: Iron Rain finally tries to bring the franchise into the current generation from a technical point of view and succeeds quite easily, highlighting how in the past there has been decidedly lazy on this important front. The action is smoother and on PC it easily reaches a stable 60 frames per second with all settings at maximum, but with one serious flaw: the resolution cannot be raised beyond 1080p and there is a suspicion that the real pixel count is even lower , if we consider the numerous jaggies that it is possible to see within the scenarios. It is not known why it was decided to limit the experience on the Windows platform in this way and we have not been informed about the presence of any workarounds to solve the problem unofficially, but we sincerely hope that Yuke's releases an update to remove this absurd imposition. Also because, in general, we are talking about a security that does not stand out from an aesthetic point of view, it often remains anchored to very generic solutions and focuses on the quantity of assets rather than on their quality in order to be able to effectively manage the large number of objects and enemies on the screen at the same time. A vision that extends to music and sound effects, functional to the action and little more.", "date": "2019-10-21", "grade": "6.8"}
