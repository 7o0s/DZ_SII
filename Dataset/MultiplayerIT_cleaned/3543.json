{"name": "Wreckfest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wreckfest-recensione-console.html", "text": "Wreckfest, the protagonist of this review, has a particularly long history behind it, which started way back in 2012 as an experimental project which at the time was called Next Car Game, a simple but somewhat ingenious title that practically already said everything. The authors, Bugbear Entertainment, are a Finnish team specializing in racing games that have always shown a certain predilection for racing with ~destructive~ implementations and Next Car Game was supposed to bring these features to a new level of realism thanks to an ambitious engine specifically designed to integrate advanced handling and physics simulation into a compelling driving model. In short, there was a good research work that involved insights into the physics of soft bodies, or ~soft bodies~, used to create an advanced damage system and in many respects also unprecedented in the world of video games. All this has led to very long development times, also burdened by the initial absence of a publisher and the need to find alternative financing for the project, after the failure of the Kickstarter campaign. It is evident that Bugbear was convinced that she had something important and with excellent potential on her hands, having not given up in the face of the apparent initial disinterest of the public and in the end she was right. The important thing was to allow players to try firsthand what the Finnish team was putting together: in fact, after a first test Technology Sneak Peek, funding took off simply through the purchase of pre-orders of the game in early access , which in the meantime was becoming Wreckfest, reaching a more evolved version in early access in 2014 and continuing with an evolution that would still be long, until today. Speed and destruction The idea behind Wreckfest is to re-propose a racing game with the possibility of advanced vehicle destruction, in which this feature becomes an integral part of the gameplay and not just a technical tinsel to increase its realism. Here there is no space for clean races with luxurious and polished cars: the sources of inspiration are the races between cars without rules, in the mud and on the dirt road, which animate the villages in the American hinterland, the challenges focused on the destruction of opponent in arenas and crazy digressions aboard improvised vehicles. In short, it is a question of recovering the legacy of titles such as Destruction Derby and FlatOut, using ideas and suggestions to achieve something different and more complete, a sort of total immersion in the world of destructive racing, in which the standard rules of the races fade and they distort like the sheet metal of cars on the track. However, Wreckfest goes beyond its sources of inspiration by proposing a much more advanced driving model, also thanks to the management of cutting-edge physics, which goes beyond the strictly arcade sphere by positioning itself close to the so-called sim-cade, while still maintaining considerable scalability thanks to the various levels of driving assistance that can be selected. In line with this intermediate vision, there is also a deep car improvement system based on the upgrade of the various components and the possibility of adjusting various characteristics in search of the perfect tuning, for the more expert. The interface itself closely resembles Forza Motorsport and this is the game that comes to mind also to make a parallel with the driving system, although here the balance between simulation and arcade remains clearly shifted to the latter style of play. This search for the simulation aspects and leaving considerable freedom to the player in customizing the driving model is undoubtedly a positive element, making the experience more profound and usable by an even wider audience, however one could perceive a certain difficulty in finding a precise identity for this title, which seems unable to choose between the arcade immediacy of a FlatOut and a sort of atypical driving simulation. Destruction tours The game modes and contents are essentially those present in the PC version which was analyzed about a year ago by Tommaso Pugliese, to whose review we refer you for further information collection. In the Career we are faced with five championships arranged in progressive order, each consisting of a large amount of different events to be tackled even in random order, once unlocked. In principle, the races are divided into events based on speed and therefore on finishing first, in destruction derby in which we simply have to destroy the opponents trying to remain more or less intact fto the end and in crazy digressions with improvised vehicles, ranging from lawnmowers to trucks, up to sofas suitably made up for racing on the track (and we're not kidding). It should be noted that even the standard races still maintain a certain destructive component, in the sense that incorrect driving is usually encouraged with lots of secondary objectives that require the demolition of some opponents in addition to good final positioning, therefore the characteristic of destruction remains a recurring element in all types of competition. The progression is a bit depersonalized, in line with what has been seen in many other titles of the same genre, essentially based on the collection of experience points and stars to move from one category to another, but if nothing else it stimulates you to continue thanks to an advancement constant between levels and continuously unlocking new content. The alternation between the different racing experiences helps to break the typical monotony of racing games, making us go from racing focused on speed and driving skill to violent battles in arenas up to the loudest challenges on improbable vehicles, always maintaining a certain degree of mixing between the different components. The great work done on the damage system makes the destructive component particularly interesting: everything is pushed to paroxysm but without detaching too much from reality, with the hits that are reflected in a convincing way in the appearance of the cars and, by setting the option, you can also translate into realistic reflections in road holding and gait, depending on the damaged components. The single player proves to be satisfying thanks to a good artificial intelligence, but in the long term the contribution of the multiplayer modes is fundamental, which transport the various types of races in the online context with other players, obviously increasing the rate of challenge and involvement. Technological racing As previously reported, there is a good artificial intelligence that makes the races rather unpredictable, even if a lot depends on the difficulty level set: in calmer situations the trajectories followed by the CPU are quite predictable but when you are in the pile it is possible witness truly spectacular scenes, with opponents who do not disdain the use of a very aggressive attitude and results that are nothing short of chaotic. Wreckfest rests on solid technological foundations, having started as an experimental project on the reproduction of damage and physics in a racing game. The lion's share, as far as graphics are concerned, is therefore covered by the car models, capable of deforming and crashing in remarkably realistic ways. The physics of soft bodies is in fact a rather complex area and rarely addressed by video games, because it presupposes the possibility of deforming three-dimensional structures in a plausible way, implementing a series of dynamics that are difficult to reproduce in a convincing way. On this front, Wreckfest is at the forefront, staging a truly impressive dynamic damage system. On the other hand, everything else is decidedly less peculiar, with a rather standardized reproduction of the scenarios, which draw from the classic rural settings that often form the backdrop for races of this type. The console version falls short of the performance of the PC version in the most advanced configurations, which is capable of handling 4K at a high and stable frame-rate under the best hardware conditions. On base Xbox One, where the game was tested, a rather stable frame-rate is recorded but anchored around 30 frames per second, however the quantity of elements that can be viewed on the screen with a certain tranquility remains considerable, including debris, pieces of cars and elements of the scenery thrown around. There is a good job done on the lighting system, although certain levels of realism and complexity of effects and scenarios and cars are not achieved, as seen in other titles of this type. Remaining in the technical field, there is a certain length of loading at the start of each race which can be a bit unnerving due to the continuous expectations, but it is a recurring defect in this kind of game.", "date": "2019-08-23", "grade": "8.0"}
