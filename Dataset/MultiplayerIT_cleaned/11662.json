{"name": "Speedball 2 Tournament - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/speedball-2-tournament-recensione.html", "text": "Collect points The aim of a Speedball game is very simple: try to score more points than your opponent at any cost. The matches are essentially played with the hands, i.e. you have to grab a metal ball and be able to throw it into the opponent's goal. But this is not the only way to accumulate points: each stadium is in fact littered with bonuses that allow you to collect some extras. For example, on both sides of the field there is a row of five stars which, if lit, yields a good amount of points (two for each lit star plus ten for the entire row). Another extra is the buffer positioned roughly on both three/quarters of the field which, if hit, gives away a point. Obviously the funniest way to collect bonuses is to break the opponent's capocollo nut, or deplete an athlete's energy bar by shouldering or landing him with a tackle, thus earning ten points. To greatly increase the chances of winning, it is possible to throw the ball inside a ramp that gets 50% more points (for example a goal is worth fifteen points instead of ten). If you manage to use the ramp a second time, the bonus will become 100%. How do you say? Sounds like Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe? You are right. In fact it seems to be talking about the same game. The differences of this Tournament compared to the classic version are few and are limited to the implementation of a more articulated control system, although one can easily use the one based on a single key so dear to purists, to the possibility of playing online (in LAN or on the internet) and due graphic restyling necessary to justify the system requirements. For the rest, apart from a general reorganization of the various modes, which we will discuss shortly, there is not much else to report. The power-ups that appear on the pitch have also remained the same. Novelty Here are the main changes in detail. Before and during a game you can select one of two available control systems. The first, the classic one, is based on the use of a single button, which is used to pass and throw the ball and to hit opponents. Despite the years it still works very well, even if it shows some limitations, especially since, unlike the joysticks compatible with the Amiga 500, modern joypads have keys galore. For this reason, an advanced control system has been implemented which practically separates all the functions by assigning each one to a specific key and adding new ones, such as quick shooting. However, it is a simple and very intuitive system that requires little practice to master. The second novelty concerns the game modes that have been adapted to the times, inserting some interesting options, even if very few. There are four of them in all: Knock-Out, a fully customizable single match in which up to four players (two per team) can take part; League, the classic career mode in which you have to try to climb to the top of the standings of four leagues, each made up of fourteen matches; Cup, in which competitions between teams are organized, with round-trip matches, for a total of eight clashes and finally Practice, which helps us to become familiar with the controls. In fact, apart from some forced additions, there is nothing really innovative about the modes. Something more could certainly have been done, especially for the career mode which is rather poor in content. Obviously the most evident novelty is the due graphic restyling. A lot has been done to give Speedball 2 Tournament a visual aspect in step with the times. The three-dimensional models of the players are well done and partially customizable in the team management phase. The armors are tastefully modeled and manage to convey the right sense of protection and brutality. The arenas, four in all, are very similar to each other and stand out for the beautiful textures that cover the field and the stands. The only flaw is that there is a lack of some extra effects necessary to further emphasize the clashes. Among the extras the possibility of changing the point of view on the action, even if, for reasons of practicality, we tend to always keep the camera vertical. That's probably okay The multiplayer, which in the intentions of the developers should be the fulcrum of this production, had to undergo some problems. Unfortunately our experience was not very positive. The games that we were able to play completely are few, mainly due to the excessive lag and the lack of connected users. Where we managed to compete decently,however, we were able to test the goodness of the online game, with satisfying matches (even when a German player gave us an unworthy 205 to 28) and the confirmation that the gameplay of Speedball 2 is always of the highest level, despite being linked to the era of the 16 bits. Precisely the fact that seventeen years after the release of Brutal Deluxe on the market a way has not been found to improve the original formula can be interpreted as a form of laziness or as a celebration of the goodness of the work done then, which is still today proves solid and capable of thrilling thanks to its simplicity and effectiveness. Of course, the lack of novelty is strongly felt, especially as regards the ancillary aspects of the game. We would have been immensely pleased to find a few more modes, greater career articulation, and more in-depth team management, the latter also remaining identical to the original Speedball 2. PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 4 2.0 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card with 128 MB Pixel Shader 2.0 compatible DirectX 9.0c or later Disk Space: 2.0 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment More could have been done. In many cases it really feels like the original game. Some of the naiveties of the AI are no longer tolerable after all these years and the most demanding players will soon find themselves suffering from a lack of game modes that threatens to bring down interest. Otherwise it's the same great game that we've enjoyed all these years. It's worth a look, especially if you lived through the Amiga era. Pros Nice graphic makeover Solid gameplay Fun in multiplayer Cons Few poor career modes Very naive AI Speedball 2 Tournament is available for PC. Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe, made by Bitmap Brothers and first published in 1990 for the Amiga 500 and for a very large group of other systems in the following years, can undoubtedly be included in the ranks of video game classics and, in the opinion of the writer, is still the best representative of violent sports simulators. Speedball 2 Tournament is, more than a sequel, a remake that follows the original game in an extremely faithful way. In reality, an official sequel to Speedball 2 exists: it was released in 2000 for the first PlayStation, it's called Speedball 2100, and it's better forget its existence given the final result. In the distant future, after a terrifying civil war, rival gangs, who don't quite know what they have to do with the civil war but are always fine, battle each other on unconventional fields, challenging each other in matches of Speedball, a sport in where elbows count more than sporting fair play and where breaking bones gives points instead of penalties. Obviously the general public, accustomed to much more shameful and bloody shows such as Big Brother 135 and Radioactive Island of the Famous, immediately picked up on the novelty and welcomed the new sport as a breath of fresh air, capable of bringing some ' of ethics in this rotten and chaotic world. In short, Speedball became hugely popular, seeing the flourishing of sponsors and the construction of dedicated stadiums that took the games off the street. Many merchants, sniffed out the deal, have started businesses based on the sale of relics taken from the playing field, such as sheared teeth or broken kneecaps. Your aim, at the helm of a shabby team made up of nine athletes chosen from among the outcasts of society and frustrated young industrialists in disguise, is to reach the top of four leagues, ousting the reigning champions for the past fifty years: the Brutal Deluxe.", "date": "2008-01-22", "grade": null}
