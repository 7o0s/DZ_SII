Interactive arrive in these days. We are talking about the bundle with Tremor and the Klassic Skins Pack 2, with new costumes for Quan Chi (from Mortal Kombat 4), Jax and Kung Lao (both from Mortal Kombat 3), which Kombat Pack owners were able to download on July 21st from PlayStation Store and Xbox Marketplace, contrary to other users for whom it will be available from July 28 at the price of 7.99 euros. We remind you that both the character and the Klassic Skins Pack 2 are also on sale separately, respectively at the price of 4.99 and 3.99 euros. Finally, for the record, we point out that the Klassic Fatalities Pack 2 is also available for free, a package containing the classic fatalities of fighters such as Mileena, Kitana, Kung Lao and Jax. Tremor, ninja of the Black Dragon clan with the power to manipulate the elements, arrives in Mortal Kombat X The earth shakes The latest (but will it really be so? Rumors speak of a possible Kombat Pack 2) downloadable content for Mortal Kombat X celebrates the return of Tremor, the ninja disciple of Kano who made his debut in 2000 in Mortal Kombat: Special Forces (but not as a playable character) and who we last saw in action in Mortal Kombat on PlayStation Vita, where he was usable in one of the missions in the Tower of Challenges. The Tremor available thanks to this DLC is however different from the one just mentioned: physically it is more massive and has a new design also for other aesthetic features, such as for example the presence of rock fragments that cover the upper part of its body overlapping the skin itself. In combination with his immense resistance and durability, Tremor is therefore a difficult enemy to deal with, especially for the strength of his fists ~coated~ with rock or metal and the ability to inflict large percentages of damage in combos. He is a wrestler capable of controlling different types of minerals, and thanks to his elemental powers he can summon stones of various sizes, create earthquakes of strong magnitude and cover his body (or hands) with crystals, precious metals, incandescent lava and rocks. Precisely based on these skills, NetherRealm Studios has created three combat variants for him that are not very dissimilar from each other. In fact, apart from a few small differences mostly of an aesthetic nature, or linked to a couple of special moves or Brutalities, contrary to what happens with the other characters, the trio of techniques does not allow the playability of the character to be changed too much. However, the first of the three selectable fighting styles, Return Shock, allows him to fight using the power of stone: in this way he can generate spheres of rock from the ground, to then throw them at opponents, or make his punches more powerful . With the move Earthquake, available from the ground and from the sky, he can also generate strong earthquakes by directing them under his opponent to unbalance him for a moment and make him lower his guard, in such a way as to give him the opportunity to strike him again, perhaps always from a certain distance before subsequently attempting a closer combo or devastating grapple. The strength of the elements The other two combinations instead see the ninja use the strength of elements such as crystal and metal instead of rock. Crystalline allows the character to make attacks using the crystalline mineral of the same name. The latter through moves such as Kristalizzazione and Evoca kristallo is able to materialize either in front of the enemy, causing them huge damage once shattered into a thousand splinters by Tremor, or alongside them in the form of a large piece of green crystal which can then be thrown at the unfortunate person on duty. Not to mention a relative Brutality, which we will talk about better later, when we analyze the final moves, really violent as well as ~satisfying~ to perform, obviously in the context in which the events of the game take place. Even the Metallic variant gives space to combat which mainly alternates punches and blows inflicted with the elements, but this time with the help of metals and molten rock. Incandescent magma and golden spheres therefore ideally replace, but with similar effects, similar moves of the Return Shock and Crystalline variants. Apart from the power of the attacks, which with Metallic become significantly stronger and more harmful for those who suffer them, the rest of the actions to be performed are identical. As for finishing moves, we first have Tombstone, which effectively blocksthe unfortunate opponent between two huge rocks that squeeze his body more and more until they crush him. Particularly interesting, however, is the second Fatality, the one called Stalapotency, which sees the defeated enemy first impaled and then with his head smashed by Tremor's two enormous hands, transformed into rock hammers. From the ~beautiful~ to the ~discreet~ the range of proposals of the Brutalities. We liked those of the head pierced at the nape of the neck when the enemy is defeated on the ground, of the crystallization of the rival's body, which when falling then breaks from the bust up, with the head that after flying away falls back and is impaled on a spike, up to the one who sees a large boulder thrown by the character go and knock off the opponent's head, then stopping on his neck like a grotesque stone Halloween pumpkin. The X-Ray move is also very violent and well done, with Tremor wreaking havoc on his opponent's bones: first he throws a large boulder at him, then catches it in flight and throws it over a spike. Finally he jumps on his body crushing his chest and neck. Ultimately the Tremor package is qualitatively fluctuating and a little disappointing, since the ninja, in spite of an excellent graphic characterization that makes him one of the most fascinating characters of the roster and of the powers, fails to offer much, in our opinion, from the technical point of view. In the end, as described in the review, the character is visually pleasing, he has a lot of potential which, however, has not been adequately exploited by the developers, who could propose real and better defined variants as regards his skills and moves, rather than proposing three in photocopy. Obviously at this point those who are not interested in the variety of moves and perhaps have bought all the other characters will not want to miss this too, but if it were up to us this time we would reluctantly give up the expense. Among other things, there isn't even a block of particularly intriguing skins to balance the thing, given that apart from the nostalgia effect, these don't prove to be up to par with horror or samurai ones, for example. In short, if you are fascinated by Tremor, get the DLC, if not, you can look further.", "date": "2015-07-23", "grade": null}
