{"name": "Hunting Simulator 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hunting-simulator-2-recensione.html", "text": "The Hunting Simulator 2 review talks about a title that tries in every way to make you forget the first, mediocre chapter but, as we will see, it only partially succeeds, while improving it in various aspects. Being a hunting simulator it doesn't have a real story to tell: chosen between being a man or a woman, the player simply has to reach one of the six available hunting locations, two set in the Colorado plains, two in the Texan desert and the last two in Europe, looking for prey to kill. In total, there are thirty-three animal species to be hunted in exchange for money (deer, moose, rabbits... there's a bit of everything), while the equipment consists of 160 weapons, accessories and clothes. Each species requires the possession of the appropriate license to be killed, licenses that can be purchased from the computer located in our hunting house, where we will also be able to improve our equipment and hang the trophies obtained by playing. If we want the outline of Hunting Simulator 2 it ends here, in the sense that the rest is all practice. Dog Once the tutorial has started, the classic hoarse voice of someone who has spent his life sipping beer and smoking while keeping his feet on the carcasses of his prey and now can't wait to blurt out some anecdotes to anyone who gives him confidence, introduces us to the rudiments of the game and to the most interesting novelty: the presence of a canine companion (a Labrador Retriever, a German Shorthaired Pointer or a Beagle) who will keep us company during the long hours of hunting and which will be very useful for following the movements of the animals. Broadly told, the gameplay of Hunting Simulator 2 is really linear: once you have found the track of an animal, you have to follow it until you reach it, alternating moments of research with others of waiting. The dog in this will prove to be a precious help, because thanks to its powerful sense of smell it will take care of following the tracks for us. Giving him orders is really easy: just call up a radial menu and select the action to make him perform from those available. If we want we can also gratify him (a happy dog is a dog that does its job better). The tracks to follow are basically of three types: footprints, remains and blood, the first two are difficult to identify and require great attention. Especially where the grass is tall, you can spend many minutes looking for them. The latter are more obvious, but require a wounded animal and tend to get lost in the environment. Gameplay Of course, the difficulty in reaching a prey is not a big problem in terms of quality, given the genre to which Hunting Simulator 2 belongs. After all, a hunting simulator is really asked to simulate hunting activity faithfully, therefore the long minutes, when not hours, spent wandering in search of game are part of the game and avoid turning it into a normal FPS. In addition to the dog, there are other very useful accessories to help the player, such as lures or decoys, without forgetting the binoculars. When you are in the presence of a huntable animal, all you have to do is stand still, raise the rifle, aim and shoot. Hitting vital organs isn't easy, given that weapons, especially the less expensive ones, tend to sway a lot and pans are always around the corner. To have a better chance of making it, in addition to buying better weapons, you can climb the turrets, where there is also less risk of being seen or heard. When you are satisfied with the hunt, you can return to the starting shed and sell the prey, or you can keep some of it as a trophy. The six large maps included in the game differ from each other not only in biomes, but also in the fauna and the level of challenge they offer. Let's say that the starting point for everyone is certainly Colorado, with its gentle terrain and excellent visibility, while the two European maps are the most complex to tame, due to the luxuriant vegetation, which greatly limits visibility, and the landform, much more rugged than that of the other maps. Defects During the first game sessions, Hunting Simulator 2 seemed like a worthy competitor to theHunter: Call of the Wild, but as the hours went by, some defects emerged that dampened our enthusiasm a lot. For example, the fast travel system is really bad: the game only allows you to fast travel when you have found a camp... the problem is that these are quite rare and are not indicated until you have found them. Wouldn't it have been more realistic to provide the player with a map with all camps marked? In this way we would have avoided having to retrace the very long stretches on foot and we could have enjoyed itmake our travels much better. Another problem is the ethical system (yes, it's a hunting game but it has a moral system), which prescribes killing an animal with a maximum of two bullets. Shoot the third and you will be fined for your conduct. Now, the fact that a game in which you shoot Bambi wants to teach us morals makes us laugh a bit, but what is ethical about finding a gasping prey and not being able to put an end to its suffering, because otherwise you are considered bad hunters? Finally, the most serious problem concerns tracking. Basically doing it without using a dog is a frustrating operation when they are difficult to spot, but using the dog constantly reduces much of the gameplay to running after them. Repetitiveness is always around the corner. Someone could argue that it is a choice due to the desire to make the game more realistic. Maybe yes, but the fact remains that we are dealing with a much more arcade title than other exponents of the genre, such as the aforementioned theHunter: Call of the Wild, so why look for realism precisely on elements that ultimately greatly worsen the game? gaming experience? From a technical point of view, Hunting Simulator 2 is a decent title and nothing more. Some landscapes are very nice, the animals are well done and have decent animations, but we have seen better elsewhere. The overall style is also really poor. Let's say it's a very cheap representation of the hunting world. Since this is not a triple A production, we can be satisfied.", "date": "2020-07-02", "grade": "6.8"}
