After the movie you just have to choose between the usual options and whether to face this ~epic~ adventure alone or with the help of a friend. Once the necessary choices have been made, finally, we take the field and, guys, let me tell you: you won't believe your eyes! In a super-detailed scenario that comes frighteningly close to photorealism, you can only drool when faced with the perfect movements of your alter ego: dizzying animations, never-before-seen lighting effects and I just can't take it anymore! This is probably what I would tell you if I had been in hibernation back in the C64 and woke up with A.M.:G.R. in front of your eyes! Unfortunately so far I've only joked trying to hide the disappointment and the state of absolute despair that came over me after viewing the title developed by 3DO. Well: the game is really indecent! The 3DO programmers have tried to bring the spirit of the old MERCS or Commando shooters (remember them?) to a latest generation platform but, alas, they have combined a disaster. Let's pick up where we left off: we have just entered the battle with the aim of covering the 16 levels that make up the game by eliminating the opponents who stand in front of us (these are the blue and yellow armies) while trying to bring our beautiful skin back home green (or maybe it's plastic?). Too bad that everything is resolved in shooting at anything in motion and avoiding the copious enemy fire. Things get even more complicated due to the bad game mechanics that see you forced to crouch (by pressing a specific button) to being able to stop the continuous flow of the scenario or to be able to eliminate all the enemies present in that stretch, which could also have worked if it weren't for the fact that in this way you are more exposed to the numerous bullets aimed at you. Not bad someone will say: ~you duck behind a rock or a tree and kill everyone!~. I tried but it's really bad to see the little man who gets stuck behind the rocks as soon as you get up and the scenery starts flowing again! If nothing else along the way you will find the usual upgrades with which to give free rein to your destructive manias through the use of more powerful and choreographed weapons compared to the miserable ~pistol~ supplied (see for example the flamethrower or the bazooka). To use the weapons, just hold down the R1 key and aim using the right analog stick, while pressing R2 you will use the bio-attack in the form of a mega explosion that will eliminate most of the enemies on the screen. To move the character, needless to say, you will use the left stick or the pad. The game is all here and the only variant is given by the possibility, in some situations, to use an amphibious vehicle. If you're wondering if at least it's fun, the answer is obvious: not at all! Although I am a lover of old-fashioned shooters, the monotony and the ~smallness~ of the gameplay meant that the permanence of the DVD in the console tray was limited to the time necessary to be able to do this review! Moving on to the technical realization, apart from the fairly well-made CG sequences, everything leaks! The main character is made up of a limited number of polygons compared to the average of PS2 games, but the real defect is constituted by the truly pitiful animations: as long as you go straight on, nothing to say but just turn in any direction to see the feet going shots giving the feeling that the little man is tripping over something! The area in which we move is the most bare and poorest we have ever seen in recent times and the general impression is that we are dealing with a game for PSone, which is poorly programmed. Despite the lack of graphics it is possible to notice even slowdowns when the situation gets more crowded! Ugly (except the fire of the flamethrower and the explosion of the bio-attack) also the special effects. The real ~pearl~ is the sound: it combines discrete military-style music with a fair amount of speech that will make you double over with laughter! I don't know if it was wanted or is the result of the general bad workmanship of the product, but listening to the female voice at the beginning of each mission (with such a ~silly~ speech that you will hardly be able to understand what she is saying) or the various comments of our hero during the game it is something that leaves its mark (negative of course!). Not to mention the ridiculous noises that enemies make when they are killed or, again, the fact that when there are more ~voices~ at the same time a ~mess~ of sounds is created and one gets the impression that the audio passes from stereo to mono. In short, what can I say, one of the worst titles so far releasedyou for the black monolith! I challenge anyone to find anything really positive about this game. In the light of all that has been said so far, the only question that comes to mind is: but at 3DO, instead of releasing dozens and dozens of playful trinkets, couldn't they make one or two at least decent titles? Pro: Ehmlet's see ah yes, the videos! You can play with a friend Cons: you will lose your friend! Technical realization The game itself! Masterpiece In the super secret G.A.A.R.D. (the advanced research division of the green army) the scientist known as Mr. X has developed his most important experiment: mixing the D.N.A. of the bravest soldiers managed to create a super man capable of single-handedly wiping out entire opposing armies. This new experiment has a name: Omega Soldier! Guys, forget Metal Gear Solid 2, forget the nerve-racking wait for the most promising titles for your PS2: 3DO has decided to meet our wishes and created what will probably go down in history as THE game! When, eager as always for valid titles, you insert the silver disc (oh yes, it's on DVD, not the usual CDs!) in the case of your ~black goddess~ you will only be able to admire the splendid and long film that will reveal all the secrets of the ~Omega Soldier~ experiment. I know you're excited but stay calm because we'll be in action soon!", "date": "2001-05-25", "grade": null}
