Unspoken words, the first chapter of the trilogy of Julia: Innocent Eyes, is very short. It will take an experienced adventurer less than an hour and a half to complete, while newbies will have to spend a little more time. Once the game is started, a movie starts with a Pierrot who kills a girl dressed as a sexy demon with an ax for the Halloween party. With the corpse still warm, the killer answers the victim's front door and gives a group of children a treat. Obviously the identity of the murderer is hidden by the mask and, equally obviously, Julia will have to discover it. The woman is called by a janitor while she is lecturing at the university where she works. The player's first task is to retrieve Julia's jacket, cell phone and diary. It is an introductory phase that allows you to familiarize yourself with the control system and to get a first idea of the flaws, as deep as the sea, of the user interface. Poor usability Graphic adventures are not a genre born recently and, although it hasn't been renewed much since the time of the classic Lucas games, it has still seen improvements that are now considered essential, especially in terms of user interface. For example, it is known that the user hates hunting for objects to interact with, especially if they are small and well hidden in the scenario (the infamous pixel hunting). To overcome this problem, the developers have introduced various systems to make the so-called hotspots more evident. Now, imagine the joy of playing a title that is mainly based on looking for clues, often small and well hidden. Actually, that's not even the real problem. Let's say that, apart from the special sections, Julia is made up of two types of environments: the fixed ones, where the protagonist moves as in a classic adventure (for example the university classroom, or the garage where the victim was found) and the ~navigable~ ones, in which Julia is at the center of the screen and explores larger areas by walking through them and being able to change the angle of the camera that frames her. Now imagine having to underline the areas inch by inch with the cursor looking for clues, hampered by the too closed framing and by the fact that the walls often block the view of the furniture and other objects, perhaps essential to continue. Also imagine that, in the explorable areas, which require prolonged movements, you have to continuously click on the mouse to make the protagonist take small steps (implementing a Diablo-like movement system seemed ugly?). Irritating, right? The girl and the assassin There are other sections that complement exploration (searching for luminol stains, reconstructing the crime scene, and so on), but they're isolated moments that don't add up to the annoyance it feels to battle with the terrifying interface. At this point, some may be wondering if the plot is worth the candle. Unfortunately it is not possible to express a definitive judgment on the plot as a whole. Julia: Innocent Eyes is divided into three episodes and the first ends with many questions and very few answers, but the development has no ups or downs such as to make it interesting or to make you want to wait for the other two. Perhaps things could improve going forward, but the initial phase of the investigation is rather obvious and does not leave us with the curiosity to know what happens next. Moreover, as already mentioned, the game lasts very little and there are no moments of in-depth analysis of the characters and their relationships, apart from the very quick hints in some dialogues or in the videos. It is also true that it is designed mainly for fans of the comic series, but this does not justify the lack of consideration of the player who has never read the books. Repropositions From an audio-visual point of view, what can I say? From a title inspired by a comic series, one would expect a more refined style and greater attention to certain details. Unfortunately the style is very flat and uninspired, as the images accompanying the article can demonstrate. But, at least, will it be valid from a purely technical point of view? Unspoken words seems to have been made in the late nineties, put in a freezer and pulled out in 2010 without too many precautions. The problem is not only the washed-out textures, the poverty of the details of the settings (yet they are not very many and they are not even immense), or the three-dimensional models worthy of a PlayStation 2, but a lack of care that often ends in the ridiculous. Have you ever seen a policeman conversing with awitness, holding her several meters away and facing a wall? Or two colleagues at the crime scene talking without looking at each other? Some may consider them simple directorial errors, but try to fit them into the big picture and you will get the image of how much approximation the game contains. Moreover, one wonders why such a visually poor title has system requirements worthy of Crysis. Italian mysteries.", "date": "2010-11-15", "grade": "5.0"}
