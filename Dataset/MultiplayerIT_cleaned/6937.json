Through movies, animated series, comics and books, he led the troops of the Republic in the Clone Wars, faced Jango Fett on Kamino and trained Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force. Yet there he was, old Ben, waving at us, trying to use a Jedi mind trick to get us to rate a free to play game on the App Store. Star Wars: Commander is a new piece in the strategy that Disney Interactive is pursuing on mobile devices: taking a successful formula and setting it in a galaxy far, far away. Specifically, Commander is a mix of management and strategy that quite clearly incorporates the mechanics of the successful Clash of Clans. Star Wars: Commander recycles the Clash of Clans formula in the Star Wars universe War on Tatooine Despite being an almost shameless clone of the Supercell game, Star Wars: Commander exploits Lucas' imagination so well that for a fan of the franchise it is really difficult not to give him even a chance. A clear example occurs after a few minutes, when you have to choose whether to side with the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance. In reality, the two factions do not have who knows what differences in terms of gameplay: on the one hand there are stormtroopers, AT-STs and TIE fighters, on the other you use Wookiees, R2 droids and heroes like Han Solo. The only real consequence concerns the multiplayer component, given that it will be possible to fight only members of the opposing faction and join a clan made up of people belonging to one's own. Those who have played Clash of Clans, or any other similar game, will already know what to expect: the resources collected are used to build new structures, strengthen your defenses and recruit units for your army; every mine, every turret and every factory can then be upgraded to produce more resources, deal more damage or unlock new units and new vehicles. All this often translates into more or less long waits, also because in the first hours of the game (until a third and expensive droid is unlocked) only two actions can be performed simultaneously. It's not uncommon to wake up in the morning, give two orders, and then have to wait a whole day before finally being able to do anything else, but in free-to-play games of this type the waiting factor is unfortunately an inevitable component. Star Wars: Commander's big problem though lies in the artificial intelligence, which is mediocre at best and pathetic at worst. Theoretically, each unit is designed to have a different behavior and particular priorities: the stormtroopers move in a straight line attacking everything in their path, the Wookiees focus on defensive turrets and the dewbacks are perfect for demolishing barriers. This should also add a minimum of strategy in deploying one's forces, but the truth is that often the units behave in a completely random and meaningless way. In some cases we've seen soldiers shooting at a wall while being attacked from behind, or AT-STs abruptly walking away from a battle to the death. It is a flaw that is amplified especially when you decide to attack another player's base online in ranked battles: carefully deploying your units only to then see them go into disarray, sometimes compromising an entire attack, is obviously quite frustrating. And it's a shame because the developers have instead done a great job to enrich the single-player experience, with a hint of a story that connects the different missions and a series of campaigns that are activated for a limited period of time and which allow you to unlock new units. Currently the game is set mainly on the planet Tatooine, but Disney Interactive has already confirmed that the next updates will introduce new settings and content from the Old Trilogy: who said Battle of Hoth?", "date": "2014-09-03", "grade": "6.8"}
