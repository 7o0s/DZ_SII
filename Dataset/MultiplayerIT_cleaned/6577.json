He had moved a little, actually; just two sectors further south. The blade of our charged sword-axe had worn away during the last skirmish with the monster, a kind of nightmarish giant baboon that glided on the gristle under its arms. Filed the sword with a whetstone, we put it away together with the shield and we headed south, passing an area where, in our previous excursions in the Ancestral Forest, we had not yet come across. After collecting a few herbs and a little honey to mix a mega potion, we steeled ourselves and crossed the threshold of the next area. The Kecha-Wacha seems unaware of our arrival: it hovers above us, pacing a ceiling of intertwined branches and vines back and forth. We decide to take it by surprise, climbing up the nearest rocky wall, when suddenly the monster breaks through the natural ceiling and, hanging on it with its powerful claws, roars and prepares to attack us. We leap from the wall and elegantly draw our sword in mid-air to hit him full on the head, making him lose his grip. The Kecha-Wacha crashes to the ground and writhes, helpless: we only have a few seconds to hit him full on the head, hoping it's the last time. We hook the sword to the shield and an intricate system of gears transforms them into our gigantic battle axe, charged with energy. We wind up the coup de grace... Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate is truly the best episode of the series - it will be difficult to top it Reopen the hunt Monster Hunter veterans will have recognized, in our fictionalized introduction, the highlights of a monster hunt: the chase, the collection of emergency materials, the preparation, the fateful final confrontation. However, they must have also noticed something strange when we spoke of a monster - the brand new Kecha-Wacha, to be precise - which hangs from the ceiling and lets itself fall, and which we attacked on the fly after jumping from a wall. Mind you, that part wasn't fictionalized. It really happened, because Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate (and by now even the stones should know it, especially if they have read our exhaustive hands-on) expands the movement and combat mechanisms considerably compared to the past. Temporarily set aside the underwater environment and swimming, Capcom has decided to focus on the vertical development of the scenarios, implementing a whole series of completely new and engaging mechanics. While in the past the maps developed mainly horizontally, in Monster Hunter 4 there are very few sectors without hills, steps, platforms and scalable walls. In some cases the scenario is divided by intermediate floors (which the monsters can even break through) and in others it is structured so that you can jump from one handhold to another, perhaps to get close to a monster that is taking a nap hanging from the ceiling . The variety, in terms of level design, is extraordinary, and offers always different approaches to each type of enemy based on their position and ours, based on the weapons we're using or the tools we have in our inventory. In Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate you cannot jump in the practical sense of the verb, but take advantage of the differences in height to take the enemy from above: depending on the case, it is even possible to cling to the back of the monster on duty and trigger a small minigame while we try to tame it with dagger blows. If you succeed, you gain a handful of seconds with the monster squirming desperately on the ground. One of the new weapons conceived by Capcom, however, actually allows you to jump at any time: it is the insect stick, equipped with a special move that allows you to leap towards the enemy or away from it. Together with the charged swordaxe, the insect staff is a very pleasant addition to the hunters' arsenal: the two new weapons are in fact decidedly bizarre and complex to use, but also rewarding and powerful once you learn to master them. The insect stick, which also improves in its own way, allows you to absorb the lifeblood contained in certain points of the enemy's body to enhance the player based on various color combinations, drastically changing the weapon's attacks. The Charged Ax offers multiple playstyles at once, mixing sword and shield with a gigantic ax and a phial-based attack and defense boost system that charges with every hit. Thetwo weapons are actually as intricate as they seem, and the interactive and textual tutorials proposed by Capcom only scratch the surface of the peculiarities of both the new weapons and the old ones that have been balanced and improved. As usual, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate also sips information on its own mechanics: on the one hand, Capcom's strategy, deliberately aimed at establishing a communication and data exchange network between the players themselves, is all in all understandable, but from the The other risks once again alienating new users, who will find themselves overwhelmed from the outset with information and parameters to be explored through websites, forums and YouTube videos. Pocket Monsters Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate offers the largest and most varied zoo in the series, with over ninety creatures of which forty-odd large. Most of it comes directly from the previous games, but of course Capcom has come up with some brand new ones that, in our opinion, are among the most original and inventive that we have ever come across. In addition to the Kecha-Wacha we have already talked about, among the new monsters the Zamtrios also stand out, a sort of quadrupedal shark capable of moving underground and changing dimensions, and the Seltas Regina, a giant scorpion that can ~latch onto~ its subjected, becoming even more lethal. Impossible, then, not to mention the Gore Magala, the cover monster of the moment, around which the whole story of the game revolves a bit. Yes, because if in the other Monster Hunter episodes the plot was just sketched out, in this fourth round it is a little more incisive: it still remains a pretext to justify the hunters' adventures, mind you, but it was structured in a very more pleasant and organic. In fact, we will find ourselves following a caravan of adventurers from one village to another, in an attempt to discover the mystery behind a strange black scale and the epidemic that is transforming some monsters into even more powerful and lethal beings. The five villages are actually hubs that all have more or less the same services, but inhabited by different characters who will entrust us with tasks. These will then appear in the usual list of missions, together with the others, but by completing them we will unlock new functions, improve some services and continue the search for the caravan. The leitmotif of the epidemic, then, is actually a new mechanic of the game. Some monsters, in fact, will seem to die suddenly to resurrect immediately, more powerful and furious, accompanied by a black aura that can infect us: at that point we will have little time to inflict enough damage on the monster, reversing the contagion so that we you empower rather than weaken us. The epidemic mechanic is actually linked to certain particular missions, but it represents an extra degree of challenge that adds to the furious state of the monsters, making them even more unpredictable and dangerous. Capcom, for its part, has well thought of designing the climb of the ranks in the hunters' guild in a way that seemed decidedly softer to us: Monster Hunter veterans will complete the first six ranks of the missions quite easily, perhaps changing a couple of armor and making the right weapons while respecting the elemental weaknesses and their skill in mastering them, but then the game will take a much more difficult turn for them too, forcing them to make a painstaking choice of the most useful equipment, decorations and skills when face a certain monster in a certain environment. As per tradition, some monsters are nothing more than reskin of those already faced, but the changes to their behavioral patterns, combined with the strategic variety offered by the level design and the large number of weapons from which it is possible to choose, divided between melee and that at a distance, make each fight different from the previous one, suggesting the potential of new approaches and different and, perhaps, even more imaginative tactics. Cats and misdeeds The strength of Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate's gameplay is once again expressed in the possibilities offered by cooperation. For the avoidance of doubt, it is always possible to play alone, up to the last mission, but it is clear that Capcom conceived the more advanced ones by imagining the ideal scenario of two or more players working together, side by side, deciding what to attack, how and when. Local multiplayer is a decidedly rare solution in our parts, so Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate offers an Internet multiplayer mode full of opportunities. Unlike in the past, this time you don't need to rely on other consoles or other software to play with friends and strangers amiles away: just turn on Wi-Fi on your Nintendo 3DS and select the appropriate option on the Touch Screen to search for a room or create one to bring together three other players. Needless to dwell on the depth of a multiplayer game of Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate: try to imagine the scene we described at the beginning, but add a hunter who bombards the Kecha-Wacha with soporific bullets while the one clinging to the wall distracts him and the others two prepare the bombs or traps that will corner him. With Wi-Fi off, however, the adventure isn't so lonely, because within a few missions we'll earn our Felyne First Companion, the same one we customized at the start of the game. Inseparable helper, the Felyne is to all intents and purposes a second character who will attack the monsters with us, collect materials and help us tackle each mission, leveling up accordingly. In each map, then, we will find a Felyne to recruit, who will move to live on the Sunsnug islet awaiting orders. We will be able to recruit up to fifty Felynes, choosing five of them to be our Owners and one of these five to act as our Location Companion, following our hunter and his very personal Felyne on missions. Each Felyne can belong to a specific class such as Bombardment, Heal or Support, and depending on the Felyne chosen as Holder we will unlock new special abilities of the First Companion, as well as a super move that it will perform from time to time together with the other Felyne. Choosing a Felyne, again, is extremely important: while healing skills are some of the most useful, it's best not to underestimate the convenience of a Felyne who lays traps for you, who throws bombs or who can hurl you towards the enemy to a surprise jump attack. The Felynes can also be equipped with funny weapons and armor all to be crafted after recovering the materials through the two mini-games of the Sunsnug island, among which a variant of the Chinese morra stands out in which five of our Felynes will face monsters alone of puppet theatre. The Felyne can also be exchanged with other players, and another very nice feature of Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate also focuses on the concept of the exchange. In fact, between one mission and another we will be able to explore the Ancestral Forest, a randomly generated map in each game in which it is possible to wander around without a specific purpose, facing any monsters that make their appearance and collecting various resources, including weapons and armor related to the monsters that appeared in the previous Monster Hunters and that in this new episode it is not possible to fight (like the Lagiacrus, to be clear). By completing one of these explorations with sufficient success, you get a special mission that you can exchange with other players and that increases in terms of difficulty and rewards each time you complete it, a bit like it happened in Dragon Quest IX: The Sky Sentinels when exchanging special dungeons. The 3D effect While not involving real advantages in terms of gameplay, the stereoscopic effect in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate is simply astounding, thanks also to the spectacular nature of the settings and the size of certain monsters which, not infrequently, seem to literally come out of the screen. Too bad it accentuates the definition a bit too much, messing with the antialiasing. The handheld compromise To conclude our analysis, we certainly could not forget the technical framework which, in fact, is not easy to judge. There is no arguing about the variety of weapons, armor and monsters: Capcom has really outdone itself, and as usual the animations of characters and creatures are incredibly fluid and precise, as it should be in a game where combat, without a actual lock-on or other aids, it's all based on player timing and frame count. We don't even think it's fair to give a damn to the few settings that repeat themselves: the night and day versions of the dunes do not differ only in terms of gameplay or colouring, but also in small details such as the refraction of dawn light or the sky starry above. The scenarios are all beautiful, evocative and full of details: flocks of birds that cross the sky reflecting on the puddles, waterfalls that stand out on the horizon, rocks that fall around us as we climb the heights of Monte Paradiso, and so on. In short, from an artistic point of view, the work done by Capcom was extraordinary, but on the technical side we frowned several times because, looking closely at the textures, we noticed the", "date": "2015-02-10", "grade": "9.5"}
