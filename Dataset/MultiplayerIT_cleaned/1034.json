Sent into exile by the Jedi Order for taking part in the battle despite the Council's explicit ban, our alter ego finds himself hunted by the evil forces of the Sith, who see him as the last obstacle to their desires for conquest. Without revealing more of the excellent storyline of the Lucasarts product, I would like to underline here the different state in which the main protagonist is entrusted to the user's commands compared to the first KOTOR: unlike what happened in the prequel, in fact, here the hero of the game is a Jedi to all intents and purposes, therefore capable of being able to make use of the Force from the very first bars. the hero of the game is a Jedi in all respects, therefore capable of being able to make use of the Force from the very first bars A long time ago (but five years later) in a galaxy far, far away In addition to the obvious advantages of the case, such a choice of gameplay somewhat reflects the spirit that pervades the entire Obsidian production, characterized by a playful depth undoubtedly greater than that of the last episode, albeit notable. But let's go in order. First of all, it is interesting to note how the growth factor of the character is absolutely not affected by the fact that the protagonist is a Jedi: as an exile, our hero is no longer linked to the Force as he once was, and in strictly material terms, not he no longer even owns a lightsaber, confiscated from him by the Order. Consequently, the user will have the task of modeling and making his alter ego evolve according to his own needs and inclinations. The three membership classes that can be selected in the character creation phase (Guardian, Consular and Sentinel) have remained unchanged, while the addition of a series of 6 specialties, called Prestige Classes (Jedi Weapon Master, Jedi Master, Jedi Watchman , Sith Marauder, Sith Lord, Sith Assassin), with which the player will be able to relate later in the game, thus increasing the level of customization of the characteristics of your Jedi. Exhilarating features of KOTOR that returns here in an even more convincing guise is the way in which the look and characteristics of your character, as well as the entire storyline, are influenced by the user's inclination towards the positive or negative side of the Force. The actions performed by the player, the quests he accepts to face and his answers in the dialogues lead to the acquisition of Light or Dark Points, the accumulation of which has more than significant effects on the continuation of the adventure. In addition to elements such as the protagonist's appearance, the way he will be treated by NPCs and the usable Force Powers (the ~spells~ of the game, if of opposite alignment to that of the protagonist, require a greater expenditure of Force), follow the path of light or darkness affects the progress of the storyline even more significantly than what was seen in the prequel, to the point of making it absolutely advisable to tackle the title twice, choosing the opposite poles of the Force. And that's not all. In KOTOR II, even the members of your party will tend to evolve according to the selected alignment, and to prove more or less compatible with the user in relation to the answers he provides during the dialogues. More positive characters will therefore expect to be treated with loyalty and respect, while other less noble ones will appreciate more contemptuous and self-centered attitudes, often warning the player about acts of kindness. the spirit that pervades the entire Obsidian production, characterized by a playful depth undoubtedly greater than that of the last episode, albeit notable. A long time ago (but five years later) in a galaxy far, far away In addition to greater depth in strictly playful terms, however, KOTOR II also offers a better outline of the members of one's party and of the storyline in general: travel companions with more defined personalities will accompany the user in an adventure with a probably more compelling plot and full of implications compared to the prequel, although not detached from some ~holes~ and questionable narrative devices, especially towards the end. Fans of the first episode, then, will be pleasantly surprised by the return to the scene of some of the characters from the previous chapter... The Force flows strong. The frame rate a little less Although presenting some novelties of different kinds here and there, the gameplay of KOTOR II however remains firmly anchored to the excellent standards set by its predecessor. The Lucasarts RPG is therefore divided again between exploratory and combat phases, most of the time amalgamated perfectly, although there are some moments of slack during the adventure. Regarding the first component, KOTOR II offers the player a good number of planets to visit, many of which are fished directly from the prequel. However, this should not be misleading: it is not a choice dictated by the laziness of the developers in designing new scenarios (however present) but by precise narrative needs. This decision is certainly apt, which allows users who have already gone through the first episode to view the changes undergone by the various places as a result of the devastating effects of the civil war. Undoubtedly, however, someone could turn up their noses at the permanence of all in all familiar situations, moreover presented through a graphic sector that does not seem to have enjoyed particular improvements compared to a year ago. In fact, KOTOR II visually offers very little different from the prequel: a few more animations, a very slight increase in detail of the environments and very little else. If on the one hand, however, one certainly cannot complain given the nature of the product (it is known that in an RPG the cosmetic component is among the least important), the relatively short period of time between one episode and another and above all the still pleasant quality of the graphics, on the other hand it is sad to have to note again the presence of a significant amount of drops in the frame rate, especially occurring during camera movements and in the most agitated combat situations. therefore the pazaak matches, the speed contests with the Swoop and the shooter sections aboard turrets and so on, are back, while the new capabilities of the Workbenches are making their entrance, workstations scattered within the scenarios The Force flows strong. The frame rate a little less Again, it must be emphasized that the aforementioned slowdowns do not affect the natural course of the game in any way, but finding them in KOTOR II is certainly not pleasing. Continuing the analysis of the Lucasarts product, however, various elements should be noted as diversions to exploration, some inherited from the prequel, others introduced by Obsidian: therefore the pazaak games, the speed races with the Swoops and the shooter sections on board are back of turrets and so on, while the new capabilities of the Workbenches are making their entrance, workstations scattered within the scenarios with which it is possible to upgrade one's equipment and, in this continuation, also create from scratch objects useful for one's adventure. Despite some excess of backtracking here and there, therefore, playing KOTOR II is confirmed as a full and satisfying experience, to whose pleasantness the never too praised goodness of the combat system contributes significantly. Always based on the D20 rules, the spot-on mix of real-time and turn-based elements of the clashes that animate the user's wanderings in the Obsidian title continues to give moments of pure videogame enjoyment. Some innovations introduced by the developers are noteworthy: in addition to unpublished Feats and Force Powers, there is a practical selector for the offensive attitude of one's companions (defensive, aggressive, stationary, remote, Jedi support and grenadier) and seven forms of attack with lightsaber exclusive to the protagonist able to provide him with particular bonuses in certain situations. The picture is completed by a very complete stock of equipment items, including several new entries, and an average level of difficulty of the battles slightly higher than that of the prequel. The rest is history: the flexibility of the combat system inherited from KOTOR proves to be able to satisfy both the most discerning palates, who will take advantage of the special pause button to give precise orders to each individual character, and less demanding users, to which it will be sufficient to define the attack input of the warrior under their control and leave the rest of the work to the satisfactory AI of the game. In short, KOTOR II proves to be perfectly capable of offering an exciting gaming experience like that of its illustrious predecessor, enriched as if that were not enough by a whole series of small but significant innovations. As before, more than before: the Obsidian title surpasses the master in several aspects, not least in longevity, not so much for the actual duration of the adventure (always oriented around 30-40 hours) as for the aforementioned greater replay value. The roundup of praises to KOTOR II is closed by the sector songold, the trademark of Star Wars titles for its absolute excellence in music, effects and dubbing. Comment Obsidian has certainly done an excellent job with KOTOR 2, proposing the excellent balance of the prequel without overturning its structure nor reducing it to the development of a mere mission pack. By building around a gameplay perfected in some respects a more compelling storyline full of ideas, a more sustained pace of play and a group of secondary characters with greater depth, charm and personality, Obsidian has succeeded in not only not disfiguring in front of the expectations of the fans, but even to offer a globally better title than the original. In the light of all this, KOTOR 2 proves to be an obligatory purchase for all lovers of the prequel and Western school RPGs and in its version entirely subtitled in Italian it is a candidate for the title of one of the best RPGs of 2005! Pros: Excellent gameplay, improved in many aspects Great in terms of narrative and game pace Remarkable longevity and very high replay value First class audio Cons: Frame rate drops still present A few bugs here and there Italian Jedi After the difficulties that the Italian edition of the previous chapter had to face, finally the force can flow freely in our country too. The Sith Lords, both in the PC and Xbox versions, enjoys an excellent translation into Italian, all entrusted to subtitles, but of undoubted value. The choice not to impose dubbing allows true fans of the saga to enjoy the original voices of the game, which can be attributed in part to the actors who have populated screens around the world for years. Needless to deny it. The passing of the baton from BioWare (engaged on the promising Jade Empire) to the highly respectable Obsidian team as regards the development of KOTOR II has certainly influenced the hype accumulated by the sequel to the best RPG of the year 2003. Precisely by virtue of this prestigious title conquered by the Lucasarts product, it would have been reasonable to expect a more exciting wait for this sequel, which instead did not happen. The most common speech revolved around the fact that, despite Obsidian's excellent curriculum, it would still have been very difficult to repeat such a complete success as that of the first episode.
