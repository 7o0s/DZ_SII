Unfortunately we are far from the peaks reached by the reference series in this case, despite the excellent premises from which this Needs Games project started, mainly due to a certain lack of general identity and a wild monetization that ruins everything a bit Also in this case it is a title that aims above all at the mobile market but starts from the evident foundations rooted in the PC tradition, drawing strong inspiration from the aforementioned reference models but trying to introduce, at the same time, also some characteristic element, succeeding only partly. The story is not exactly a volcano of originality: the aim of the fully customizable protagonist is to become the greatest rune hunter of Traum, a world governed by the harmony between 12 divine beings which however sees its balance threatened by the advent of a dark being called ~God Serpens~. The mission of our fighter, initially moved by personal reasons, soon expands to become the classic journey to save the world, carrying out a large amount of quests between the main narrative line and sub-missions of various types, but all essentially focused on the liberation of various areas of the kingdom from the presence of various monsters and creatures, up to the clashes with the various bosses present. Absolutely nothing memorable from a narrative point of view, but in an action RPG of this type the plot is certainly secondary and above all serves as a stimulus to explore new areas, fight and, above all, collect industrial quantities of loot to advance the protagonist. Classic action RPG Undecember, a melee combat scene The structure of Undecember is the classic one of the Diablo-style hack and slash action RPG, with the shot from above showing a large part of the surrounding world and the protagonist intent on fighting hordes of enemies by freeing various areas of the map, completing the various quests proposed by story and non-player characters. As always happens in these cases, the main engine of the action is above all the constant progression of the protagonist, who pushes us to obtain experience points and look for new loot within increasingly challenging dungeons full of enemies, in a mechanism that works always very good, being innate a bit with the primordial instincts of the gamer. During its beta phase, Undecember achieved considerable popularity thanks to some excellent ideas, linked above all to the protagonist's evolution system, only to see the enthusiasm suddenly diminish mainly due to the wild implementation of micro-transactions, but the positive elements in terms of gameplay have remained. The combat system does not offer major innovations: it is always a question of moving the character on the map and facing clashes with an overwhelming number of enemies, alternating standard and special attacks, weapons and spells, paying attention to cooldown and opting for the most suitable options at the moment, between concentrated or area damage, elemental magic and various other possibilities. As often happens, the challenge essentially depends on the level of experience reached by the protagonist, therefore leveling up is a fundamental element of the game, with some more demanding and varied moments represented above all by the boss fights, some of which turn out to be really very interesting by attack pattern and characteristics. For the rest, on the battlefront it is a question of pressing the keys corresponding to the attacks after having organized an optimal build, drawing satisfaction from seeing entire enemy armies being torn to shreds around our hero. Classless progression system Undecember, screenshot showing the initial fortification The most characterizing element for Undecember is its classless progression system, which allows you to build totally customized fighters and without the need for choices that preclude any type of evolution. After a quick character editor, with actually rather limited possibilities, we start without selecting any specialization, which allows you to embark on your own path without any particular predisposition. Already in the first minutes of the game we can simply pick up a bow or some kind of sword and immediately experiment which is more suitable for us, with the ppossibility of switching from one to the other at any time (obviously given the space limits of the inventory). As the levels pass, the possibility emerges of shaping the protagonist by arranging the points accumulated among the three typical main statistics consisting of Dexterity, Strength and Intelligence, which obviously also determine a certain predisposition towards some specialties, given that the score of each trait affects the effectiveness of certain types of attack and the possibility of using some weapons and armor. Undecember, the effects of a magical attack However, this aspect directs the evolution in the most classic RPG standards, but nothing prevents the creation of balanced characters capable of using any type of weapon, or who can specialize both in standard attacks and in magic. The use of runes is a another interesting aspect: these are the fundamental elements for the spells in the world of Undecember and can be managed with a certain freedom, through a ~composition~ system that allows you to connect them together and associate them and various weapons. The runes are essentially hexagonal boxes to be placed inside a sort of chessboard, so that the colored sides of these correspond to each other. If you manage to position them in this way, you can obtain combinations of chained effects that guarantee active and passive skills to be applied to weapons or to be used separately as spells, through a creative and interesting system, even if most of the associations between runes they are quite driven. Aesthetics and microtransactions Undecember, the cutscenes are well done but decidedly generic Undecember stages a somewhat generic and uninspired dark fantasy, which clearly looks at the famous examples provided mainly by Diablo and Path of Exile but without being able to give a characteristic identity to the whole, despite some interesting ideas. The presence of a depersonalized protagonist is obviously functional to the possibility of shaping him in different ways according to the player's tastes, but it is a pity that even the surrounding world and the story fail to offer something particular and engaging. In any case, the graphics are generally pleasant and are also well suited to use on mobile devices, such as general clarity and scalable complexity of the elements on the screen. The main sticking point of the game lies in its wild monetization: microtransactions are a real problem in Undecember, which however emerged only after a positive beta period as it is practically devoid of this aspect. The problem is not so much the fact of being pay to win - an element that is certainly present - but rather the positioning of various useful characteristics on the QoL front behind the paywall. Since it is a free-to-play game, it is normal that there are paid elements, but the ~ethical~ use (as far as possible) of this system would impose a limitation on the aesthetic elements, not on the essential components to play with the right comfort . Therefore, the space in the inventory, artificially reduced, becomes acceptable by paying, just as the pet becomes useful (or at least not harmful) only by purchasing the right skills, for example. These and other characteristics can be obtained with diamonds, which can only be purchased with real money and not with gameplay.", "date": "2022-10-29", "grade": "6.8"}
