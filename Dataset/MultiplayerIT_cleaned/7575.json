Ubisoft's Just Dance is undoubtedly among the survivors, actually in excellent health, a franchise that has collected more than 40 million copies sold worldwide between the main series and spin-offs. And given that to date there has been no drop in public affection for the formula studied by the French company, we might as well continue along the same path; consequently, Just Dance 2014 arrives on the market, the new chapter coming out on Wii, Wii U, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and soon also on next gen consoles. If you haven't got tired of dancing, read on... Desire to dance As per the well-established tradition throughout the life of the series, Just Dance has always collected the best results at Nintendo; precisely for this reason, this year too the reference version is the one for the home console of the Kyoto house, but although a Wii edition is also strategically planned, this time the greatest resources have been spent on the more modern Wii U. Given the Not very brilliant sales of President Iwata's new hardware, Just Dance 2014 therefore also becomes a sort of test bench to verify the stability of this ~marriage~, and more generally the effectiveness of a formula which - as anticipated a few lines ago - in fact it does not bring with it even on this occasion any substantial novelty, limiting itself to enriching what is the ~side dish~ of the main course. If you have lived on Mars so far, know that basically in the Ubisoft title you simply have to hold a Wiimote and try to replicate as closely as possible the choreography of the dance that appears on the screen, possibly keeping an eye out for the pictograms in the lower part which indicate the next dance steps. Basically that's all. If described in words it is certainly not the most exciting situation in the world, in reality in practice Just Dance has always managed to establish itself as one of the best party games around; firstly because it is very accessible and far from harsh in judging users, and secondly thanks to the quality and variety of the choreographies enriched by a graphic design that is certainly not elaborate, but colorful and full of personality. We have already said in all the reviews of the previous episodes that the detection of the movements is far from precise, but in the specific case of Just Dance it is not a factor that can be attributed as a defect; those who wish to engage in rigid and severe dance simulations must necessarily go elsewhere, because the philosophy behind the Ubisoft production rests on a very different, festive and carefree concept, light years away from frustration and performance anxiety. Framed in this precise interpretation, the effort of the French house therefore remains an authentic point of reference for the entire genre. Just Dance 2014 is once again one of the best party games out there A bit of everything' Obviously the crucial point for a title of this type is represented by the tracklist, an element that is certainly not easily judged for a product that is so transversal in its target user. Just Dance 2014 basically offers around fifty songs from very different genres and eras, and for this reason it's quite natural to notice contrasts and predict that it's difficult for a player to appreciate all the songs available. Together with the nightmare of all wedding parties or Y.M.C.A. and classics like I Will Survive and Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! yes there are modern performers like Lady Gaga, PSY, Nicki Minaj, Robin Thicke and Ke$ha, but also questionable inclusions like George Michael's Careless Whisper, Prince Ali from Disney's Aladdin, or simply songs that in our latitudes are little or not at all popular. The online store allows (or rather will allow, given the few tracks present so far) certainly to expand the tracklist according to one's tastes, but going to draw on the wallet again. Closed the parenthesis, however, the different game modes deserve a separate discussion, which try with good results to give greater variety to the basic gameplay by also exploiting the Wii U GamePad with exclusive modes in the specific case. These include, for example, the ability to sing like a sort of karaoke using the microphone, or - with the Party Master option - build the choreography piece by piece that your friends will have to perform by selecting the next step to propose via the touch screen. To add further load to the public ridicule one can also record trwatch the camera short sequences of their performances, to then share online with the rest of the community. However, the online element is more deeply exploited, for the first time in the series, by a real multiplayer that allows up to 8 users to challenge each other to the last step even without having to be in the same living room. The On Stage novelty is very nice, which in practice puts a player in the role of the Star and two others to perform a support choreography, thus replicating a real live performance.", "date": "2013-10-08", "grade": "8.0"}
