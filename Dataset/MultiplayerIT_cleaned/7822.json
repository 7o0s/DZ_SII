We are referring in particular to the introduction of the NINE Season 2009 narrative mode, finally capable of characterizing the franchise even in its obligatory annual cadence. The inevitable update in terms of teams, drivers and tracks is this time accompanied by a more intransigent and simulative, which loses accessibility and requires commitment, but at the same time boasts an undeniable depth. In terms of content, however, the offer is rather traditional, proposing the solid Managerial Career and the accompanying methods to which is also added a local multiplayer via split-screen. Structure MotoGP 22, an exciting track chase Let's start with the contents, which on the one hand reproduce the offer seen as early as the 2020 edition, with the interesting Managerial Career and the inevitable side dish made up of individual grand prix, championships, time attacks and advanced tutorials; on the other they introduce the great novelty of the NINE Season 2009 mode, created in collaboration with the director Mark Neale. It is a narrative story mode inspired by the usual Formula 1: Drive to Survive, that is what has always been missing from the MotoGP series which the need was definitely felt: a series of no less than thirty-nine scenarios, divided into seventeen chapters and introduced by documentary-style sequences, which recount Valentino Rossi's feat in the 2009 MotoGP championship. However, we will not always find ourselves wearing the role of the driver from the Marches, but we will also have to alternate in command of the other protagonists of that extraordinary season, such as Stoner, Pedrosa and Lorenzo, trying from time to time to complete specific objectives on the track in order to retrace the faithfully what happened in that championship. The mix of narrated introduction, interview clips and filmed sequences works very well, giving emphasis to the action and generating a great feeling of involvement with the events, which, moreover, are offered with a reasonably short duration. Ultimately, a pleasant and interesting tribute (the last?) to the incredible career of Valentino Rossi. Gameplay MotoGP 22, an overtaking on the straight As mentioned at the beginning, the gameplay side MotoGP 22 pushes the accelerator on the simulation even further, thus proposing a rather uncompromising driving model, which does not discount the management of braking and adds a further substrate of difficulty emphasizing the importance of the trajectories ideals. If you don't know the series and come from any simcade, you'll find yourself going long in every single corner, unable to lean as necessary, even in the presence of the numerous aids available by default. The key obviously lies in practice and in this sense both the tutorial and the MotoGP Academy prove to be fundamental for understanding how the various mechanics work once on the track. MotoGP 22, a night race Like any self-respecting simulation, the Milestone title therefore requires long, intense sessions on the track in order to memorize where to brake and how to take each hairpin bend, experiment with any changes to the set-up and find the best approach. The improvement is around the corner, but it must be conquered and it is not a trivial undertaking, even if the many options help to make the experience concretely progressive. Unfortunately, some aspects of the game still need filings: the artificial intelligence system A.N.N.A. it is often too aggressive, opening up to intentional cuts and impacts that in reality occur very rarely. Luckily collisions don't mathematically determine a crash as happened in the past, but on this front the Italian team still has work to do and the rewind function cannot be the answer to all questions. Graphics and sound MotoGP 22 returns an excellent sense of speed also thanks to the motion blur MotoGP 22 boasts a good graphic realization but once again, and in particular on next-gen platforms, the distance compared to the more famous racers is evident. In particular, the improvements made to the visual sector of the game compared to previous editions appear timid and there is still a bit of pop-up on some tracks. On PS5 the game runs at a stable 60 fps, an essential aspect also for of the precision of the controls, and supports the analog triggers going to significantly increase the resistance to pressure to simulate the real commands of the bike. The sound can count on very realistic effects and the narration of the NINE Season 2009 mode is always engaging, but as far as Guido Meda's commentary is concerned, once again it is limited to introductions and conclusions, without any comment in between.", "date": "2022-04-24", "grade": "8.0"}
