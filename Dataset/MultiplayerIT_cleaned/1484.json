{"name": "Amped 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/amped-2_a.html", "text": "The amazement of a leap beyond all limits... Amped 2, like its predecessor, does not follow the mechanics of a snowboard racing game, but those of a skill contest where the winner, at the end of the descent, has scored the most points by performing spectacular evolutions. The offline game revolves around the Career mode, in which, after having created your alter ego by choosing from hundreds of possible combinations, you will have to pass a series of tests spread over the various mountains reconstructed in the game. The basic challenges consist in achieving a certain High Score and pre-established Average Points, or those achieved in some areas of the track marked by rotating cameras, which indicate the presence of a journalist who will take a snapshot of your jump. Once these two preliminary tests have been passed, a sponsor will have to be convinced to give you his support, performing the evolutions that most strike him until he becomes Amped (astonished, amazed), to create a series of tricks to have a camera and, finally, to defeat a snowboard Pro, following him step by step in a short but very intense race. To completely conquer a mountain you can also decide to perform a set number of tricks or explore every inch of the slopes in search of some snowmen, but these tests are not necessary to progress in the game. Once these steps have been passed, an event will be unlocked, in which you will race with seven other boarders and you will have to beat them by achieving the best placement, calculated on the average of the points scored in the best High Score, in the greatest Average Points, in the Trick with the highest score and in the most spectacular combination of Trick. Xbox Live Enabled! Up to 8 players can challenge each other on Xbox Live, simply by descending from a mountain and achieving the highest score among all online players at that moment (Just Ride) or by setting the rules between 4 pre-established modes (Session Mode). High Score, where the winner among 8 players with the highest score; Best Trick, which will reward those who make the single evolution with the highest score; King of The Mountain, with a series of pre-established points along the way, in which to achieve the highest score: whoever at the end of the path will be prevailed in the greatest number of them will win; Trick Race, the funniest, a race where whoever arrives first at the end wins. The trick lies in the fact that along the descent there are pre-established sections in which to achieve a certain score. If you fail, you will be blocked for a few seconds. The lords of the snow Understanding the gameplay of Amped 2, the difficulties and the charm it brings with it, necessarily passes through the description of the commands and, believe me, it is worth reading carefully. The fulcrum of the whole game is the left analog lever of the pad, with this you head to the right or left, you accelerate or brake when you proceed adhering to the ground; when you are in the air you can perform rotations to the left or right or somersaults forward or backward; by pressing it, you make the ~butter~ or you can connect several tricks in sequence. The tricks in the air are performed with the right analog stick (there is one for each direction) and by combining this with pressing the triggers, further variations are performed; with the analog triggers, two other types of rotations are carried out and the table is inclined when the grinds (the slides) are carried out on the railings or on the trunks of the trees; pressing the A button accelerates and releasing it you perform jumps, with B you activate the possibility of grinding on edges and with Y you perform other tricks. The novelty of this sequel is the introduction of the Skate, a different type of board, where the snowboarders' feet are not fixed, but free to leave the support like a normal skateboard. This translates into a vehicle with much more stable control, less fast and which allows further evolutions. When you are in this mode, therefore, another key will be added, X, with which to jump from the table, make it rotate and then land on it again. Of course, further combinations are possible by pressing the button and the analog levers. The real challenge of Amped 2 lies in the understanding and complete acquisition of these techniques, since you will need to have a good command of them to continue in fashioncareer ity. The fears of being left on your own in tackling this task are dispelled by a very detailed tutorial system, which explains every possible evolution in detail. The problem is that even in this case, as in all recent Microsoft productions, the video texts and speech are left entirely in English, without the slightest localization and in this case it can only be considered as a serious shortcoming. However, managing to overcome this obstacle and if the game system is able to capture you, the challenge will prove to be compelling and you will find yourself cheering aloud every time you have successfully achieved combinations of tricks, jumps and grinds on the edge of reality. Among other things, in this new chapter, the execution of jumps and somersaults has been made easier than in the first episode, where falling after an evolution was far from an exception. Snow everywhere, as far as the eye can see. Amped 2's graphics are perfectly calibrated to the kind of experience the programmers wanted to render. The mountains are immense and disappear as far as the eye can see under your jumps and acrobatics. Lots of different surfaces, icy and snowy, marked by different sound effects, which faithfully render the spectacle of a mountain equipped at every point for these crazy snow tightrope walkers. The frame rate travels at 30 fps, but without any uncertainty and, considering the amount of polygons and the reverb and lighting effects, the result is decidedly satisfying. The animations are also good, if we exclude some problems given by the sequences that link some tricks together. The soundtrack is absolutely above average: a hundred unpublished songs that pass in continuous streaming in the speakers of the stereo, without interruptions of any kind. Some are really beautiful and deserve to be on a sound track sold separately, including grunge, alt rock, hip hop and ambient music. Comment Amped 2 is a deep and fun game, but only for those who know how to accept sometimes really prohibitive challenges. The complexity and executive difficulty of the real counterpart of this sport are rendered in an even too faithful way, through a command system that will make you wish on several occasions to have at least a couple more fingers, but which will be able to give great gratification once dominated. There are many slopes and just as many challenges proposed to conquer each mountain, in a game system that is captivating for technical players, but frustrating for those looking only for crazy descents on snow-covered mountains. The heart of Amped 2's eventual success will all lie in the Xbox Live community that will form, given that the Microsoft game, in the online dimension, gets rid of all limits and frustrations given by a not perfectly calibrated difficulty curve. Descending with eight friends and feeling free to launch yourself from incredible slopes with the sun in your face and the wind brushing your hair, without the nagging of targets imposed by the CPU, is a liberating and unrepeatable act. The only perplexity is that a certain Top Spin and the upcoming Project Gotham Racing 2 may limit the good sensations of Amped 2 to a small circle of Trick Masters. Pros: Xbox Live enabled Long and demanding Excellent graphics and exceptional sound commentary Cons: No localization in Italian Gameplay perhaps too complex for the general public 9 The first to have to believe in Xbox Live was Microsoft to indicate to third parties and users what was the true strength of Xbox and the feature that most distinguishes it from competing consoles: a stable online gaming service, easy to understand and use and complete. After a somewhat hesitant start, this winter the words have definitely moved on to deeds with a plethora of games coming out, all Live enabled. Amped 2, which also relies on the XSN service (the link will take you straight to our special), is the sequel to one of the most successful sports games of the first line up of the green crusade console, the one that has been called the Snowbard game for snowboarders.", "date": "2003-11-16", "grade": null}
