{"name": "Lineage 2M", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lineage-2m-recensione.html", "text": "There is now little to quibble about the strangeness of video games that play themselves, because autoplay is now an integral part of the mobile meanings of RPG in general and MMOPRG in particular. So let's (partially) clear the field of the usual arguments to deal with the Lineage 2M review, because otherwise we fall back into the same issues already addressed several other times in the past. In fact, this system was massively introduced in the first wave of online RPGs for mobile platforms, of which Lineage 2: Revolution was one of the major exponents. We can now almost consider it a distinctive feature of the series that could not be missing even in this new evolved version of the NCsoft game for smartphones. With the series having been a mass phenomenon in Korea for years now, this 2M represents a project specifically designed for the mobile market and therefore focuses on some choices made for the best possible use in this context, in particular as regards the interface, controls and graphics. It remains a brick of considerable proportions, mind you: starting from the installation that requires almost 10 GB of space to have the complete contents available, Lineage 2M only reiterates how the traditional MMORPG is a technically difficult genre to transfer to mobile platforms. as intrinsically heavy in terms of technical and amount of content. If this seems to be absolutely not a problem in its country of origin, in the West where lighter and more dynamic experiences are often sought on smartphones, this considerable weight of the game can be quite a deterrent, also given the huge amount of resources required to make it work at best, in terms of hardware, display and battery consumption. In any case, those who want a rather full MMORPG experience close to the origins, at least in terms of atmosphere, can find some satisfaction in Lineage 2M: the attack is already simply epic, with an initial sequence that illustrates a great siege complete with dragons and the appearance of the super villain, filled with cut-scenes in computer graphics and dramatic fights. Mobile MMORPG between evolution and classicism In Linage 2M characters are related in appearance to race and class The setting is very classic starting from the story, which stages the usual quest of the chosen one (~Inheritor~ in this case) who, once his special power has been awakened, must launch himself into the fight against the evil Etis, crossing diverse and completing a huge amount of missions, including both PvE and PvP elements. Respecting the classic characteristics of the genre is a bit the backbone of all Lineage 2M to tell the truth, starting from the very concept of the game: Ncsoft's idea is to bring the standard PC MMORPG to mobile platforms and, to do so , also in this case it followed the same approach already used by Lineage 2: Revolution at the time (here our review) and by several other similar titles, transferring as much as possible the standard features of the genre from the computer to portable devices. This in itself involves various problems due to the different size of the screens, the peculiarities of the hardware and the interface, things that have led to adopting the autoplay solution to streamline the inevitable cumbersomeness, but introducing, in this way, a even more tedious system because it is simply based on a linear and purely ~numerical~ progression as regards the evolution of the character. This new chapter improves something in this sense: the interface has been studied from scratch in order to work best on smartphones and it is therefore much clearer and more practical than that of the original Lineage 2: Revolution, just as the combat system is streamlined and more dynamic, with a technical construct also as regards the graphics that adapts much better to mobile hardware while maintaining always a remarkable richness, scaling resolution and performance when necessary in a convincing way. Lineage 2M, a boss fight On the other hand, some problems remain and in some ways some strange steps backwards compared to current standards are also noted: customization is penalized by the absence of a real editor, which is strange considering what competitors offer, as well as classes and races can be a little stripped down to the bone. There are five races (human, elf, dark elf, orc, dwarf), each tied to a single variant as gender of the character and which in turn have practically the same types of fighter (knight, warrior, wizard, archer, cleric ). Aoptionally, this too, which recalls the origins of the classic MMORPG but which can be a bit limiting compared to the customization, progression and specialization systems seen elsewhere. Some good ideas emerge in the combat system, which allows the use of a considerable quantity of even spectacular special abilities, however the main problem remains the gameplay: the structure is based on fetch quests and decidedly repetitive fights, while the control system with the typical touch screen inconvenience inevitably pushes towards autoplay. At least, an attempt made by the developers to limit this mechanic can be detected, which becomes compulsive with the need for grinding: in the more advanced levels, the need to explore the settings more deeply, going in search of Codex and other objects becomes clear needed to unlock more special skills. This further exploration, in some cases, cannot be carried out automatically, thus pushing for direct control of the characters, but above all it concerns secondary quests, while the main parts of the game can be easily automated.", "date": "2021-12-17", "grade": "6.5"}
