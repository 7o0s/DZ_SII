The Redmond-based company gave us the code for the multiplayer mode, called Wrecking Zone, a few hours before the embargo expired, so our impressions are enriched by a handful of hours spent with the multiplayer. We want to underline this because the most important feature of this title, that cloud computing heralded since the trailer from the announcement of E3 2014, was only appreciable for a few hours. It is a technological manifesto of Microsoft, a manifesto which however remained in the drawer for a long time and which in the meantime has already been used by others with very encouraging results. In short, Crackdown 3 could have been ahead of its time, but instead it trudges in the current times. A game that requires such a long gestation (five years), which is postponed several times, which even changes the developer, could hardly reach memorable heights. History Those who have played the previous titles already know what to expect: Crackdown 3 is a third-person action free roaming where the protagonist, wandering around the city of New Providence, has the task of dismantling the TerraNova organization and its fearsome dominatrix Elizabeth Niemand. Technically, the area where the final boss is located could be reached almost from the beginning, but the statistics would not allow it to last for more than a few seconds. Therefore it is advisable (if not necessary) to upgrade them following the typical philosophy of the game: ~more kills, more skills~. There are five skills at our disposal: effectiveness with firearms, skill in handling explosive objects, strength in unarmed combat, agility and skill in driving. While the first three are perfected by dint of shooting and sending enemies to the cemetery, the other two increase above all by participating in races which are the only diversions present in the Sumo Digital title. Each member of the TerraNova organization has dealt with a sector that allows dominion over the city: we find Reza Khan who controls the toxic gas mines for the production of Chimera, the ultimate weapon; R.O.X.Y., the robot who takes care of the monorail; Vargas evil mastermind behind the toxic waste disposal. In total there are seven that make up the pyramid at the top of which Niemand sits. Each of these areas is highlighted on the map; once all are freed, the position of the respective boss appears where to go to give life to a spectacular fight to the death. The bosses differ from traditional enemies above all in terms of firepower and the amount of health, while we were unable to appreciate particular strategies. The protagonist is Terry Crews The main character is Agent Isaiah Jaxon, played by actor/athlete Terry Crews (among his latest works we remember Deadpool 2). His stage presence has a good impact in the presentation film; unfortunately during the game using his avatar or one of the others available (some are unlocked by collecting fragments of DNA scattered around the map) has the only appreciable effect of seeing some skills permanently modified. This is the ideal man if you want to punch everyone who comes in front of you, a little less if you prefer greater control over the vehicles, but from here to say that the way to play varies according to the chosen character, there are wants. The plot is a mere pretext to justify the action, but this may not be the limit. There have been titles that have not made the depth of history their strong point since the days of Duke Nukem, but at least the demented and quotationistic declination of a Saints Row made up for the excessive linearity of the events and the stereotyping of the characters. Not even a light-hearted irony intervenes in Crackdown 3, despite the voiceovers trying to convey it. More work could have been done on this point, as well as on the interlude scenes which, unlike the introduction, are represented by simple animated tables. The combat system Crackdown 3's combat system is arguably best done - the action is fast-paced and you shoot seamlessly at enemies appearing from every direction, including from the air. The fact that health is not recharged by medkits but is recovered with kills (the same happened in previous episodes) means that the player never hides in some corner waiting to find the right opening to strike with precision, but rather that it continually moves to one sideto the other, jumping and exploiting, in addition to the power of firearms, also that of bare arms. The variety of villains is discreet: in addition to the inevitable criminals, dressed in yellow or red, and some junkies with gas masks, we find robots of various sizes, some of which are decidedly large. These are the circumstances where the game gives its best, between explosions that light up the screen and acrobatic evolutions of the protagonist. The number of weapons is varied and each one involves a different approach to the others, but we felt that the more powerful ones, such as the rocket launcher and the guided missile launcher, have a slightly too large magazine. The aiming system (in the lower difficulty levels there is the aim assist) works well; the movements are fluid and it is possible to perform aerial evolutions easily and the uncertainties of the camera are minimal. The famous interaction with the environment, in this mode, is extremely limited: you can pick up and throw some flammable bins and a few other objects (chairs, wardrobes, pieces of destroyed robots) that only serve as a means of offense. Exploiting the destructibility of structures to take out hordes of enemies is not on the agenda and therefore, at least in this case, one of the key points of the game is missing. The driving model is forgettable and the fact that there is no GPS that indicates the best way to get to the selected point means that the use of cars is sporadic and limited above all to speed challenges. The artificial intelligence is not evil: the most advanced enemies adopt the most effective offensive techniques with which they are equipped, even if they hunt the player following basic patterns. Understand for yourself, however, how the bad guys are nothing but cannon fodder that helps keep the explosive engine of the game running. The destructible scenery The theme of the destructible scenario is by no means new in the world of video games: since the first Red Faction some titles have relied on the physical capabilities of the game engine to attract attention. Indeed, Ageia, before being acquired by NVIDIA, had launched the PPU PhysX, a chip dedicated to the management of the homonymous library. The results had been encouraging as witnessed by Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter and Mirror's Edge. We are talking about the Jurassic era (2006/2007); nevertheless the limited resources of the latest generation consoles have not changed the balance much. Hence the choice to take advantage of Microsoft Azure servers through the Cloudgine engine to help Xbox One in the onerous task of maintaining a decent frame rate while the dozens of polygons that make up the buildings splash from all sides. It is an API developed by the homonymous Scottish company whose founders include Dave Jones, the creative director of the first Crackdown, as well as other successful titles such as the Lemmings saga. The software house was acquired last year by Epic. The City of New Providence New Providence looks like a futuristic version of Sleeping Dogs Hong Kong: it is divided into eleven small neighborhoods and each has its own stylistic register. Nonetheless, we had the feeling that we were walking through the streets of a colorful ghost town. The inhabitants, who appear here and there, are simple puppets placed just to fill the spaces, and do not interact in any way with the player except by running away when a pawn is hit. There are no shops to visit or bases to develop; in reality there is really no possibility to explore the buildings, despite the initial promises, so all the action takes place between the buildings of the metropolis. For all that has been said, the exploratory section is rarely stimulating, and the numerous blue globes scattered in the most improbable points are of little use, because in the end you manage to live very well without them. A shortcoming that is difficult to forgive for free roaming is the lack of secondary activities. The liberation missions are almost all identical to each other (basically it is a question of besieging enemy forts by destroying some neuralgic structures) with the only and pleasant exception of the radio towers which represent demanding reflex challenges, requiring excellent coordination to reach points impervious jumping between platforms. The character does not have a hideout (only checkpoints from which to restart in case of death), nor can it be aesthetically customized, therefore the entire evolutionary tree is entrusted to the field experience of which we initially wrote. The graphics From a graphic point of view there is little to add to what the images say. It is clearly a title that suffers greatly from the weight of the yearsthe past and that tries to mask the paucity of details with a pleasant and not too marked cel-shading, but the users' eyes are now accustomed to other standards. The explosions are still well done and there are moments of spectacularity, especially during firefights with many enemies present at the same time, thanks also to the HDR support, but it is really too little to say that the Unreal Engine 4 has been exploited on duty. The buildings are of a disarming flatness, the animations are reminiscent of those of a mobile game; the textures are few and recycled. The characters themselves are characterized by a character design that will certainly not go down in history. At least the frame rate (unlimited as far as the PC is concerned) is stable. Even the audio is not particularly noticeable: the dubbing is only in English and the composer has certainly been inspired by the previous chapters and has looped a remix of the original soundtrack. All in all, the noises of the explosions are pleasant. Longevity, in the light of what has been written so far, is below the standards of similar titles. In theory, the final credits could be reached in five or six hours, leaving out most of the secondary bosses. To complete it adequately, however, it is necessary to at least triple this amount of time, for a value that remains low in absolute terms. The co-op mode should add some spice to the single player experience, but we weren't able to test it thoroughly. The multiplayer Microsoft provided us with the code for the online client shortly before the embargo expired: this allowed reviewers to compete against each other in two private sessions each lasting a couple of hours. We realize this is too small to provide a definitive judgement, and reserve the right to adjust our positions once it becomes available to all buyers; therefore expect a dedicated special in the coming weeks. However, we do not want to refrain from sharing our experience. The choice of character skin is purely aesthetic and does not affect the way you play. There are two modes, both in teams with up to five players each: they are called Agent Hunter and Territories. In the first you have to collect the badge dropped by an opponent killed within ten seconds of his death: after this time it self-destructs and the team will not get any points. The first of the two teams to reach 25 (or, alternatively, who will be in the lead after the ten minutes of the match), will be the winner. In Territories, on the other hand, you have to conquer and defend an area of the map: maintaining it will allow you to win points. There are initially a couple of them, each of which can provide a maximum of fifty points. Once exhausted, two more will appear on the map, until a team has managed to get 250 points. The maps are completely different from that of the single player, and not only in terms of design: they are in fact completely destructible and the number of polygons that move on the screen is remarkable. We still have doubts about the actual usefulness of so much destruction, as the extreme mobility of the players can hardly be limited by some building falling apart. The only appreciable tactical variant is that you can't hide because the game highlights the position of allies and enemies and therefore you might be tempted to bazooka hit a wall to get directly to your opponent. Two types of weapons can be carried: a heavy one like missile launchers, which however is slow and requires open spaces, and a light one which has ultimately proved to be much more effective. You can choose one of two gadgets to equip: an additional shield or a device to make vertical jumps, absolutely useless. A choice that we have considered frankly inconceivable is the auto aim: once hooked it is almost impossible to get out of the reach of an enemy. The only explanation is cross-play between Xbox One and PC, a platform where players, being equipped with a mouse and keyboard, could have too obvious an advantage over those using a joypad. Scattered around the map there are red globes that should increase the character's stats but whose usefulness we honestly struggled to appreciate. Sadly, our trials left us extremely frustrated. The matchmaking was really long, but this could be justified by the small number of participants. In an hour and a half of practice we managed to take part in only six games. We have noticed in a couple of cases some problems in balancing the teams, in particular", "date": "2019-02-14", "grade": "5.0"}
