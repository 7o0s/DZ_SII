Decorated trees, gifts everywhere, colored lights and a nice warm fireplace are a perfect scenario for a Zombie-themed game, just a pity that we are in March and more than Christmas we think of Easter and outings with friends. Already present since day one in the Windows Store, the Capcom Vancouver title opens up to an even wider market and to one of the most active communities in the PC world, releasing an updated and improved version of its product that includes all free updates and DLC so far released. Among other innovations, there are two new game difficulties ~Hard~ and ~Black Friday~, which basically make the treatments less effective and the weapons less durable... but will it be enough to intrigue the players of the Valve platform? Dead Rising 4 arrives on Steam: let the zombie slaughter begin! The return of Frank West Although it has already been properly covered in our review of the Xbox version, it seems right to us to take stock of the situation. In Dead Rising 4 returns the original protagonist of the saga, Frank West, in the role of a reporter on the hunt for the perfect scoop. The game gravitates around the humor of the protagonist, proposing extravagant situations and funny gags that characterize the saga proposed by Capcom. Several changes have been made to the gameplay, further refined than in the past but with very questionable additions that do not integrate well with the game itself. We are talking about the presence of the Stealth which allows us to stealthily take down enemies, absolutely useless considering the arsenal of weapons available and the continuous chaos that can be generated thanks to them. Equally criticized, Frank West's camera presented as an intriguing addition to the gameplay instead ends up slowing it down further, forcing the player into investigative sessions where you will have to take pictures of key elements or use the various camera filters to solve trivial puzzles or find secrets . Moving on to the good news, the number of zombies on screen increases and slaughtering them has never been so much fun thanks to the excellent inventory management that allows us to quickly switch between our tools of mass destruction. The range of colors proposed by the game is now more lively and colorful, also thanks to the Christmas atmosphere of the fourth chapter of the saga. The weapon crafting system is very basic but well implemented in the game, unlikely combinations of objects now become instruments of death capable of exterminating entire hordes of zombies in a short time, provided that you have the schematic to then replicate the weapon. While these are present in large quantities, the combo vehicles are very few and it will not be uncommon to always find yourself running with the same vehicle due to the few dedicated schemes. The game world is not very large, but still full of collectibles, easter eggs and references to the many titles in the Capcom universe. The open world also revisits the iconic department store seen in the first chapter and adds an entire explorable city full of zombies, psychopaths and mini events that will continue to pique the player's attention by catapulting him here and there in the game world now free from the ~timer~ of the missions which instead forced, in the previous chapters of the saga, to complete the story in a certain amount of time. However, the flaws already reported remain, such as extremely superficial boss battles, the absence of kinematics for the various Psychos which almost seem like a last minute addition and a very disappointing narrative. The PC version Fortunately, the PC version of Dead Rising 4 is quite convincing. In addition to running well on our hardware without encountering particular anomalies, the technical level is much higher than that seen on Xbox One and the vast selection of graphics options confirms the first impression. Considering the classic situation, where thousands of zombies populate the game scene, reaching a very stable configuration is certainly not easy. To do this, the development team has introduced a solution similar to that of the dynamic resolution seen on the console: the Dynamic Load Scaling which dynamically reduces the resolution according to the chosen target, in order to keep the framerate stable. In fact, the player can select 30 or 60 frames per second as a goal, considering however that correct functioning occurs only if accompanied by the right settings. In short, it is not a magic key that adapts the game to our PC (for that there are many external tools), but an option to be exploited in case drops occur during gameplay.It must be said, our experience before using this function was quite a dancer despite the PC used for the test having all the credentials to make the most of Dead Rising 4. Dynamic Load Scaling is therefore a function definitely aimed at PCs less performing, but to be considered also on more performing configurations since the actual drop in image quality is almost imperceptible. Spending a few lines instead on the overall technical realization, the Capcom title on PC renders very well and the first impact having played the console version immediately goes to the volumetric light and the excellent quality of the reflections, however the lack of attention to the faces and various secondary elements of the scenario not cared for. The experience with mouse and keyboard is perfectly enjoyable, the controls are well designed and the ability to map each key in order to adapt the gaming experience to your style is a great plus. Ultimately, the Steam version is undoubtedly successful, the title is ready to embrace the Valve community and reunite with the many fans of the saga who have not been able to play it due to the exclusive storm. Considering the world of bad porting around, the fourth chapter of the extravagant zombie-themed saga can instead boast a good technical sector suitable for all players with a good PC.", "date": "2017-03-22", "grade": "7.5"}
