{"name": "Sonic the Hedgehog", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-the-hedgehog_a.html", "text": "The early days of Console War. Fifteen years ago, the dialectic skirmishes between passionate owners of Mega Drive and SuperNes were no less heated than those that develop today in the forums of Multiplayer.it. The Nintendo console, equipped with a graphics chip specially dedicated to rotations of bitmaps and sprites (the legendary Mode7), lent the side of the Megadrive in terms of CPU speed. And it was precisely on that peculiarity that SEGA decided to focus to create a platform able to stand out among the multitude of exponents of the genre. And indeed the choice was spot on. Sonic the Hedgehog was a technical prodigy: the blue hedgehog darted at breakneck speed along colorful and varied stages, driven by crazy inertia he went through multiple loops, whirling his red lacquered shoes like a mad blender. It slipped into twisting tunnels, twirled in the sky collecting clouds of glittering rings, darted everywhere, shot left and right by springs, ramps, slides and carousels of all kinds. The aim of the game was to collect as many rings as possible, scattered throughout levels that developed considerably even vertically, offering the player a choice: a ~sprint~ completion of the stage, almost in apnea, collecting just that handful of rings that guaranteed immunity; or a deeper exploration of the level, finding alternative ways, hidden bonuses, 1-ups, secret passages. ~Plin-plin~ is the sound of Super Mario's coins, and the same sound is made by Sonic's floating rings; the function they have in the two games is different: where the plumber collects them exclusively for scoring purposes, the hedgehog loses a life if he is hit by an opponent when he has nothing in his pocket. Furthermore, accumulating rings is essential to access the bonus stages, psychedelic whirling labyrinths that Sonic faces to get his hands on the ~chaos emeralds~, six precious stones which, once collected, give access only to the alternative ending of the game, and not to the transformation into SuperSonic. for which we had to wait for the second chapter of the series. But the mission could be said to be fully accomplished right from this first episode; SEGA had found the mascot it was looking for, as well as the unforgettable idol to deliver to the children of the MegaDrive. Be a hedgehog today. Sonic is still a valid platformer. Lovers of the genre will appreciate its distinctive features. The great speed of play, although sobbing already from the second world, makes the formula particularly enjoyable. The level design is very varied and well thought out, even if the frenetic pace is often broken; you proceed in jerks, when instead you just want to flow smoothly and go, run again and again. Sonic's most penalizing limit is undoubtedly its longevity: a total of 20 poor levels, which a novice would have no difficulty completing in less than two hours. Scarce quantity even then, unsatisfactory when compared with both contemporary and more recent 2D exponents. Collecting the bonus gems is little incentive to replay, considering the meager reward you receive. Available immediately at a cost of 8 (800 points), Sonic is a must-buy for fans of the genre. The others evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a fun but too short gaming experience. Genesis of an icon. The year was 1991 and the contest for supremacy in the video game market was played out between two Japanese giants: Nintendo and Sega. The Kyoto house came from a glittering decade, son of the successes of NES and GameBoy, consecrated by the worldwide affirmation of that timeless icon that responds to the name of Super Mario. For its part, SEGA could not count on an ambassador of this level. It was to fill this gap that the figure of the anthropomorphic blue hedgehog was born, super-fast and eager for golden rings: Sonic, in fact. A charismatic character, bold and a bit of a braggart, who was entrusted with the mission of relaunching SEGA in the 16bit generation, after that of the 8bit had ended with an almost total domination of the Nintendo consoles.", "date": "2007-02-12", "grade": null}
