{"name": "Pocket Kingdom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pocket-kingdom.html", "text": "Management is better than fighting However, the game structure of this promising Sega production is different from traditional MMORPGs, in fact relying almost exclusively on management and organizational aspects. In Pocket Kingdom the player is in fact called upon to take on the role of a sort of general within the world of Ulgress, with the simple and ambitious goal of being able to conquer it and therefore become its absolute ruler. We were talking about the game structure: with a certainly appreciable choice, the programmers have decided to reveal the possibilities offered to the protagonist step by step, through a sort of constant tutorial which however does not prevent you from starting your work right away. The first steps are therefore limited to the possibility of buying troops from the shop, divided into various classes, to form small teams of 4 soldiers each; this passage is one of the foundations of Pocket Kingdom, since it is precisely through these teams that it is possible to discover the territory on the main map, find enemy castles and possibly attack them. Within each of these groups the player can control some aspects of primary importance, such as the position in the ~deployment~ (magicians behind and soldiers in front, as usual), their attitude during the fights and their equipment. This last variable, the equipment, opens the door for one of the most questionable choices of Pocket Kingdom, since it is in fact possible to associate only one object with each unit. So there is a choice: is it better to provide a weapon to have greater attack power or armor, to guarantee a high defense? Although this limitation can also be read in a strategic key, we would have preferred to have more freedom in equipping our men. It is also a pity not to see the actual aesthetic implementation on the appearance of the latter, which will always maintain the same appearance whatever object you wear. The importance of organizing one's troops is a real cornerstone of the gameplay offered by Pocket Kingdom, since during battles the player has no faculty of interaction; all that can be done is in fact to observe one's own forces collide with the opposing ones, and wait for the final verdict determined by the characteristics of the two sides. Surely this choice represents the main point to be addressed for anyone wishing to attempt the adventure of Sega production: while strategy lovers could in fact appreciate this mechanic, on the contrary those who are more inclined to action could find the experience offered unsatisfying. There is also the possibility, through the use of special emblems, of developing the level of each individual unit, thus increasing its characteristics. Patience is the virtue of the strong Losing one of your soldiers in combat means losing him and his equipment forever. Hence, Pocket Kingdom offers the possibility of treating the wounded at the cost of some loot, the currency used in the game. But of course that's not all; after having introduced the aspects relating to the control and management of one's troops, the Sega production confronts the player with a further aspect of fundamental importance in the overall economy, namely the creation of weapons and armor. The steps are simple, but extremely important: first of all you need to buy a mold and a metal, the quality of which will obviously be proportional to its price and its rarity. Secondly, it will be possible to decide whether to add a couple of further ~ingredients~, such as precious stones capable of giving secondary characteristics to objects. Partially putting a spoke in the works to such an interesting aspect, however, intervenes the impossibility of buying, selling or managing more than one element at a time, making some steps repetitive and frustrating not only in the process of creating objects, but also in numerous other moments in the game. Not being able to buy, for example, 10 pieces of metal in one go, but having to repeat the process ten times for each single piece is frankly a simply stupid design choice. More generally, playing Pocket Kingdom gives on more than a few occasions the sensation of a heaviness and slowness in navigating through the menus that could certainly have been avoided by means of some simple expedients, such as assigning ~shortcuts~ to the numerous keys of the N-Gage. On the contrary, the programmers have decided to use only two: 5, to confirm, and 7, to refuse or go back in the screens. From a technical point of view, the Sega production resultspleasant and characterized by an appreciable style: the use of a cartoony and super-deformed design helps to defuse the events, and the excellent use of colors combined with the high level of detail of the settings overall makes the visual component of Pocket Kingdom entirely fit for purpose. The same cannot be said of the sound, made up of a few boring background tracks and bare-bones effects. The online mode allows you to pit your best troops against those of human opponents scattered all over the world, but not only that: the programmers have also included a fun auction system for the sale of items, a kind of text chat and a ranking world championship to climb victory after victory. Comment Pocket Kingdom is a unique game of its kind. Without surprising for particular peaks of originality, the Sega production is in fact an atypical product, thanks to a gameplay based almost exclusively on the managerial and tactical factor without allowing any space for action. Which, if on the one hand it could certainly make lovers of the genre appreciate the title in question, on the other it could annoy those who do not digest the reasoned rhythms and the inevitable repetitiveness of the proposed mechanics. To this must be added some truly questionable design choices, which if resolved would have certainly made Pocket Kingdom more enjoyable. Nonetheless, Sega's effort undoubtedly has qualities, it is made with care, and in the current list of games available for the N-Gage it finds its place perfectly. Pros Challenging game mechanics Good technical setup Interesting online component Cons Some dull design choices Playstyle not for everyone Poor sound Over time repetitive Among the peculiar features of N-Gage, one of the most interesting but at the same time underused was undoubtedly N-Gage Arena, or the online gaming service remotely similar in structure to a sort of X-box Live on mobile phones. Although the idea of challenging other human players anywhere in real time was undoubtedly stimulating, the data transfer limits of GPRS combined with the far from affordable costs of this technology have discouraged both developers and players. Sega wanted to put an end to this waste of resources by developing a sort of MMORPG exclusively for the Nokia home console. Pocket Kingdom, this is the name of the ambitious project, is now finally in our hands: mission accomplished?", "date": "2004-12-15", "grade": null}
