{"name": "Petz Sports: Dog Playground - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/petz-sports-dog-playground-recensione.html", "text": "The Petz brand is definitely one of those that have most followed the new course of the Wii. Ubisoft with this series has always tried to catch the market of boys, girls, girls or simply non-players. The reference to puppies of various species and the tenderness they inspire are clear reminders for a certain type of clientele. Four paws... The creation of the entire series always settles on fairly mediocre quality levels, but in this case we are faced with a slightly more refined and attractive game for other users as well. The basic idea is to manage the life of a nice electronic puppy. Right from the start it is possible to choose from many different breeds, from the German shepherd to the poodle, from the husky to the cowherd, all very well characterized and distinguishable. With this puppy you can then face a series of different activities that allow us to have an ever better relationship with our little virtual pet. It starts in what could be the room of any average child  American, Wasp, rich and resident in a splendid provincial villa!  complete with bed, desk, wardrobe, shelves and games on the floor. The environment is very nice, well done and with nice lighting effects, too bad for some jaggies, really well done! Well done to the decorator and programmer! However, what immediately attracts our attention is our cute little dog, which we obviously chose and baptized first, who immediately welcomes us by jumping, wagging his tail and licking the screen... how cute, and how well he moves. The fur effect is rendered realistically and the movements are well cared for. Also, like all puppies, tenderness oozes from every pore of his well-crafted, polygonal body. All his little friends are equally well reproduced even if they share part of the animation routines which are still many and very pleasant. ...a little face... But what can we do with these beautiful animals? First of all, pamper them! An entire section of the game allows you to scratch our pets in the right places to make them more and more our friends. If at the beginning the paws, the muzzle or the back emit nice little stars when they need to be rubbed, waving the remote control, then the behavior of the ~beast~ must be interpreted in order to manipulate the right thing. Once a special indicator is filled, you change position, for example you get on two legs, and start again until the end of the minigame. Then we can dress them in hundreds of nice ways, from the most to the least ridiculous - a dressed up dog is always a ridiculous dog - whether it's a warm coat or a funny toucan's beak, everything can make some moments of useless leisure pass. Another activity can be playing ball! So here we are, armed with a slingshot and ready to hit the classic targets on the screen but didn't you shoot ducks once upon a time?- with the usual Mote pointer. If you hit the mark, the dog performs a nice flying catch with a jump, otherwise it produces other pleasant recovery animations that are more or less awkward depending on our aim. The lawn where you play is beautiful, full of details and with many well-made trees, of course there are plenty of ladders here too but it is still a pleasure for the eyes! Have you ever seen a dog jumping rope? Well, in Petz Sport they do it and they have to do it also following the rhythm of many different pieces of music. In front of the average child's garage  complete with an average child's car and an average child's playground  one ~arms~ oneself with a rope and follows the instructions of the simple but fun musical game. There aren't many moves  shooting up, right to left, with the pressure of a key and repeated jolts -, but it's still pleasant and fun and then also the environment in which it's set and the dog's moves are very nice and well done ... And A Tail! Our pet can also be trained to perform certain actions. Do you know when a cute little dog gets on two legs, tries to grab its tail, rolls over and then howls satisfied by following the orders given by its owner? Here, these things can be taught through the classic, but always fun, mini-game of ~follow the path on the screen with the pointer~. All this training for this poor puppy, what could it be for? To make him compete in many obstacle course races of course! Starting from the street near the house to get to the biggest stadiums, complete with sponsors, you have to face three other very nice puppies in a race that sees the pet's owner sweat more ... In fact, to make it run you have to shake up and down while the right and left movement allows you to superare the stakes and balance to overcome the balance bar and so on. All very pleasant, certainly already seen, fun and well done thanks to a good progression in the introduction of the moves and the right difficulty. In short, we have quite a lot of fun with these puppies, a pity that the activities to be carried out are a bit few and sometimes they tend to repeat themselves a bit. Two more minigames would certainly have benefited this experience and maybe even a growth and breeding section. Given the average quality that these productions generally have, in this case we find ourselves playing with a pleasant surprise, albeit with the aforementioned limits, well cared for and well made. Comment One is almost surprised to be faced with such a nice and well-maintained product. Ubisoft has created a nice title undermined only by a certain limited content that does not allow you to get a better vote. However, what is there is very well done, pleasant and fun by amalgamating concepts and mechanics already seen in a new and captivating context. Very suitable for a Touch Generation audience with hit and run use, but it also deserves a look from a more experienced audience. Longevity could be limited by repetitiveness as once all activities with a puppy are finished the only thing to do is start over with another breed. Pros Well cared for and well done Entertaining Oozes tenderness Cons Missing at least a couple more games In the long run can be repetitive Replayability dubious", "date": "2008-12-09", "grade": null}
