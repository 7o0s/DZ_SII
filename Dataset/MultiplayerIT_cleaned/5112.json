{"name": "How to Say Goodbye", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/how-to-say-goodbye-recensione.html", "text": "How to Say Goodbye opens with a warning: developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix, friends since school, wanted to talk about loss and mourning. They did it in a kind and positive way, of course, but as with Gris and What Remains of Edith Finch the theme of death is central, and the whole narrative of this French independent title revolves around it. The aesthetic style chosen by the duo, supported from ARTE France, winks at the illustrations by Antoine de Saint-Exupry and the Moomins by Tove Jansson, and the variegated colors of the settings certainly strike the eyes of the players. The puzzle mechanics are equally effective, while the narrative, as we will see, has left us more lukewarm. We will tell you about all these aspects in our How to Say Goodbye review. Getting lost to find yourself The settings of How to Say Goodbye are varied and always of great beauty It's quite common to start a video game adventure with the main character editor, but we've never had to choose the identity of a recently deceased person and his favorite dish, all starting from the hospital room he hosted his last breath. How to Say Goodbye is always delicate in dealing with the difficult theme of death, but its surprising beginning is perhaps the most intense moment for the player, who will inevitably find himself thinking about his own life and recalling a loved one who is no longer there . During the adventure you will play various characters, but in the opening bars you take on the ethereal clothes of the spirit of the person who has just disappeared, looking for a way out of the corridors and rooms of that hospital that we just want to leave behind . The spirit, understandably, wants to go home to his loved ones: a universal story, told by religions and mythologies from all over the world, and also made central in How to Say Goodbye. As will be discovered in the course of the game, however, the spirits, just like those who are left alive, must learn to move forward, otherwise they will become Spleen, ghostly beings unable to accept their own death and condemned to remain in a disturbing limbo for the 'eternity. There is no lack of situations of great poetry, especially in the phases in which a great masterpiece of French literature is mentioned: given the inspirations of How to Say Goodbye, we are sure that the players will not find it difficult to find out which one. However, the narrative soon loses bite and urgency, only to reach a disappointing and abrupt ending that makes the adventure seem incomplete. And it's a shame, because the potential of How to Say Goodbye are many and clearly visible, fortunately better exploited from a gameplay point of view. Always moving The art style of How to Say Goodbye is clean and effective The game mechanics of How to Say Goodbye are so simple and intuitive that they do not require explanations. The protagonists do not move directly, but the boxes on which they rest, and not only they will be dragged, but also all the objects present on the same line. To this basic dynamic are added, during the adventure, many other elements implemented to perfection, capable of forcing the player to review their thought patterns and strategies: black holes, locks, self-propelled components help to keep the l 'attention for all three hours necessary to complete the sixteen chapters of the game. We appreciated the choice of the developers to create puzzles that can be solved in any state: exactly as happens with the famous Rubik's cube, the paintings of How to Say Goodbye can never find themselves in a situation where they need to be reset, and the player can always find the right way through the end-of-level door. A further note of color are the spirits, present in many settings, with whom the protagonists can chat: we have often found ourselves in the situation of wanting to reach them at all costs, punctually discovering interesting characters, each with its own melancholic vision of existence and what comes after its conclusion in the earthly world. The path of the protagonists of How to Say Goodbye is tortuous, but always fun Honorable mention for the aesthetic style adopted by Veltman and Portefaix, always effective, clean and of great beauty in its variegated colors in all the numerous settings of How to Say Goodbye. It is a video game suitable for young and old, but some puzzles are able to put even the most experienced puzzle gamers in difficulty, and this can only be a pleasure for those looking for a fair degree of challenge. The sound accompaniment is also excellent, which keeps a sensation aliveion of dreamlike exploration and, at the same time, allows the player to focus on the puzzles to be solved. Too bad for the absence of an Italian translation, which makes it essential to have at least a basic knowledge of English if you want to appreciate the dialogues: however, remember that to understand the mechanics of the game and conclude the adventure it is not necessary to read any text on screen.", "date": "2022-11-03", "grade": "7.0"}
