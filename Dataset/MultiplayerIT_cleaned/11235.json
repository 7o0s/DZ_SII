{"name": "Tetris Pop", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tetris-pop_a.html", "text": "Many things have changed in the world of video games since 1985, yet Tetris remains a staple. The masterpiece created by Alexey Pajitnov still manages to be current, and especially on portable devices it is re-proposed cyclically, with very few changes to the original structure. Beyond the innumerable more or less successful clones, in fact, the Tetris mechanics are unique and for this very reason it does not feel the weight of the years: the sliding of the bricks has been made faster, the controls have been optimized but the base is always that, and it works fine as usual. If we want to find a reinterpretation of this classic, the mind immediately goes to that Tetris DS which had the merit of refreshing its structure, offering to the owners of the Nintendo portable console at least an unprecedented mode, in which correctly fitting the bricks translated into a different action on the top screen. Tetris Pop goes further, and for the first time adds substance and depth to an already winning mix: the result of this combination is probably the best mobile puzzle game. The developers of EA Mobile have decided to take the original Tetris and add a level structure that does not provide for the mere raising of the degree of challenge as you progress, but a large number of variations that leave the basic mechanics intact but the used within ever-changing processes. Translated into simple terms, in Tetris Pop we won't simply have to fit the bricks and make the filled lines disappear, but to do it to achieve a specific objective. Sometimes it will simply be a question of eliminating a certain number of lines within a limited time, but the seven ~worlds~ available in the main game mode will also see us doing very different things: connecting two detonators by building a ~circuit~ with bricks of the same color; knocking down resistant surfaces with the weight of the pieces piled up; eliminate as many lines as possible by blocking an indicator that tends to fall dangerously high; try to fit the bricks together in an emergency situation; arrange the pieces on the background in order to reconstruct the contours of a figure... There are seventeen variants in total, all equally valid and fun, while each ~world~ is divided into four stages at the end of which we are assigned a ~ vote~ which does not have a purely symbolic value, but can help us unlock the still hidden stages and modes. In addition to the main game mode, it is also possible to try Pop Chrono and Pop Mix: in the first case, we will simply be able to play a more or less complex random game depending on the time available to us (which is asked of us by the game at the beginning), in the second case we will be able to play with the Tetris variants unlocked so far. Tetris Pop's graphics are really good, especially giving a feeling of dynamism and ~agility~ that is rarely found in mobile games. The developers have prepared an interface that is very beautiful to look at and equally functional, full of colors, which during the action gives way to stages that are never too similar, which differ above all in the shades used. Even the sliding of the pieces is rendered in the best way, visually, and making them descend at high speed (a relatively ~unprecedented~ move for the various interpretations of Tetris made so far) produces a nice trail. The sound sector succeeds in the thankless task of being up to the situation, with catchy, good quality music that accompanies the action in the best way.
