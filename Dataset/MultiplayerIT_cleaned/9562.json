The game mechanics are the same, as are the classes and their roles on the battlefield. What varies are the weapons, decidedly ~more manual~, the vehicles and the maps, also taken from the collective Vietnamese cinematic imagination. The new irons are all from the time, at most we find in the Viet Cong files a nice piece from a Soviet museum, registered World War II, absolutely not to be underestimated despite its age, like the PPSH 40 engineer's machine gun, or speaking of Americans we can get your hands on the M79 Assault Grenade Launcher (Call of Duty's China Lake), the M16 very early version, the Stoner Squad SMG, aka XM22, or the Uzi submachine gun. Hill 137 It is interesting to note that there are no optics, except obviously for the snipers, no acog, red dot and beautiful company, only the iron sights to facilitate aiming, which is spot on from a historical point of view, and which puts everyone on the same level in long shooting distances. However, the flamethrower certainly stands out above all, devastating when short, with a sort of ~continuous damage~ over time, and which also leaves a smokescreen on the scene, given its ability to burn ~all the burnable~. This thing that goes hand in hand with the recognized ability of the Frostbyte engine to ~blind~ the player thanks to the so-called fog of war, often making it impossible to see beyond one's nose in the most agitated moments, between dust, dirt thrown into the air by explosions and the thick black napalm smoke. It goes without saying that it is an extremely specialized weapon, and one that requires extreme coordination to use with teammates. In terms of vehicles, in addition to the tanks it is possible to board the American river patrol boats, armed with double Brownings to make suppressive fire on the hinterland, and the Huey helicopter, painted with a shark's mouth, from which, given that it is possible to choose the music, to have the Cavalcade of the Valkyries strictly at full volume. And if we want to have fun playing the little creative bomber we can board a kind of apetto, stick dynamite on it, and jump out of it just before breaking into the enemy base, a big bang and a conquered position. Speaking of maps, four are available immediately, with one that will be unlocked when players have completed sixty-nine million support operations called Operation Hastings already seen in Battlefield: Vietnam. The new maps are the real flagship of the game: the one that struck us most is certainly Hill 137, divided equally between trenches, fortified positions on the hill, the river with armed boats and above all a rugged mountain completely devastated by napalm still steaming in which attack and defense play the last chances. A real show, both from a gameplay point of view, given that dedication and absolute discipline is required of each class, we dare say, with coordinated movements and in unison, and in terms of cosmetics. DICE's work is undoubtedly excellent, the environmental destructibility is always the key to the game, the particle effects and explosions seemed to have improved compared to Bad Company 2. Xbox 360 goals Battlefield: Bad Company 2 - Vietnam rewards the player with nine achievements that are achieved by simply playing the game, increasing one's level. The more challenging ones instead ask us to reach the silver star and the gold star in the use of all weapons. At home in a sack Other notable maps are Kao San Temple, with the temple that becomes the scene of close clashes, with moments of real urban warfare and Phu Bai Valley, a base nestled between hills and marshes, in a continuous ups and downs and points in which it dominates for its entirety of the valley, between rice fields, small villages and fortified posts. More generally, it is possible to say that the maps made by the Swedish boys are never one-way, they never give the impression of having a single obligatory point of passage, but that they are made with the present classes in mind, with numerous routes escape and approach to targets. Nothing new, they are the same foundations appreciated in ~smooth~ Bad Company 2, but in this case, given the small number of maps, it is possible to immediately enter the perspective of how to move by exploiting all the potential offered by the game. There are no particular flaws, except those that all those whothey are familiar with the DICE title they know, i.e. a lot of space given to snipers, who in any case do not enjoy instant kill. You die and die often, snipers are as fundamental as they are ~hateful~ in the economy of the game, but it is undeniable that being able to take a position by working together, perhaps uphill, challenging the enemy defense, avoiding the trails left by the snipers and trying to go on the opposing flanks is a really gratifying and very satisfying moment.", "date": "2010-12-17", "grade": "8.7"}
