{"name": "Taiko no Tatsujin per Nintendo Switch: la recensione della versione giapponese", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/taiko-no-tatsujin-nintendo-switch-recensione.html", "text": "Born from the creativity of Yukiko Yokoo, Don-chan has become a symbol of Japanese arcades over the years. Here the funny mascot of the musical series Taiko no Tatsujin dominates the two characteristic taiko, the huge drums that make Bandai Namco's rhythm game so unique and flashy. Inevitable in Japanese arcades, Taiko no Tatsujin has however been proposed numerous times on consoles and smartphones, and it was only a matter of time before Don-chan grabbed a pair of Joy-Con to play on Nintendo Switch as well. While waiting for news on the possible arrival in the West, we thus played the Japanese version of Taiko no Tatsujin for Nintendo Switch to discover a cheerful and fun, albeit imperfect, chapter. What does it... beat? As in many other music games, the objective in Taiko no Tatsujin is to hit colored icons with the right timing, following the rhythm of the music and trying not to interrupt the combos. Hold the sticks (the so-called taiko bachi), in correspondence with the red icons (~don~) you have to hit the center of the drum, while with the blue ones (~kat~) you hit the outer ring. There are a couple of other special icons that ask the player to perform short rolls, but tended to, from its debut in 2001 to today, the formula of the Taiko no Tatsujin series has remained almost unchanged, and woe if it were otherwise. After all, the success of the game is also linked to its enormous accessibility: anyone can pick up a pair of wands and start playing, but to get really good you need well, wrist. Of all the console versions released so far in over fifteen years, the Switch edition of Taiko no Tatsujin is undoubtedly the most versatile in terms of control systems. It can be carried around - like the 3DS version - or played in the living room - like on the Wii U; you can use the physical keys - like on PlayStation Vita - or the touchscreen - like on smartphones; it also has a drum-shaped peripheral, exactly like the PlayStation 4 edition, but in addition you can use the Joy-Con as if they were sticks. Unfortunately each of these configurations has its pros and cons: playing with console keys is the most boring, but also the most reliable way if you want to score well on high difficulty levels. The touchscreen can only be used if the Joy-Cons are connected to the console, making it difficult to grip and forcing it to be placed on a flat surface; furthermore, touchscreen support is completely absent in the menus, which must therefore be navigated using the keys necessarily. The best way to approach the arcade experience is obviously to use the drum-shaped peripheral produced by Hori. Except for the buttons, the drum for Switch looks exactly like the one Hori made for Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum Session on PlayStation 4, sharing the same weight and form factor but thankfully being a little more sensitive. However, you have to get used to hitting harder than normal (especially in ~kats~), or use some online guides on how to modify the drum hardware to make it more responsive. The most curious novelty of this chapter for Nintendo Switch, however, is the use of Joy-Con as sticks. Playing with Joy-Con Taiko no Tatsujin isn't the first Switch game where the motion sensors of the Joy-Cons are used to play drums but, just like in the bizarre Gal Metal, the experience can be light, accessible, yet imprecise and frustrating. On paper, the idea is to mimic with the Joy-Con the strokes you would give on the drum: a movement from top to bottom for the don and one inclined at 45 for the kat, while the controllers vibrate with each stroke to give a vague (very vague) feeling that he's actually beating a drum. When it works it's hilarious, but after a while you realize the numerous limits of the technology: the inputs are not always detected correctly (especially in diagonal shots), in fast sequences the Joy-Con tend to miss a few shots too many, and for to function properly they must be held rigidly in an upright position, which is paradoxically more tiring than using real chopsticks. Also, at the time of writing, the Joy-Con's vertical movement is automatically registered as both don and kat, allowing you to hit both red and blue icons with the same movement: this feature should theoretically be restricted to one specifies ~casual~ mode, but due to an alleged bug it is actually present in all difficulty levels and using any character. Even with all the limitsti and the defects listed, using the Joy-Con to make ~air drum~ remains a nice and disengaged way to memorize the rhythm of a song, especially at lower difficulty levels. Eigo wo hanasemasu ka In the days leading up to the release of Taiko no Tatsujin in Japan, Bandai Namco registered a number of trademarks related to the franchise in Australia, including the title Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun for the Nintendo Switch. It therefore seems almost confirmed that the game will also arrive in the West, but those who don't want to wait can retrieve the game on the Japanese store, taking advantage of the fact that Nintendo Switch is region free. On August 9, Bandai Namco should also release a patch that will add the English language to the menus of the Japanese edition. sensei music! As per the tradition of the series, the Taiko no Tatsujin tracklist for Nintendo Switch is a mix of J-Pop songs, anime theme songs, classical music, some catchphrases and a handful of songs taken from some video games. From the theme of Your Name (Zen Zen Zense) to Japanese classics such as One Night Carnival and Train-Train by Blue Hearts, passing through Flight of the Bumblebee or the inevitable Zankoku na tenshi no tze, the opening of Evangelion that the Japanese people use in cooking instead of parsley. To amuse Nintendo fans, the list also contains two music taken from Splatoon 2 and Super Mario Odyssey, but overall the tracklist of the chapter for Switch is a little weaker than that seen at the launch of the PlayStation 4 edition, with some big absentees and a level of challenge generally more oriented towards the bottom. However, there will be support for DLC: while we write it is already possible to download a free package dedicated to the anime Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion, while a collection of songs taken from Studio Ghibli films will arrive on August 9th. Although the performance mode represents the main dish of Taiko no Tatsujin, this chapter for Switch also features a party mode, with a good number of mini-games to play in the company of friends or against the CPU. These are simple and insane challenges, in which the participants must follow the rhythm dictated by the game in a very similar way to what was seen in the Rhythm Paradise series. On a console that lends itself so well to quick multiplayer games, these little rhythm races are a particularly welcome addition, and thankfully they don't make too much of the fact of having to replay them dozens and dozens of times to unlock avatars and hidden songs.", "date": "2018-07-25", "grade": "7.8"}
