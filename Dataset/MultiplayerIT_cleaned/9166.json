Over the years these sailing ships have clashed in battles with no holds barred, and in the end only a few valiant crews have managed to resist the cannon fire of the fearsome battleship known as the World of Warcraft. The comparison is even reductive, if we consider that the colossus created by Blizzard is now so deeply rooted and populous as to be comparable to an unassailable, unattainable floating fortress managed by a gazillion sailors. Such great power has forced most of the challengers to adapt, and to modify their commercial strategy. To survive, they therefore decided to focus on a model that everyone has loved since the dawn of time, the free one. Those who chew the genre will remember that in the past free to play MMORPGs were often synonymous with poor quality. These were products that were lacking in content or with monstrously repetitive gameplay. In recent years, however, even illustrious games have collapsed due to a lack of users - or have proved to be more forward-looking - and have opted for the elimination of the monthly payment: Dungeons and Dragons Online, Lord of The Rings Online and Champions Online are just a few examples of this trend. The last illustrious ~victim~ is Age of Conan, a title with great potential that has resisted for a long time, but in the end had to give in to the advance of the old rulers and new contenders. Not that playing for free is a bad thing, but the software houses have shown an unfortunate propensity to make their creatures little more than self-congratulatory demos after the change, unlikely to captivate a non-paying player for long. How did Funcom handle the situation? Today we explain it to you. This is Conan the Cimmerian The transition to free to play has paid off well in most cases. Many MMOs nearing total bankruptcy have seen their developer accounts go back into the green for the first time in years, and a substantial proliferation of players on previously deserted or nearly deserted servers. However, none of these games really broke the bank, except perhaps for LotRO, plausibly for the reason mentioned above. In fact, programmers have almost always decided to give newcomers little more than a taste of their virtual world, to entice them to use the in-game store. If you expected a different approach from Funcom, unfortunately you will be disappointed. Age of Conan: Unchained actually has too many chains, and they imprison contents of considerable importance. We are not at the levels of Champions Online, which does not even allow you to develop your character at will, but the limitations are many, starting with the usable classes. There are only 4 careers that you can undertake during character creation: Barbarian, Demonologist, Cleric of Mithras and Guardian. An unfortunate choice, given that in a game of this type the freedom to immediately choose the path that most inspires is one of the greatest attractions. You will also only have 2 slots available for your alter egos. These first barriers can be bypassed in two ways, the first is to pay, the second is to be a returning user after a long break. In fact, if you were lucky enough to own the game before the change, you will keep all the classes you created in the past, and the same number of slots. However, be aware that, whatever your case, you will never reach the top of ~the world's most deprived~ without shelling out some vil money, as you will not be able to visit the most demanding instances, nor the high-level areas of Khitai, the empire introduced in the Rise of the Godslayer expansion. Go barbarian, kill 10 wolves Age of Conan certainly has nothing to envy to other exponents of the genre in terms of size and complexity. The universe created by Robert E. Howard is one of the most famous and epic ever, and the Funcom title reproduces it with a certain fidelity. The game also features one of the most comprehensive character development systems ever. The player is asked to develop multiple skills on three different branches, and to distribute skill points, useful for improving characteristics such as healing speed or running endurance. The maximum level is 80, and the possibilities are countless for each class. Too bad that the free version also partially confines this aspect with the elimination of the Alternate Advancement originating from the expansion. This is a parallel system to the growth of one's character, which is developed with the completion of PVE and PVP objectives, or the simple passage of time. The additional capabilities thus obtainable greatly affect the style of play, and make everything even more profound. Also inthis case therefore ~no money = no party~, but it's already nice that the rest of the system has remained unchanged. Among what hasn't been changed, fortunately, there is also the gameplay, and we specify ~fortunately~ because it is precisely the gameplay that has earned Age of Conan a rightful place in the Olympus of MMOs. Warriors use omnidirectional attacks both to strike enemies and to execute devastating combinations with various effects. A very similar mechanism is applied to wizards, with spells capable of enhancing each other to be used wisely. Yet it may not be enough to capture new players and convince them to stay. The gameplay only really shines in the toughest instances or massive PVP battles, both of which are off limits to non-payers. The free and explorable areas are the basic ones, full of standard quests that will force you to slaughter countless specimens of flora and fauna to gain experience. A real man is hairy Another strong point of Age of Conan has always been the technical sector. Times have changed since the release of the game, but we are still facing one of the most beautiful MMORPGs on the market, and one of the few in which it is possible to change the appearance of your alter ego down to the smallest detail. The world of Conan is represented with remarkable care and the effective views are certainly not lacking. The most spectacular locations are actually found mainly in Khitai, but at least the developers wanted to make the initial areas of the exotic empire open to visitors. The three-dimensional models are quite detailed, and the textures of good quality. The same cannot be said of the animations which are rather wooden. The game interface is also excellent, much more customizable than normal. The skill bars and keyboard shortcuts are freely tweakable, albeit a bit complex to manage for those unfamiliar with online RPGs. One of the most serious problems that old users will no doubt remember was the impressive amount of bugs that plagued the game. We can tell you with some satisfaction that they are mostly gone, and you will no longer run into huge invisible walls or see your skill bars disappear for no apparent reason. However, a few hiccups here and there remained, especially in certain animated scenes that present very busted cameras or absolutely ridiculous movements of the protagonists. Luckily nothing major. The sound has its ups and downs, and while in Tortage town you'll have to endure the atrocious voice acting of NPCs, you'll also be able to enjoy some great background music.", "date": "2011-07-19", "grade": "7.2"}
