{"name": "Spicy Piggy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spicy-piggy-la-recensione.html", "text": "The boundless Nitrome catalog is mainly made up of titles accessible to anyone and which make immediacy and ease of use their pillars, but this does not prevent the British publisher from occasionally trying new paths: it is certainly this is the case of Spicy Piggy, a platformer with harmless appearances but with a damned hardcore soul, light years away from the relaxed experiences of Slime Pizza and company. So let's find out in our review if the present title developed by Gypophotamus has all the credentials to offer an attractive challenge to the most savvy players. Spicy piglet and fiery gameplay Without wasting even a second telling a story that would actually have been useless, Spicy Piggy simply puts the user in the role of a little pig who must go through the various levels eating as many hot peppers as possible and reach the finish line unscathed. represented by a kiosk where you can cool off from the heat. The structure is therefore extremely classic and linear, with the stages to be played in sequence and an evaluation at the end of each of them based on the inevitable three stars, to be obtained respectively by completing the level, collecting all the peppers and remaining under a set time. The peculiarity of Spicy Piggy lies entirely in a truly grim level design, which has little to do with the rose water standards of the mobile world and which instead more closely resembles titles of the caliber of Super Meat Boy. A particularly fast game action is therefore combined with stages that offer obstacles and enemies of all kinds in rapid succession, which often and willingly appear suddenly leading to the inevitable death of the protagonist and the consequent loss of progress achieved up to that point . When this happens - that is, with an incessant frequency given the difficulty of the game - you have the possibility to choose whether to start over or restart from the last checkpoint by paying a certain number of peppers or by watching an advertising video: a system widely tested by Nitrome in many of its products and which confirms its validity also in this case. Like any self-respecting hardcore platformer, Spicy Piggy walks that fine line that separates the frustration for the constant game overs one encounters and the satisfaction generated by having finally managed to overcome a particularly complicated scheme: a more common balance in the console field than in the mobile one, and which certainly can be indigestible to those who are not accustomed to titles of this type. Also because here the player's failures cannot always be attributed only to his shortcomings in terms of attention or quick reflexes: the developers have in fact not spared themselves in real pitfalls scattered throughout the various levels that have more the flavor of taking lap that the stimulus to improve their performance. Even the control system - very important for a game that places so much emphasis on precision - does not always give the impression of being 100% reliable, despite its extreme simplicity: the pig automatically runs forward, and there are only three buttons virtual on-screen dedicated to jumping, sliding and shooting fireballs essential to eliminate enemies and break down some barriers. Unfortunately, this is one of those cases in which the lack of physical support makes itself felt, given that a touchscreen will never be able to give the responsiveness of a joypad.", "date": "2019-02-22", "grade": "7.0"}
