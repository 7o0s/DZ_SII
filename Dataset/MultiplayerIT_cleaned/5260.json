Dragon Quest Builders by Square Enix finally arrives in Europe where the typical construction mechanics of Minecraft and the world of Dragon Quest are combined, the famous saga of Japanese role-playing games created in 1985 by Yugi Horii who has been capable of bringing their adventures to life on practically every existing console. To justify this union with Kazuya Niinou and his team it was enough to imagine an alternative ending of Dragon Quest in which the kingdom of Alefgard, instead of being saved by the protagonist, was devastated by the Dragonlord who deceived the hero, thus bringing darkness (even in the literal sense of the term given the evil clouds that hang over the area) everywhere: for once, the villain seems to have won. After years of oblivion, the population, or rather what remains of them, is desperate and completely in disarray and the only hope of the kingdom is you, prophetic savior with the innate ability of a builder capable of obtaining materials from everything around you . We are faced with a Minecraft with themed graphics, then? Absolutely not, given that the typical nature of the sandbox is distorted by the mission structure that will guide you throughout the adventure and that will be useful, initially, to familiarize yourself with the controls of your character and, subsequently, to always have some task to perform. You can build as you like or carry on the story of the protagonist, when and how it depends only on your imagination. Dragon Quest Builders, the sandbox joins the quests with a truly immersive result The kingdom of Alefgard in our hands After having witnessed the prologue (the crime mentioned above) and having created the character (the choice options are few and limited to gender and the color of hair, skin and eyes), you will be awakened by the Goddess Rubiss, the spirit of the earth on duty which, in addition to repeating to exhaustion that your skills as a builder make you the only hope in the world while not making you a hero, will start you understanding the basic commands of the game, starting with the movement of the character, from the construction of the first objects up to placing the blocks and navigating the quick selection bar. To build the basic objects, the Goddess will teach you how to use, as a workbench, the stump of a tree cut and ~randomly positioned~ inside the crypt where you will awaken: once you have learned the first techniques, it will give you the reach the ruins of the ancient city of Cantlin and place the first banner of light. Placing this banner will inevitably attract people who struggle to survive every day to it, and it will also serve as a save point for your games. The first citizen to arrive will be Britta who, in addition to showering you with compliments worthy of a true savior, will provide you with a new series of quests that are very useful for learning more advanced construction elements such as, for example, the empty room, the door and a bed for sleep, plus it will suggest how to get food to recover energy; this last element is particularly important as the hunger bar, made up of five loaves of bread, together with the life bar are the two parameters to keep under control to avoid passing away and losing half of the objects you carry ( you can still go back to recover them after you come back to life). As you expand the city or wander around the surrounding area, you will find other characters and each of them will invite themselves to your city by offering help which, in terms of gameplay, will translate into new missions and recipes for new items that you will simply acquire talking to them or discovering a new object or a new material in the places visited: picking up an object for the first time, very often, will automatically make you think of one or more recipes in which to use it. The missions in which you will have to reach a certain place will be marked on the practical compass/clock which also marks the day-night cycle: at night you can both continue the adventure and go to sleep but, in the first case, you will always have ghosts to annoy you they will be eliminated. Minecraft or no Minecraft, that is the question When Dragon Quest Builders came out in Japan earlier this year, there was immediate talk of Japan's answer to Minecraft, how true is that? First of all, the playing area, similarly to the Microsoft title, is divided into cubes that the protagonist will collect by destroying the ground, which can be of various types (with materials such as coal, iron, copper, etc. inside), with his weaponfirst and with the hammer, moreover, the quick bar is also very similar and accessible via the directional cross which, however, in Dragon Quest Builders has the added function of selecting weapons; the movement of the character is delegated to the left stick while with the right you can rotate the camera at will. The first difference from Minecraft is the third person view which is very comfortable in outdoor environments but which becomes difficult inside the buildings to which you have put a roof. The other two not negligible differences are the height, limited to just 32 blocks starting from sea level and only four in depth (forget the deep caves of Minecraft), and the total impossibility of interacting with the sea which can only be crossed where the water is only one block deep and which, if you try to dive into it, will bring the injured character back to the shore. To reach the many islands present, you will need to advance with the story mode and this will give you the opportunity to build portals which, once crossed, will give you access to a new area, with new monsters to kill, new materials to take and new non-player characters which will provide main story or optional quests. The latter will affect the final score of the chapter you are playing: there are 4 chapters, of increasing difficulty and complete with an epic battle with the final boss. Once you have passed the boss at the end of the chapter, the trick used by Square Enix is interesting: in fact, in the next chapter, you will have all the recipes learned up to that moment available (some with variations caused by the diversity of the various settings) but you will lose all items and life points and you will have to start over in the new setting with a new banner. Once the first chapter is finished you will return to the main menu and both the second chapter and the Terra Incognita free construction mode will be unlocked in which you will be able to access the game online and in which multiplayer is limited to sharing your building with other players who they will simply see it appear in their free build mode. It's a real shame not to have a real multiplayer, it would have been the icing on the cake for a product that already has many strings to its bow. Another element that differs substantially from Minecraft is the construction of the city that you will level up as you create the various rooms and fill them with decorations such as vases, benches, tables and other furnishings: the possibility of creating private rooms is original for each of your citizens by affixing a plaque on which you will write the name. Similarly, you can create inns, shops, laboratories or armories in which to place the equipment you no longer use. Playstation 4 trophies There are trophies for all tastes in Dragon Quest Builders and they range from those related to the story mode to those based on the feats accomplished within a given chapter. Other trophies can be earned simply by playing and repeating an action to excess such as destroying many blocks or furnishing yours so much as to fully earn the title of decorator. Lots to do in the colorful world of Dragon Quest Those familiar with the Dragon Quest series will have no trouble recognizing many of the enemies present, above all the Slimes (one of them is the protagonist of a hilarious part of the first chapter) but above all will appreciate the characters designed by the mythical (now less can be attributed) Akira Toriyama, author of the first Dragon Quest and Chrono Trigger, if we want to stay in the field of video games, or of masterpieces such as the Dragon Ball series or Doctor Slump & Arale if we move to anime and manga. The animations of the characters and enemies are always very fluid even if the distance from which to hit them could have been better cured which instead requires you to get so close to them that you risk physically hitting them by taking damage. All the dialogues, which are presented with the classic ~chat bubbles~ of Japanese role-playing video games, are localized in Italian and very amusing translations have often been made with jokes sometimes bordering on repeatable (we will not reveal anything). Like every game in the series Dragon Quest, the musical aspect is very accurate, starting with the very recognizable initial theme (trademark of the series) and gradually exploring melodies that follow the game situations: one for the night, one for when you're in the city, one for when you are outside. The themes are almost never too annoying even if in the long run they risk becoming a bit repetitive. The estimated duration for the completion of the four main chaptersipali is about 50-60 hours without considering all the additional quests that can easily bring the game time to even 100 hours, excluding the part of Terra Incognita where you build freely, so it could last virtually indefinitely.", "date": "2016-10-04", "grade": "8.5"}
