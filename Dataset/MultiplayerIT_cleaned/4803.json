A significant contribution in this sense was given by the guys from Vertigo Games, who at the end of 2016 showed us their Arizona Sunshine, a title completely dedicated to the virtual reality of HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Respecting the old adage according to which ~good things come in threes~, the Dutch team has worked in recent months to bring Arizona Sunshine to PlayStation 4 as well, a platform that has now established itself as a point of reference for virtual reality thanks to the diffusion of its PlayStation VR headset. The possibility of hunting for zombies under the scorching sun comes at the very best moment for owners of the Sony console, given that after the release of Farpoint and ~its~ Aim Controller, Arizona Sunshine also supports this peripheral. But let's not go any further, it's time to show Freddy again what we're made of! Zombies at 40 degrees Living up to its name, Arizona Sunshine takes us to the southwestern United States, in a classic setting made up of canyons and abandoned mines. After starting the main campaign we immediately get to know the protagonist, grappling with the rolling head of a zombie - or Freddy as he calls them - arriving in front of his feet after the unfortunate friend has ended up in one of the traps placed near the refuge. Just as the beginning of the game takes place without too many preambles, our virtual alter ego lets us know without much explanation that the time has come to leave the place, thus venturing on a journey in search of other survivors of the zombie apocalypse. As told at the time also in the review of the PC version, Arizona Sunshine does not offer particular ideas either from a narrative point of view or from that of game dynamics, limiting itself to providing a reason to make the protagonist move from one point to another, shooting meanwhile to everything that moves. The main campaign, playable online with a friend, still offers us the possibility of walking around without being forced by real tracks, even if its linearity soon becomes evident. Apart from some very simple puzzles that lead us to go in search of keys or other objects necessary to move forward, the gaming experience is in short based entirely on clashes with zombies. Being a title dedicated to virtual reality, this is by no means a trivial aspect, and in fact, as we are about to discover, Arizona Sunshine is all about involvement. Before going further, let's remember that there is also a horde mode, which is also quite classic in its putting us in front of crowds of friends intent on feasting on our brains. Playstation 4 trophies Arizona Sunshina has a total of 35 trophies, on top of which we find the usual platinum to unlock after collecting all the others. The rest are divided between 4 gold, 14 silver and 16 bronze. Most of them can be collected by completing the campaign mode, which you will probably find yourself replaying to collect all of the objectives. A small part is instead dedicated to the horde mode, in particular to the number of zombies killed. Freedom of control If the PlayStation 4 version of Arizona Sunshine offers broadly the same setting and modality as seen in the PC one, the game dynamics differ thanks to the different control possibilities that the Sony console makes available. As we said at the beginning, the Aim Controller is fully supported and brings with it a new specific mode associated with the main campaign, in which the pistols are replaced by two-handed weapons. The second alternative is represented by the combination of PlayStation Move, thanks to which the player can obtain the same dual wielding effect seen on PC. The latest solution for those who have not yet purchased other control peripherals is the classic DualShock 4, through which it is possible to access the two-handed mode, therefore usable even without having completed the purchase of the Aim Controller. In case you fall into the latter category or don't have a pair of Moves available, don't be scared, because even using the classic joypad we had quite positive sensations. While losing something in terms of identification, the controller has in fact allowed us to enjoy all the headshots that Arizona Sunshine has to offer, including the moment in which to aim before seeing the head of the unfortunate zombie explode. In fact, the Vertigo Games title alternates calm phases, in which to focus on the singleor lethal blow, to others in which the presence of a large number of zombies does not allow us to focus too much on precision, shooting wildly. The weapons range from pistols, rifles and machine guns, accompanied by the inevitable grenades with which to do a little cleaning in a single bang. The freedom on the control system is accompanied by an equally free choice regarding the movement of the character, which can be carried out by teleportation, by degrees or in complete fluidity. As previous experiences with virtual reality teach, the last of the three alternatives is to be avoided unless you have an iron stomach, to possibly focus on the second in case you want to have more realistic control of the situation. The use of teleportation instead allows you to completely protect yourself from motion sickness phenomena, and this is why we strongly recommend it so that you can enjoy Arizona Sunshine without particular worries, also given the temperatures of these days which certainly don't help . Despite the efficiency of the teleporter, it must be said that its use makes the game a little easier, in fact allowing the player to escape from a bad situation by literally vanishing from where he is. Best on PlayStation 4 Pro According to the developers, Arizona Sunshine takes advantage of the hardware offered by PlayStation 4 Pro to introduce greater visual distance and other effects that can significantly improve the graphic detail compared to the basic version of the console. Within the limits imposed by the current technology behind virtual reality, the test we carried out on PlayStation 4 Pro allowed us to directly ascertain that the level is quite close to that known on PC, compared to which in visual terms Arizona Sunshine retains the strengths and weaknesses found six months ago in the review phase. Texts and dubbing are completely in Italian, thus giving everyone the opportunity to appreciate the Duke Nukem-style jokes made by the protagonist of the game, intended to break the tension between one group of zombies and another.", "date": "2017-06-28", "grade": "8.0"}
