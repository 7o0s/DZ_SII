The world of RTS is mainly active on PC, in this sense the first chapter of the strategy set in the Halo universe was a strong gamble by Microsoft which, despite the limitations of the Xbox 360 hardware, focused a lot on this unusual exclusive . Luckily for the Redmond colossus, as written in our preview of the Definitive Edition of Halo Wars, the title was a real success, recording over a million copies sold and conquering the best-selling RTS title on Console. This February begins the adventure of Captain Cutter, commander of the ship Spirit Of Fire, who will have to deal with a new enemy, Atriox, at the head of the Banished, a new separatist faction that has sworn war against the Covenant. Unfortunately for us, ~the enemy of your enemy is your friend~ doesn't apply here, and the conflict is set to be one of the hardest fought ever. Halo Wars 2 is not only campaign, and in addition to the good variety of competitive multiplayer modes, it introduces for the first time Blitz, a mode that combines the concept of collectible card games with real-time strategy. The team has dedicated a lot of resources to the mode which, in addition to a strong PvP component, includes a PvE mode in which players will have to face waves of increasingly difficult enemies. We will be able to deepen the concept well during the review, now it's time to talk about how the game universe has changed in recent years. Creative Assembly with Halo Wars 2 proves to be the absolute master of the genre, even on consoles The Spirit of Fire, 28 years later After nearly 28 years out of conflict and isolated from the rest of humanity, the famous UNSC ship led by Captain Cutter returns to battle to face new challenges. Creative Assembly develops a universe full of details and with much brighter and more vibrant colors than seen in the first chapter. Thanks to the extensive game maps, the campaign offers a great variety of objectives and strategic approaches. All this becomes explicit as you proceed with the story which, in addition to the classic gameplay focused on creating your own base, will offer real boss battles, tower defense sessions, timed objectives, map control and so on. In addition to the strong exploratory component, the levels take place in several stages; now we are building our base, now we find ourselves with our Spartan exploring the map recovering troops or gathering resources. The clashes are more alive than ever, with constant events that force us to reevaluate our strategies and make the most of the surrounding environment. However, we are not talking only about strategy, since Halo Wars 2 also offers a lot of collectibles to unlock including the Phoenix Logs scattered throughout the levels with the aim of deepening the story, and the inevitable Halo skulls, real modifiers of difficulty that are unlocked by completing the secondary objectives of each mission. The narration has much more space, if in the first chapter it was limited only to cinematics, now the characters talk during the missions, providing not only important strategic information, but deepening the plot and allowing the player to be part of what is happening in the universe of game. It is therefore clear how the experience offered by the strategic Xbox is not ~passive~, on the contrary it is full of dynamism and frenzy with almost completely absent dead times. Interestingly, among all, how Halo is now a very established expanded universe, with a multiplicity of elements that coexist with each other consistently despite this being in constant expansion. We are talking about a very strong attention to detail which is expressed in many small things that a less attentive eye could ignore. The human models, including weapons, logos and various technologies, are taken from the first trilogy of the shooter originally created by Bungie Studios, establishing continuity with the game events and demonstrating exemplary attention to detail. The maximum expression of all this is Blur studio's incredible computer graphics cinematics, which tell the story of the game in its most salient and spectacular points, building a visual / narrative experience that could not otherwise be made by simple gameplay. In this regard, the introduction of animated microsequences in the in-game sessions in which, directly exploiting the graphics engine, the focal points of the missions are shown. So whether it's the appearance of a boss, or a twist, the cameraa will focus for a few moments on the events by offering us real mini kinematics with the polygonal models of the game itself. Strategy in Multiplayer A huge chunk of the experience offered by Halo Wars 2 is centered around competitive multiplayer. This includes three main modes at launch, which differ from each other in the game experience offered. Control, it is based on three zones to capture and control to score points. Strongholds, among the most frenetic, features unlimited resources with all upgrades unlocked. Players will need to conquer and build as many strongholds as possible to secure victory at the end of the game. Finally Deathmatch, characterized by a more classic and slow gameplay where you start completely from scratch and finish once the enemy bases have been destroyed. Each of these modes is also customizable in private matches, where we will be able to add opponents controlled by artificial intelligence, selecting their level of difficulty or simply invite friends to play with or against us. The multiplayer experience, regardless of the game mode, revolves around the Leaders. The main characters of the campaign are then played, as commanders, by the players. Whether you've chosen a UNSC Leader or one of the Outcasts, it's important to keep in mind that these drastically change the gameplay experience. Some have unique units, others have passive perks and unique powers to use during matches. Being able to understand every weakness of your leader and to master their strengths is the key to success regardless of the mode chosen. The clashes in Halo Wars 2 are not limited to the classic one against one, but extend to two against two and the more chaotic three against three, in each of these scenarios it will always be necessary to know your enemy and, more importantly, coordinate with their companions making the most of every single resource. The matchmaking system, on the other hand, offers a good variety of playlists at launch in which players can discount themselves by choosing their favorite game mode. Competitiveness is not neglected, and while they may not be available at launch, competitive playlists are on the way with a ~skill based~ search system and relative ranking system very similar to the one seen on Halo 5: Guardians in which, after ten games , you are sorted into a division between bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, onyx and so on. If you are looking for a challenge, you will have bread for your teeth. Technically and Gameplay Speaking of a console strategy game, it is absolutely necessary to spend a few lines on the technical sector and on the gameplay. Comparing it to the first chapter, Halo Wars 2 is a completely different game, with much more detailed polygonal models and a very strong presence of vegetation and foliage. The maps are full of structures, effects and various details which, despite the view from above, often give us splendid scenarios to admire. Between native 1080p resolution, environmental effects, good texture quality and a high number of units, the game still manages to hold 30 frames flawlessly even in the busiest situations, giving us a fluid experience and rigorous image cleaning on Xbox One. Moving on instead to talk about the Gameplay, it is always curious to see what tricks the development teams adopt to adapt the complexity of the title to a controller. The basic control scheme resumes in all respects what was seen in the first chapter, with the possibility of making multiple selection by holding down the A button on the controller. There are still all the shortcuts to select all units or only those on screen with a simple press of a button, or even quickly switch from one base to another or from one group of units to another simply by pressing one of the arrow keys on the controllers. The same radial construction menu returns again, also applied to the powers of the leaders, which is well suited to the selection via the analogs of the controller. A small welcome change, however, is that of being able to create customized groups of units by pressing the right trigger and assigning them to one of the four directional arrows on the controller. Another change is made on the front of the game economy, now no longer based only on resources, but also on energy. Players will then have to balance their resource and energy production according to their needs and chosen tactics; some units require a higher energy cost, others only consume resources, the same goes for leader powers. Blitz: Trading Cards and RTSHowever, the construction of units and bases, and the related resource management mentioned above, disappears completely in Blitz, the new mode that combines the experience offered by trading card games with real-time strategy. Where before we had to wait several seconds for a single unit to create, now they are catapulted into the action as soon as the relevant card is played. These fall into two main categories, unit cards that remain until defeated, and powers that fade after a set amount of time after being cast. Each card has a cost in terms of energy, which can be collected simply by destroying the various cores that appear on the map during the course of the game, significantly increasing their regeneration speed. In all this, the player will also have to be able to control two of the three bases to be able to score points, once the limit score is reached, or the time has expired, the game ends by declaring the player with the most points the winner. To discourage players from throwing cards only in times of need, units are born with half health and will only reach 100% after a few seconds if and only if they are not hit by enemies. In Blitz therefore it is not only crucial to know your deck of cards, but applying the right strategies, collecting energy before your enemies, and being able to control the map will guarantee you victory regardless of the rarity of your cards. A microtransaction system is introduced to obtain new cards, despite the fact that a season pass is present in the game for future DLCs. In addition to spending real money, packages can be obtained by completing the daily and weekly challenges dedicated to Halo Wars 2 Multiplayer or by leveling up in the service register of your profile. The number of cards present at the launch is not very large; it ranges between common cards up to legendary ones and, in order to make your choices even more drastic, many cards will be exclusive to certain leaders. It should also not be forgotten that many of the units and powers present in Blitz are unique to the mode and will include exclusive perks, which justifies the difference in cost between one card and another. An interesting dynamic related to the ~doubles~ is that they will serve to level up the relative card, significantly increasing its statistics such as attack power, defense, life and much more. For each leader it is possible to build up to a maximum of three personalized decks, carefully choosing the cards from your collection. The same gameplay is applied to the Blitz Shootout mode, which can be tackled single or in co-op, where the player will have to face increasingly numerous waves of enemies trying not to lose control of the three zones. Like all other multiplayer modes, standard Blitz is playable by two to six players divided into two teams. Prepare your bouquets, you will see some beautiful ones. Xbox One goals Halo Wars 2 has 60 achievements totaling 1000G. These vary from the simplest, related to the completion of the tutorials, up to the real challenges that will require the achievement of some goals in multiplayer or the completion of the campaign on maximum difficulty with all the skulls active. Ultimate Edition owners receive Halo Wars Definitive Edition which contains an additional 75 Achievements for 1500G. A compelling sequel From what we've tested, Halo Wars 2 is the worthy successor to the first chapter. The scenarios boast an excellent artistic realization and the technical level of the title is on par with the times. As you play, you can create scenarios packed with units fighting each other, resulting in explosions that fill the game scene, all while maintaining flawless fluidity. The campaign mode is very well done, with an excellent level design and a huge variety of objectives and game modes. The CG kinematics are among the most exciting aspects of the campaign, so much so that we want to continue in the story just to be able to enjoy the excellent work of Blur. Unfortunately these are not present in every mission, and out of a total of twelve levels of the campaign we receive about seven cinematics for a total of about thirty minutes of video. Multiplayer is the strong point of the Creative Assembly title, which despite the lack of variety of modes at launch, has an excellent game balance and a well-established leader system. There is no doubt that the feedback received during the first chapter has been exploited to the fullest to further optimize an already excellent multiplayer.
