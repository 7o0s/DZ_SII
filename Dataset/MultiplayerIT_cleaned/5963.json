The first DLC for the Microsoft exclusive linked to the six-monthly Season Pass, sold individually or included in the prestigious Ultimate Edition, is a tribute to the Xbox One debut of the famous G series of Logitech racing wheels, one of the most popular peripherals for racing game enthusiasts and available on the Redmond flagship with the excellent G920. The Logitech G Car Pack, as announced, contains a selection of seven new cars, which is also added to the powerful Japanese coupe Infiniti Q60 Concept, free for all and linked to an update that involves several fixes and updates to the code. Let's find out together before diving into the analysis of the new racing cars. Class, luxury and mind-boggling performance in the Forza Motorsport 6 Logitech G Car Pack Chisel work The first substantial patch for Forza Motorsport 6 affects several features of the game, and beyond refinements on tracks and cars, it also touches the Drivatars, the import of liveries from Forza Motorsport 5, the objectives, the discussed Mods and some aspects of multiplayer. As for the cars, Turn 10 has fixed the audio problems related to the engines of the V8 Supercars and the Ford Shelby GT350, in addition, several views from the cockpit have been corrected, including those of the Lamborghini Gallardo LP570-4 and the Ford Escort RS1600 Fast & Furious edition. The most important interventions concerned the fix of the infamous transmission bug, which granted some specific cars an undue advantage during competitions. If you've seen rankings dominated by old Mini Coopers, Abarth 595 essesse and Fiat X1/9, the reason was linked precisely to this problem, and the developers have decided to cancel all times obtained illegally from the leaderboard. Although it is one of the flagships of the series, the artificial intelligence of the Drivatars has shown its side to some small flaws, and Turn 10 has made some server-side changes to improve its behavior. Further interventions are planned in the near future. Other important fixes concerned the mapping of the keys in case of simultaneous connection of joypad and steering wheel, the scores obtained during the drifting sessions, the ~World Traveler~ achievement that did not unlock correctly and the export / import of liveries. A bug that allowed cheating on the Ascari variant of the Monza circuit has also been corrected, while the Road Atlanta and Top Gear circuits have been cleaned up of some imperfections. The road ones In the Logitech G Car Pack, which can be purchased outside the Season Pass for 6.99 Euros, there are three road cars, which unfortunately do not include the highly anticipated Alfa Romeo Giulia and Ferrari 488 GTB. The models chosen are in fact the 1967 Volvo 123 GT, the 2013 Cadillac XTS Limousine and the very fast Caparo T1, a car with much more contained charm and charisma than the two Italian racing cars, which we will most likely see arriving in the next packages. Let's start our analysis with the Swedish company's sports sedan, a model released in the 1960s derived from the discreet Amazon, a car manufactured near Gothenburg which achieved good commercial success and excellent results on the tracks of the time. The 123 GT version was particularly rich in accessories and was fitted with a 130 horsepower B18 engine, sufficient to make it fast and fun to drive, also thanks to its weight of only 1,140 kilograms. On Forza Motorsport 6 it costs 14,000 credits, is included in the new E-Class (223) and can be used in the SuperStreet Volume within the Compact Classiche group during the career. Despite its heavy appearance and little pick-up, the Volvo 123 GT behaves fluidly and brilliantly especially when drifting, and is also very balanced once you pick up a good speed. The polygonal model is excellent, especially in the interior where the old horizontal odometer is striking, while the exterior suffers from a bit of aliasing on the grille, on the metal bumpers and on the side mouldings. In order of power, the second road car present in the DLC is the Cadillac XTS Limousine, a 2.5-ton ~monster~ as long as an aircraft carrier and decidedly more suitable for accompanying overseas VIPs than devouring the asphalt of a racing game. Derived from the XTS luxury sedan, this version is equipped with a powerful 227 kW 3.6 V6 engine which provides discreta power, although size and weight represent insurmountable limits in terms of performance. On Forza Motorsport 6 it can be purchased for 75,000 credits and is included in the slow E-Class (270), together with the vast majority of vintage ~grinders~. Despite being stable and assisted by an excellent braking system, fast corners are unfortunately its worst enemy, given that it inexorably tends to go straight. The interiors are a little too sober and anonymous, but in ForzaVista mode it is possible to access the rear seats and experience the unbridled luxury dedicated to passengers, amidst neon lights and a complete, faithfully recreated piano bar. On the outside, the model does not appear fully convincing, due to the rendering of the reflections along the mileage of the sides and the polygonal details of the rear portion of the car. On the other hand, the roar of the engine is good, which is deep and vigorous. Overall it is a car to try out sometimes on a whim, but it will have very few admirers also because it is unusable in Career mode. Diametrically opposite is the case for the British Caparo T1, an extreme custom-built car that has various characteristics similar to those of a Formula One, starting from the single-seater appearance, even if in reality there are two seats, with the passenger seat positioned behind to that of the pilot. It's quite a famous car for its reliability issues, highlighted during events and presentations. A few years ago it caught fire at 240 km/h during testing for the Fifth Gear program, and pilot-presenter Jason Plato suffered some burns. On Forza Motorsport 6 the car costs 400,000 credits, is included in the extreme P class (952), weighs only 672 kilograms and has 480 horsepower, specifications that push it over three hundred kilometers per hour and make it detach from 0-100 km/h in just 2.5 seconds. As can be expected, it is a very fast car with agile behaviour, which however, especially without aids, requires a lot of practice to be tamed, given that not carefully choking the gas and brakes almost always results in a spin. The polygonal model looks perfect in the iconic orange color both indoors and outdoors, plus it's virtually aliasing-free. Due to its particularity, it is unfortunately not usable in career mode. Small note for the nostalgic: the Caparo T1 was one of the best cars in the Project Gotham Racing 4 garage. Racing cars The four racing cars featured in the DLC are equally divided between classic and modern, expanding the selection of racing cars for the Corsa Pro and Extreme Motor Sports volume series, with the exception of the 1939 Mercedes-Benz W154 which cannot race in the career. Let's start our analysis with this pre-war ~Silver Arrow~, heir to the victorious W125 and equipped with a powerful 3.0-litre V12 supercharged with 474 horsepower. Thanks to the 490 Nm of maximum torque and the weight of 1,217 kilograms, the W154 is agile and snappy, nevertheless, due to the skimpy tires and the peculiar aerodynamics, it is a decidedly nervous car to control on Forza Motorsport 6, a detail which also adds the bad performance of the brakes. Included in the Class A (612) and costing a good one million six hundred and fifty thousand credits (fortunately the DLC cars are given away on first purchase), the W154 has an excellent polygonal model, both internally, with the huge wooden steering wheel and the three circular indicators in evidence, and in the exteriors, stained by aliasing only around the bonnet slits. Despite the age-related flaws, this is still a pleasant car to drive, especially from the inside view. The splendid Honda RA300 also has an indisputable classic charm, a Formula One from the 1960s which at the time had to contend with ~sacred monsters~ such as the Lotus Type 49. The car was known for its incredible speed, and not case the only Grand Prix in which she emerged victorious was precisely that of Monza. On Forza Motorsport 6 she is included in the S-Class (767) and is one of the queens in the Grand Prix Legends group. This is the best car in the DLC in terms of pure fun, thanks to the exciting driving position and agile and aggressive behavior on the track. The polygonal model, in the iconic white and red color that recalls the Rising Sun, is absolutely valuable, and it is possible to observe every minimum detail of the vigorous engine, surmounted by four aggressive black exhaust pipes. The rendering of the interior is also excellent. Fast forward about thirty years to the 1994 Nissan No. 75 Cunningham Racing 300ZX, a racing car derived from the apphighly refined coup produced by the Japanese company between 1983 and 2000. Victorious in various IMSA GTO championships of the time, this car has remained in the hearts of many racing game enthusiasts, since it was one of the most loved since the first Gran Turismo. The famous American actor and racing driver Paul Newman also won a few races on board the previous model. On Forza Motorsport 6 it is included in the R828 class, costs 650 thousand credits and represents an excellent choice in the Volume Corsa Pro for the Initial GT Racing series, where it has to contend with the Ferrari N.A.R.T. 512 DB/LM, the Audi 90 quattro IMSA GTO and the BMW Motorsport M1 Procar, cars that wrote the history of motor sports. The 582 kW of power make it particularly agile and aggressive, but it takes a lot of practice to fully appreciate it. Once tamed the 300ZX drives beautifully, and is a real pleasure to launch it around the fast corners of circuits such as Watkins Glen or Spa. The polygonal model is excellent and is only marred by a hint of aliasing on the taillights, while the interior is decidedly racing and Spartans, featuring a simple yellow digital gauge. We close our analysis of the Logitech G Car Pack with the Audi Team Joest R18 E-tron quattro, a prototype designed for the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC). Characterized by extremely advanced technology, the German car is a hybrid with 565 kW of power and a monstrous maximum torque of 1,300 Nm. On Forza Motorsport 6 it is included in the P (957) excellence class and is sold for one and a half million credits . Among the various LMP prototypes present in the Turn 10 sim-arcade, which are all a bit similar in terms of performance and behavior, it stands out for its fabulous braking system and carbon anthology in the interior. The driving position is on the right and in the center of the view there is an annoying windshield wiper in a neutral position, while the digital display is curiously integrated into the steering wheel. The polygonal model is excellent as is the sound of the engine, however in the upper part of the car there are some textures that are a bit too grainy.", "date": "2015-10-19", "grade": null}
