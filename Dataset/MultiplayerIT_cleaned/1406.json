{"name": "PC Calciatori 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pc-calciatori-2004.html", "text": "From the stickers to the screen PC Calciatori puts us at the helm of a team, but with a nod to some typical aspects of the sticker collections that have made Panini famous and universally loved. The first choice we have to make, in fact, immediately puts us in front of the possibility of following the classic route of the coach or trying the ~Superlega~, a video game and simplified version of fantasy football in which we can create a team as we like by choosing favorite champions and play computer-created lineups in the same way. If, on the other hand, we want to remain traditional, we will still have to decide whether to choose which team to lead at will, randomly or by embarking on a real coaching career by sifting through the positions available in Europe. In any case, the choice is not the most varied, in fact we will only have the Italian professional series available (A, B, C1 and C2) and 10 other European leagues, with a number of players that is around 20,000 of whom we will have always all the personal data, also for the players of A, B and the Spanish series A will also be available the photo. Furthermore, a certain imprecision was noted in some data and this is at least alarming considering that Panini makes the database its strong point. For example, I am referring to the names of the players themselves. Everyone knows that some players (especially those whose mother tongue is Spanish or Portuguese) only go by their surname or stage name (Figo, Ronaldo, Adriano, just to name a few), and are indicated as such in the formations, not with full name. Scrolling through the lists, however, you end up meeting other players who do not fall into this category such as Zinedine Zidane (who is not exactly the first to pass) who are indicated without either the name or the initial of the name for no apparent reason. Team management Moving on to the management part, the things to do are what one would expect from a sports manager: analyze the players, choose the formation, organize training sessions and manage the transfer market. The interface is structured as a tree, and it is always necessary to return to the main menu before being able to access any aspect of the game. A choice that becomes frustrating after a few minutes. Each player is characterized by 10 characteristics (to which physical fitness is added, which however is marked separately) which are then grouped into defense, midfield and attack, then further into an average value to simplify even more the choice between players . The system is extremely reductive, in fact to choose the players to put on the field it is enough to look at the intermediate values or even the global averages, with the effect that the individual skills end up becoming useless, given that it is enough simply to choose the players who have the averages higher. The tactic is then limited to the bare essentials. Almost all the formations used are present, but the additional options to further customize the strategy are very limited: pace of play, passes, offside, pressing, maximum shooting distance and the possibility of assigning man markings. No information on set pieces, crosses, the possibility of keeping the ball or passing immediately, nor on the type of game (offensive or defensive), especially the latter is missed because it is what can make the difference in the various situations, depending on the opponents and the provisional result. Instead, the training system seems quite simple and intuitive. At each stage it is necessary to assign the roles of the players who must participate in it, and the number of hours; at the bottom is the level of intensity that allows us to identify if we are asking too much of our players. It is also extremely pleasing to discover that the possibility has been included to customize training for individual players by indicating which skills they must concentrate on and how intensely. Unfortunately, however, there is no way to monitor the effects of training, so either you take notes continuously or you risk not understanding if the system adopted is useful or only causes damage. Without infamy and without praise the market, which offers the now indispensable search engine, but which does not offer any indication during the negotiations. In fact, it often happened to me to make offers higher than the market value for a player and find myself faced with a refusal saying that it was too little, but without specifying how much they wanted to continue the negotiation. So you have to go blind or save and reload endlessly, and the same goes forthe contract. In the field After many ups and downs we finally get to the game. The show is limited: no animations, no cutscenes, just static images of the players that occasionally appear in groups of 3-5 at a time (never seen more than 5 images to describe an action) and which should represent what happened in the field. The commentary of the match, entrusted to Massimo Caputi (testimonial of the game), is very limited. There are dozens of sentences, none longer than three-four seconds, and there are not two of them with the same tone of voice, with the final result that when an action occurs, the various comments attached to each other fail to communicate the feeling which one would expect, so much so that after a couple of encounters, one ends up muting the speakers. If the representation of the match is modest, the best cannot be said of the management of the team. The players' performances are updated only at the end of the first half and at the end of the match ~just like in reality~ (it is specified in the game manual). The problem is that, given that the gamer does not see the game because there is no animated reconstruction of the actions and he does not see the statistics updated in real time, it is not possible to understand who is playing well and who is better replaced. The statistics are used precisely to simulate the impressions that a real coach would make and that the gamer in this case cannot make because he is not watching the match. The economy Among the many things that as managers we should supervise, there is also the economic section. This includes staff management (doctors, assistant coaches, personal trainers, etc.), stadium maintenance and safety, ticket and season ticket prices, and sponsorship contracts. All these options are extremely simple and intuitive. We also point out the prices of tickets and season tickets which can be differentiated according to the areas of the stadium and the importance of the matches. In conclusion The impression one gets after playing with it is that it came out a few years late. It looks like a managerial game from another time, imprecise and devoid of any type of animation. However, the problem is not so much the lack of representation of the matches (although for obvious reasons it is the one that is noticed first), but the absolute inadequacy of the interface: constantly returning to the main menu is frustrating, and after a few minutes ago already feel like closing everything. There are no ways to compare individual player characteristics apart from the individual training screen, which obviously does not include players outside the squad. So it is difficult even just to look for the element we need without a block of paper notes in front of us, which today is unacceptable in a football management game. The same management of the team in the match is problematic. Without the statistics and the videos it is not possible to decide how to modify the strategy and with only three characteristics per player (as I have already said, in the end the others do not count) it is practically useless to make substitutions: why on earth should one player be replaced with another who does it have one point less than global? Furthermore, Panini proposed 17 leagues from 6 countries and 20,000 players, while its direct competitor Championship Manager 03/04 reached 96 leagues for 42 countries and over 255,000 players. The ratio is practically 1 to 8. In many ways it felt like we were playing the very first Manager, the one released in the early 90s. In defense it can be said that it is the first game produced by Panini, which certainly had a limited budget and costs only 19.90 against the 49.00 of CM03/04. The difference is notable perhaps in both quality and price. To you the choice. Pros: Individual training of the players Low price at 19.90 Cons: Irritating interface Few features Static game display Sparse and repetitive audio commentary Limited and not very useful tactics Behind the scenes of PC Calciatori 2004 For the uninitiated, PC Calciatori 2004 is a local product. In fact WaywardXS is a software house based in Savona, which since December 1996 has been doing its best to get a place in the sun on the international market and which has specialized in sports management, with productions such as Championship Rugby Manager, Gianluca Vialli's European Manager and Euro Club Manager. PC Calciatori 2004, which took on this name in Italy, belongs to the latter trendthanks to the notable contribution of Panini, and which in Spain is instead known as PC Superliga 2004. The progenitor of the series was Gianluca Vialli's European Manager, released in 2002, whose similarity is clearly seen. Going to look in more detail, the points in common between the two titles are really numerous: training, tactics, transfer market, management of the stadium and sponsors, even the phase of the match. The major differences are summarized in a restyling of the panels and some icons, the updating of the formations and the introduction of the Super League mode. If you want, go and take a look at the review by Gianluca Vialli's European Manager (link). 10", "date": "2004-01-28", "grade": null}
