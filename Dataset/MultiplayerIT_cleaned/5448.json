After publishing some free updates, the time has come for the DICE guys to put Outer Rim online, the first of a series of paid content. The environments linked to Jabba and his palace were followed a few days ago by those of Bespin, the planet where we got to know Lando Calrissian at the time, as well as a place that hosted some of the most famous scenes of the original trilogy. As usual, we spent a few days in the ranks of the Empire and the Rebels, to give you our opinion on the new DLC currently only available to Season Pass owners. Lando Calrissian and the Cloud City maps are the highlight of the Battlefront DLC dedicated to Bespin! AT-AT on the attack Like Outer Rim, Bespin also features a series of new maps that add to those of the basic version of Battlefront. To be exact, we find five new settings, linked to the famous Cloud City and dedicated to the different game modes. Unlike the previous update, Bespin offers news also for those who love wider-ranging modes, adding new settings for games such as Walker Assault and Fighter Squadron. As for the maps in their structure, the DICE guys did a good job of reproducing the areas of Bespin as we saw them in the original trilogy: it's easy to recognize the long white passages between the structures, just as it couldn't miss the famous room where Han Solo is hibernated in graphite. Obviously, not all maps are compatible with modes that host multiple players: the AT-ATs can only move in the largest one, set outdoors among corridors, fountains and crashed X-wings, while Fighter Squadron is dedicated a map that takes us to fight in the clouds and floating platforms of the planet. In strict terms of gameplay, Bespin's maps present a good variety between more open spaces and more claustrophobic passage environments, where the clash between the two factions often ends up concentrating on gaining control of an area identified as a goal. The predominantly open nature will make snipers happy, for whom it is no coincidence that a new blaster arrives among the weapons added by this DLC. Those who, on the other hand, like to jump into the action will probably notice an excessive lack of cover points in some areas, but it is mostly a question of doing a little practice to understand how and where to pass in order not to find yourself fried by the opponents' lasers . As in the case of Outer Rim, there is also a new 32-player mode, entitled Sabotage: in this case, the pretext is offered by some tractor beams deployed by the Empire around Cloud City, to prevent the Rebel ships from leaving Bespin. Whoever is part of the revolting side must therefore conquer the areas where the generators that feed the rays are located, then maintaining control of the extraction area to allow the means to leave. For those familiar with the world of first-person shooters, Sabotage's features will surely sound familiar, as it is ultimately a mode of conquest and control. A rebel in company Even if the article you are reading is dedicated to the contents added by the paid package, the free patch that paved the way for Bespin also deserves a small parenthesis. Its importance lies in the enhancement of the collaboration system, showing from this point of view the will of DICE to bring Battlefront closer to the Battlefield series. Through some measures, a greater synergy has been created between game partners, automatically recognized by the system when they find themselves fighting together. To this end, respawning next to allies now takes place more efficiently, and once our partner is killed for a certain period it becomes possible to take revenge by eliminating his killer. A little more glory also for assists, which are now taken into greater consideration when determining the individual score. Lando arrives The novelties of the DLC dedicated to Bespin obviously do not stop at the maps alone. We have already mentioned the new blasters in the previous paragraph, while the new Star Cards include binoculars that can report the position of enemy troops, a grenade that blocks the movements of the opponents and a similar ability that allows you to knock out droids and turrets . The methods of ggames involving the use of aircraft on Bespin's maps can now also count on the Cloud Car, available for both sides; its agility makes it easy to maneuver between the tall buildings of Cloud City, while the pair of special equipment includes a tool capable of confusing enemy detection systems and an inevitable pair of rockets. We close the list of news with another part of the main dish, namely the new heroes introduced by this package. In the ranks of the Rebels we now find Lando Calrissian, a character who certainly needs no introduction given the key role he played in the fight against the Empire in the original trilogy: finally seeing him in Battlefront is just a pleasure. When fighting enemies, Han Solo's friend can leverage his high blaster-in-hand capacity, as well as some support abilities that make him a little less immediate to play than others. Speech completely at the antipodes for the hero added to the Empire, that is the bounty hunter Dengar: a little-known character, except by the most avid Star Wars fans, essentially conceived to do damage to enemies with his attack skills. Moving towards the conclusion, for the DLC dedicated to Bespin we can make more or less the same considerations made at the time with Outer Rim, with respect to which the additions now present new features also for those who love wider-ranging modes. Without inventing anything particularly new, but showing off other famous settings seen in the episodes of the old trilogy, Battlefront remains dedicated to fans of the brand to which it is linked, who have shown that they appreciate what DICE has set up. If you are evaluating the purchase of Bespin, we also strongly recommend that of the Season Pass of the game, also for early access to content that you will otherwise pay more to enjoy late.", "date": "2016-06-25", "grade": null}
