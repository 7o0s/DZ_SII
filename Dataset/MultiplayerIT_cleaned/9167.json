{"name": "Nobody Saves the World: recensione dell'avventura trasformista di Drinkbox Studios", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nobody-saves-the-world-recensione.html", "text": "After the two excellent Guacamelee, in which it tackled the metroidvania genre with an original attitude, the Drinkbox Studios team decided to launch itself into top-down action RPGs, bringing the typical light-hearted spirit even to this type of game that still boasts competition fiercer: have they managed to confirm themselves? We would say yes, based on what emerges from this review of Nobody Saves the World. Already the demo published on the occasion of The Game Awards 2021, on which we had written last month's test, had rather convinced us, leaving us after a few hours of play with a great desire to return to this bizarre distorted world and the full version confirmed the good impressions, thanks to the addition of some gameplay mechanics that emerge only in a more advanced stage of the game in addition to the considerable size of the explorable world. In an apparent simplification of the standard features of RPGs, what the Drinkbox title does particularly well is to offer a constant stimulus to move forward and progress, despite the intrinsic repetitiveness of the game situations and of the gameplay structure itself. In fact, the foundation of Nobody Saves the World is something very close to grinding, the constant progression of the protagonist being the central element of the game, yet it is very difficult for it to be tedious, also thanks to its comic and light-hearted characterization, acting as fantasy RPG parody. Although the appearance may suggest something else, the game is closer to Diablo than to Zelda - to simplify - but still manages to maintain its own specific connotation that always makes it original and enjoyable. One, None and one hundred thousand The characters in Nobody Saves the World are heavily caricatured The story of Nobody Saves the World is not exactly that complex fantasy plot that one might expect from the genre, but it is enough to see a few images or a clip of video to understand it: the Drinkbox game is proposed as a real parody of the clichs of the genre , with an ugly, pale and completely naked protagonist who wakes up in a mysterious hut, suffering from the inevitable amnesia which makes his identity unknown. He is a nobody, in fact, and as such he is also rather incapable at first. However, the weight of a great quest to save the world seems to weigh on him, starting first of all from the discovery of the great wizard Nostramagus, the protector of the kingdom who seems to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Nobody seems to have any particular abilities, but after finding a magic wand within the first few minutes he discovers his main ability: being able to transform himself into a large number of different creatures, assuming their characteristics and attack, defense and movement possibilities, thus becoming a formidable fighter. Starting from the insalubrious prison where we are thrown a few seconds after waking up, we must continue our adventure in search of Nostramagus and against the evil that is darkening the kingdom, exploring the large map and taking part in a large number of quests. between dungeons to explore and no less dangerous movements between the various areas into which the territory is divided. The top view and some small puzzles related to the elements of the scenario may vaguely recall the style of Zelda, but Nobody Saves the World is detached from it for everything else, configuring itself as an action RPG in which the clash has a fundamental role, taking place always against huge waves of enemies and aiming above all at the growth of statistics and the management of these, in a particular system of progression and personalization of the protagonist. Transformations and constant progression Nobody Saves the World presents truly bizarre situations The main features of the gameplay are the ability of the protagonist to transform and the constant progression that accompanies each action of the game. The ability to change shape determines many fighting styles and also different movement capabilities, continuously changing the gaming experience: the different forms are unlocked through an intricate general skill tree, the ramifications of which lead to the various possible mutations, all quite crazy. It starts from the protagonist, essentially helpless (at least at the beginning) and goes towards decidedly bizarre forms, reinterpreting some typical RPG classes such as the magician, the warrior, the necromancer and the ranger but adding, between one and the other, even eccentricities such as the snail, the horse, the bodybuilder, the turtle and the mermaid, just to name a few. Each of these forms has, in turn, a series of progressive levels that lead to unlocking skillsspecifics, adding special moves and passive powers, but also unique movement possibilities that can open new paths in the exploration of the map, applying almost metroidvania characteristics to the game. weight of the transformations in the possibilities of exploration, but with the full version and the map in its maximum extension, the positive answer we were looking for arrived: the need to unlock new shapes and use them at the right moments emerges as an integral part of the gameplay to get to some places otherwise inaccessible, as well as solving some small puzzles that require the use of specific abilities of the different creatures. Nobody Saves the World: a detail of the skill tree referring to the different transformations These are still pretty basic gameplay elements and not very detailed, but they still work well to vary the action and force a certain rotation of the transformations. The other structural factor is provided by the constant progression, which serves as the main stimulus to progress in the game . Practically any action can be part of this continuous flow towards the evolution of the character, which is stratified on several fronts: we are dealing with the general level growth that concerns Nobody and the increase of the specific levels of each transformation that unlocks further different forms, abilities and powers. In addition to the completion of the quests, at any time we can also keep track of the other objectives to be achieved by simply looking at the HUD or by calling up a practical dedicated menu, to make it clear how this continuous completion of missions and sub-quests is fundamental for the structure of the game . Ultimately, it is precisely this constant grinding of the engine at the base of the gameplay and what drives us to undertake the missions around the map: it is easy to realize how the game is a sort of spasmodic race to increase the parameters, but the whole it is so well blended and rhythmic as to make this compulsive action truly irresistible to her. Gameplay and combat system Nobody Saves the World is a continual parody of fantasy adventure clichs The accumulation mechanism is found at different levels in Nobody Saves the World: not only in the constant progression of the protagonist, which translates the fight into a continuous evolution race, but also in large part in the construction of the clashes and enemies. More than focusing on the skill in dodging and timing, the clashes are resolved above all in the increase in the statistics of the protagonist, who finds himself having to face hordes of progressive and increasingly aggressive enemies, but this above all following an incremental logic. In short, rather than introducing new types of enemies with increasingly complex patterns, the game tends to bring together an ever-increasing number of them, somewhat in the style of Diablo, however there is also a tactical approach to combat in this case as well. standard attack, which depends on the chosen creature and its equipped weapon (all absurd, of course), we can count on some secondary skills, each characterized by specific attack bonuses: in general, we distinguish the classic subdivisions between melee, ranged strikes, single or area damage and the implementation of additional effects. However, the skill with the controller here leaves room for the ability to build a character capable of dealing with threats of different types, if necessary frequently changing the form of the protagonist and modifying his active and passive skills. A part of the Nobody Saves the World map The most interesting mechanism of the gameplay probably focuses on this aspect: the enemies have specific weaknesses to exploit or strengths to break, in terms of physical characteristics and reaction to elemental magic, which forces us not to settle on a few forms and attacks but rather range over the entire transformation tree, frequently switching from one to another in order to take advantage of the different characteristics. Furthermore, it also becomes necessary to mix the characteristics of different forms, putting together passive and active skills belonging to different creatures in order to be able to count on a wider variety of powers. Game world and dungeons Nobody Saves the World features somewhat hilarious dialogue The map is designed in such a way as to offer different environments to explore, each featuring related scenarios and enemies as well as some dominant movement and interaction mechanics (such as swampy and aquatic regions that require the use of swimming transformations) but the dungeonsthey are based on a random generation, therefore it is not to be expected, within these, the same study from the level design point of view. Considering that even the loot focuses exclusively on money and food (to recharge energy), it is understandable how the exploration of the dungeons does not really offer a stimulating experience, beyond the usual constant growth of the protagonist and the strange settings in where you can find yourself. In general, the highly caricatured graphic style that is characteristic of Drinkbox Studios, also in this case, manages to give a strong identity to Nobody Saves the World, making even the simple exploration of the map pleasant to discover places more and more strange and crazy characters. There is a certain recycling of some assets, both within the game itself, where the repetition of elements is very evident especially in the dungeons, and with the team's previous titles, with some sound effects that seem to be taken directly from Guacamelee, which it can however be taken as a sort of stylistic code. From an aesthetic point of view, both in terms of graphics and audio accompaniment, it is still a very pleasant and particular game, characterized by a rather unique 2D design.", "date": "2022-01-18", "grade": "8.4"}
