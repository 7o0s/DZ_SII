The Binding of Isaac for PC and Mac thus represents a sort of return to the past, to those simple and somewhat foul-mouthed Flash games with which the Californian developer has made a name for himself on Newgrounds and other browser game portals. It is a personal project made with the help of Florian Himsl over a period of four months, a minor title born almost as a pastime before actively diving into the development of Team Meat's next ambitious game. But then why are all your friends on Steam still playing it? Through the cellar One of the most atypical elements of the game is its narrative premise: the protagonist of the story is in fact Isaac, a child who loves to play and have fun, but who had the misfortune of being born into an overly religious family. It all begins when one day God orders Isaac's mother to take a leap of faith and sacrifice her son, who, perceiving danger, begins a long escape into the depths of the cellar of the house. It is undoubtedly a macabre incipit, so full of randomly scattered religious and pagan references that it is not clear whether the developer wants to induce the player to reflect on the inconsistencies and morbidity of the biblical stories, or if the intent was simply to make a good game with a nonconformist and taboo story. This beautiful canvas takes a moment to fade into the background, since the heart of The Binding of Isaac is in its game mechanics that effectively steal and mix elements taken from other titles. Thus we find ourselves in front of a sort of arena shooter  la Smash TV, in which to eliminate all the enemies that populate the environments up to the clash with the boss on duty, while the numerous references to The Legend of Zelda range from the structure of dungeons to rooms with merchants, from using bombs to destroy boulders to collecting hearts to restore energy. The game flows like this: you enter a room, make a clean sweep of enemies and move on to the next, continuing until the boss fight that separates the player from the next dungeon. As in the classic roguelikes, death forces you to start over and everything is generated randomly, ensuring each new game an ever-changing combination of enemies, items to collect and dungeons to face, and it is precisely this, combined with the mammoth amount of contents, to represent the real strength of The Binding of Isaac. The pleasure of surprise Between unlockable power-ups, secret rooms and creatures to face, the work done by McMillen in creating content is absolutely remarkable. You can count over a hundred items to collect, the vast majority of which allow Isaac to enhance his attack skills, grant him special powers or increase the speed with which he moves; the possible combinations are so many that it would not be surprising to come across unexpected design situations, and one of the reasons why you will continue to want to play and replay is precisely the desire to find out what other surprises await you around the corner. Exploring a dungeon, for example, you could enter an arcade where you can bet everything on slot machines, sell part of your energy in a blood bank, or you could still meet Satan himself, who will invite you to sacrifice your soul to obtain powers special. Given the randomness of the content offered in each game, the difficulty of the game also becomes unpredictable, and if the right combination of objects can transform Isaac into an unbeatable battle machine, an unfortunate session risks making the experience almost frustrating. Each enemy is characterized by a particular behavior and attack pattern that the player must learn to memorize and neutralize, while from time to time 'special' versions of the monsters may appear, more powerful, bigger and more dangerous than the traditional ones. To all this must be added the secret objects, the numerous alternative endings, the Steam objectives and the three unlockable characters that stand out for their attack, speed and range of shots, for a quantity of content that is difficult to find even in far more ambitious productions. At this point you will have already understood what the weak point of The Binding of Isaac is: the very first hours of the game are all in the name of surprise, mystery and the discovery of the unexpected; despite a structureure simple and deep down repetitive, you keep going, dying and starting over until the game inundates us with new objects never seen before and unpublished bosses. And yet, as we continue and the new contents make the experience more complex and articulated, this sense of discovery is less and less, sooner or later the news becomes increasingly scarce and we finally realize the repetitiveness of the mechanics. At some point, unfortunately, the magic of The Binding of Isaac fades and disappears, leaving you with the desire for new opponents to tear apart, new upgrades for your alter-ego and new surprises to discover. Barring a huge success and strong fan demand, it is unlikely that the game will be supported in the long term, but fortunately the author has already ensured that on the occasion of the next Halloween he will release a free update containing enemies and items at theme. Macabre yes, but with style Once again, Edmund McMillen's artistic talent is strong in every illustration, every animation and every cutscene, managing to mix a comic and cartoon drawing style with revolting monsters, morbid situations and bloody deaths. Within a few moments you can come across a lethal worm with a big smiling face, meet a little man hanged in a room full of dung or dodge the vomiting of a lard abomination. In addition to the goodness of the drawings, it is precisely the macabre originality in the design of the monsters that makes them so charismatic. It's a shame that the version currently available on Steam suffers from sporadic frame drops mainly due to poor Flash optimization, although an update aimed at fixing some annoying bugs should arrive as we write. In line with Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac is also a strongly self-celebratory game, and it will often happen to come across references to other works by the American author or other independent developers. Finally, everything is made even more gloomy and macabre by the excellent soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky, a talented composer and author of the music for Super Meat Boy and Canabalt: the songs that accompany the player range from rocking themes to mysterious and disturbing music, then exploding in a sinister children's choir capable of making one shiver at first hearing.", "date": "2011-10-03", "grade": "8.8"}
