{"name": "PaRappa The Rapper - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/parappa-the-rapper-recensione.html", "text": "Describing a game like PaRappa has never been easy and it isn't even now that it's reproposed in a revised and corrected version on Psp. The story of the game is centered on PaRappa, a small dog with long black ears who pines for love towards the same age Sunny Funny. The game unfolds on a plot very similar to that of a cartoon: PaRappa, although moved by the best intentions, is hindered in every way by his eternal bad luck and by his archenemy Joe Chin, the richest and most beautiful dog in the city, also It's on the hunt for sunny funny. The internships represent PaRappa's attempts to fix his mistakes or improve his situation, by learning kung-fu, getting his license, or cooking for his girlfriend. If in the Psx version the main adventure represented everything the game offered to the end user, in this ~remixed~ version for Psp players are given the opportunity to take advantage of PaRappa's immense load of fun even in multiplayer. In fact, the developers have seen fit to include in the game the possibility of playing ad hoc multiplayer for up to 4 players (obviously equipped with UMDs) or to download the demo of a level to take a look at what PaRappa offers. While remaining unchanged in content compared to its original version, all players equipped with a wireless connection can download five new game levels (after all, almost the same number of levels present in the classic adventure) from the official game servers in order to prolong the too short gaming experience. Probably one of PaRappa's biggest obstacles has always been the one linked to the eternal question ~what do I have to do to play?~, which is why the developers - today as then - have seen fit to insert a practice / tutorial mode in which one of the characters in the game (Katy Kat, the cat) teaches the baggy-pants dog how to rap to music. Kick and Jump PaRappa The Rapper is a decidedly atypical musical game, focused as much on pressing the right sequence of keys in time, as on freestyle and song interpretation. This is the element of absolute originality that for ten years now has gravitated around the canine rapper: in all the raps proposed by the game, what matters most is knowing how to keep time and knowing how to improvise one's moves on the notes of the song . PaRappa is the classic musical game that bases its structure on a horizontal bar which has the dual function of signaling the moves to be performed and making visible the beats (rhythm) of the song. The ~duels~ present in the six levels of the game take place as real duets in which the master on duty (Maestro Cipolla, even after many years is still remembered with respect) challenges PaRappa to repeat the moves he has just performed in the best possible way. The sequence of moves is exemplified by a series of keys to be pressed in the right sequence and with the right timing, absolutely necessary conditions to be able to continue with the song and complete the level. The player's performances are entered in the area on the right of the game screen, where a very simple scale of values ranging from (cool to awful) highlights the quality of the rap that is being carried out. As in many other musical games, another element for which PaRappa has marked the way forward is linked precisely to this last concept of game performance: if the player is not able to keep up with the pace, bringing his level of play towards the awful and bad categories, even the game setting will follow its bad rap with a lot of listless and disappointed characters, otherwise by rapping to the maximum of one's possibilities it will also be possible to reach a cool level (reachable only and only with the excellent freestyle) and then continue through the level by improvising on your own. Kick and Jump The graphics sector is probably one of the aspects that made PaRappa memorable and still does. The awkward animations of the characters (almost as if they were drawings made with Paint and subsequently animated), the absolutely saturated colors used, the comic lightness of the situations and that b-movie touch, make PaRappa an absolutely unique game of its kind and probably in the entire gaming world. The developers have managed to create a series of characters with almost sketchy features but full of personality, character traits and irony. However, the key element of the game remains the music, with rap songs from the most disparate origins and sources of inspiration (rap with oriental tones, reggae songs revisited in a rap key and so on...), and with absolutely out of the ordinary lyrics. Aspreviously mentioned, it is difficult to describe a game like PaRappa, and perhaps it is even more so in this moment in which it is difficult to separate what is the original game released for Psx from this version for Psp, and the reason is only one: the two versions are absolutely identical. Same content, same story, same songs, same methods: in the operation carried out by SCEJ to bring PaRappa The Rapper back to light it is difficult to find a real meaning, other than to give the possibility to younger players (those who have not been able to play to PaRappa at the time of its first release) to play this bizarre musical game. It's difficult to make sense of all this also because, exclusive contents aside, it takes a few months and maybe PaRappa could have been downloaded at a much lower price directly from PSN. The indisputable fact remains that PaRappa has made the history of musical games and that Psp - starting today - has another precious weapon in its holster. Pros: Memorable songs Graphic section still unique Ability to download extra songs online Cons: Too short and simple Identical to the Psx version. More a transposition than a remake Few extra contents Guitar Hero, Bust-a-Move, Dance Dance Revolution, Ouendan, Elite Beat Agent, Boogie, Beatmania, Singstar, Samba de Amigo, Space Channel 5. At first glance it's all too easy to see what all these titles have in common: they are all music games. They come from the most disparate consoles, from the Nintendo Ds through the Dreamcast, ending up on Ps2, yet there is an element that perhaps unites them all even more: they all came out after December 1996, the year in which a small dog dressed as a rapper with baggy pants and red hat. PaRappa (literally ~sheet of paper~) The Rapper cleared the fashion of music games on Psx, a fashion that in just over 10 years has grown dramatically, creating real mass phenomena (Dance Dance, Guitar Hero and Singstar above all) intended for an increasingly frequent audience of gamers and non-gamers. Raise your hand if you believed that little PaRappa would have succeeded in a feat of this magnitude. And you know the funny thing? The answer to this question he has always repeated before each performance: ~I have to trust!~.", "date": "2007-08-08", "grade": null}
