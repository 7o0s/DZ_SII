{"name": "Scratches: Graffi Mortali - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scratches-graffi-mortali-recensione.html", "text": "Mysteries from Africa The story of Scratches begins when the young writer of horror books Michael Arthate decides to move to the English countryside of Rothbury, and more precisely to a Victorian villa called ~Blackwood Manor~, in order to find tranquility and inspiration to give life to his next work . The place, immersed in a perennial unnatural calm, seems to be ideal for Michael's needs, but he soon realizes that dark secrets are hidden within the walls of that sinister mansion that risk irreparably compromising his sanity and, as if that weren't enough, even his soul. As soon as you start a game, you are immediately overwhelmed by the feeling of dealing with a tremendously ~old-fashioned~ product, and this is not necessarily a negative factor. The nature of Scratches, especially in the early stages of the game, is that of a reflective and exploratory adventure, with slow rhythms and dilated times. The graphical interface is reduced to the essentials, showing only the hand-shaped icon on the screen and, only when called up with the right mouse button, a simple inventory. The nature of the puzzles is appreciable, which to be solved must always be faced in a rational way and with the help of testimonies left by the previous inhabitant of the house and concrete objects, present in everyday life: nothing particularly ~metaphysical~ or abstruse, Therefore. The longevity of the Nucleosys title is certainly one of its weak points: despite a more than fair number of explorable places (it is also possible to visit the areas outside near the house) the time necessary for a savvy player to finish the game will not be very much: quantifying, we can assume an average of 6-7 hours. Graphics and sound The graphics, as you may have noticed from the screenshots, are the real sore point of Scratches. The technique used is the one we have already seen in many classic point and click adventures from a few years ago: a fake 3D obtained with two-dimensional images ~stuck~ inside the virtual sphere inside which the camera is located, which can be rotated 360. While not always managing to make the most of the depth effect, the 2D tables are more than discreet, and help create a palpable atmosphere. Unfortunately, the resolution used is fixed 800x600, without the possibility of intervening in any way (or rather, it is possible to edit the configuration file by hand but even doing so does not change anything), and this greatly compromises the final rendering on the screen, especially if you are used to higher resolutions. The positive side of all this is that the system requirements are particularly low: all you need is a PC with a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM and a 3D video card with 32MB of ram. From an audio point of view, the lion's share, despite particularly spot-on ambient sound effects, goes to the music. The quality of these is always more than good, making sure to accompany the player in the adventure and always keeping the tension level high. The dubbing is entrusted to professional actors, and it feels. Final comment Scratches is a sort of amateur production promoted to a commercial product, and this largely justifies the little budget available to take care of the technical aspect. If you are willing to pass over some inevitable defects, including the not exactly stellar longevity, Scratches can prove to be a real surprise, especially from the point of view of the atmosphere and the identification with the story. Also by virtue of the particularly low price, i.e. 20 euros (sold on newsstands), every lover of graphic adventures should therefore seriously consider purchasing it.Pros Good atmosphere Good audio sector Excellent price Cons Outdated graphics with a fixed resolution of 800x600 Short life Often predictable plot The little-known guys from Nucleosys Digital Studio, an all-Argentinian software house founded by bold Agustn Cordes and Alejandro Graziani, are trying to gain the appreciation of graphic adventure enthusiasts with ~Scratches~, a title developed with a very small budget that however boasts elements such as dubbing, atmosphere and effectiveness of the puzzles worthy of competing with those of far more expensive and prestigious productions. Scratches, as its creators want to let you know, is the first commercial graphic adventure ever developed in the homeland of the tango, and it certainly won't be the last: Nucleosys is already working on a new project. Let's take a closer look at the results of the efforts of these enterprising South American boys.", "date": "2006-06-09", "grade": null}
