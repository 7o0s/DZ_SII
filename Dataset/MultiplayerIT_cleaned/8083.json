Due to their immediate mechanics they have often been protagonists in arcades, even without obtaining who knows what success on home consoles, and in recent years they had practically disappeared. A Dubai-based team was needed to try to relaunch this trend, providing an interpretation that was in some ways unprecedented, and so Fuel Overdose landed on the PlayStation Store. The game offers us a gameplay on the one hand traditional, on the other full of strategic and action facets thanks to the introduction of weapons, ~grappling hooks~ and special abilities. The latter can be activated when the relative gauge is full, by performing ~crescents~ or similar movements with the right analog stick, almost like in a fighting game match, and each character has a set. Speaking of characters, the roster is made up of eight very particular pilots, each driven by different motivations but characterized by truly unoriginal traits: we have Lene, a blonde girl with enormous breasts, a girl who appears frivolous but is actually ready to take charge of the responsibilities entrusted to her by her clan; Hayden, the classic hottie with an unlikely hairdo; Ryuhei, the lonely samurai; A.J., the energetic punk of the day; Noa, an African boy who inexplicably knows how to drive a car; Rosa, also endowed with enormous breasts, a young leader of a South American clan; Odessa, a ~female~ android who specializes in killing people; and finally Hermod, a mysterious character that must be unlocked. But why all these clans and, above all, the races aboard armed vehicles? It is explained to us in the introduction of the Story Mode, on the notes of a beautiful rock song: we are in a post-apocalyptic scenario in which humanity has been decimated by a virus and the survivors must continuously take a vaccine to remain immune, but the Medicine costs money, and winning races like this is just one way to get it. Lights and shadows From the main screen of Fuel Overdose it is possible to access five different modes, namely Free Run, Championship, Story, Challenge and Multiplayer. Unfortunately, there was no way to try the latter: thanks to the Christmas holidays, during our tests we never managed to find active games or simply someone willing to challenge us. However, the offer seemed to us more than discreet in quantitative terms: the Story must in fact be completed with each of the eight characters to have a complete overview of the plot, albeit obvious at the level of the more traditional JRPGs, while the Championship is made up of four stages independent, with an increasing degree of difficulty. Finally, there are several Challenges, or races to be completed in particular conditions, for example without the use of weapons or starting with some handicap of a different kind. In short, you can play for quite some time, as long as I-Friqiya's vision matches your tastes. We, honestly, found ourselves in great difficulty in appreciating the peculiarities of this production, because the implementation of the various elements that make up the package seemed a bit confusing to us. Let's try to explain ourselves better: the developers have decided to tell the story in a certain way, using digital images to paint the post-apocalyptic scenario, only to introduce anime-style characters who have very little to do with that type of solution. The feeling (probably founded) is that the game was practically ready and then we wanted to add this ~manga~ substrate, with the busty girls and all, to increase the interest. Then there is clearly the question of the gameplay, and in this juncture, in our opinion, it was wrong to want to put everything on the plate right away: the range of actions that can be performed on the run is really too large to be able to master them immediately, and the risk is that many possibilities are put aside trying to focus on the point, or rather on the most effective weapons and on the pure and simple memorization of the tracks. Playstation 3 trophies Fuel Overdose contains eleven Trophies that are quite simple to obtain: just complete the tutorial, the Story with Hermod, perform actions such as eliminating twenty enemies, unlocking all cars, completing Challenges and so on. Unconventional weapons Beyond the interpretation that the Dubai team wanted to provide of arcade racers with a top view, there are elements that this genre cannot ignore, such as the cleanliness and fluidity of the technical sector. Racing on a track whose limits are not well defined is in fact not very pleasant, yet in this sense some crimes have been committedthe enormous ingenuity. In the first place, the graphics are among the ~dirtiest~ ever seen on PlayStation 3, so much so that sometimes even the cars appear difficult to distinguish; not to mention the design of the circuits, which sometimes present truly questionable solutions in terms of performance and cleanliness. Secondly, even the solidity of the frame rate is not guaranteed, given that a little chaos is enough to trigger ~blocks~ or heavy slowdowns, ending up well below the canonical 30 FPS although there is nothing exaggerated to move on the screen, indeed. The fact of opting for a view that is not fixed but dynamic, which changes frame depending on the point of the track where we are, sometimes works well and sometimes not; but it is above all the excessive proximity of the camera to create problems, in this case when we use weapons. Our vehicle is equipped with a machine gun, homing missiles and mines, but to lock onto a target we must necessarily have it nearby. Well, try to fire a missile and you will see that in 90% of cases its explosion will also damage you, and the same applies to the interesting possibility of detonating charges on the runway. Then there are the grappling hooks, also a good idea poorly implemented. In practice, we are given the possibility of closing tight bends using a cable hooked to a pin on the roadside, but the performance of this maneuver leaves much to be desired: instead of activating a sort of ~compass effect~, in fact, the hook does not that allow us to enjoy an extra cue, but the low effectiveness of the maneuver often results in an unwanted impact with a wall. So let's come to physics, because here too things have convinced us very little. It is not uncommon to see the various vehicles crowding and ~trampling~ each other during the clashes, an eventuality out of any plausible scenario. Not to mention when the tracks are ~open~ and our car begins to travel along the edges, with terrible consequences for the race. If and when the vehicle turns over, we can press the Select key to get it back on track, but here too there is a problem: we will have to press the R2 trigger several times for the game to notice that we want to restart (wasting precious time) and do be careful if you are in a curve, because the controls will struggle to work at first.", "date": "2012-12-28", "grade": "6.0"}
