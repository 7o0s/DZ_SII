{"name": "Jet Set Radio Future", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jet-set-radio-future_b.html", "text": "A bit of history... but is it needed? ;) There are Poison Jam, thugs on wheels with a nice blue ~scaly monster~ outfit and its angry Piranha mask... the NoiseTanks dressed in spacesuits and full-face helmets ;P... the Immortals, true fanatics of Egyptian embalming, so much so that you go around looking like real mummies!!! Fortunately, even if you will never have an easy life, not all rival groups are necessarily enemies, such as Rapid99, made up of ~only women~ (very very cool ;P), who will reveal valuable information on the continuation of the story . If at the beginning the number of Rudies is very small (i.e. 3/4 elements), with the unfolding of events, we will meet many ~freelancer~ characters on our way, who we will be able to bring to our side, after accepting (and winning, of course) the challenges they will propose to you. Here too the Smilebit designers certainly did not spare themselves, churning out a series of truly bizarre and well-matched characters, from black kids with stereos on their shoulders, to the ~recycled~ Robot (playing you will immediately understand why ;) ), naturally passing through dear maidens (I still haven't figured out what they have about kind ;P). Packaging - but is localization there? Thanks to Infrogames (or whoever) also Jet Set Radio Future can count on a great localization work... both the manual, the subtitles and the entire game interface have been translated into Italian, without presenting ( at least as far as I've gotten) translation or typing errors (even if the text is sometimes introduced too quickly making us lose parts of the conversation)... the only flaw that those responsible for Metal Gear Solid 2 could REALLY spare us ( unfortunately they ruin the pathos a little in particular moments, to a game that anyway will remain a milestone in videogame history). The manual, printed in the classic ~colorless~ format (contrary to what the Japanese are used to :( ), is well structured and complete; in addition to explaining the basics useful for the correct use of the game (commands, items, characters, etc. ), this small text explores the topics concerning the various multiplayer modes available and the use of the graffiti editor... explaining the function and command associated with each single Tools. Style is not H2o!!! - Graphic Department And Smilebit confirms it with this new chapter of Jet Set Radio, released some time ago for Dreamcast (unfortunately it was very unfortunate and above all underestimated), and now produced and ~designed~ for XBOX. Smilebit was the forerunner of Cell - Shading technology, churning out a game with a revolutionary look, damn gritty and incredibly original, which lends itself well to the background of the game (or should we say ~underground~ ;)) and the adrenaline-pumping actions that we will be called to accomplish. The areas are very large and the city is shown with long views, without ever shooting heavily or presenting significant slowdowns (we are always around 60fps! And slowdowns so strong as to break the game speed I have not noticed any). People, vehicles, animals (yes, there are those too, albeit almost exclusively ~feathered~)... in short, everything moves fantastically, fluidly and convincingly! The various elements made in Cell-Shading make this game a unique (unless you've already played the Dreamcast version) and rewarding experience. Even the animations seem well done, always fluid and well characterized... all to make the game as spectacular as possible... and believe me, if you like the ~cartoon~ look this JSRF is REALLY A SHOW!!! Sound - Concept of Love In a title like this, Smilebit certainly couldn't insert four sparse and flat songs ;) For the occasion, many DJs and composers were called (among the most active ones we can include: The Latch Brothers, Cibo Matto and Mike D.) to give life to an amazing and impressive soundtrack, perfectly in tune with the feeling of the game!!! The piece in the opening video (the initial one to understand), ~Concept of Love~ by Hideki Naganuma (that is the genius (very inspired heheh) who selected and directed the whole compartor musical!), is the best, in my opinion, among those included in this DVD-compilation, to reflect the soul of JSRF and is perfect for enjoying the evolutions of our favorites! Unfortunately, I was not able to use compilations included in the HD, even if the high number of tracks present certainly does not make us miss anything in terms of variety and sounds created ad hoc ... but it would certainly have been a very welcome thing, a simple menu to be able to insert songs or compialtions inserted by us on the HD; moreover, the only possibility given to us to select the tracks we want to listen to is reduced to just the map of the garage.. in all the others it will be the crazy DJ Professor K who chooses them for us... sometimes giving us annoying repetitions... From point out the use of the Dolby Digital Surround system (5.1 channels) to maximize involvement... you risk starting to dance taking your pad with you, instead of playing ehehhehe ;P (if you know what I mean ;D) But come!!! But who are they?!?!?!? - Playability Well here things get more delicate... as you well know, we certainly don't all have the same tastes... Those who have had the pleasure of playing the previous version will immediately find themselves as regards the movement of the character... while he will find a moment displaced by the Graffiti system... In JSR for DC, the Graffiti system was more complex, it was necessary to impart combos with the analog stick to draw in a single action, thus collecting many points! In this new chapter, the system has been simplified and reduced to pressing a single button (the right trigger) when we are near the wall to be covered with our ~little drawings~, to the benefit of game speed... This choice may not please everyone, but it is certainly compensated by the execution of graffiti placed in particular points, which require real acrobatic ~combos~ to be reached .. perhaps for a second or two, making this one much more adrenaline-pumping action (in fact the previous system implied a stop to carry out the combos and therefore a fragmentation of the timing of the game). But come!!! But who are they?!?!?!? - Playability Personally I found the selected command system excellent, but in my opinion, the possibility of moving the camera around us while we are running is missing... let me explain... it happens that we have to look around us, to find ~handholds~ where grind or billboards where you can ~go up~ walls, to reach hidden or difficult to access areas... this ~scan~ of the surrounding environment can be done thanks to the right analog stick, but only when we are perfectly still (with First Person mode, i.e. in first person)... I would have preferred instead if the camera (which for the rest of the time is external and positioned just above our character) had been rotatable (maintaining the external vision and not in First Person) even when we run or stand ~grinding~ (sliding) on a parapet or on a light pole... this would help us, making clearer the position of all the other ~exploitable~ objects around us and therefore on a greater awareness in the jumps (oh god what's up is it to my right? let's hope we catch that damn railing!)... moreover, it would have made the unfolding of the game even more spectacular :D But come!!! But who are they?!?!?!? - Playability As I said before, not everyone has the same tastes (and luckily ;P)... JSRF's physics certainly don't follow reality... practically we will never finish a Trick with our faces on the ground like in Tony Hawk , for example... The system therefore remains more simplistic (in short, arcade) also for this reason... and if on the one hand it could make purists turn up their noses (or btw those who prefer physics closer to Tony Hawk or Amped) , on the other hand, it makes the title open to everyone and at the same time decreasing the phantom breaking of the game speed... this speech in my case hasn't affected the enjoyment of the product, which can be played easily at the beginning, but which sucks the player into Neo Tokyo with its atmospheres, without ceasing for a moment, continuing to repeat ~I pick up another spirit and then take it off~ (if it were true ;-P)! The system of ~items~ that revolves around the game is made up of: *Cans: there are three types: yellow which count as a single unit; Blue worth 5 yellow cans; Reds that restore part of the character's energy; *Cassettes: tapes that contain the secrets of each level; there are one for each level, hidden in particular spots. By collecting them, the notes of the GG will appear where there is a summary of what to do to unlock (and moressively collect) the hidden spirits; *Spirits: each level has a specific number of hidden spirits, which can be collected after fulfilling particular requests and game performances; *Graffiti Points: these are areas where you can save your game and change which character to use. But come!!! But who are they?!?!?!? - Playability Even the usable characters have characteristics that differentiate them from each other and in addition to the classic Stamina (which determines our energy) and acceleration, we also find: *G-Stamina: or the resistance to being subject to graffiti by others on one's body (ehm, I didn't take it from a dictionary... in short, it's the bar of resistance to enemy sprays on us.. oh well, I hope you understood :P) *Spray: the maximum quantity of transportable cans; *Graffiti: the ability to spray graffiti (i.e. the speed and range of graffiti making) *Grind: the character's ability to slide over railings, lampposts, etc. Is the party here??? - Longevity and Multiplayer Mode JSRF, I found it just amazing in this area... ~Fantastically Scalable~ is the right phrase! And now I'll try to explain why... I find this combination of terms perfect to talk about the difficulty of JSRF, in fact depending on our desire to commit ourselves, the game is able to offer challenges of various kinds and ~caliber~... Is the party here??? - Longevity and Multiplayer Mode If you don't want to put in a lot of effort, spend hours finding a certain spirit to unlock this or that graffiti, stripping off all the extras and just sticking to the plot, JSRF becomes simple and easy enough to wrap up...but if we want to finish it one hundred percent, collecting all the spirits and unlocking all the extras (unless you use cheats, of course), you'll have to roll up your sleeves, because there will be plenty to do and time to commit to solving each ~under quest~ ! Although sometimes the AI of the enemies seems to be made to help us, actually decreasing the difficulty of the challenge, the possibilities of perfecting acrobatic movements in conjunction with the search for the highest score (always useful for unlocking further Spirits ;)), makes the soooo long game! The same game mechanics, the search for spirits, the introduction of the turbo (usable at the cost of 10 cans), serve to make the title a wonderful stepping stone to the paradise of perfectionists, but also an immense playground for the less ~perfect~ ;). Is the party here??? - Longevity and Multiplayer Mode The multiplayer modes are many and all can be played by friends, up to a maximum of 4, or in training mode, with bots (computer-managed entities) to take their place (not very friendly btw ;)). The game possibilities in multy are all realized in Split Screen and the modalities range from the simple race to who arrives first to a deth match to whoever graffitis + the opponents, from capture the flag up to an innovative ~capture the ball and get at least a lap without ever losing it~ ;P... In multiplayer battles there are many characters that can be used, all to be unlocked as the ~Spirits of Neo Tokio~ points are collected, in fact pushing the player to do more and more to unlock a greater number of characters. In short, there is something for all tastes! Before going on to read the conclusions, I encourage you to download a video of the game igrabbato directly from myself Conclusions Maybe it won't be a title for everyone... but not having it is really a pity... at least, if you're still not convinced, try to play it with some friends or in a ~demostation~... But you have to take it into consideration.. . is a true ~TRIP~ of lights, colors and truly indispensable music! Trust me!!! Pros: Unique and innovative design, look & feeling!!! If you get caught you risk not quitting for a loooong time! Audio and Music in Dolby Digital 5.1 and created ad hoc; High playability and great interaction with the surrounding environment; Difficulty ~scalable~ to your gaming commitment; Graffiti editor; Fast, adrenaline-pumping and spectacular! Cons: Lack of a mobile (at our discretion) camera system when on the move; General difficulty a little too low (Opponents waiting for us if we fall too far behind etc). We can't listen to our own compilations; The graffiti editor is too isolated, we can't import or export graffiti made by us or others, nor use memory cards.
