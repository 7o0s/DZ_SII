{"name": "World in Conflict - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-in-conflict-recensione.html", "text": "It would be simple, too simple, to define World In Conflict with the usual clichs: amazing graphics, innovative and immediate gameplay, over the top plot and immersive sound; we could, of course, but it would mean not doing justice not only to what WiC actually is, but also to what it represents. Defining its amazing graphics would be an understatement, if we compare it even to the more recent RTS, while saying that its gameplay is innovative would mean belittling the brilliant work of the developers: that World in Conflict was an announced success, this was already understood from the first closed beta, but one could hardly imagine reaching such a peak of excellence. Alternative History World In Conflict has its roots in the most classic of alternative histories: what would have happened if the Cold War, as history has taught us, had not ended with a mutual dismantling of arsenals? What would have happened if the Russians had decided to go on the attack, sending their war machine directly to American soil? You will find the answer to these questions in the course of over 15 missions, which will see you fighting not only on American soil, but also in Europe, at the head of a NATO contingent, and in the frozen wastes of Norway, grappling with a series of special and top secret operations: all told through splendid videos made with the game engine, able to give the sensation of being in front of a film more than a simple video game. However, the real touch of class, which distinguishes World in Conflict from many other productions, is given by the magnificent use of hand-crafted tables on which dialogues of such beauty are grafted and recited with such skill that, sometimes, you will struggle to hold back some tears or anger that grow inside you. Thing of the past If pathos is guaranteed by the opening and closing films of each mission, during the actual game (which we could define as the interactive aspect of this film), World in Conflict keeps expectations high by showing a graphics engine of excellent quality, able to detach by several measures any engine seen in other RTS and, even, in many shooters. You will find yourself in front of battlefields, both city and field, covered in flying debris, wreckage of destroyed vehicles, black columns of smoke rising towards the sky, while your units will move extricating themselves between explosions and artillery salvos, flown incessantly by attack helicopters and, even higher in the sky, by heavy bombers. The sense of a real large-scale battle is not conveyed, however, by the high number of units present on the map, but rather by the total interactivity of the surrounding environment: any element, be it a tree, building or bridge, can be destroyed, burned and demolished with enormous joy for your eyes and, as we will see shortly, with serious repercussions also on the gameplay. Particular applause goes to the obsessive care placed in recreating the single units in all the details, ranging from the crests of each battalion, up to the damage reported in combat: these are, of course, simple little touches of class, but which contribute to significantly improve the experience that World in Conflict offers you. An Interactive Movie The rich and well-constructed plot fits perfectly with the humanity of the characters you will meet: forget about getting to know the usual Full Metal Jacket-style Instructor Sergeant or Marines fearless in the face of death, but you will be shown all the (terribly) human side of the American Army, with officers covered by insecurities hidden behind ranks, with captains who have to come to terms with their conscience and live with their mistakes, with superiors who will find themselves having to take decisions sometimes so drastic as to show themselves in all their desolate weakness, while the simple soldiers will show you one of the few positive feelings of the game, friendship. An Interactive Movie These are elements that have never been shown to us in a strategy game, which brings World in Conflict closer to cinematic productions similar to Saving Private Ryan, rather than the usual modern clone of Age of Empires: this humanity that permeates every single unit will also condition your way of approaching the game, so you will hardly feel like sending a small group of soldiers in advance, perhaps against an enemy outpost, but you will be much more inclined to act with caution, to plan your every single move and to make extensive use of engineering units to repair the damage suffered:and you will also have to get used to the small shiver down your spine when, on the horizon, you will see dozens of enemy units appear directed against your position. The new libraries The question that arises spontaneously is whether all this aesthetic splendor has a negative impact on the minimum hardware requirements of our computer: the excellent commitment of the developers, placed in every element of the game, is also known for the excellent optimization work carried out on the engine. Offering you a very large scalability, which includes (just to name a few) the quality of the shaders, that of the reflections, which objects reflect in the water, the rendering quality of the trees, that of the clouds and so on, the game will allow you to reach , behind a few minutes spent in the options panel, the best compromise between quality and performance, adapting perfectly to your system. Unlike many other products, the guys from Massive have decided to focus their attention on making the game usable to the greatest number of people: we refer you to the hardware box of the article to get some reference configurations and further details on the FPS achieved. It should be noted that, as has recently happened in this transition phase from the old to the new Microsost libraries, World in Conflict also allows you to take advantage of some DirectX 10 effects: unlike other titles, which boasted of being the first to use them ( we refer to Lost Planet and BioShock), in the Massive title even a completely fasting person can notice, by eye, the difference between the two versions. Using the new libraries, each single unit model is enriched with some purely aesthetic elements, thus avoiding the impression of being faced with many small vehicles that have come out of a perfect cloning machine; details which, however, are a real feast for the eyes when you see them jump away. DirectX 10 also brings a handful of new effects, such as a nice blur associated with each explosion, in case the camera is close to it, and particularly well done heat distortion effects. In fairness it must be said that, except in some rare moments, you will hardly pay attention to such details, so much will you be engaged in your furious battles: if, however, you were thinking of changing your video card with one compatible with DX10, without a doubt World in Conflict represents the stimulus (and justification for spending!) necessary and sufficient to take this step, if only to enjoy this masterpiece without framerate problems. The innovations We are well aware that the first impact is very important, but not fundamental: any game that fails to keep the player's interest alive is necessarily destined to be soon forgotten or, even worse, not finished. In this case, World in Conflict not only looks beautiful from the outside, but its real strength lies precisely in the ingenious mix of elements that make up its gameplay: fortunately, forget about spending hours and hours collecting resources and building granaries and other structures, because finally these now, frankly, obsolete mechanics have been given a decisive blow. Each of the long missions, which make up the World in Conflict campaign, will require you to choose the composition of your army, among a particularly varied pool of vehicles, aircraft and men: it is, of course, a completely free choice and which will vary depending on the player's personal tastes; if, for example, you are passionate about hit and run, you will probably opt for a composition that is based on fast Jeeps and infantry units, capable of setting up deadly ambushes inside the bush and buildings, while if you prefer the hard and pure, you'll surely fall back on heavy tanks and artillery support, capable of wreaking havoc on anything that stands between you and your objective. An important choice, therefore, but which will not see you bound in any way: the developers have structured the missions so as to make them complete with any combination of units, avoiding the frustration of coming close to victory, but seeing it blown away just because you have not purchased a certain medium. We then come to talk about the other blow in the sponge, which sees the classic system of the Chinese morra abandoned (in part), now abused by any strategy title, for which any unit is particularly suitable for facing another, but it is extremely vulnerable against a third: this often led to having to choose carefully which units to produce and insert in one's army, to face an advancingspecific versary. The innovations Aware of the limits of the system, the guys from Massive have decided to perfect it: given the particular type of clashes in World in Conflict, in which you will have to face different types of units (infantry, aircraft and armored vehicles), the solution reached was to equate all units, differentiating them only in terms of their effectiveness in combat: thus, a heavy tank will be very well able to defend itself against an aircraft, even managing to shoot it down, but reporting a greater amount of damage than it would have immediately an anti-aircraft vehicle; similarly, a simple infantry unit is capable of destroying a heavily armored vehicle, provided that the player has the foresight to resort to his special ability or to hide his men in a wood, guaranteeing them greater protection. Other innovations? Thus, the other interesting aspect of WiC is introduced, namely the presence of specific abilities for each unit: it is not a question, as happened in other RTS, of mere accessory elements, but of factors that can overturn the result of one clash with a simple click: resorting, for example, to a smoke screen can allow your tanks to retreat safely, while a barrage of Mk2 grenades can prevent the enemy from conquering a salient point on the map. The player, throughout the single player campaign and also in multiplayer battles, will be able to access a particular menu from which to call up support from outside the map, spending the hard-earned ~Tactical Points~, obtained by destroying and damaging enemy units and structures: it is not only a valid ploy to make the clashes even more spectacular, with bomber flights, artillery barrages and paratrooper raids, but elements that are perfectly integrated into the game mechanics. The park of support requests is quite large and varied, ranging from simple artillery fire aimed at an area of the map, used to quickly eliminate large groups of enemy units, to carpet bombing, devastating against anything in the wake of the bomber: the introduction of these elements makes the gaming experience more complete, as well as integrating the offensive potential of your army; if, by chance, your group of tanks finds itself under the crossfire of RPGs coming from the surrounding forest, to avoid suffering huge losses you can request a nice napalm attack, which among other things, will also open an alternative way for you in the bush. It is essentially a further element that reveals a precise choice of the developers, namely that of not penalizing the user in any way for his choice, but only making him pay, bitterly, for any tactical error he commits. person: it will therefore be your mistakes that make the game over appear, and not some defect in the calibration of a map. Which, of course, represents a tragedy for all those who think they are expert strategists. The Multiplayer.it Contrary to the bad habit many developers have taken up in recent years, World in Conflict is not one of those weekend games, those titles created specifically to offer a lot, but for a very short period of time, so as not to overly engage the player. The single player campaign, although quite simple for veterans of the genre, will still keep you busy for about 10 hours of play on a normal level, while you can easily go up to 15-17 if you try to tackle it on a difficult level. However, longevity is ensured not only by the presence of a single-player Skirmish mode, but especially by an absolutely top quality multiplayer component: this will see you engaged in frenetic battles to conquer key points on each map, exactly as happens in the single campaign player; the substantial difference is that you will not be able to freely compose your army, but as soon as you have chosen the faction for which to fight (USA, USSR or NATO), you will also have to choose a particular Company, among the four available, i.e. Infantry, Armored , Air Force and Support. Obviously, the choice will affect the units that you can deploy in the game, limiting yourself only to those that belong to your Weapon, with some exceptions, which however will require an exorbitant amount of unit points. it will therefore be your mistakes that will make the game over appear, and not some defect in the calibration of a map The Multiplayer.it This precise selection obviously involves a necessary collaboration between all the members belonging to the same faction", "date": "2007-09-26", "grade": null}
