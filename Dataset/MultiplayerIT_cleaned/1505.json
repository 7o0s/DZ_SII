{"name": "Medal of Honor - Breakthrough", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medal-of-honor-breakthrough.html", "text": "Breakthrough Literally the term Breakthrough (from now BT) means ~to break through~ and in military terms it could mean an action to break through enemy lines. Already from the first level of the first mission you can understand what BT offers: you are catapulted into the middle of the Tunisian desert at the height of a trench battle, immersed in a dense and swirling blanket of sandy dust, from whose mist you can barely see the flames of machine guns and the silhouettes of German panzers. The enemy bullets whistling all around and the roaring explosions intertwine with the cries of the soldiers, who fall by the dozen into that chaos of unheard-of violence. And we are only at the beginning... In the three campaigns proposed by BT we will wear the American uniform of Sergeant Baker, who will have to cross hot North African battle zones, escorting road demining convoys and penetrating the heart of enemy lines, then passing in our dear Sicily, to eradicate a large concentration of fleeing Germans, to then finally reach the historic lands of Monte Cassino, on whose hills the most violent and bloody battles of the Second World War will be fought! Eleven levels are enough for me... In the eleven levels proposed, as can be partially seen from the photos, you will have the opportunity to experience the most intoxicating war actions that have ever been proposed to a gamer. How can we fail to mention the different situations in which standing on a bouncing jeep, armed with a red-hot MG42, we enter at full speed into the heart of the enemy lines, while all around, hidden in the ruined houses or scattered behind a thick bush, a myriad of Germans target us with precise shots and lethal bazookates! If this weren't enough to steal secret documents inside an enemy ship, moored in a port full of soldiers or sabotage planes in the heart of an airport manned worse than a prison, it should more or less clarify the dominant fulcrum of the type of missions we will go to face in BT. Eleven levels are enough for me... The nature of the levels, which we remember set up by TKO Software, denotes a strong preponderance of violent and chaotic action. It almost seems like playing a new Operation Wolf (who remembers this legendary game?), in which continuous waves of enemies besiege us from all sides, with our reflexes representing the only solution to eradicate the arrogant and overwhelming difference in number of opposing forces! Many times we will be the only ones to counter the enemy, playing the role of cover for the spy on duty or giving a hand to a completely besieged defense position, with energy and ammunition always close to absolute zero! Crazy... ... and nine maps for multiplayer too! In addition to singleplaying, which we have already praised, let's also add the multiplayer section, which will represent, in the long run, the longest part of the title. Nine maps, a few more weapons, the Italian uniforms and a new game mode, Liberation, are the novelties that BT brings to Mohaa. The architectural workmanship of the maps is amazing! Just see the ruined Palermo or participate in the Tug of War of Monte Cassino to realize the high quality achieved in this expansion. The additional weapons, almost all Italian, have balanced the two deployments and have even brought, albeit partially, an adequate balance to the long-range machine guns, whose fire rating has been halved to meet the pressing requests of the fans, frustrated by the fragged with mathematical ease by a short gust not so precise. The Carcano is a fine example of an Italian rifle, which however often needs two bullets to take out the adversary and the Moschetto submachine gun, with its forty rounds and high speed, is an effective weapon for all occasions, remaining accurate even at long distances. A Beretta pistol of clearly local production, a Piat rocket launcher with a dove trajectory, a Vickers-Berthier machine gun with vertical coupling cartridge, a DeLisle as silent as it is lethal, anti-personnel mines plus detector and a series of renewed hand grenades conclude the new equipment brought by BT. ... and nine maps for multiplayer too! The Liberation mode, inspired by the famous Quake III Arena mod, JailBreak, implements the ~arrest~ of fragged opponents, who can be freed by penetrating the enemy area where the prison is located and opening the doors by activating a switch usually placed at some distance from the bars. It is obvious that the area is manned by defense posts and bunkers availablead hoc, which make the life of the liberator difficult, who is often the victim of being arrested too. He wins the side that manages to imprison all or most opponents at the end of the game time. Last but not least, the Tug of War mode is still present, with three related maps, which added to those of SpearHead, elevate the mission sector dedicated to this wonderful multiple-objective mode. Conclusion BT is the only expansion around that is actually worth dedicating your savings to. The playability is amplified by pure action: from start to finish you will shoot without a moment's pause and the quality of the missions is always high, without having drops as in the previous SpearHead. BT features the best of Mohaa and gets so wrapped up in the realistic feel of the game that in the excitement of seeing ~what's next~ you'll finish it ahead of schedule, thus halving its actual longevity in the game. singleplaying. However, the need was felt to play a similar title, which satisfies the insatiable hunger of the effeppiessaro, before the advent of the future Mohaa-Pacific Assault, which will completely renew the FPS genre set in the WWII. and of which another great title, Call of Duty, will soon be released, which will hopefully be released shortly, in conjunction with the pre-Christmas sales period. In conclusion, we recommend the purchase of BT, which, like a small barrel of wine, presents small pearls of excellent quality compared to the insipid quantities of silly material contained in similar titles of recent years. Pros: Unparalleled war atmosphere! High gameplay, with intoxicating battles. Improved graphics engine. Excellent workmanship of the maps in multiplayer. Cons: Short singleplay longevity. Frustrating difficulty in the last levels. Few changes made to multiplayer game modes. Excessive drop in fluidity in overcrowded situations. Premise Medal of Honor - Allied Assault is the first person shooter that best represents what has been produced in the last three years: superb historical setting of the Second World War, pressing soundtracks, playability raised to the highest levels, have contributed to giving it an enveloping atmosphere and a unsurpassed traits. It is normal for a title of this stature to have strong requests for ~expansions~ and considering the sales success, our Mohaa has had two: the discreet SpearHead, which if on the one hand has added new missions and weapons, from another has given rise to strong imbalances in the multiplayer sector (still the cause of strong discussions among fans) and now the brand new Breakthrough is also included, of which we are going to draw our opinions on the spot ...", "date": "2003-11-04", "grade": null}
