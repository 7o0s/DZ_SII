The question is why the triple A market has managed to miss out on a similar vein, which is based on a very simple concept: to stimulate the creativity of users. Terraria does not have cutting-edge definable graphics, given that it disfigures in front of that of many platformers of the 16-bit era. It doesn't even have some of the features that are considered essential in all modern video games in order not to alienate the user, such as a detailed tutorial or the classic tricks (arrows, maps, and so on) that guide you through the levels step by step. It's a difficult game with a very steep learning curve. We often die and just as often we find ourselves lost in the depths of the earth, perhaps because we no longer have torches with which to light up the caves or because at times it seems we are digging in vain. Yet they bought it in hundreds of thousands and immediately a similar phenomenon was created around the game, albeit smaller, compared to the one that happened with Minecraft: dedicated sites were born and thousands of users began to publish their works created by playing. Sure, it doesn't offer all the possibilities of Notch's masterpiece, also due to the smaller size it has, but the effect you get when playing it is similar: addiction. It will be that when you start building a house you want to complete it, whatever the cost. Why? In short, a title like Terraria costs little, fascinates for weeks, if not months, and is supported more and better than any triple A production. At the time of writing this review, we have just had the opportunity to test version 1.05, which adds a lot of content. .. so many that if Re-Logic wanted they could have been sold as DLC. But nothing, everything for free. Do you think it is a coincidence that Terraria has been in the Steam top 10 for months, keeping up with and overtaking in sales games that will have cost thousands of times as much, advertised everywhere? Yet describing it is not so interesting (but couldn't the same be said of Minecraft?): in the role of a young hero you have to dig in search of material to use to create a stronghold well defended from the enemies of the world of Terraria, where to host other people and make the right equipment to face the most dangerous monsters and bosses. Interesting? What if we told you that most of the playing time is spent digging in search of the veins of the most precious materials? We're talking hours and hours of life as a virtual miner where zombies and slimes are the most pressing problems and where the sighting of a vein of gold can be compared to a miraculous event. Fun? Apparently not, so why can't those who start playing it be able to stop? Why do you spend time admiring the fruit of your work, melting materials, joining artifacts and doing all activities that in any other game would be considered harmful? Like Michelangelo Terraria has the same charm as a piece of clay for a child or a block of marble for Michelangelo. What you want is already on the map, you just have to find it and get it out. The taste is to perceive the spurious material as a potential from which to generate an idea, a creation, to be irretrievably exposed on the internet. There are also platform and combat sections, but they are secondary to the rest and you only notice them when you've managed to do what you wanted in terms of construction; also because adventuring in the most dangerous areas with a wooden sword and a bucket on the head means certain death. In reality there is a certain gradualness in exploration, because some areas become explorable in safety only when you have good armor and a good set of weapons (or maybe the right spells... yes, in Terraria you can become also wizards). There is no shortage of special pieces, to be created following very difficult recipes to make (especially some of those added since patch 1.05 are really complex) and objects that have a mere ornamental function, excellent above all for showing off with other players and for making screenshots (or movies) to put online. Among the most relevant innovations brought about by patch 1.05 is the 'Hardcore' mode, which makes common enemies and bosses more difficult to eliminate, increasing the already high difficulty and creating the definitive experience for the player who never has to ask.", "date": "2011-06-29", "grade": "8.8"}
