{"name": "NBA Inside Drive 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-inside-drive-2006.html", "text": "The news I confess that I enjoy dealing with basketball titles, so it's no surprise that I spent many hours in the company of this game as well as its predecessor. So what has changed, maybe just the name? Fortunately not, even if at first glance the 2002 and 2003 versions appear identical in all respects, but after a few games the first impression fortunately vanishes. If it is true that from the graphic point of view there is no change and therefore no improvement, much more pleasant surprises come from the playability and from that of the modalities. NBA Inside Drive 2002, far from being a bad game, lacked all those options and depth of play that instead made the fortune of its direct competitors. Most of the defects have finally been resolved and NID2003 finally appears able to offer everything you can ask for in a basketball simulation. So here is the franchise mode, absent previously, which brings the item ~longevity~ back to the highest levels. In fact, it is possible to play up to 25 consecutive seasons at the end of which it will be possible to enter the NBA hall of fame which only the best teams, the most successful coaches and the most established champions can aspire to. An Italian in the NBA: mirage or reality? However, the developers of High Voltage have decided to do things in the best way by delivering the complete management of the teams into our hands. We can therefore take part in the early season drafts trusting in a good choice of rookies, choose among free agents (players without a contract) or create a player out of nothing, a possibility that we were denied last year. Given the lack of Italian basketball players in the league, I couldn't resist the temptation to create some ~local~ players, first of all Pozzecco and Meneghin who for one reason or another failed to snag a contract in the last American summer camps. The economic management of the team acquires equal importance compared to the technical-sports management, therefore it is necessary to pay attention to the wallet and the salary-cap which it is always better not to exceed. The training section is also very interesting, which allows us not only to perfect the shooting action but also to try movements of approaching the basket and moving the ball. Among the other modes, the classic ~playoffs~ and ~single game~ could not be missing, which represent the best solution for those who think they do not have the patience necessary to complete an entire season. Defense, this stranger... NBA Inside Drive 2003 maintains the connotation of a simulative arcade game that places it in an intermediate position between the realism of Sega Sports NBA and the pure arcade of NBA Live. Compared to the previous edition there have been some additions to the playability that allow the development of a greater number of actions both in the high post and in the low post. It is therefore easier to observe players who free themselves from the markings to take a shot from the 3-point line or others who cut under the basket to receive our pass. If then the organized actions do not lead to collecting ~easy~ baskets, it is always possible to force the opposing defense with a movement back to the basket which aims to push the opponent's marking backwards. This action is accessible via the left trigger and in most cases results in a hook shot or a free pass to a free man for a long range shot. Despite the additions, I would have expected to find some more spectacular action but unfortunately we have to settle for the usual dunks. As far as the defensive phase is concerned, however, the doubts that I have also had in the past due to the absolute impotence towards the offensive action of the opponents remain. The feeling is that the attacks definitely have the upper hand against the defenses, even if deployed, and that any action, from stealing the ball to the rebound jump, is damned difficult to execute successfully. Also missing is that pressure, that constant physical contact that we are used to seeing in matches broadcast on TV, replaced in this case by the static nature of the defenses which almost never appear capable of blocking the way to the basket. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that NBA Inside Drive 2003 is a fun and addictive game, certainly more than its predecessor. It is in fact possible to develop fluid actions, which make sense for the purposes of the tactics we have devised and therefore the feeling that the baskets are the result of chance is less strong.Technical foul! On the technical side, there are very few innovations and I can safely say that NBA Inside Drive 2003 is practically identical to NID2002. Polygonal models, stadiums and textures appear unchanged and this can only be considered a negative note given the progress made by XBox in recent months in the graphics field. As for the animations, there have been some appreciable additions, especially in the offensive movements but unfortunately we are still far from the standards of other productions both in quantitative and qualitative terms. The sound can instead boast a commentary, strictly in English, of absolute depth thanks to the competent commentary by Kevin Calabro, Marques Johnson and the new acquisition Kenny Smith. The sound effects are also good even if the atmosphere that surrounds the matches appears more appropriate for friendlies in a suburban pitch rather than a match framed by 20,000 spectators. Comment NBA Inside Drive 2003 is undoubtedly a good game. Despite some flaws, the additions made by High Voltage have helped to make the gaming experience more satisfying which should now not dissatisfy fans of basketball made in the USA. However, there is still a long way to go to be able to close the gap that still divides the Microsoft game from the competition. While awaiting further progress that will surely arrive in the next edition, I recommend the purchase of NBA Inside Drive 2003 to all those who live on bread and basketball and to those looking for a good pastime waiting for the release (finally also in Pal version !) of NBA 2K3. Pros: Well structured career mode Gameplay improvements Simple construction of actions Cons: Defenses often powerless Number of movements available not great No graphical improvements Microsoft hits the basket Stars and Stripes professional basketball returns to XBox with the 2003 version of NBA Inside Drive just in time to kick off the new NBA season. Will the Lakers of the fantasy duo Shaq-Bryant be able to reconfirm themselves as champions for the umpteenth time? Difficult to predict considering that the competition from other teams is becoming increasingly fierce, it is a little easier to try to establish whether this NID2003 can finally stop playing the role of ~poor~ brother of the equivalent productions of Sega and Electronic Arts. Do you want to find out the truth? Put on your shoes then because it will soon be time to get down on the parquet together.", "date": "2002-11-14", "grade": null}
