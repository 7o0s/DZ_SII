{"name": "Advance Wars: Dark Conflict - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/advance-wars-dark-conflict-recensione.html", "text": "Advance Wars: Dark Conflict is available for Nintendo DS. War renewed The ~unit park~ of the previous Dual Strike has been revised and corrected, with the aim of rebalancing some aspects that were not entirely successful. Among the new troops available, the soldiers aboard sidecars are particularly interesting, capable of capturing cities and structures and at the same time very gifted in terms of movement possibilities, thus making the recovery of resources much faster and more dynamic. The possibility of having a support commander and consequently of using additional powers has also been eliminated, and new terrains with peculiar characteristics have been added. In addition, your men can earn up to 3 upgrade levels by eliminating enemies, which allows you to improve the attack and defense qualities. More generally, Dark Conflict is therefore a decidedly essential and dry chapter of Advance Wars, which takes a step back by returning to making the basic mechanics the undisputed protagonists but without trivializing or debasing the gaming experience. Indeed, the latest episode of the series produced by Nintendo is in all probability one of the most balanced, which puts the experience gained to good use without chasing the obligation to add elements with the risk of weighing down the gameplay. And so the story mode runs smoothly which is a pleasure, despite the excessive verbosity of the dialogues and the presence of a plot never able to make the leap in quality beyond the ~normal administration~. The big news proposed with regard to the available modes is undoubtedly the online multiplayer, with which to challenge flesh and blood users and even communicate via an excellent quality voice chat, which obviously takes advantage of the console's built-in microphone. While certainly giving the DS the advantage of having more time available, it is therefore clear that today the Nintendo laptop has much more developed online multiplayer capabilities than the Wii. Obviously there is also the possibility of organizing local challenges with single or multiple cartridges. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, we must frankly admit that we were not particularly impressed by the artistic direction adopted which, in line with post-apocalyptic themes, brings with it an absolute predominance in the use of brown, gray and red hues. Even the chara design is involved, focusing on a banal and less incisive style. The sound is decidedly subdued, made up of traces that struggle to remain in the memory. Comment Advance Wars: Dark Conflict is not the classic chapter of the series that we would have expected. On the contrary, it represents a real turning point, going to change in a decidedly marked way the atmosphere and the setting that had so far characterized the work of Intelligent System. At the same time, even the gameplay, while remaining anchored to the ~historical~ mechanics, has abandoned the superfluous by taking a step back in the desire to offer an essential and extremely dry experience. In the end, we are therefore faced with a title of great quality, but certainly destined to make the community of longtime fans of the series discuss. Pros Dry and convincing mechanics Satisfying like few others Excellent online multiplayer Cons Atmosphere that not everyone will like Long-winded and boring story Monochromatic color palette The Dark Conflict And it is no coincidence that the subtitle of this second Advance Wars for DS is Dark Conflict, and already from the intro it is immediately clear that something has changed; in fact, a meteorite hit the Earth wiping out billions of lives in an instant and leaving only a few survivors, committed to surviving in a sunless world amidst ruins, rubble and very little hope for the future. And in such a gray and catastrophic climate there are few positive characters, genuinely driven by the desire to do something to give way to a new beginning, surrounded by a large number of petty men, often moved by personal interests and greed, if not downright real bands of marauders determined to take possession of the few remaining resources. A rampant pessimism in which the protagonist of the game, a boy named Ed, tries to find a breach together with Captain O'Brian and a small team of men committed to finding and rescuing any survivors. Obviously the development of the plot then goes through numerous variations and twists, but the foundations of the setting of this Nintendo production are and remain very, very different from what was previously seen within the series. A choice certainly destined to divide users and give rise to different preferences, but which undoubtedly has tive a little of the charisma and originality of Advance Wars now uniting the product to the many titles based on this type of atmosphere. Having said that, however, it must be clarified immediately that the foundations of the gameplay of Intelligent Systems' fatigue have fortunately been touched very little by this breath of novelty decided by the team. For those who have never heard of this series, it is enough to know that it is one of the best exponents of the turn-based strategy genre available on consoles. In a nutshell, everything revolves around a fairly small game map, within which it is possible to move a whole series of units (infantry, tanks, planes, ships, etc.) on the basis of a grid subdivision. Each unit has different movement and attack capabilities, and at the same time its own characteristics make it particularly effective against a certain type of enemy and much less with others (the same goes for its vulnerability). In the end the foundation is that of the evergreen paper, rock, scissors, so to speak. But if the continuity in the gameplay that has made the series so loved is guaranteed, that does not mean that there are no new features", "date": "2008-02-11", "grade": null}
