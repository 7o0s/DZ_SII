{"name": "La Recensione di Rocky Legends PS2/Xbox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-recensione-di-rocky-legends-ps2xbox.html", "text": "The italian stallion The new game produced by Ubisoft appears as a completion of the old title, therefore it will not be a complete novelty for those who have already had the pleasure of trying the prequel, but in any case there are all the reasons to view this new product. The main mode is the Career Mode in which we will take part in the climb to the world title by being able to impersonate one of the four protagonists, namely: Rocky Balboa, Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago. For each of them the story is different, for example by choosing Clubber Lang you will start from the prison in which he is imprisoned up to the challenge with Rocky for the title; starting, however, with Ivan Drago, as a member of the Soviet army, you will reach the topical challenge with Rocky which is the culmination of Rocky IV. After the first match played, the world ranking will be displayed and we will be able to choose our opponent in the next match. The player will start twenty-fifth and will be able to choose who to fight, knowing that in case of success he will be undermined from his position in the standings. In order not to make the climb too hasty, he can advance a maximum of three positions at a time. After each meeting you can train to enhance the physical characteristics of the athlete: speed, power, resistance and so on. The training itself consists in playing mini-games, well done and fun, ranging from the classic lifting to the bar, to jumping rope, from hitting the bag to the very nice ~catch the hen~ (an exercise which, as you will remember, Rocky himself did in one of his films). The matches will see the two boxers clash in ever more ~important~ rings, from the street we will in fact pass to the dilapidated gyms of the suburbs, up to the enormous buildings of the Madison Square Garden type. The fights are sufficiently well done, even if definitely not devoted to realism! The italian stallion The fights are sufficiently well done, even if decidedly not devoted to realism, and characterized above all by the player's ability to be able to launch coordinated combinations of blows and to effectively parry the rival's attacks. In this we are helped by the control system that assigns the shots to the four front buttons of the pad, each used for a different shot, and to the combinations of the same with the two back triggers that allow you to parry/exit the guard and use the 'uppercut. At first, the control system may seem a bit limited and not entirely immediate, but, after a few games, you will see your boxer respond perfectly to commands and unleash your competitive anger on the unfortunate opponent on duty. Some innovations have been introduced in this sequel which will certainly not make the title more devoted to realism, but will certainly make it more spectacular and capable of demonstrating the courage and anger of the contenders. The new features we are talking about are Super Punches, Fury Mode and the Audience Bar. Starting from the latter we can tell you that, in Rocky Legends, on the screen, in addition to the health indicator of your boxer, you will find another small bar that indicates the level of enthusiasm of the public towards you. The better the boxer fights, the easier it will be to bring new fans to your side, and once that gauge is filled, we'll be able to perform a highly devastating triple combo of moves. Super punches are simply an extra weapon in the hand of the fighter and the player will have to be skilled in calculating the right timing to use them since, requiring a longer preparation, they leave the boxer uncovered for a few moments. When the boxer goes into ~Fury~, and this only happens when he has less than 30% of the energy available or has already suffered several knockouts, he is able, for twenty seconds, to throw punches at double speed. In addition to the Career mode there are the classic ones of every fighting game that do not require particular explanations: the exhibition mode, the survival mode, the practice, the training and the elimination tournament. Adrianaaa! From a purely technical point of view, the Ubisoft title immediately makes a good impression, thanks to an excellent introduction that ~mixes~ clips from the films with parts of the game, with the soundtrack of the whole saga in the background. The cosmetics of the characters present is of a good standard, especially as regards the four protagonists. Unfortunately, we noticed some polygon interpenetration during the fights, but in principle everything works for the best during the fights and the graphics engine manages the frame rate without too much hassle. The effects that highlight the bruises that are created during matches are excellent, while, unfortunately, the animations of the boxersi are often woody and somewhat stiff. The scenarios are well recreated and there are more than twenty locations taken obviously from the films. Matches between two players are very entertaining and often close on the ~thread of wool~ or on points, through an improved counting system that considers the hits scored and the saves made. Unfortunately, however, the A.I. of the opponents, when playing in single mode, at times, although it has been refined compared to the prequel, it is predictable and can be circumvented with some rhythmic sequences of shots. To add even greater regret is the fact that both the Xbox version and the one planned for PlayStation 2 lack an online mode that would have guaranteed, in addition to more tenacious opponents, greater longevity. The soundtrack of the game follows, hand in hand, the characteristic music of Rocky's films and we were happy to be able to listen to them, a pity only for the lack of a must such as ~Eye of the tiger~; the effect is of total rapture, as if we were personally in the ring. Rocky Legends therefore turns out to be an improved game compared to the previous one, but these innovations could have been more marked and, for sure, with a few more precautions we would have had an excellent arcade fighting game. The positive aspects of the game are there, even if, probably, those who have already played the first title will not be encouraged to buy this sequel. Some gaps of a purely technical nature and the absolute lack of online support markedly affect our opinion, even if reluctantly, given our passion for the Stallonian saga and the qualities that in part emerge from this Ubi Soft title. Pro It's him! It's the Italian stallion! Very neat atmosphere Fun and purely arcade encounters Excellent soundtrack Against A.I. sometimes deficient Technically only fair Lack of online mode The two versions compared The title was developed for both the Microsoft console and the PlayStation 2 and in reality the two versions are almost identical. As usual in cross-platform titles, the Xbox counterpart is slightly more accurate, denoting better textures and a few more polygons. The lack of online mode in both does not tip the balance in favor of either version. To you the choice. How many of us have enjoyed and suffered in following the story of the brave boxer played by Sylvester Stallone? Many, we are sure, and we are also sure that many would like a further sequel, a chapter number 6, just for the joy of being able to see that ~mythical character~ again. Unfortunately we are not able to tell you if the expected chapter will take place or not, instead we write this article to tell you about the new game taken from the series. In 2002, unexpectedly, the first title based on the official license of the Rocky movies was released and, even more unexpectedly, that game managed to convince not only the avid fans of the saga but the users in general. About two years after its release, Ubisoft offers a sequel to that first successful experiment, baptizing it Rocky Legends.", "date": "2004-10-11", "grade": null}
