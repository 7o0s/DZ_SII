{"name": "Tomb Raider Anniversary", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-anniversary.html", "text": "Contrary to the visually sumptuous Tomb Raider Legend, the Eidos Mobile product is a two-dimensional action game that tries to shift the attention (for once) from the attractive forms of the protagonist towards the substance of the gameplay: the game consists of 15 levels inspired by the progenitor of the saga, released on PlayStation and Saturn back in 1995, obviously revisited in a 2D key. Although she has lost a dimension, Lara has certainly not forgotten all her skills, which she also shows off on her mobile phone screen: jumps, acrobatics and somersaults are therefore the order of the day, without forgetting the usual handful of firearms with which to wreak havoc on your opponents. The action basically develops within the classic canons of the series: the levels are therefore full of obstacles and enemies to be eliminated, with the addition of a few puzzles here and there (of the ~pull-the-lever-open- la-porta, nothing too elaborate) as a necessary side dish. But there is actually a macroscopic difference compared to Croft's previous adventures, and it is the level of difficulty, positioned by the developers on absurdly high peaks: a minimal misstep or a few blows too many is enough to make a very fragile Lara fall to the ground, with the result of having to repeat the stage from the beginning. It is not only the absence of checkpoints that enrages, but also the chronic shortage of medikits within the levels, not to mention the unfortunate choice to keep the protagonist's state of health unchanged from one stage to another: which opens the road to the concrete possibility of starting a new scenario simply with too little energy to be able to continue, forcing the repetition of the previous phases. Completely wrong choices, those just listed, which only lead to frustration and for which Finblade cannot be absolutely justified. Tomb Raider Anniversary, although overall well done, pays dearly for the sensational ingenuity of the developers, proving to be simply too difficult to be fun. The regret continues if we also consider the graphic qualities of the Eidos product: although it is not astonishing from a cosmetic point of view, the title can count on Lara's excellent animations, very fluid and varied, as well as on some truly remarkable special effects. But nothing can change the fact that Tomb Raider Anniversary is sadly not fun PRO Gameplay at its best Good animations AGAINST Difficulty level too high Frustrating design choices", "date": "2008-03-04", "grade": "S.V."}
