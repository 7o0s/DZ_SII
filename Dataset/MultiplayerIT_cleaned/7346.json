One of the most interesting things about the project, which these days has been confirmed to have been distributed in more than a million copies worldwide, was that of four DLCs with additional stories that tell a series of parallel storylines, connected to the main , through four characters. A good way to extend the life of a game, giving a good reason to buy the season pass. At least on paper. Operation Broken Eagle kicks off the additional episodes of Dead Rising 3 Adam Kane Without going into too much detail, so as not to spoil the surprise for those who have yet to play Dead Rising 3, in the story there are essentially three factions between the US president, an evil army general and, of course, the protagonist. In Operation Broken Eagle, the hero of the story is Adam Kane, commander of the army who obeys the orders of the second faction, who plots in the shadows fighting the soldiers who answer to the president and the survivors of the holocaust. The plot is open and it is clear that it will unfold through the four episodes to compose the overall picture. It must be said that writing a full-bodied review of this DLC is a rather demanding undertaking, given that it is finished in less than two hours. Considering that an article like this can be written in an hour and that it is ready for publication in the same time, it takes almost longer to write than to play this DLC. The contents are, in fact, a diminished replica of those of the base game: there are very few sub-missions (most of which consist in finding fellow soldiers transformed into zombies to kill them and recover their dog tags) all the same, and a handful of which lead to the end of the main story without any boss fights or psychopaths whatsoever. There is no cooperative and in those rare cases where there are surviving soldiers, these cannot be put to rest in the shelters which are no longer available due to the coherence of the setting, but it is necessary to take them with you unless you leave them at die. Another aspect is that the skill tree is at the same evolutionary point reached with the main game, so our Adam, provided you have played Dead Rising 3, is very strong and practically immortal from the beginning, making Operation Broken Eagle very easy to deal with. The graphic system is the same and so is the fun for what is a more of the same that those who played the original will certainly appreciate, just as we enjoyed playing it. It's just that it's too little for the price, at least as a single, to have a couple of hours of gameplay, some additional weapons (always crazy) and a vehicle, which at least, however, can be ~transported~ into the main game. The purchase of the DLC on its own and for 9.99 cannot be recommended, therefore, the door remains open for the season pass which, thanks to a fairer price, will be evaluated upon the publication of all four additional episodes .", "date": "2014-01-24", "grade": null}
