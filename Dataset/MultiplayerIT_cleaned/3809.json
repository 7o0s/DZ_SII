{"name": "Jump Force", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jump-force-recensione.html", "text": "It's not the first time that the manga universes published in the Japanese weekly Shonen Jump collide in the same video game: it all started in 2005 with Jump Super Stars and then Jump Ultimate Stars on Nintendo DS, but then a few years ago there was also J-Stars Victory VS for PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4. There is nothing extraordinary about Jump Force in this respect, so developer Spike Chunsoft and publisher Bandai Namco thought it well to celebrate the 50th birthday of the famous magazine with a ploy bordering on the crazy: they made the protagonists and the most famous manga villains collide in our world. A curious, risky and widely debated choice which, on balance, is perhaps also the most negligible one in the enormous mess that is this fighting game. The story: from comics to reality The story that justifies this mega crossover is decidedly specious, but considering the subject it could not have been otherwise: it would have been impossible to credibly motivate the meeting of so many different worlds and character designs, so the developer has chosen the lesser evil. Our planet has suddenly been invaded by a mysterious force that has spread the umbras cubes, strange artifacts that manage to take control of certain individuals, making them become violent and aggressive. This evil plan was hatched by a criminal mastermind hiding behind some of the most famous bad guys in manga: it is for this reason that the greatest heroes of all time founded the Jump Force, an ever-expanding army that fights to destroy the umbras cubes, neutralize their negative influence and defeat the evil ones who want to conquer the universe. At the beginning of the game we will have to create a character who will represent us in the Jump Force: after resisting the power of the umbras cube, we have managed to defeat the venoms - fighters possessed by this evil force - and we have attracted the attention of Goku, Naruto and the other heroes who lead the Jump Force. The editor allows a fair amount of freedom, while referring to hair, particular signs and other details that characterize the various characters taken from Jump. In any case, it's possible to unlock costumes, accessories and other objects that will allow us to change the look of our alter ego at any time, and collecting them is an important aspect of the game. Also from this point of view, Jump Force is very reminiscent of Dragon Ball Xenoverse: once we enter the base of operations, and after connecting to the network, we will find ourselves surrounded by the avatars of the other players, with whom we will be able to marginally socialize. The story, in fact, is divided into various chapters, marked in turn by key missions that can be accepted at the appropriate counters: initially we will have to recruit the various components of the Jump Force, and to do so we will have to defeat them while they are possessed by the umbras cubes, but then we will have to face the various enemies in the company of our pets. The campaign is quite long but tends to get repetitive quickly, rarely setting up interesting encounters. The fault obviously lies with the trivial script that brings together good guys and bad guys without particularly caring about their relationships: it is clear that Bandai Namco is addressing an audience of enthusiasts who will rejoice even just seeing Goku, Naruto and Luffy side by side, but not we would have been sorry for a more articulated plot and perhaps a greater number of quotations. A messy graphics If the story is not very engaging, it is also and above all the fault of the staging. The speech is quite complex, so be patient. It all starts with the realistic character design that Bandai Namco has imposed in the context of this transition from the manga dimension to the planet Earth in which we live. Thanks to the Unreal Engine 4, the protagonists of Dragon Ball, One Piece, Bleach and so on have taken on more realistic features, while maintaining their original appearance. Needless to say, this has caused a stylistic inconsistency that is a real eyesore, because the style of a mangaka like Eiichiro Oda is very different from that of, for example, Tsukasa Hojo, yet there they are, Monkey D. Luffy and Ryo Saeba, together in the same team. It is a mixture that becomes evident in the cinematics in which the characters interact with each other, but perhaps even more so in the numerous sequences in which our heroes stand dazedly arguing only through lines of text, without even moving their mouths, standing like stockfish next to each other. The fact is that the discrepancy in the character design of the various characters and their realistic appearance are the least problems of atitle that was developed hastily and with little affection for the source material. Graphically Jump Force is a game full of problems that Spike Chunsoft has tried to hide behind a riot of special effects, explosions and objectively very beautiful and spectacular particles. The polygonal models are awkward and awkward, often summarily animated, and even the dubbing leaves something to be desired considering that many scenes are not even spoken. In combat, in the deserted but detailed maps, the speed of the exchanges of blows, between explosions and sparks flying everywhere, prevents the less attentive eye from noticing the jerky animations and imprecise collisions: the screen is filled with effects graphics, flashes of light and electric shocks every time you punch, while excessive blur blurs the image. The scene is filmed by the camera behind the player: Jump Force is an arena brawler, a third-person fighting game that allows you to move freely around the battlefield, but which at the same time prevents you from calculating distances accurately and seeing the enemy when a chain of attacks is linked. The watchword is entertainment and, in this sense, Spike Chunsoft has done an excellent job. The most famous special attacks are extremely choreographed and carefully follow the original sources, whether they are paper or animated. Press keys at random As a brawler - a term that, quite subtly, differentiates the more technical fighting games from the more chaotic ones - Jump Force relies on a tested control system designed for a vast and savvy audience. Combos are performed by pressing a single key repeatedly, perhaps together in different directions. Another key lets you unleash a charged attack that breaks the opposing guard or ignores normal strikes. The other two buttons control the inevitable grab and jump. The backbones are certainly the most interesting keys, except for the parry which, pressed at the right time, allows us to move behind the opponent, interrupting his combos and starting one of our own. The other backbone makes us approach the enemy with a shot, but consumes an indicator that recharges over time and which, in this way, prevents us from abusing the lightning movements. The same key, pressed with a certain timing, allows us to escape a combo and move away. The last two ridges have a more strategic importance. One controls the tag team: Jump Force is fought in teams of three against three, even though each character shares the same life gauge with the others. The back button allows you to call an ally to attack and disappear, or replace the fighter we are controlling. The other back button, pressed together with the front buttons of the pad, allows you to use up to four different techniques: three of them consume one or more indicators that we can reload by hitting the enemy or by holding down the back in question, while the last technique , the most powerful and spectacular one, consumes the Awakening indicator around the portrait of the character we are controlling. The Awakening is perhaps the most interesting and studied mechanics of Jump Force: once the gauge is filled to 50%, the player can already use his deadly technique or temporarily transform into a more powerful version of himself; if you then wait for the indicator to reach 100%, you can access an even more lasting boost, too bad that the Awakening loads by taking the blows, so it becomes a double-edged sword. In reality, however, none of these mechanics has a decisive influence on combat, because in the chaos of battle, in the confusing succession of particle effects, it is difficult to understand when is the right time to interrupt a combo, and it is often practically impossible to determine distances among fighters: it's a pity that most of the special techniques are linked to a hold, a projection or a charge that triggers the animation of the attack, so that you find yourself sprinting uselessly towards the enemy who then turns out to be too distant or even too low to be hit by the opening shot of a taller character. The imprecision of the collisions further complicates life when you want to finish a combo with a special technique or attack the target while it is falling to the ground. It's a sloppy and imprecise combat system that relies only on visual spectacularity and even manages to lose frames when the situation gets too chaotic. Playstation 4 trophies There are 36 bronze, 11 silver and 2 gold trophies to unlock to get your hands on theplatinum: among other things you will have to finish the campaign, complete each mission and increase the level of the avatar and the other characters as much as possible. Other content Despite everything, as a brawler designed especially for fans, Jump Force strives to offer a quantity of content that promises a certain longevity. The roster is made up of about forty characters who, while not differing much, guarantee a certain variety net of an almost non-existent balance. As we have said, the aim of the game, once the campaign is completed, is all about collecting the various cosmetic elements, but there is also a rather bland role-playing component, linked to the growth of our avatar, which increases in level and earns money and materials which he can then spend to enhance learned techniques or his battle stats. Jump Force is clearly inspired by Dragon Ball Xenoverse also from this point of view, while offering a smaller amount of challenges and objectives. The player can engage in the various optional missions to learn new techniques, unlock exclusive clothing and earn experience points and gold coins, but can also challenge the players around him, train in the training mode or test himself in increasingly difficult discounts . The netcode proved to be quite stable: we tested several games against other players and only occasionally suffered from an annoying lag. Of course, the idea of being able to build an alter ego who knows the most famous fighting techniques of the manga and who runs around with Goku's uniform, the greaves of the Sagittarius armor and Luffy's straw hat is fascinating, but it is equally true that a fan would hardly play as an anonymous avatar when he can directly control his favorites. Jump Force is a real nonsense from whichever side you look at it.", "date": "2019-02-15", "grade": "6.0"}
