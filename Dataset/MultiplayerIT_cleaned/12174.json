{"name": "Overlord - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/overlord-recensione.html", "text": "On a mission for the Overlord The first level serves as a tutorial, where our faithful right-hand man (a crooked goblin with an obsession for evil deeds) makes us familiar with the control system, explains some simple but fundamental notions and introduces the summary plot that is at the base of the game, which can be summed up in nine words: conquer everything and ruthlessly eliminate those who oppose it. The headquarters is a ruined tower, which in addition to serving as a home, also houses, among other things, an arena for duels and, above all, a teleporter to instantly reach certain areas of the kingdom. As the Overlord's power increases, the tower will be remodeled and will be filled with more and more evil minions. The Overlord, who as a figure closely resembles the physical incarnation of Sauron in ~The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~, naturally has both melee attacks and magic at his disposal, but the real strength of the game are the minions, i.e. the little monsters that accompany him on his death missions. These minions, whose maximum number increases or decreases according to certain circumstances, can be easily controlled with the mouse: with the left button they can be sent to an area or to a precise objective (several times the mouse button is pressed, more units are sent), with the right one recalled in the presence of their lord and with both together they can instead be controlled directly, directing them through the movement of the mouse itself towards the desired direction. minions have the interesting ability to be able to use practically any object they find as tools of offense or defense On a mission for the Overlord Unfortunately these controls are not always flawless, and occasionally they will make the player's soul damned. The minions have the interesting ability to be able to use practically any object they find as tools of offense and defense: a pumpkin can become a helmet, a piece of fence or the severed arm of a zombie, a blunt weapon, a piece of sheet metal a 'armor. Naturally this does not affect only on an aesthetic level (some combinations are very funny), but actually increases the attack and defense capabilities of the revolting little monsters. If one or more minions should die, you must make sure you have enough evil energy to summon them again from one of the appropriate points. This energy is obtained simply by killing enemies. By acquiring more experience, more powerful minions can be summoned: to the basic ones, which are naturally the most unlucky, others are added with rather interesting skills such as throwing fireballs, resurrecting dead companions and other not bad things. During the game, the minions will not only come in handy to win battles more easily, but also to overcome particular puzzles, such as obstacles scattered along the path or secret areas inaccessible to the Overlord. And let's not forget that as good succubi they can also be sacrificed to restore their master's energy. Dungeble Pikmer The game could be defined as a mix of elements taken from Fable, Pikmin and Dungeon Keeper. Let me be clear, Overlord in no case manages to reach the peaks of excellence that distinguish the best sides of these illustrious colleagues of his, and he also seems to lack class and charisma, but still manages to have a certain personality. In all this whirlwind of pure action there is therefore also room for a sprinkling of strategic elements, and this again thanks to the invaluable minions: the Overlord doesn't necessarily have to carry them all with him, on the contrary he can leave small groups of them in strategic points at the order to better face a battle or just make them stand guard. Instead, the freedom to explore the levels was penalized, which, given the beauty of the settings, would have been appreciated in greater doses. Overlord is an enjoyable and carefree game, which in the medium term also remains quite fun, but which as the levels go by could tire someone before reaching the end. As already mentioned above, the creation of Triumph Studios does not in any way want to immerse the player in an atmosphere of true wickedness, so much so that ~moral~ choices are also added to the light-hearted tones, somehow antithetical to the script itself game: in one point, for example, the adviser suggests to the Overlord to reflect (such as, for example, exterminating the enemies, but saving the lives of the innocent peasants). The choice of inserting a paper map in the game box without having any kind of reference on the screen is strange. The multiplayer is decent. graphic and sound The graphic sector of Overlord certainly makes the figure of him, both from the purely technical side and from the artistic one. The game boasts good textures, good polygonal models and equally good animations. With the test configuration the game was always fluid with all the details at maximum and at the resolution of 1920x1200, dropping below 25 frames per second only in a few circumstances. Artistically speaking, the first term of comparison that can come to mind to describe the style adopted by the developers is another game signed by that genius Peter Molyneux, namely Fable. The glimpses of forests, fields and villages have, like the title Lionhead or perhaps just less, the power to evoke real fairy-tale images to the mind, fruit of the imagination and suspended in time (to be strictly set on fire once contemplated enough) . As for the sound, the Italian dubbing is fun and fairly well done, while the music does its job very well.

Unfortunately, it is precisely the mechanics themselves that lack a little depth, which, combined with some small defects in the control system and a lack of bite in the plot, relegates this title to the ~good but not excellent~ games. Thinking about it is still a duty in our opinion. Pros Fun and rather immediate Good technical and artistic sector Cons Mechanics not deep enough Some defects in the control system Overlord is available for PC and Xbox 360. The PC version was used for this review. Both in literature and in cinema there are practically infinite examples where the public becomes more attached to negative characters, or at least it is they who often manage to remain most impressed in the collective imagination. Based on this concept, the developers of Triumph Studios, fresh from the success of Age of Wonders, have packaged an action game with some hints of RPG elements quite particular, which puts the player in the role of an evil creature brought back to life only purpose of sowing death and destruction among the peoples. But let's clarify one thing immediately, before anyone is disappointed: Overlord's register always remains on rather hilarious tones, at times even parodic, aimed more at entertaining and occasionally eliciting a laugh from the player than at making him identify with the evil being who impersonates.", "date": "2007-06-22", "grade": null}
