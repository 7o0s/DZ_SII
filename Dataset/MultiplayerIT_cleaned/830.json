{"name": "Recensione Far Cry Instincts - Xbox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-far-cry-instincts-xbox.html", "text": "Far Cry Back, in the role of the fearless protagonist, Jack Carver, former mercenary, reckless tour guide and above all the only human being willing to accompany a curious journalist in the fearsome Jacutan archipelago. As soon as they arrive at their destination, the two are attacked by someone not inclined to appreciate the curious and above all determined to eliminate them as soon as possible. Losing sight of the intrepid scientist during the introduction, now fully playable, we just have to hunt down the hostile helicopters and gain the shore in an attempt to save our skin and unravel the dangerous mystery that surrounds these islands. Running out of weapons we are forced to approach our adversaries silently, perhaps crawling on our stomachs to avoid any noise, and attack the sentries from behind. Far Cry's stealth mode, albeit without indicators, works fairly well, the guards are extremely sensitive to noise but take into account the intensity of the same allowing us to risk some rustling, especially when lying down and depriving ourselves of a good view of the area does not seem a tempting alternative. Once in possession of a sufficiently large arsenal we can give up stealth by drawing on pure manual skill or, in the case of multiple enemies, we can mix a silent play style with extremely rapid actions, perhaps by throwing a stone where we have hidden a trap and then making fire behind the victims. we can mix a silent style of play with extremely fast action Far Cry Obviously there is no shortage of more effective means to free the jungle from any possible threat and grenades and mines are certainly the masters, as well as vehicles which, in addition to representing a valid way to face long journeys, are excellent allies in outdoor combat. Proceeding through the game, when the structures, towers and above all the weapons aimed at us increase in number and power, the accurate use of the sniper rifle, combined with the incredible sight distance of Far Cry, becomes an indispensable weapon and above all extremely satisfying. Moving targets remain the main problem that every good shooter must be able to deal with and our Jack Carver, like any self-respecting human being but unlike his fellow protagonists of other video games, is able to hold his breath and get, for a few second, a state of absolute and decisive immobility in the most delicate moments. The Xbox pad proves once again to be second, at least when it comes to first person shooters, only to the mouse / keyboard combination. Bestial vigor The plot travels through the same themes of the PC episode, but the mutations, previously precluded to the protagonist, instead become the most powerful weapon at our disposal and this element, in addition to determining the title of the game, obviously represents the major innovation of Far Cry Instincts. Like Dr. Moreau's weird creatures we will have the human intellect combined with the incredible physical possibilities that evolution and chance have granted to animals. The jungle will then become our home and enemies prey to be hunted without mercy. Our animal evolution will bring us incredible strength and speed, the ability to regenerate wounds, and above all the ability to follow scent trails and see in the dark. The physical attack is clearly inspired by the energy sword of Halo 2, with the possibility, having reached a certain distance from the target, to perform a dash and a lightning attack capable of eliminating an opponent with a single blow. we will have the human intellect combined with the incredible physical possibilities that evolution and chance have granted to animals Bestial vigor The effect, in Far Cry Instincts, is still more spectacular with a lot of blur, acceleration and literal take-off of the hit target. From the point of view of the less evident powers, if night vision is nothing more than the alternative to the visual sensors already seen in other video games, instead the possibility of following the smell of a prey becomes an incredibly interesting possibility capable of increasing further the tactical side of the game. The splendor of the tropics The closing of the introduction, although suitable to describe the choice of Ubisoft Montreal, is not entirely correct. Why is easy to guess the moment Far Cry Instincts comes to life on the TV screen. Indeed, considering the XBox hardware, the engine derived from that of Crytek continues to amaze technically. This reissue comes incredibly close to the graphic rendering of the first Far Cry on the best performing PCs, alless with the same resolution, but the programmers have been forced to redesign and reduce the effective size of the maps by choosing obligatory routes and precluding the exploration of large stretches of the island. Furthermore, in rare cases, it is possible to notice objects not too far away appearing out of nowhere, but overall Far Cry Instinct is able to field an incredibly rich and realistic jungle, thirst-quenching water, explosions majestic and soft and believable animations and it is a graphically exceptional title capable of showing all the cards of the Microsoft console. Even the audio, including dubbing, is at the highest levels and allows you to appreciate the difference between a standard sampling and a sampling designed to give emphasis to vehicles, weapons and detonations. The inevitable multiplayer Obviously there is no shortage of Deathmatch and Capture The Flag, albeit called in different ways, but what makes Far Cry's multiplayer quite different from the competition is the real possibility of hiding almost anywhere and escaping, with a vehicle or on foot, from any situation that is too hot for our tastes. Fortunately, Instincts also has a peculiar mode that is hidden under the name of Predator. Considering the possibilities offered by mutations it is easy to understand what we are getting into. In this case, a dense jungle is an element capable of pumping tension and adrenaline up to making us literally jump out of our chair after a lightning attack that rained out of nowhere. Obviously the maps can be shared via Xbox live and played with anyone The inevitable multiplayer Spice is added to this recipe by the splendid editor which does without too many technicalities and allows us to place objects and shape the map instinctively and above all instantaneously as is the convenient preview able to show us any defects in our work . Obviously the maps, which we can literally fill with details and objects, can be shared via Xbox live and played with anyone. Comment More than a conversion, Far Cry Instincts is like a new title that does away with a drop of spectacularity to give us a new and even more comprehensive and articulated experience than the first episode in the PC version. The integration between plot and game, carried out to give us feral powers capable of radically changing the gaming experience, is proof that the guys from Ubisoft Montreal have not sat on the laurels of the original to take it to even higher levels. Despite the drastic reduction, in certain situations, of the breadth of the maps it is impossible not to appreciate the fidelity of the technical conversion capable of squeezing the Xbox down to the last drop. If you appreciate FPS and have an Xbox, Far Cry Instincts is a must buy and yet another demonstration that the gameplay of first person shooters is constantly evolving. Pros: Technically outstanding Enriched Far Cry gameplay Extremely well thought out from every point of view Intuitive and extremely rich editor Cons: Comes after Far Cry Exploration and maps significantly reduced A year and a half ago, while the world of video games was waiting for Half Life 2 and Doom 3, Crytek launched Far Cry surprising the market and above all surprising Valve and IDSoftware who could hardly foresee the arrival of such a fierce competitor. The main reason for this success lies behind the immediacy with which the merits of Far Cry leap to the eye from the first moments of the game, visually and perceptively striking any newly navigated gamer. Far Cry, beyond the game design, presented itself as a real demonstration of future fps, starting from the incredible visual distance integrated with good physics, which let us glimpse the now imminent possibility of move in vast and believable worlds. Unfortunately, from the moment the initial impact fails, Far Cry becomes a slave to the common mechanics of each FPS and the visual distance, when crossing only jungles, loses strength. However, the excellent construction of weapons and vehicles and the credibility of the movements and tactics of the enemies remain, which is enough to make it an excellent FPS but leaves an aftertaste that is not excellent. Having to resize its creature to adapt it to the XBox hardware, and offering the same graphics engine to the user, Ubisoft Montreal appropriated the Crytek Studios creature and decided to transform the game into a completely different experience capable of balancing the 'impossibility of a spectacular second impact.", "date": "2005-09-30", "grade": null}
