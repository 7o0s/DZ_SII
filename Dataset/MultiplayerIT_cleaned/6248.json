However, the 90s have passed, the series has long been struggling to find itself and the 2008 reboot, having its merits, has unfortunately not left its mark. Atari has therefore decided to try again, entrusting an almost rookie development team with the difficult task of using that brand to make a cooperative-based third person shooter that many have mistakenly compared to Left 4 Dead. In reality, the mechanisms and structure of Alone in the Dark: Illumination recall those of Nazi Zombie Army, which is also a horror-style cooperative TPS (which we reviewed a few weeks ago, on the occasion of the release of the Trilogy), with the difference of the four characters and their skills, to be developed within three mini-campaigns. An interesting concept all in all, so let's see how it went. Alone in the Dark: Illumination starts with an interesting idea, but executes it poorly Look, not even the halo remains! Announced just under a year ago during PAX East, Alone in the Dark: Illumination has been the protagonist of a mysterious and troubled development, since its release was originally scheduled for autumn 2014. The authors have fielded a phase alpha and then a beta reserved for users who had pre-ordered on Steam, but once we got our hands on the game we wondered what this finishing period was for, given that this concept appears quite distant from the reality of the finished product. As mentioned at the beginning, the title offers three mini-campaigns, each consisting of four stages and freely playable, provided you have completed the previous one (again just like in Nazi Zombie Army). You can tackle the adventure alone or together with three other people, but during our tests we found the servers constantly deserted, and even the attempt to create a game from scratch has unfortunately borne little fruit. Not at all discouraged, we decided to proceed alone (we're still talking about Alone in the Dark, after all...) and to test the peculiarities of the four selectable characters, as well as the mechanisms that regulate the gameplay. Illumination is a third person shooter, and we've already said this, but don't expect a frenetic approach and thousands of zombies coming out of the ~fucking walls~, because the situations that the game proposes instead have a strategic value, with hordes of enemies which start at certain times and which must be defended by firstly turning on any light nearby (um, does anyone remember Alan Wake?), secondly by opening fire with the equipped weapon and/or using special abilities. The fanatics four We then get to know the merry gang, made up of characters who in theory have to do with the original series of Alone in the Dark (or in any case its reboot), as direct descendants of the various Edward Carnbys (the Hunter) and Emily Hartwood (the Witch), or completely new figures such as the Priest and the Engineer. Each class has a starting weapon, a possible secondary weapon and special abilities that can be unlocked by gaining experience and spending the points obtained to purchase upgrades from a special menu. By default the Hunter can open fire with an assault rifle or a flamethrower, the Witch can fire a pistol or throw lightning bolts from her hands, the Engineer can use a pistol or a powerful sawn-off shotgun, while finally the Priest wields a pair of fast automatic pistols, which he can ~charge~ with spirit energy to burn enemies. The creatures that come out of the shadows to attack us and which, thanks to their numerical superiority, often manage to catch us from behind, are particularly resistant to conventional attacks, which is why we must hit them when they are exposed to light. During the levels, however, it will not only be necessary to defend oneself from these hordes, but also and above all to activate switches, open doors, find objects and identify the right path to follow to reach the end of the scenario. To support our action we will find around ammunition, medical kits and refills for special powers. I light up immensely The basic idea of Alone in the Dark: Illumination has very little to do with the series created by Infogrames, that is clear, and the concept of putting the descendants of the original protagonists in a cooperative third person shooter context fIt will certainly turn up the nose of nostalgics, as well as those who still believe that the brand can be exploited in a dignified way, remaining on the tracks of the genre to which the very first Alone in the Dark gave birth in 1992. That said, it must be admitted that structurally the vision of Pure FPS is not bad: you go around the levels, possibly in four, you watch each other's backs with respect to the attack of these monsters that you have to ~illuminate~ (ta- dah!) in order to kill, you activate switches and carry around objects; and then there is the question of the characters, well differentiated (albeit characterized by an anonymous design), each with its own why and with a skill tree to be developed from game to game. The big problem is that the game still seems stuck in the alpha phase: it's just an angular draft, full of glitches and design problems, which can only be enjoyed by closing not one but both eyes and standing there, really, alone into the dark. Among the technical specifications of Illumination, the use of the powerful Unreal Engine 4 stands out, but the graphics of the game are mediocre in terms of detail and effects, there are many interpenetrations and bugs of ~slipping~ or disappearance of enemies, the polygonal count is modest and the end result is mediocre. Even the localization in Italian limps, while the support for the controller is to say the least lacking and you have to manually assign the commands to the various keys in order to obtain something vaguely usable. In short, we are faced with yet another wasted opportunity to do something sensible with a historical license, which it would be a real shame to make disappear.", "date": "2015-06-24", "grade": "4.0"}
