{"name": "Super Mah Jong Quest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-mah-jong-quest.html", "text": "Time is our bitter enemy and as it flows inexorably we will have to correctly match the pairs of tiles on the chessboard. However, there are some basic rules to follow, in fact the pawns are arranged so as to cover each other and to be able to combine those of the lower levels we will first have to eliminate the ones above. We will not be able to match the pieces only on the basis of their similarity but the tiles must have the right and left sides free. Some pawns follow a common theme and can be matched even if they are not identical, for example there are tiles representing the seasons that can be undone without a perfect match, in other words we can match summer to winter, autumn or in the spring. The I-play game offers two distinct types of game, the first is a very normal arcade mode in which we will face a dozen schemes structured in very different ways as we like. In the second, called Kwazi's Quest in which it will be our task to overcome, ~stimulated~ by a very banal plot, various challenges with increasing difficulty levels. There are about thirty worlds and the ease of use makes it an ideal game for short games to chase away thoughts, as well as some variants such as the ~earthquake~ (which shakes all the pawns on the table by dividing or modifying the playing area ) always make it varied and exciting. The control system helps the player by proposing two aids: a cursor that varies in color based on whether or not it is possible to combine the selected card and the asterisk key which allows you to find a pair to cancel in an instant. Technically we certainly can't complain, the pieces are very defined, colorful and with attention to detail, certainly the small diagrams of the cell phones do not help by creating some more difficulties for the user. After a few games we can't deny that we wanted a slightly faster system for selecting pieces, compared to the classic, but slow keypad.
