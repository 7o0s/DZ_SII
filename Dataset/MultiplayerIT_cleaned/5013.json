Therefore, once we have purchased one of the first vehicles available, our objective in the game will be to try our hand at a large number of one-on-one races and try to win them both to multiply our nest egg, on the basis of even rather strong bets and risky, and to raise the indicator relating to reputation, to which the possibility of accessing the major leagues is linked. After a short tutorial, the title developed by ShortRound Games turns out to be an interesting hybrid that pushes above all on online multiplayer, thus allowing us to challenge other players in order to earn the money necessary to upgrade our car or even to buy another one. A progression with a lot of side dish, not exactly intuitive at first and seasoned with the traditional mechanisms of freemium productions: a bar with ten ~notches~ which represents the races we can face before waiting for the energy to recharge, the pieces to collect to facilitate the upgrades and the inevitable precious currency, given in very limited quantities, which allows you to advance faster as long as you spend real money with the inevitable packages. Rival Gears Racing is a futuristic drag racer with some interesting twists on the theme On the track! After talking about the structure of Rival Gears Racing, let's see how exactly the game works. The system developed by the developers draws on the one hand from the drag racer genre, on the other from that of the endless runner: our vehicle must first of all score a perfect start to get the initial cue necessary to create some ' distance with the direct opponent, then change between five lanes (using two icons on the sides of the touch screen) to avoid traffic, which is signaled by the lighting of the four arrows by the vehicle we are about to crash into. If the car is boosted enough and no accidents are made, victory is within reach; otherwise, you end up losing any amount committed to the bet and you are forced to start over. It is a very simple formula, which also includes the possibility of committing improprieties (such as, for example, hitting the opponent so that he suffers an impact that causes him to lose a few moments), but which proves to be decidedly repetitive after a few races, highlighting at the same time the limits of an approach that aims a little too much at monetization and invariably forces grind. As far as the technical sector is concerned, nothing to say: the in-game graphics are excellent, although not very fast, but there are some elements of the interface that leave something to be desired.", "date": "2017-03-08", "grade": "7.0"}
