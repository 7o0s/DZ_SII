{"name": "NHL 07 - recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-07-recensione.html", "text": "EA Style Electronic Arts games are never stingy with game modes and various features, and already in previous editions a player had everything he could wish for. Despite this, compared to NHL 06 we find some further small additions. The Czech championship has been added to the long list of European leagues in which it is possible to participate, the possibility of playing the ~Dynasty~ mode has been added by holding a team from the old continent. The ~Dinasty~ mode, in fact, is the fulcrum of the game, and has remained practically unchanged since the 2005 edition. The only small changes concern the management of the owner's trust towards the manager, who now pay in ~upgrade points~ rather than cash. The owners are always a bit volcanic (let's even say hysterical) and the seasonal goals they impose on us are often out of reach for the team. For the rest, we find the usual quick games, tournaments, online games and so on, which can satisfy any user. Puck on the rocks The game mechanics essentially follow the already hyper-tested ones that we were able to appreciate in the 06 version, which balance a fair dose of realism (perhaps however, making the necessary proportions, less than the editions of the late 90s) with a model of fast and fun game, without unnecessary frills. The only real change of weight in playability is given by the high-sounding ~skill stick revolution~, which is none other than what has already been present for years on the Pro Evolution Soccer / Winning Eleven series: the mapping of the passes on the right analog stick . By moving the right stick with the right force and in the desired direction, the player will produce a rather precise pass. This system also allows you to throw the puck towards uncovered areas, effectively acting as a sort of ~through ball~ (the famous triangle button of Winning Eleven). In short, not a revolution, but certainly a welcome and necessary evolution of the passage system, which however can be used by PC users only if they have a joypad with analog sticks (with the keyboard it is clearly impossible to use this feature). the game mechanics essentially follow the already hyper-tested ones that we were able to appreciate in version 06 Puck on the rocks In the ice rink the pace of play is always high, perhaps far from the unrealistic speed of some previous editions but still suitable for reproducing what is considered ~the fastest game on earth~. To tip the balance on the side of realism it was also decided to resize the ~one timer~ shots (previously), which while in the reality of the NHL are quite rare and usually produce poor results, in the past edition of the game EA represented a real unconventional weapon, being extremely precise and powerful. Speaking more generally we can say that the entire shooting system has been slightly improved, reaching an almost optimal compromise between realism, practicality and resulting fun. Remaining on the subject, a welcome return is that of the aiming system for shots, which consists in displaying the symbol of a target in the part of the goal you are aiming for, for a total of nine different directions. This system facilitates the shooting phase by allowing you to see on the screen if the direction we are aiming at will actually be the one where the puck will be shot, but it could make some purists who love maximum realism turn up their noses, so it can also be deactivated by the options. The longevity of NHL 07 is more than generous as usual, not to mention the robust online mode that allows multiplayer games between players from all over the world. HHL 07 is available for PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360. The version used for this review is the PlayStation 2 version. Graphics and sound The sensation of already seen certainly does not stop when you go to evaluate graphics and sound, on the contrary it is amplified and made more evident. The graphics engine is practically the same seen last year, and demonstrates how the efforts of many software houses are aimed at the near future rather than the present. The models still manage not to disfigure, although they cannot count on a quantity of polygons aligned with the latest best productions (especially for the PC). The animations are more than good, and make the most of the harmony of the movements on the ice and the violence of the clashes. The arenas uncover the side a little and feel a little the weight of a lack of technological renewal, but in the end they too are more than discreet. The chants that can be heard in real American arenas (sporadic,imitated and not very imaginative if compared to those heard on football fields) have been reproduced in a more than discreet way, as well as the usual accordion music that entertains the public when the game is stopped. Good play-by-play commentary and EA-Trax class as always. The game, as usual, is completely in English with a manual in Italian. Final comment Electronic Arts has once again rested on its laurels, recycling what it already did last year and demonstrating that its efforts are directed towards the future. However, this is not enough to make this NHL 07 a game to advise against, on the contrary it is a mature product, with few novelties but solid, fun and technically discreet. A must for all fans of this sport too often underestimated in our country.Pros Good playability Numerous modes and leagues Cons Too similar to the latest editions Technically not amazing For almost ten years the hockey games produced by Electronic Arts have been unquestionably the best on the square, both for an effective quality of the work done by the programmers and for the lack of consistent competition. With the beginning of the 2000s, however, things got worse: the competition got underway with rather valid titles (Sega in particular), and the decidedly too arcadey imprint given to the NHLs of that period made people turn up their noses. much more than a few fans of the series. Fortunately, with the most recent editions the shot has been corrected, and although (in the due proportions) NHL has not fully returned to the glories of the past, the needle of the balance has returned to lean in the right direction.", "date": "2006-11-15", "grade": null}
