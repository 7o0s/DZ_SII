Without going too far back, just remember Wii Sports on Wii (even if it was bundled the result was the same), Luigi's Mansion on Gamecube, Super Mario 64 on Nintendo 64 and on DS; in the case of the 3DS, on the other hand, the choice, obviously wanted and aware, was to leave room for third parties, thus favoring greater support from the latter right from the beginning of the new laptop's life. While all in all understandable, if not farsighted and intelligent, this decision deprived the handheld of a great product capable of defining its peculiar personality and qualities, thus reducing the appeal of a line-up practically entirely made up of reissues or conversions of products already seen on other platforms. And the best 3DS launch title is therefore just that: an adaptation of an already released game, in original or ~Super~ version, on Xbox 360, Ps3, PC and iPhone. We are obviously talking about Street Fighter IV. I'll break your face If the idea that the best title for the new handheld isn't an exclusive game or a Nintendo product doesn't bother you in the slightest, so much the better; because Super Street Fighter IV 3D is also on 3DS an exceptional fighting game, considered by many to be the best exponent of a genre that the Capcom series has shaped and evolved over the years. Among the qualities of this version, the one that stands out the most is undoubtedly the remarkable fidelity with the original on the arcade or home console, starting from the contents; in this sense, the Japanese programmers have chosen to accept very few compromises, unlike for example what was seen with the previous reduction on the iPhone. Here however, to begin with, there are all 35 characters with the complete set of moves and costumes together with all the stages, so as to guarantee both experts and novices a variety and depth that has few equals. Let me be clear, those who have perfected their technique in Super Street Fighter IV with dozens of hours holding a joystick cannot think of finding a comparable control system on 3DS; although the d-pad and even the circle pad guarantee decent precision overall, it is the arrangement and shape of the keys that causes more than a few problems in carrying out the more complex moves, above all because of the small and not very comfortable (in this context) back keys associated with kick and hard punch. Even by undertaking to adapt and reconfigure the arrangement of the buttons, or by relying on the help of the 4 virtual keys available on the touch screen, the problem can at most be mitigated but never disappear; aware of this, and also with the desire to expand the user target of a hardcore and very demanding product, Capcom has well thought of inserting an alternative mode called Lite, thanks to which the lower screen can be used to automatically activate the different special moves. An option that, although undoubtedly frowned upon by purists and players of the old guard, succeeds in making the producer Yoshinori Ono's fighting game more accessible. Not funny anymore though, or at least that's our view. As for the modes, in this respect Super Street Fighter IV 3D does not disappoint at all; for the single player there are the usual single matches, training and above all the arcade mode, with which to gain experience and beat the excellent artificial intelligence of the CPU at various difficulty levels and then move on to the rich multiplayer. The 3D effect The three-dimensional effect of Super Street Fighter IV 3D is actually, as can easily be understood, totally accessory; in fact, its application only serves to increase the sense of depth of the elements of the seabed, but it is something that adds very little to the overall experience. Indeed, by completely disabling the 3D function (in the game options, not just with the slider), you can enjoy a not at all advertised 60 FPS mode which for many could prove to be much more important than the third dimension. The street fighters Moving on to the multiplayer element, it can undoubtedly be said that Super Street Fighter IV 3D constitutes a sort of all-round example of the console's ability in this sense; sorry that the Capcom title is in fact the only game of thethe initial line-up complete and satisfactory in this important respect, but at the same time looking at the glass half full one can hope that in the future the next products for 3DS will follow the direction indicated by the Japanese company. We therefore start from the local multiplayer, even with a limited but very welcome download option to play with a single cartridge, then moving on to the valid online section; in the latter you can challenge users from all over the world in ranked matches so as to improve your statistics with victories. The ability to apply various filters to the search is welcome, so as to be able to possibly exclude those who use the Lite control mode. Lag generally ranges from great to more than acceptable, denoting Capcom's netcode prowess; it is obvious that exceptions related to poor connection quality of one of the participants can happen, but these are rather rare cases, at least in our experience. Obviously there is the possibility of challenging friends already present in the list of your console, while the communication possibilities are very limited, linked only to a set of pre-packaged phrases. On the other hand, the collection and collection section of the models is incredibly full-bodied and robust, on which the StreetPass mode is also based; in practice, by spending the virtual money collected by playing, it is possible to buy models of the characters through a sort of slot machine, a clear reference to the all-Japanese fashion of capsule distributors. These kind of statuettes, which depict the wrestlers in different poses and costumes, are then used to form a team that will automatically fight against 3DS users randomly encountered on the street. All this takes place on the basis of statistics and values to be increased and improved with the fights, in a kind of rose water RPG. Your collection can then also be increased with the help of friends who own the game, with whom you can exchange the models. A totally accessory mode, but made so well as to once again underline the commitment made by Capcom in this edition for the Nintendo portable. On the other hand, the Versus 3D option is less exciting, which allows you to face fights with an unprecedented, spectacular but almost unusable view behind your fighter's back. Finally, moving on to the technical component, Super Street Fighter IV 3D turns out to be an excellent conversion capable of restoring a large part of the splendid visual quality of the home console versions; in this sense, obviously the small size of the screen plays a role, but the cuts to details, effects and animations are far from dramatic, on the contrary. The only real point of detachment lies in the backdrops, made totally static and therefore deprived of all moving elements; an evidently obligatory choice, but which is a little sad in light of the fidelity of practically all the other elements of the game.", "date": "2011-03-31", "grade": "8.5"}
