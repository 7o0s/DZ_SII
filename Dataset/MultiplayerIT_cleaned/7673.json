This is probably why many famous development teams have also decided to look into this world, if only to see what it is like. In the specific case of Dropchord, it was the guys from Double Fine Productions who embarked on a new adventure, which however is not an adventure; and, let's face it right away, it's not even a rhythm game, as it would seem at first glance. No, the game is rather an arcade game (but we could also simply define it as a ~casual~ product) in which the musical component is predominant (see also the soundtrack for sale on iTunes) but serves as a mere accompaniment to the action. Action that is not based on rhythm, but on reflexes and precision, on eye-hand coordination or, better to say, eye-thumb. What Dropchord asks us to do, within two different modes (one based on traditional levels, the other endless), is in fact to place our thumbs on the touch screen of our iOS or Android device, so as to check an email line inside a circle, moving its ends in order to touch the yellow dots that appear within the area and, at the same time, avoiding the red dots and possible electric shocks. Sounds easy, right? Well, it's not. Dropchord is a real audiovisual experience, however spoiled by some practical limitations Intertwined thumbs The idea of Dropchord came to Double Fine at the same time as the debut of the interesting Leap controller, a PC device that reads the movement of our fingers in three dimensions and translates it into input. This version of the game is on sale on the Windows 8 store, and if you own the Leap it is in all respects a different experience than usual. The point was to want to bring it to mobile devices as well, taking advantage of its touch controls, with a significant limitation: our thumbs on the screen cannot roam freely and rotate as if nothing had happened, because they are attached to the rest of the hand. Let's imagine that Doctor Zero is a Dropchord champion, but a mere mortal at a certain point (indeed, right away) finds it hard to keep up with the ever faster rhythms of the experience, looking for a different finger position (two index fingers?) to solve the problem. If you find the right configuration, the Double Fine title turns out to be fun, with many interesting findings in terms of graphics and sound, both elements of great importance. The standard gameplay is even broken up by variations on the theme that are sometimes a little obscure, but which perform their job well of shuffling the cards on the table while waiting for the next level. Accidentally coming into contact with the aforementioned red dots implies not only the loss of the score multiplier, but also damage that is reflected on our energy bar, once it is depleted, the game over will arrive inexorably. There is room for maneuver to go far, at a certain point memory also comes into play (the patterns do not change from game to game, like in a shoot'em-up) and therefore the final result is far from bad, albeit less innovative and valid than one might expect from the authors of Psychonauts and The Cave.", "date": "2013-08-14", "grade": "7.0"}
