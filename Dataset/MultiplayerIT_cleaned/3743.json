{"name": "Final Fantasy VII per Nintendo Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-vii-nintendo-switch-recensione.html", "text": "There was a time when Square Enix, when it was still called Squaresoft or Square and nothing else, developed practically only for Nintendo consoles. It was the early 90s and the success of titles like Final Fantasy had reinforced a close bond between the two companies, a bond consolidated by Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, even Super Mario RPG. But then something called CD happened. At the time, Nintendo was working on a prototype CD player with Sony but, at one point, realizing that it would have to cede control over its own licenses to another company, Nintendo dissolved the deal. While the big N was looking in vain for a new ally in Philips, to then launch the cartridge-based Nintendo 64, Sony continued on its way with the CD-based PlayStation. And so it came to 1997 and Final Fantasy VII. Square originally wanted to develop it for the Nintendo 64, but the cartridges cost more and more and the prototypes of the Nintendo console simply couldn't handle even the demo of the game. Square wanted to evolve and PlayStation seemed to be the only console to allow it. The decision to move the project to the Sony console, however, cracked the relationship between Square and Nintendo for years: in this sense, the release of Final Fantasy VII on Switch has a more important nostalgic value than usual also because, at the time, it was one of the titles to sell PlayStation in Japan and to transform Sony into a giant of the gaming market. Today the panorama is very different compared to those years and Square has returned to developing for Nintendo consoles for several generations, however this is the first time that Final Fantasy VII has been released on a machine of the great N. Aged with style We started this review with a school lesson just thinking of those who don't know the history of Final Fantasy VII well and have never played it: the new generations, perhaps, but there are also those who don't buy consoles other than the Nintendo ones. The title Square, in this sense, becomes unmissable despite some ailments due to age that can be easily overcome with a little patience and a glimmer of foresight. The plot is still gripping, especially thanks to the cast and a dark undertone that gives the story an adult flavor: everything revolves around Cloud, a former SOLDIER who joins the gang of a childhood friend to overthrow Shinra, a megacorporation who is draining the planet's energy to get rich. Within a few hours, however, the story becomes more complicated when one of the villains who have marked the history of the medium enters the scene: Sephiroth. At that point, Cloud and his companions will have to travel far and wide to prevent the end of the world. The adventure is very long and touches all the strings that traditionally characterize the genre of Japanese role-playing games, also because Final Fantasy VII created many clichs. The characterization of the characters is sublime, probably one of the highest peaks reached by Square, even in the face of a plot that occasionally tends to twist on itself but which still maintains a sustained and constant pace until the end, gracing the players with a soundtrack, signed by master Nobuo Uematsu, which still gives chills today and remains among the most exciting ever heard. In terms of extra content, then, Final Fantasy VII still remains one of the most complete, long-lived and full of secrets to strip, including optional characters, hidden summons and mini-games in profusion. However, there is some angularity due to age, starting with the combat system which today might seem a bit simplistic. The clashes are random and take place in turns, with the characters acting each time a specific gauge is charged. The player can deploy a party of up to three characters and attack, use spells, items or other skills that can be selected via a simple window menu. The characters do not have specific roles and the player can customize their skills, so to speak, by embedding the Materia in their weapons: these magical spheres unlock spells, summons and bonuses of various kinds, altering the statistics of our heroes and earning experience points as They. It is a rather simple system that guarantees a good variety and a fair amount of freedom of choice, allowing the player to face the fights in the way he prefers and to reconfigure the party if necessary. The Switch version The version proposed on the Nintendo store for Switch is the same that we have seen over the years on recent mobile systems, PCs and PlayStation consoles, but in this case it is the dual nature of the console that confersrle a small but important advantage. The quality of the conversion is all in all decent: Square has increased the resolution of the polygonal models, which now appear much more defined, despite being composed of a handful of polygons when wandering around and not fighting enemies. In general, the most annoying problem concerns the pre-rendered backdrops: Square has kept the original resolution, so the large panels return a grainy and pixelated image that doesn't do justice to the splendid work of the Japanese graphics. The difference between the resolution of the polygonal models and the pre-rendered backdrops also causes a stylistic ~detachment~ that marginally affects the gameplay, because sometimes it is difficult to understand which elements of the backdrop it is possible to interact with or which details are actually gates, entrances or exits. This problem is somehow alleviated by playing in portable mode: the small size of the screen allows you to better distinguish every detail. The image consequently appears sharper, even if framed by the notorious black bands that preserve the original aspect ratio. It is clear that you have to deal with a necessarily dated technical aspect, but which finds the perfect balance between a cartoony character design and a more realistic and science-fiction representation of the world in which the adventure takes place. The conversion of Final Fantasy VII for Switch also inherits the options introduced starting from the mobile version that allow you to customize the experience and make it more accessible to those who don't want to face hundreds of random fights to get to the end of the story. Most of the options in question find space in the appropriate screen, but others have been associated with the analog sticks or back buttons to allow activation or deactivation on the fly. You can then disable or restore random combat, increase gameplay speed up to three times, and so on. Compared to the conversion of Final Fantasy IX released some time ago, Final Fantasy VII can boast much faster loading, but also some genuinely annoying bugs mostly because they have already been found in previous editions: we are referring above all to the piece of music that characterizes the world map and that starts over every time we finish a fight. Considering that the track in question is one of the most iconic and that it lasts about six minutes, it's really a shame that a corrective patch is not yet available.", "date": "2019-04-01", "grade": "8.0"}
