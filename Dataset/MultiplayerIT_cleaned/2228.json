{"name": "Jeremy McGrath Supercross World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jeremy-mcgrath-supercross-world.html", "text": "A lot of quantity but the quality? Opening the package that hid the coveted game, I immediately notice a small detail that makes me suspicious. The developers of the game are no longer the Z-Axis, which made themselves appreciated for the realization of the Dave Mirra saga, but an internal team of Acclaim that responds to the name of Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City, which had made itself known for productions sports not exactly excellent. After this little moment of bewilderment, I inserted the CD into Play2 and here I am at the main title screen. Apparently the game modes seem many and varied. We will be able to try our hand at racing in the Paris-Dakar in a mode called Baja Racing, or perform spectacular tricks aboard our racing cars in Freestyle Mode or more simply run indoors (Indoor Racing) or outdoors (Outdoor Racing) . But the two modes in which we will be able to compete more than twice in a row will be the Single Event Mode and the Career Mode. Like any self-respecting (good?) racing, here too we will have the possibility to select the bike on which to ride and the rider to command. I point out that we will be able to ride motorcycles of different engine capacities (125, 250 and 500), faithful reproductions of the real counterparts, each characterized by four parameters (maximum speed, suspension, traction and engine capacity). After selecting the track, we are finally ready to hit the track! The list of defects! Going down the track you begin to realize how many defects afflict this production. The first thing that catches the eye is the strict non-compliance with the laws of physics. You will be able to see your pilot suspended in the air, with his head turned downwards for long seconds, so much so as to give a hard time to the spectacular overturns of Holly and Benji which led the two boys to vibrate in the air for minutes and minutes. Equally surreal is the Artificial Intelligence of the CPU-driven pilots. Not infrequently you will see yourself crushed by the wheels of your rivals, who always follow, and I mean always, the same path whether there are obstacles in front of them or whether they have a clear road. The shopping list doesn't end there. As I told you, we will be able to select different motorcycles, each with its own peculiarities and engine capacity, but during the game there are no differences between riding a 125 and a 500. Their responses to the commands are identical, the sensation of speed is identical as much that that initial option seems to be a mere graphic accessory. Graphically speaking! If the gameplay is of modest thickness, the graphics and sound sector certainly does not fare better. Having played the N64 version, I can safely say that there has been little progress. The rendering of the circuits is stingy with details, with textures of mediocre workmanship, which slightly increase their quality by passing on to the drivers and their vehicles, which at least try to reproduce those details typical of the real counterparts. Occasionally pop-up effects are encountered, while the frame-rate is well below competing titles such as, for example, MX Starring Ricky Carmichael. On the sound, some positive notes come from the rock songs that make up the soundtrack, which proves to be catchy and never unpleasant. Among the groups that we will be able to listen to in the game we find: The Supersuckers, The Hellacopters, Drowning Pool, Millencolin, Sevendust, Mudhoney, Lunatic Calm, Stuck Mojo, Vision of Disorder, Fenix TX and two songs by Dry Kill Logic 1. Keep out of the way for a radius of 10 km This Jeremy McGrath Supercross World could become the perfect example for budding developers of how not to develop a game. As often happens, the initial impression I had upon opening the package was confirmed by the hours of testing the game, we are faced with a poor quality product that I strongly advise against.Pros: we forwarded the report to ~Chi l'ha visto~ Cons: graphics, gameplay, appeal .... From the Playstation with horror! Acclaim is certainly one of the oldest software houses on the gaming market, author of hundreds and hundreds of titles of all genres and for each console. I remember when a Playstation title called Jeremy McGrath Supercross '98: McGrath vs. first came out in 1998. Pastrana. This game was quite successful at the time, thanks to the sponsorship of the two greatest drivers in the S championshipupercross and thanks to the good work done by the Z-Axis guys. After about two years this title was revived on Nintendo 64, but without leaving obvious traces on gamers. But as our professors have taught us, history is made up of courses and appeals and, obviously, Acclaim could not fail to serve us his racing game on the golden plate of the PS2.", "date": "2002-02-27", "grade": null}
