{"name": "Returnal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/returnal-recensione-pc.html", "text": "What happens when you take a talented but independent development team and give them the resources to create something great? The answer to this question is precisely Returnal. Released on PS5 in 2021, Housemarque's spectacular and challenging roguelike shooter still stands today as one of the most interesting new generation PlayStation exclusives, but things could have gone differently. The Finnish studio, author of excellent shooters up to that moment such as Resogun, Alienation and Nex Machina, had in fact come to have to announce the abandonment of that videogame genre due to the poor results obtained. So Sony's intervention was the most classic of sliding doors; but talent and courage were not lacking in Harry Krueger and his colleagues, who took the opportunity to prove their worth, so much so that they later earned entry into PlayStation Studios. In short, it is a story made up of opportunity and commitment, experience and a pinch of luck, the one that took place behind the scenes of this ambitious project, which after almost a couple of years is also ready to lead the owners of the platform Windows in a fascinating but lethal journey to the planet Atropos and the mysteries of the human mind: we tell you about it in the review of Returnal for PC. Story: the eternal return Returnal, the protagonist Selene had a bad day The story of Returnal is that of Selene Vassos, an astronaut who explores the universe for the ASTRA Corporation, but is caught off guard as she chases an eerily familiar signal aboard her spacecraft, Helios, and ends up crashing on the planet Atropos . Unable to leave again, the woman soon realizes that there is something very strange about this place. It's not simply about the monstrous and lethal creatures that inhabit it, no: there is a sort of field that surrounds the planet, trapping those who found on its surface in a time loop that ~rewinds~ each time the visitor dies. Is there a way to escape? Selene isn't sure, but giving up isn't an option: gun in hand, the astronaut decides to find out the truth about Atropos and that signal in the only apparently possible way, that is by fighting. The narrative sector of Returnal, mysterious and suggestive, in some ways emerging, reveals new details about the protagonist and her epic as we manage to push further into the campaign, telling them through audio files left by Selene herself in a previous attempt gone wrong ( a theme, uh, recurring in the title Housemarque) or in the context of dream sequences that are very similar to hallucinations. However, waking up from this nightmare seems impossible: whether the protagonist keeps her eyes open or not, the planet around her changes and evolves, messing up the arrangements of its different settings in an attempt to take us by surprise but also allowing us time to observe this strange world, its terrible pitfalls and the tense and heavy atmosphere that accompanies us at every step. Structure: thoroughbred roguelike Returnal, our character to the starting point, the crash of the Helios The structure of Returnal draws on the roguelike vein in a convinced way, while presenting certain elements that it is possible to keep between one attempt and another, and which therefore bring the game of Housemarque more precisely into the orbit of roguelite productions: a fundamental aspect for give the progression a complete sense and derive the right satisfaction from it. Every time you die you have to start over, it is true, but specific skills, upgrades and objects remain at our disposal, in addition to the possibility of using the teleporter to quickly reach the areas that we have already explored, therefore without the need to break down the difficult bosses that initially blocked access. Returnal and its suggestive glimpses, those that escape the rules of the procedural system As in any roguelike, the element of luck is present and sometimes preponderant: depending on the weapons and upgrades that we find during a game, this can be more or less complex regardless of our personal ability to deal with threats and eliminate so many enemies that will be sent against us losing the minimum possible amount of integrity of the suit, i.e. our vital energy. There is also an extra factor represented by experience and familiarity with what happens around Selene: before being able to arrive at the end of this journey, we will have to have the patience to set aside dozens and dozens of failed attempts, which however will prove useful even if only to teach us something about Atropos.PC version of Returnal also immediately includes the possibility of suspending a cycle to resume it later, which was missing at the launch on PS5 and which makes the experience a little less cruel than the debut, as well as the Tower of Sisyphus and the cooperative mode, which however supports crossplay only between Steam and Epic Games Store users. Gameplay: fear and loathing Returnal, dark and light merge during fights The gameplay of Returnal is absolute frenzy: an extraordinarily dynamic third person shooter system, which catapults us into increasingly difficult arenas, surrounded by enemies who will try to eliminate us in every way and will certainly succeed in their intent if we remain still , interpreting the game's shoot 'em up mechanics in a static way rather than using the bullet hell run & gun approach envisioned by the developers. it also uses the haptic feedback provided by the DualSense controller and the variable resistance of the triggers in a phenomenal way on PC, the latter linked in a fundamental way to gunplay given that the fire mode of the equipped weapon depends on the pressure of the left trigger. If you prefer the classic mouse and keyboard combo, however, you'll have no problem using it. Returnal, a cooperative boss fight As for weapons, we will find different guns along the way, equipped with different levels and appendages, and we will be able to specialize in their use to improve their statistics and therefore their effectiveness, in combination with an enormous amount of upgrades, parasites (yes) and consumables that will give us some kind of advantage, although almost always destined to disappear in case of defeat. The experience of Returnal, however, would be little without the hostile environment that characterizes it, made up of monstrous and lethal creatures that they will fail to target us with their projectiles, filling the screen with blue, red or green globes while we try to take advantage of the protagonist's jump, dash and possibly the Atropic Sword to dodge the attacks and sink ours, whether short or long distance. In this sense, the five bosses play a fundamental role, with their different phases and the intricate attack patterns to memorize. Technical realization and PC version Returnal, Selene opens fire on a swarm of drones On a technical level, Returnal marks a very clear change of pace for Housemarque, which, as mentioned, found itself dealing with a large-scale project for the first time and did not miss the target, to stay on topic. The atmospheres linked to the different settings, the clear references to the cosmic horror of a Lovecraftian matrix and the design of both the scenarios and the enemies are extremely convincing, as well as the enveloping sound system of the experience, which supports Dolby Atmos technology on PC. If you recall, the PS5 version of the game used some unusual solutions in terms of resolution and effects in order to maintain a mostly stable 60 frames per second, rendering graphics at an effective 1080p which were then reconstructed to 1440p and upscaled to 2160p, using moreover to ray tracing only to enhance the lighting system and the three-dimensional dynamics of the audio. Returnal, the pitfalls of a new setting We were therefore very curious to understand how the game would have behaved on PC, and we must say that we still have some perplexity today regarding mysterious warnings and glitches that seem to be connected in particular to the use of the RTX 3070: at the start the card is not recognized by the system, which nevertheless presents the standard options and allows you to play quietly at 4K, with all settings at maximum, scoring ... 147 fps? Despite our disbelief, we were ready to launch ourselves enthusiastically into building a monument to Climax Studios, the team that carried out the conversion, when a doubt arose, which was later resolved with video captures: apparently the options said 2160p, but in reality the game ran at just 720p. Having restored the real values, we are back down to earth on the performance front, even though we have found a truly complete and scalable system. Returnal and reflex management, available in two variants The PC version of Returnal in fact allows you to change the resolution and v-sync, setting a possible limit for the frame rate, supports ultrawide monitors (21:9 but also 32:9) and has four main presets (Epic, Max , Med and Min) which, however, can be customized by adjusting the individual items: optimizationscreen (from dynamic resolution to manual scaler, from DLSS to FSR, via VRS and NIS) and lighting quality, shadows, ambient occlusion, ray traced shadows, reflections (screen space or ray traced), models, textures, volumetric fog , particles, antialiasing, depth of field, film grain, bloom and HDR. In short, we are provided with a wide range of possibilities to fine-tune the experience and scale it on different configurations, then verifying everything through an excellent internal benchmark, which divides the tests according to the situations that arise during the campaign and indicates for each item the degree of CPU and GPU commitment, as well as obviously the totalized frames per second. Even the percentage of effective resolution compared to the output is revealed in the presence of upscaling technologies. Returnal, a fight sequence Net of two large patches (one 2 GB and one 3 GB) released during our Returnal test, in the absence of NVIDIA drivers optimized for the game and with the perplexities we told you about at the beginning of the paragraph, we can say that a great job of conversion has been done, which in a similar way to what was said in the review of Dead Space for PC presents itself as the best version of the Housemarque title, capable of pushing more convincingly on resolution, frame rate and effects depending on the hardware in your possession. In our case, with the aforementioned RTX 3070, an Intel Core i5 13500 processor, 16 GB of DDR5 RAM and SSD, using the Epic preset you have to opt for a 1440p with DLSS on ~balanced~ to get 60 stable fps, although in some moments subject to noticeable stuttering. In such a complex and frenetic game it is necessary to consider a generous performance surplus to cope with the most crowded sequences, but switching to the Max preset seems to be able to play well even at 4K with DLSS on balanced: not bad for a mid-range video card of last year.", "date": "2023-02-15", "grade": "8.5"}
