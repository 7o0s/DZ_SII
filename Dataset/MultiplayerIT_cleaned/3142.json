We had eyed Deadtoast Entertainment's action shooter since the first, spectacular GIFs shared by the author, a former Media Molecule struggling with his first independent project; and we couldn't wait to be able to try the game first hand to understand if those aerial evolutions based on bullets, rigorously in slow motion, were governed by gameplay that lived up to expectations. The answer is a dry and eloquent no, in the sense that the game undoubtedly puts in place excellent ideas and offers moments of pure epicness, but does not find the square to fully express its potential and thus ends up presenting itself as an interesting exercise in style which, however, in many situations appears to be an end in itself , flows away without acute details and once completed (the duration of the campaign is just over three hours, net of some inevitable game over) it doesn't leave much. History If the story behind My Friend Pedro has its own reason, revealed during the intricate ending, in reality it is a mere expedient to put us in command of a hit man with undoubted acrobatic skills, dealing with an organization criminal who was tasked with eliminating. Who assigned it to him? The talking banana that has accompanied him since he woke up, with no memory and his face covered by a strange mask. Ok, better not to ask yourself too many questions and advance through the levels, divided into five different settings, gradually coming into possession of increasingly effective weapons: from the starting double pistol, with infinite ammunition, to light machine guns; passing through shotguns, assault and sniper rifles, equipped with very interesting features and even alternative fire modes. The aim assist on PS4 tends to lock onto certain targets to make life easier for us, but on occasion the system leaves something to be desired and ends up creating a few episodes of frustration. Checks The formula, as mentioned, is that of a horizontal scrolling action shooter, however characterized by a traditional control layout (X to jump, Square to reload, the right analog stick to aim and the right trigger to open fire, mainly) , perhaps even too much considering the needs of some of the most agitated situations that we will find ourselves having to manage during the campaign: perhaps imagining some alternative solution would have been helpful for maintaining the flow. Under the vital energy indicator, divided into three units that tend to recharge individually at the normal difficulty level, we find the bar that regulates the bullet time, deliberately very generous. To activate this feature, just press the left stick on its axis, so that for several seconds everything moves in slow motion, allowing us to place the bullets exactly where we want, hit more targets in less time and, in general, create highly spectacular sequences , the real core of the experience. Gameplay The killing style is in fact the key to obtaining positive evaluations at the end of each stage, and so you have to face each situation in the craziest and most extravagant way: having identified the enemies, it is possible to lock-on one of them to be able to shoot at the same time in two directions, kick pans to make the bullets bounce and thus hit less exposed targets, use the ever-present explosives to trigger disruptive explosions (visually rendered in a somewhat disappointing way, actually), hook onto cables or even climb a skateboard that can make us advance rapidly, thus depriving the opponents of the time to react to our sorties. It is clear that dashing through a glass window, landing by rolling, leaping and hitting the heads of a group of assassins in mid-air proves to be a exhilarating experience, but as mentioned there are some elements that keep My Friend Pedro from literally taking flight: inconsistent and light physics, very approximate management of melee (which fortunately you end up resorting to very rarely), boss fights really disappointing and some alternate sections (see motorcycle chases) even more so; but above all a basic setting that often makes it optional to resort to bullet time, misunderstanding the very nature of this production. Playstation 4 trophies There are thirty-one Trophies that can be unlocked during the My Friend Pedro campaign. Some of them are obtained simply by completing the levels, others are linked to reaching certain numbers (for example dodging a thousand bullets or killing five hundred enemies), still othersare linked to very particular situations, see the use of extra objects to eliminate opponents: from frying pans to barrels, from skateboards to explosives. Technical realization My Friend Pedro manages to convincingly represent the firefights, giving life as mentioned to highly spectacular sequences in which the trajectories of the bullets ruthlessly cross the body of our enemies, leaving blood trails while we in turn try to exploit the acrobatic skills of the protagonist and his ability to rotate on himself to avoid being hit. Outside of these situations, however, the game moves a little awkwardly, resorting to solutions that are not exactly captivating, especially to give life to the alternative worlds in which some missions more focused on the platforming aspect are set. as already mentioned, it is very light and inconsistent, and this aspect is also reflected in the animations of the character, especially when he interacts with surfaces, giving life to unpleasant ragdoll effects. The good thing is that the frame rate is stable, without uncertainties, while a pleasant electronic soundtrack accompanies our actions, without conquering us but not even falling into boredom and repetitiveness. The effects are less brilliant: we expected a better yield for the many weapons that are seen in the game.", "date": "2020-04-10", "grade": "7.7"}
