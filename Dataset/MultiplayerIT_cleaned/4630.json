Not the recent Breath of the Wild, but the classic Zeldas, the ones most linked to the canons dictated by the first 2D chapters. Playing the impression of being faced with an epigone of the Nintendo saga is really very strong, starting from when you start cutting the grass with your sword to find health spheres. In short, with Hob Runic Games, the software house famous for the two Torchlights (very successful and really well done action role-playing games, despite being mere clones of Diablo II) tries to emancipate itself, but without giving up a game concept strong and already well established from which to start. To differentiate, the chosen path is above all the stylistic one, both at the level of construction of the game world, which we will discuss in a dedicated paragraph, and at a strictly narrative level, with some solutions that recall the works of Fumito Ueda and all that vein of video games evocative that dodge movies and words, letting the story emerge from the player's observation and interactions with the environment. Hob is full of evocative landscapes Start and progression Hob begins with a dramatic sequence. A strange robot awakens the protagonist from a crypt and guides him through the ruins to an unknown destination. On the way he comes into contact with a strange form of life, a kind of environmental cancer that is rapidly spreading, risking his death. To save him, the robot has to cut off his arm and give him his own, effectively putting an end to the prologue and starting the real adventure. The robotic arm has some exceptional powers, which will allow you to unlock the first areas of the adventure. Meanwhile, it possesses such strength as to allow the movement of some objects (for example blocks of stone or large batteries) and the activation of mild pressure mechanisms. The game world is basically a big mechanism to be reactivated Obviously it can also be used as a weapon in conjunction with the sword (there are several swords in the game, which must be built by finding the pieces scattered around the maps). Going forward in the adventure, new powers related to the equipment will be unlocked, both by solving the various puzzles and by purchasing them in a workshop, where you can spend the materials found around (mechanical parts and butterflies) on projects found from columns of stone or obtained in key moments of the adventure. For example, it will be possible to unlock a loaded shot for the fist, useful against armored enemies, or a power that allows you to use dematerializers, necessary to solve some puzzles, or even more effective combos for the sword and so on. At a certain point it will also be possible to change the appearance of the protagonist, so to speak. As the Zelda series wants, character progression is not only an end in itself, but allows you to access new areas of the map. With the charged shot it will be possible to break some more fragile walls, which will also allow you to create connections between the different areas, just as dematerializing will allow you to reach others. Now it remains to be seen whether it is really worth the effort to visit the world of Hob. Around the world of Hob The open world of Hob is a big ruined mechanism that needs to be reactivated literally, since you really have to make sure to bring electricity back to all areas, all with different visual styles. At the beginning you only have a partial vision of what happened, but as you solve the puzzles you get more and more in touch with this marvelous construction created by the artists of Runic Games, which alone is worth the entire price of the game. Although not graphically very complex, one is repeatedly fascinated by the landscapes produced by Hobm's engine, which are always composed with great skill. Thus, puzzle after puzzle, an incredibly dark underground cave lights up with lights that outline its shapes and underline its return to life, while also showing its function. Impossible not to be amazed when an entire region of the game world comes to the surface before our eyes, or when we find ourselves interacting with complex mechanisms that completely alter the surrounding scenario. The puzzles of them have a purely mechanical nature, as you should have already understood: levers to pull, blocks to move, connecting platforms to move, obstructions to clear, platforms to reach and so on. There are also moments in which you have to use the protagonist's dash to overcome some obstacles, or others in which you are challenged by very precise jumps on retractable platforms. Overallively between puzzles and secrets, the latter linked to materials or bonuses that increase energy bars, the exploration of Hob is one of the most beautiful experiences made in recent months, which does not make us regret the classics of the genre. Some blunder Where Hob fails is in the combat system. Let's say that in general it works... and that's it, because it's really very bland. The weaker enemies are all or almost all killed by swinging the sword, while some of the bigger ones require a more tactical approach, but nothing that can really worry. The narration is silent and proceeds by suggestions In the long run, fighting almost becomes a distracting annoyance from exploration, although the unlocking of new sword and fist powers adds some variety. Another flaw concerns the game camera. The developers have opted for a fixed and non-rotatable view, which however does not prove adequate in all situations. For example, sometimes jumps fail because the framing does not allow you to evaluate distances well, while in others the camera rotates slightly causing you to lose the direction of the run, thus nullifying the subsequent jump. These are sporadic situations, which you also get used to, but you notice them, above all because the rescue system is based on checkpoints which force you to retrace areas already visited every time to return to the point where you went wrong. Finally, for some Hobs it can be too distracting, because the objectives to be pursued are never clarified and the open world structure of the map can be confusing. What will happen to this world? In reality this only happens in the initial part, when you are practicing with the game system and pay particular attention to that. In the rest of the adventure there are always clues that suggest where to go (on the map itself appear pins that indicate where the next objective is). Furthermore, the fact that the game world is essentially divided into macro areas that must be tackled one at a time (apart from when you return to hunt for secrets) greatly softens the sense of bewilderment. Having said that, having chosen such a contemplative style for narration could throw off some people, so be warned that if you love being taken by the hand at every step and receiving didactic explanations of everything, Hob could put you in difficulty.", "date": "2017-10-06", "grade": "8.0"}
