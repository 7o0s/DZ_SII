{"name": "Obscure II - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/obscure-ii-recensione_a.html", "text": "I'm sending you to boarding school Speaking of plot, Obscure II does not differ in particular from the prequel: the location and the characters change, but the story always revolves around a college that is suddenly attacked by demonic creatures and a handful of students who find themselves forced to fight for survival. The atmosphere is taken verbatim from that of the millions of teen-horror films that have crowded cinemas in recent years, with all that follows from it: caricatured characters, deliberately over the top jokes, some splatter scenes here and there and a emotional tension based almost exclusively on (predictable) twists. Those who have always appreciated this kind of film will love what Obscure II offers in this sense, while fans of a more ~psychological~ horror (Silent Hill or Forbidden Siren style, to be clear) will only find the Hydravision title still more banal and simplistic than it actually is. The game in and of itself retains a rather classic cut, in the first Resident Evil way: the various locations are explored, weapons and objects are collected, simple puzzles are solved and monsters are killed, with the peculiarity of the second character constantly on screen . This can be controlled both by the CPU and by a human user (who can enter and exit at any time), leading to curious but not exactly revolutionary results: the presence of a supporting actor does not offer particular playful cues that go beyond some event scripted or the mere exploitation of the peculiar skills of each hero to solve the various puzzles. In fact, each of the six students involved in this bloody adventure possesses a characteristic trait that reveals him to be suitable for particular situations, whether it is to move heavy objects in the case of the gymnast on duty or to solve logical puzzles in the guise of the brainiac, just to mention the first examples. However, the ~trick~ of the double protagonist only works up to a certain point, beyond which Obscure II reveals itself for what it really is: a survival horror with a thin plot, a rather sleepy succession of events and a staging of events - inevitably - seen and reviewed. SurWiival horror It is legitimate to think that if Hydravision has decided to release this Wii version several months later from its PC and PS2 counterparts, there is a valid reason, probably linked to the need to make the most of the peculiarities of the control system. In reality, from this point of view, Obscure II does not prove particularly worthy of praise, quite the contrary. The movement of the character is delegated to the analog stick of the Nunchuck, while with the pointing of the remote control on the screen, the elements with which to interact are selected and the movement of the camera is managed, two actions that immediately turn out to be anything but easy: in fact, it happens more often than not not noticing sensitive objects due to the too small size of the on-screen viewfinder, as well as being disoriented due to an excessively slow shot in taking the right position. The lock-on system of the enemies is also rather cumbersome and not particularly exciting, which must be aimed at and then hooked by keeping the A button pressed, while to hit them it is necessary to use the B button if you are handling a firearm or move the Remote in the case of a white weapon. For the rest, the motion sensors of the Wii controllers are used only for accessory actions, such as the reloading of guns and the like (to be done by shaking the Nunchuck) or the execution of impromptu context-sensitive moves. To the large set of unconvincing aspects of Obscure II must also be added the graphic creation, which already appeared limping on PC and PS2 and which here suffers the brunt of the criticisms given the months that have passed since the previous releases: the polygonal models of the characters and monsters, while the quality of the settings and light effects reaches acceptable thresholds but nothing more. The sound, on the other hand, falls into what is usually defined as a mixed bag, with annoyingly over-the-top dubbing offset by excellent orchestral music. Comment In this Wii incarnation, Obscure II gains a more ~picturesque~ control system (not necessarily better or more stimulating, of course), but keeps its own strengths and weaknesses unchanged: unfortunately very few important elements can be ascribed to the first category, while the the second one is enriched here with a cosmetics decidedly not in step with the times. That said, Obscure II isn't literally a throwaway product, but it just doesn't really offer anything worthwhile.
