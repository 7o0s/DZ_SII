Yes, we all love the Pink Fluffy that Masahiro Sakurai invented thirty years ago, and yes, true Nintendo fans rarely miss the appointment with his traditional adventures: they play them, talk about them a bit, everyone agrees that are colorful and witty and fun, but maybe too, too easy, and then they move on, knowing that developer HAL Laboratory will come up with some new devilry in the next spin-off, like when he made it out of cloth and clay, or you had to shake the Game Boy to move it with the accelerometer. But the leap in quality, the game that marks the clear separation between what came before and what comes after, is a much rarer event. Here, in our review of Kirby and the lost land we will try to explain why we could be in front of that game. It is an adventure that won us over and entertained us like few others in Kirby's long history, and which redeems it from the disappointing Kirby: Star Allies released on Switch some time ago, anticipating a very bright future if HAL Laboratory decides to continue on this street. The Lost Land Kirby and the lost land, the 3D map where you will find the various stages It's not that Kirby, as a series, has a real narrative, but someone, over the years, has ended up putting together the pieces of a mythology that all in all has a head and a tail: the last lines of this new adventure they're going to drive Pink Fluffy super fans crazy - guaranteed! - but up to that point Kirby and the Lost Land remains a particularly stingy game of information or interludes. This is intentional, given that at the beginning of the story - as you probably know if you have played the demo already available on the eShop - Kirby and the Waddle Dee end up sucked into a world completely different from theirs and very, very similar to ours: the aura of mystery that surrounds this scenario, so familiar and foreign at the same time, fuels the feeling of playing something different from the usual, but opens the door to a slightly more articulated and subjective discourse. The lost land of the title, to understand us, is an extremely diversified world, divided into biomes as required by the tradition of Nintendo platformers: from the first world invaded by uncontrolled vegetation of Natura unica we pass to the seas and beaches of the Oasi Voce d'Oceano and to the dunes of Nullandia passing through the dark dungeons of Ortonevoso and so on. The excellent level design suppresses any dj vu in the bud: HAL Laboratory has managed to diversify the stages not only in terms of graphics, but also in structuring, so much so that even the inevitable boss rush at the end of the campaign reserves many surprises for the players who they venture believing they know what they're going to encounter. The result is obtained not only through the exemplary planning of the challenges - so to speak - and the obstacles to overcome, but also with the use of a renewed graphic layout that perhaps does not reach the excellence of Switch, but which defends itself very well and takes advantage of every possible trick to guarantee good fluidity for most of the time, although you can catch a few scatterello here and there, but we are talking about very little stuff, mostly limited to the elements in the distance . HAL Laboratory has put a lot of work into every aspect of the technical presentation. The soundtrack is undoubtedly among the most inspired of the series, with many unpublished tunes and some arrangements that we were pleased to listen to at the right time, and on the graphic front we appreciated not only the cleanliness of the image, both in portability and playing with the console in its Dock, but also the choice of colours, always lively and gaudy, which stand out above all on the screen of the OLED model. Clever use of lighting, shaders and depth of field modernize this incarnation of the franchise tremendously, but it's mainly the direction, with its memorable camera angles, that works wonderfully well in the game's best moments. For the avoidance of doubt, although being advertised as the first title in the series to be fully 3D, Kirby and the Lost Land does not allow direct camera control, which instead follows pre-established patterns. This makes perfect sense in the economy of a level design that plays on shots and perspectives. Kirby and the Lost Land, Ocean's Voice Oasis stages are filled with water And in short, if up to now we have only talked about it well, why did we say that there was a more articulated discussion to do? Let's put it this way: we liked Kirby and the Lost Land so much from a technical point of view, but we couldn't help but wonder if HAL Laboratory hasn't well, wasted all its sefforts in the representation of these realistic scenarios. Notwithstanding that the effect is much less alienating than the New Donk City of Super Mario Odyssey, given that the Japanese developer has found a good stylistic compromise between cartoonish 3D models and plausible scenarios, the various stages that recall the real world can inevitably appear a bit trivial. The video game is a medium that allows the imagination to materialize, and perhaps it would have been nice to see the Popstar planet, Dream Land and the other imaginary places where Kirby's old adventures took place. This consideration has not influenced our judgment in the slightest, be clear. Take it as food for thought, a ~what if~ if you prefer. Also because the courageous choice to set the game in a real world also represents an alternative solution to the cloth or clay of the famous spin-offs. Full force gameplay Kirby and the Lost Land, there is also Wispy Woods in an alternate version called Tropic Woods The 3D world map - also summarized in a convenient traditional list menu - allows you to choose the unlocked stages: you will discover that in each world there are both classic stages, which you will have to pass in succession to get to the gate of the boss on duty , both the extra stages, called Treasure Paths, which open upon completion of each main mission or which you will find simply by exploring the map and pressing the confirm button when you find a hidden interaction point. Once you have chosen the level to play, let's go: by selecting the cooperative mode from the main menu you can be accompanied by a friend who will control a Waddle Dee armed with a spear. It's a small step down from the plethora of supporting characters in Kirby: Star Allies' four-player multiplayer, and perhaps we would have appreciated a greater variety of supporting characters. Kirby and the Lost Land, the second player takes control of a warrior Waddle Dee On the other hand, Waddle Dee's presence makes sense. Our goal, in fact, will be to save the Waddle Dee that a mysterious enemy has kidnapped and hidden in the various stages. In addition to those waiting for you in the cage at the end of the path, you will find many others hidden in the most unthinkable places: if it is true that some can be reached by rather intuitive ways, others are so ambushed that the game itself, at the end of the stage, pity, he will suggest how to find them. We have to say that some puzzles are really evil and we would never have gotten there without the hints of the interface, but on the other hand Kirby and the lost land is a well, Kirby, and therefore you should know by now what you are getting into. HAL Laboratory titles are not hard platformers. Game over is a chimera: to say, we died twice throughout the campaign, losing just a few coins out of the thousands we had accumulated. The challenge is not to get to the end of the stage, but to play it and replay it to find all the secrets and collectibles: not only the hidden Waddle Dee, but also the blueprints and stickers. Kirby and the Lost Land, Dragonfire is a very powerful ability that can deal damage over time to enemies Beyond the fact that some bosses gave us a hard time, Kirby and the Lost Land can be challenging in its own way. The amount of content, in fact, is impressive. The stages are on average long, full of enemies and adrenaline-pumping segments, and sometimes it's enough to be too slow to miss that one chance to save a Waddle Dee or reach a project that will force us to start over. The Paths of the Treasure, then, are real puzzles based on powers and Boccomorphoses: the guys from HAL Laboratory have invented extremely different timed stages that put the player to the test in the most disparate ways. In some you will simply have to fight, in some you will have to solve environmental puzzles, still others are particularly elaborate platforming challenges. You don't need to break the reported record to win the star at the end of the stage: as we said, the game is challenging, not difficult, and Nintendo wants you to see everything it has to offer. Those rare stones in the Treasure Streets, for example, serve to enhance Kirby's Copy skills. Kirby and the Lost Land, the icy breath of the Dadopagos Ice ability forms snowmen As you probably already know if you've watched the trailers or played the demo, Kirby can boost Copy skills in the Waddle Dee city by bringing a blueprint, some coins, and one or more rare stones from the Treasure Streets to the blacksmith. Copy skills, at this round, are not many, and we have felt the lack of some famous powersi who have accompanied us over the years. HAL Laboratory has also greatly reduced its move pool: we are not sure if this streamlining of the gameplay has really served, but we can understand that it would have been difficult to implement the various directional combinations in a completely 3D context. A small price we paid in exchange for the evolved powers, an idea that we honestly liked a lot. Mind you, not all the evolutions of the Copy skills are equally inspired - some are even a little too similar to the initial ones - but there are some that are truly original, not to mention very powerful, Dragon Fire and Meta Knight Sword in primis - and the the fact that Kirby changes appearance from time to time is just the icing on the cake, also because there are like thirty shapes. Intermezzo: the city of the Waddle Dee Kirby and the lost land, in the city of the Waddle Dee you can even fish together All the Waddle Dee that you free in the lost land will gather in the Waddle Dee city, a kind of central hub, accessible from the world map, which will grow thanks to your efforts. At first you'll just have the Blacksmith that boosts your Copy skills and a cinema to review cutscenes, but as you hunt down Waddle Dee more and more you'll start adding new services and features. The city of the Waddle Dee is a kind of micro stage, with its secrets and collectibles, such as the sticker dispensers, the Kirby's house that you can marginally customize, the kiosk where you can refresh yourself when you're low on energy and a plethora of mini-games that you can face alone or in company as Roll, Kirby! which is inspired by the old Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble for Game Boy, and the nice Lightning Fishing. The Colosseum, on the other hand, with its different cups, is a fairly traditional boss rush complete with a predictable guest star and interesting rewards. Powers and Boccomorphosis Kirby and the lost land, the Morfolampadina will allow you to light up dark rooms What has been described so far is masterfully combined in the various stages. The level design is brilliant - it's meant to entertain, not hinder. Each stage is an organic and easy-going succession of challenges and puzzles that test the player's reflexes or wit. In the same stage you switch between completely different gameplay solutions with a smoothness that leaves you speechless. Kirby's Copy abilities are ingeniously arranged: the game always suggests which enemy to absorb to discover the secret around the corner, just keep your eyes peeled. Is there a torch to light and a Hothead nearby that can grant you the Fire ability? Put two and two together. The game perhaps gives out energy-replenishing collectibles too often, but you'll find that in the latter stages of the adventure, the enemies can be really ferocious, especially if you play Storm mode, the default difficulty level which you can reduce from the options menu. It is no coincidence that you can buy temporary health, attack or speed bonuses in the city. Kirby and the Lost Land, the blacksmith will boost your Copy skills If Kirby and the lost land works so well it is also thanks to Boccomorphosis. This unprecedented power allows us to absorb certain objects and take their form. The idea is an evident evolution of the dynamics experienced in Kirby: Triple Deluxe and Kirby: Planet Robobot for Nintendo 3DS. In those titles, the gimmicks intertwined with the progression in the stage: the level design forced the player to use those specific powers - while with the Copy skills it is never necessary, except in very rare cases - putting them at the service of spectacularity and a real own direction. Kirby and the Lost Land does more or less the same thing, but the variety of situations is enormous and some Mouthmorphoses lend themselves to various gameplay solutions: this is the case of the Morphoring, which the game employs in at least three different ways, making us use it to explore, to fight and even to solve some puzzles. Each new stage is a discovery, and as you continue in the campaign, the game begins to cross different dynamics, Copy abilities and Mouthmorphosis. Kirby and the Lost Land, the Morphoring allows you to push boats across the water In the end, in short, you don't get there with shortness of breath. Also thanks to the freedom to choose whether to continue or stop to complete the Treasure Paths to evolve all the Copy skills found, one hardly feels a moment of tiredness or repetitiveness. Challenging, never frustrating, and always fun, Kirby and the Lost Land is a game that takes a few nights to complete, while outlasting pretty much any other adventure in the HAL Laboratory series.
