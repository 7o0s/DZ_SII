It is a race, set in 2D with side scrolling (but represented in 3D) between four players aboard snowmobiles on the snow and focused on the ability to make jumps and land in the best way, regulating acceleration and landing angle in order not to damage the vehicle and avoid sudden slowdowns. It is a derivation of the Mad Skills series, which in turn can be seen as a sort of middle ground between Excitebike and Trials, although a greater search for realism is perceptible, compared to these models. We find the same approach, with the same sources of inspiration, here too, only that instead of motocross bikes we are dealing with snowmobiles, which definitely changes the driving dynamics and physics applied to the vehicles. Everything becomes much stiffer and more woody than the snappy enduros and, of course, it would also be right given the context, were it not that the gameplay consequently also becomes much more mechanical and staid. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but the feel is rather strange compared to standard racing or even trick-focused games like Trials, especially considering that the control over the vehicle is extremely limited. Yet, if you get carried away, you begin to find a certain satisfaction in the perfect execution of jumps and landings, even in the bizarre racing context in which we find ourselves racing. Running in the snow Mad Skills Snocross, an image at the start of the race The aim of the game is to compete with three other drivers on various tracks, trying to cross the finish line first and possibly also reaching the secondary objectives assigned to each round. The gameplay is based on a simple concept but requires some attention to be executed properly: in essence it is a matter of accelerating, decelerating and controlling the angle of the vehicle in order to execute jumps and landings in the best way, trying not to lose precious seconds, do not suffer excessive damage and maybe even gain some acceleration boost thanks to the perfect execution of the maneuvers. As previously mentioned, it is a sort of mix between the old Excitebike and Trials, taking from the former the more technical aspect of searching for the best trajectories in flight to maintain the right attitude on the snow and from the latter the possible execution of aerial tricks in able to guarantee additional bonuses. Despite the use of 3D graphics, which are of an excellent level even if always rather simple, Mad Skills Snocross is an exquisitely 2D game, all set on a single plane that allows us to essentially contract on only three commands: accelerator, brake and inclination of the sled. There is therefore no need to worry about turning or performing maneuvers to avoid and overtake opponents, since everyone proceeds parallel to the other without touching. This may seem limiting, but there really is already enough to think about to try to execute jumps and landings in the best way to make the gameplay not easy at all. Mad Skills Snocross, main character and snowmobile are all customizable and upgradeable Indeed, compared to the first decidedly accessible races, the level of difficulty soon undergoes a sudden increase which forces you to become familiar with the control system, learning even the most hidden elements in setting the vehicle's set-up. Another element of fundamental importance is the modification and enhancement of the snowmobile, which becomes necessary to be able to compete at the more advanced levels and in which the micro-transactions are obviously grafted. Being a free-to-play, Mad Skills Snocross is full of advertising and in-game currency to spend in order to quickly access the improvements for the vehicle. Although the first problem is easily solved by purchasing the elimination of advertising at the price of 7.99 euros, the microtransactions inherent in the progression system are a more complex matter: although it is possible to avoid them by dedicating yourself to a little grinding and voluntarily looking at the ads to receive extra bonuses, the paywall eventually emerges, forcing you to resort to real money to buy the most valuable in-game currency. Consequently, it is technically a pay to win, even if the asynchronous multiplayer perhaps makes the consequences of this setting less heavy.", "date": "2022-11-23", "grade": "6.8"}
