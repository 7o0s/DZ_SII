We have seen interesting experiments on the theme of strategy become over time real settled canons, such as the tower defense trend or the various hybridizations with MMO or city builder elements that have progressively moved away from the classic structure of the strategy. From this point of view, Total War Battles: Kingdom has the merit of trying to propose a more rigorous interpretation of the genre, taken directly from the PC world and transposed to the new platforms, however not without an appropriate reinterpretation of the new context. The high-sounding title evokes the most classic tradition of the strategic and at first glance The Creative Assembly seems to have kept the bar straight on its historical course, but the catch emerges rather soon: the game is a free-to-play linked to an infrastructure of rather invasive micro-transactions that permeate practically every aspect of the game, from the possibility of spending real money to reduce the wait in the construction of buildings to the purchase of an immediate cure for the troops fallen in battle. It is indeed an almost sacrilegious departure from the solid principles on which the Total War series is based, but one must not lose sight of how much good there is in the structure of the game. There is in fact a good managerial phase in the construction and maintenance of the fiefdom and a battle phase which, although not too involving, manages to put on the screen fights characterized by a considerable scale, offering the rare spectacle of vast armies clashing on small touch screens. Despite the free-to-play treatment, Total War Battles: Kingdom also has a solid structure The field and the battle Total War Battles: Kingdom consists of two different but intertwined phases, which combine the soul of the strategic combat of the Total War series with city builder-style management elements, all within a medieval setting that requires the player to put order in the socio-political chaos of 20th century England. On the one hand we therefore have the construction and management of the fiefdom, with the need to construct buildings and structures, collect resources and form an army while on the other there are the battle phases, which in this case take place semi-automatically, with the only request to deploy the troops on the chessboard in order to oppose the right elements against the enemy teams, possibly change the disposition in the race, select the objectives and play the charge at the right time. All in all, the combat phase is perhaps the least engaging of the whole game, given the low commitment required after the first deployment of forces, therefore the greatest commitment lies above all in the attempt to create an army as strong and complete as possible in its various units, able to face different situations, but the purely strategic choices during the battle are reduced to a minimum. The city builder-style management phase seems more convincing, with the management of the castle and the surrounding land, in continuous expansion, which offers numerous activities to follow, buildings to construct and parameters to keep under control. However, in this aspect of the game the tendency to confront us with microtransactions appears quite clearly, given that every single management aspect, especially in the more advanced stages, often requires long and nerve-wracking waits, clearly prompting the speeding up of breaks through spending of gold, conquerable in-game but also much more easily purchasable with real money. Gold thus becomes the center and engine of the whole mechanism of Total War Battles: Kingdom, from the reduction of downtime in humanly sustainable expectations to the need to heal the troops fallen in battle and even if it is not used it is clear that a structure of such powerful micro-transactions cannot fail to negatively affect the pace of the game. On the other hand, the fact that the game world is persistent allows you to pause and resume games while still finding a continuous progression in place while the excellent technical realization makes Total War Battles: Kingdom always a pleasure to watch, both in the more reflexive than in the combative ones.", "date": "2016-03-30", "grade": "6.8"}
