We welcome you to the Megadimension Neptunia VII review! Sorry for *glom* the wait. As you probably already know, we have arrived at the fourth main chapter of the series, as well as a direct sequel to Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory. It is also the first time the Console Patron Units (CPU) on the new generation Sony console and for the occasion Compile Heart - Compa for friends - has decided to bring various innovations to the brand, starting from an unprecedented narrative structure. Curious to find out what dear Nep-Nep has in store for us? We tell you right now! As soon as we finish our dessert... *chomp chomp* it's really good... *chomp* Three stories, three dimensions and a new CPU: here is our review of Megadimension Neptunia VII! Towards the grand finale Zerodimension Neptunia Z, Hyperdimension Neptunia G and Heartdimension Neptunia H: these are the three games that make up Megadimension Neptunia VII. Yes, because this time the Idea Factory guys weren't satisfied with publishing a single game, but they created a trilogy and then decided to enclose everything in one package. So we start immediately with the same incipit of Zerodimension Neptunia Z: Twilight of the Desperate CPU already seen in the Japanese demo: Neptune is wandering around Planeptune when he comes across a strange orange console and, after examining it with Nepgear, the two sisters are teleported in another dimension. From this moment on the story - starring Uzume Tennouboshi, a disgraced CPU who lives in a world dominated by desolation - as well as new characters and new monsters also reintroduces old acquaintances of the series and re-proposes all the typical characteristics of the brand: centrality of friendship ties, fanservice, frequent fourth wall breaks and amusing references to the world of video games. The light-heartedness of the themes, however, is accompanied by an underlying darkness which translates not only into the settings, but also into some dialogues and the fragmentary chronicles of a painful and long-forgotten past. Albeit with a sudden change of location, this vaguely dark atmosphere also continues in Hyperdimension Neptunia G: The Golden Leaders, Reconstructors of Gamindustri. Here the player finds himself carrying out (in the order he prefers) four different narrative routes, all characterized by problematic characters with tormented personalities. Everything is obviously seasoned by the contagious optimism of Neptune, but the absence of the ~protagonist of the protagonists~, during the individual paths of the CPUs, allows us to deepen their characterization and that of the new characters. But it is above all in Heartdimension Neptunia H: Trilogy Finale: Into Legend that what is told in the first two stories reaches its climax. The importance of the ubiquitous orange console finally finds an explanation, as well as the many questions that the previous events had raised in the player. It is certainly not a script without flaws and the endless lines of nonsense dialogue stand out above all, which excessively slow down a pace of play that is still better than in the past. The division into three parts has in fact made it possible to abolish many downtimes and in some circumstances the curiosity for what is about to happen is truly sincere. However, some jokes seem to have been forced into the narrative fabric, as well as entire skits, which bring back a sense of cloying dj vu for those who have also played the various spin-offs. Overall, however, the three stories have their own coherence and demonstrate a maturity that had so far only emerged in flashes in the various chapters of the series. Next generation CPUs Also as regards the game mechanics, the progression within the three episodes of Megadimension Neptunia VII is well structured. The atmosphere of the series is introduced from the first chapters with particular attention to newbies, as well as the JRPG mechanics with which longtime players can immediately find themselves at ease. The classic combo system, based on the three types Rush, Power and Standard, has been redesigned for the occasion to make the choice of attacks assigned to each character less obvious and the player must now also keep in mind the order in which to carry out hits, if he wants to maximize damage. Gradually we then become acquainted with the Hard Drive Divinity (HDD) transformation, the EXE Drive bar, once again responsible for activating the HDD mode and some skills, and the combined attacks that can be carried out when the enemy is squeezed in the gripof two or more characters. Among the most relevant innovations, the new form granted to the CPUs should certainly be mentioned: the Next Forms represent the transition to the new generation, with a consequent boost to the statistics and access to new skills, but, unlike what happens in the demo, the player cannot exploit this power up for over two-thirds of the story. The Gold Third is also added to the list of transformations, but in reality it is a mutation equivalent to the HDD and which only affects the four new personifications that make their appearance in the game (representing Capcom, Bandai Namco, Square Enix and Konami). Playstation 4 trophies There are 35 trophies in Megadimension Neptunia VII, 21 of which are hidden. Compared to the past, however, it should be easier to reach platinum. In fact, there are fewer trophies related to alternative endings and, above all, this time there are only two objectives related to Lily Rank and they do not require reaching the maximum level of affinity among all the available characters. The other trophies are instead linked to the completion of the three main game chapters and the exploration of all the secondary mechanics. Overall, therefore, platinum the game should require less grind than what the series had accustomed us to. But the next-gen is only on paper However, the news does not only concern the combat system and in fact it is the management of cities and secondary activities that has undergone the most significant changes. It starts from the map, with the paths between the various dungeons that lead to random encounters and which, under certain circumstances, must be built through a special menu by paying a certain amount of credits (the current currency in the game). Stella's Dungeon has also been revisited, integrated in a more coherent way into the mechanics through a dense scouting network, reminiscent of that of Fairy Fencer f and which allows you to send different minions to various dungeons: their reports can concern treasures, new monsters and secret locations, but their presence also entails certain bonuses (or malus) in case of direct exploration. Each city can then be upgraded by investing in commerce, industry or public relations: each investment brings specific benefits, such as new items in the market, new scouts or new projects for the creation of items. Then there are mini-games like the Colosseum and the brand new Neplunker, a dungeon inspired by Spelunker where you risk game over at every step. The crafting also returns which concerns not only the consumables and game discs to equip, but also key objects that allow you to jump higher or destroy certain elements within the dungeons to access secret areas. Speaking of dungeons, it is almost superfluous to point out that the recycling of the setting and monsters continues to be a widespread practice in the series. For a game that offers over 40 hours of content just to complete the story, it is increasingly clear that the budget available is not sufficient to make a leap in graphic quality worthy of the name. The only good news for the technical sector then remains the resolution of 1080p and the frame rate at 60 frames per second, which runs into some uncertainty very rarely. However, it is difficult to justify these slowdowns: the quality of the textures is minimal, the border of the shadows changes even two, three times as you approach an object, creating an annoying visual effect, and even a basic anisotropic filtering seems completely absent. Even the quality of the videos of the animated sequences is so compressed as to be inadequate, even if we were in front of a PlayStation TV game. Fortunately, the sound sector is better and, while not introducing who knows what quality songs, it rearranges some of the iconic music of the games parodied in the various levels in a nice way. The English dub is also confirmed to be decent (the Japanese one can be downloaded for free) but there are still too many important, inexplicably silent sequences that would undoubtedly have benefited from good acting.", "date": "2016-02-12", "grade": "7.2"}
