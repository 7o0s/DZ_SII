The inevitable rejection of this episode, completely entrusted to the care of Visual Concepts after the sudden abandonment of Yuke's, the Japanese team that has been managing the series for almost twenty years, arrives in fact in conjunction with the diffusion on social networks of various images and meme-style GIFs that describe the current state of the game in terms of glitches. We ourselves wanted to wait to understand if a solving patch would arrive in a reasonable time, but apparently it will take longer than expected to be able to fix the problems affecting the title. Mode Let's start immediately by saying that, on a purely structural front, WWE 2K20 does not miss anything. We have the now consolidated Showcase mode, which this year tells the Women's Evolution, i.e. the long and exciting growth path that led the Four Horsewomen (Charlotte Flair, Sasha Banks, Becky Lynch and Bayley) from the NXT shows to the main event of WrestleMania, legitimizing the women's division after decades of clear and evident disparity. A progression that takes the form of a pleasant mix of interviews with the wrestlers and matches of great importance. However, this is not the only story mode available: there is also a Towers mode dedicated to the career of Roman Reigns, one of the two cover athletes, which retraces the wrestler's most important matches from his debut with the Shield to the title runs, also here interspersed with interesting interviews and testimonials. However, you have to deal with the classic rule that, in the event of a game over, you have to start all over again. There is also no shortage of classic Towers, to further consolidate this specific content of the game. Then there's My Player, a long career with original characters to be created through the editor: this time it's a boy and a girl, Tre and Red, two friends who remember their climb to success in the WWE during the induction ceremony Hall of Fame, therefore at the end of their professional life. As has become tradition, the story finds space inside and outside the ring, there are valuable interventions by real superstars but also many shortcomings both on the narrative and on the realization front: if the the idea was to create a parallel with the story mode of NBA 2K, let's say that there is still a long, long way to go. The now traditional Universe allows you to program entire seasons between weekly shows and pay-per-views, putting yourself in the booker's shoes and managing a flood of parameters, determining turn faces and heels, assigning titles and creating the card for each single event. Speaking of options, the aforementioned editor is as usual very rich and allows you to create your own superstars at will and then share them with the community. As far as the online sector is concerned, this time too it is problematic, unable to connect to a combat system based on instantaneous counterattacks which, at the first episode of excessive latency, go down the drain. Finally, there is also the possibility of trying your hand at free matches, enriched by dozens of different stipulations (which obviously include the Royal Rumble, pair or handicap matches, tournaments and so on), by an enormous amount of possible scenarios (even vintage , complete with a non-optimal television reception effect) and from a roster that this year exceeds 150 characters, not counting those that will be added with the DLC. Speaking of post-launch content, there is great curiosity about the four WWE 2K Originals packs, which will add not only new superstars but also and above all bizarre settings, such as the one inspired by Halloween. Gameplay WWE 2K20 is the latest episode of a series that has been embarking on a controversial path for some time now, trying to offer a simulation transposition of a show that in reality has little or nothing realistic, as we all know it is choreographed fights; of a story that is built through promos and segments that have the purpose of creating expectation and which is therefore resolved in the ring, in the context of one or more matches. We have just explained the concept of feud in the world of wrestling, but it is an element that Yuke's has never really been able to translate into gameplay, given the turn that the franchise has taken for years now, made up of characters who move less easily than a tank and bizarre dynamics, which prevent you from crafting a meeting that starts and ends exactly as in one of theWWE shows. The problems of the game therefore come from afar and end up being emphasized by the commercial obligation of the annual release, especially in the face of an organization that gives the idea of ~just getting by~ rather than really wanting to renew the product. The last big news of WWE 2K dates back to a few years ago, when the graphics engine was enhanced, after which we plunged again into a limbo made up of simple roster updates and modes that seem to have been created with the same editor that is made available of players, considering the lack of attention paid to everything that happens outside the ring. The interesting thing is that the first impact with WWE 2K20 is actually positive: the Visual Concepts guys understood that it made no sense to use triggers in the context of an immediate counter system, given the systematic slowness of that type of input, and so they revolutionized the controls making them, in our opinion, much more sensible. Therefore, counterattacks are activated by pressing the Triangle button and, in general, the main buttons on the controller are used to execute blows and moves that they change depending on the pressure intensity and the direction of the analog stick: a quick tap on the Square and our character throws a punch, a long press and he delivers a charged blow that knocks the opponent down, for example. The same applies for the moves: with a quick pressure we carry out maneuvers that generally see us dance around the other wrestler, with hip toss or something like that, while with a prolonged pressure we lift him up for a suplex, a back breaker, a neck breaker and etc. Unfortunately, this positive desire to put things right a bit collides with a series of important critical issues, such as a collision detection that is to say the least problematic and a coupling system that works inconsistently. Added to this are the defects that the franchise has been carrying around for a lifetime now: the excessive woodiness and the absolute lack of agility of the characters (who still move like tanks), a cumbersome environmental interaction, an excessive use of quick time events that breaks a lot the rhythm of the action and a bizarre artificial intelligence, which often breaks the eggs in the basket when one actually tries to reproduce the dynamics of a normal WWE match. Playstation 4 trophies The fifty-two WWE 2K20 Trophies are particularly varied and range from the many possibilities offered by such a large structure. Many achievements are tied to specific actions, such as escaping a cage for the first time, completing a tower, performing a finisher after payback, breaking free from a submission hold, and so on. Technical realization The most sore point in the experience offered by WWE 2K20 lies in the technical sector, plagued not only by an evident and inexplicable downgrade compared to the previous episodes but also, as written at the beginning, by a terrifying amount of glitches that affect the game from a visual point of view but also and above all from that of the gameplay. Some bugs sometimes make it impossible to complete matches and/or perform the maneuvers necessary to complete the required objectives: a particularly frustrating aspect, even more so when it forces you to repeat certain sequences. There are several unrecognizable characters, and we are not referring to the now established (and inevitable) distance between the stars of the first magnitude and the midcarders. The women's division, in particular, highlights highly fluctuating designs, which confirm how this part of the roster was not yet ready to end up in the spotlight of the main game mode. The sensation, beyond some more valuable effects, is therefore that of being faced with a very dated production, which makes some improvements only on the audio commentary front, actually more varied than in the past.", "date": "2019-11-01", "grade": "5.0"}
