Few doubts and many certainties With which approach is it right to test a masterpiece fully enjoyed thanks to the old Nintendone? Is it correct to emphasize the premature aging of a title which, even if it currently seems prehistoric, dates back only to 2000, or to highlight its merits and how much it actually characterized subsequent productions? These are legitimate questions that we actually prefer not to answer, having fully enjoyed the Rare title at the time of its release, we prefer to face this reissue as a tribute to a masterpiece, fully enjoyable even now and it's a pity if someone turns up their noses, our only regret it just goes back to the past and the fact that there was no online multiplayer back then. Taking a step back Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter that puts us in Joanna Dark's shoes, younger players will have known the heroine thanks to Perfect Dark Zero, one of the first titles available when the Xbox 360 was released and which represents the prequel to Perfect Dark. Joanna Dark, also called Perfect Dark for her skills as an agent, works for the Carrington Institute and aims to unmask the dark plots of the rival corporation, DataDyne. The plot is much more complicated and compelling than that (so much so that it probably wins hands down against many of the current games) but we leave you the pleasure of discovering it. Set up as a first person shooter, Joanna uses many different weapons to make her way through the 9 available missions. From simple pistols equipped with silencers, to machine guns to accessories that allow her to make herself invisible. Many actions that the most savvy players use even in current games find their foundations in Perfect Dark, such as damaging light sources or dressing up to go unnoticed. But these are just some examples, most of the time the action is king and the firefights are inevitable. In this, the automatic aiming system helps which, however, ends up making us almost only spectators, much better the manual system with the controls on the joypad which, if desired, can be set like those of Halo and Call of Duty. The maps in which we find ourselves acting are very varied and the different levels put us in front of both claustrophobic structures and wide open spaces. In reality, the game action in the way fps are organized today is much less guided, only the basic information on health and number of shots from the weapons being present on the screen. Exploration is sometimes difficult, the areas are vast and you have to control every millimeter to be able to advance in the adventure and forget about any type of checkpoint. Depending on the level of challenge chosen, the objectives change and in Agent Perfect mode they become particularly difficult. Xbox 360 goals To get the 200 achievements we will have to sweat a lot. The points up for grabs are divided into 20 different objectives ranging from completing the adventure on all three different difficulties to participating in challenges in the Fighting Simulator. It is necessary to play while having a look at the objectives otherwise some may be missed, such as destroying the Carrington wines or using the laptop as a turret. Multiplayer In addition to the single player which is exactly like the original adventure, the big news is the presence of online multiplayer matches, in reality, as in the original game, it is possible to play together even with the shared screen. In 2000 on N64 the game via internet was impossible and now the developers have been able to go wild proposing many maps for the fun via Xbox Live for up to 8 players. All the historical maps are present plus some taken from Golden Eye (another Rare masterpiece and of which P.D. was a real sequel at least on the gameplay front). There is also a cooperative mode thanks to which it is possible to face the whole adventure together with a friend. We certainly cannot say that there are few irons in the fire. From the point of view of the restyling, it is immediately evident how much the work done by the developers is a real tribute to the effort made in 2000 by Rare. Not only from a graphic point of view, but the approach to the game itself hasn't changed, of course there have been adjustments to the stability of the graphics engine which is now fluid at 60 frames per second and to the control system now partially modified to allow control via the two analog sticks. As for the part strectly graphics, high definition has been implemented, the textures and also the number of polygons have been improved but all this just to make a product that is and remains clearly linked to the past a little more current. Seeing how ~sparse~ of polygons the gun of the protagonist is a bit impressive, as is hearing all the characters speak without them opening their mouths or the remastered but obviously retro music, all this is on the one hand tenderness and on the other it makes clear will to pay homage to a great game.", "date": "2010-04-01", "grade": "7.5"}
