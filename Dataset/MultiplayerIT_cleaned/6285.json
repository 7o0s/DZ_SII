Don't be scared, because we actually played it a lot more. Indeed, less. Making a rough estimate, we were active for a couple of hours maximum, with daily sessions of a few minutes. Sometimes for a few seconds. Yet we never closed it for days and days. Indeed, we have closed it several times. Many times ... unfortunately it plays alone. Too bad that with the PC off, Steam doesn't count the game time, otherwise the hours would be much more. Practically none, since nothing is done. But do you want to put? Clicker Heroes is a free-to-play clicker game released on Steam a few weeks ago that quickly rose to the top of user preference charts. Played and loved, as much as despised, it revises the concept of progression in video games by linking it only to time. Explaining it is not difficult. On the left of the screen is the heroes panel, on the right the monsters panel. The first hireable hero, Cid, The Helpful Adventurer, is the clicker hero, i.e. the one that does damage when you left-click on the monster. Other hireable heroes damage enemies on their own, continuously draining their energy. Their DPS (damage per second) stacks, so they join forces against tougher foes. Each hero has special abilities that are unlocked as they level up. Usually they are used to multiply the DPS, but there are also special ones such as those that increase Cid's DPS, or others that increase that of the entire parterre. By killing monsters you get money, the money is used to hire ever more powerful heroes and to buy skills. More powerful heroes allow you to progress through the levels and face even more powerful enemies, such as bosses, which give you more money. Money allows you to hire even more powerful heroes and so on. The progression of monsters and heroes is initially arithmetic, but soon becomes geometric making the various thresholds longer to reach. It doesn't matter, because you can't die. The increased power of the monsters simply means more time to take them down, which reduces the coins collected and makes the overall progression slower. Bosses have a time limit in which to kill them and have much more energy than other monsters. But that's all. Another dose We realize that from the description Clicker Heroes seems very complex, but in reality it's really very simple, to the point that after a little practice you can progress practically without even starting it. Yes, because our heroes continue to beat up monsters and collect money even in our absence. So soon the only goal to pursue becomes to grow the group to the point of being able to leave it to accumulate gold while we sleep or do something else. Then you reconnect, spend your accumulated amount, advance, and go back to ignoring Clicker Heroes. Once a certain hero, Amenhotep, has been unlocked, a skill can be purchased that allows you to reset the game, however, yielding Hero Souls, which can be spent to summon the Ancients, essentially other bonuses. If you want you can be even more active and click continuously for hours and hours. This is certainly the fastest method to advance, but also the most time consuming. To speed up a bit you can use active skills, i.e. those that must be used knowingly and have a cooling time before they can be used again. In general, however, improving passive damage yields more in terms of gonad resistance, since if Clicker Heroes were to be judged by its playful part well, it would be really difficult to find one. Basically we are faced with a mathematical equation that satisfies the player by giving him the illusion of growth that does not actually exist. Clicker Heroes, like all drugs, is addictive and addictive. We have reviewed it. Addiction and perversion There are also other ways to speed up the growth process - buds. Gems can be obtained in two ways: by clicking on birds that occasionally appear in the game, or by spending real money. The first mode is obviously the longest, while the second gives the best results. What can you buy with gems? Coins, Golden Heroes (permanent bonuses to a single hero's DPS), or resetting the game with nine bonus Hero Souls. But the ultimate goal? Move forward in the levels, grow, grow, grow. Yes, basically it's a meaningless game, in which all you do is uselessly accumulate resources in the illusion that the next step will give you a minimum of satisfaction, a satisfaction that never comes. Someone defiwould think Clicker Heroes a drug and in fact its structure, like that of all Clickers, aims precisely at creating a state of addiction in which every step forward seems to distance the goal, finally making it evanescent, almost useless in the economy of what you do. The developers have promised to gradually add new content. More heroes? Stronger bosses? More levels? New Ancients? Maybe. It doesn't matter, actually, because already as it is it works very well. It's the classic horrendous and empty game from which you can't get away from it, except with an immense effort of will.", "date": "2015-06-04", "grade": "5.0"}
