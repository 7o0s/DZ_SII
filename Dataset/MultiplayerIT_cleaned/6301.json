{"name": "Survivor!.io", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/survivorio-recensione.html", "text": "It almost seemed like a joke and instead the single stick shooter genre is actually catching on on mobile. We are talking about extremely immediate shooters, which are controlled with just one thumb, used to move the character while he automatically shoots at the closest target. Well, the guys at Gorilla Game Studio have taken this formula and declined it within the traditional zombie invasion, a post-apocalyptic scenario that nevertheless remains incidental, in the background, while in the foreground there is nothing but the action. With some flaws? With some flaws. We talk about it in the review of Survivor!.io. Gameplay: shoot as you go Survivor!.io, the protagonist surrounded by zombies The gameplay of Survivor!.io is very simple, and it couldn't be otherwise. Within a rather anonymous map, our character must survive increasingly consistent and tough waves of enemies, starting with rather fragile creatures and continuing with resistant mutants, undead dogs, birds of ill omen and finally big and bad bosses .The basic concept is to move, avoid attacks and let the automatic aiming system do its job, but at the same time trying to collect as many fragments as possible and raising a bar that allows you to choose each time you fill an upgrade among different possibilities: additional bullets, missiles, bombs of various kinds, drones that fire homing bursts, rotating discs (essential!) and then again improvements in health, resistance, damage and speed. It continues to grow and gradually becomes more competitive, but the enemies become so many, to the point that the action turns into a sort of bullet hell and it becomes really difficult to avoid taking damage. If we then consider that each of the thirty levels available for the campaign requires you to survive numerous waves and bosses in order to be complicated, some clear balancing problems emerge. The point is that the well-stocked game store, with its many microtransactions, pushes to think that the developers voluntarily opted for such a high degree of challenge, prompting users to purchase packs, coins and action energy. Yes, there's also the one to limit our attempts, with the usual indicator that reloads over time or by watching advertising trailers. Technical realization: too simple? Survivor!.io, always the protagonist surrounded by zombies The short introductory sequence of Survivor!.io suggests a minimal style a la Among Us which then materializes in the game action, perhaps exaggerating a little. There are many characters on the screen, but thanks to the ~aseptic~ background and the lack of reactions based on the blows, one has the clear sensation of being faced with simple moving objects, which interact without adequate rendering of weights and impacts On the sound side, the thing is handled in a discreet way, the music involves, but they remain a bit in the background compared to the effects, which in many cases also serve to understand when a certain blow will arrive, when the blades will begin to turn around us and we will be able therefore venture a crossing among the zombies otherwise impossible.", "date": "2022-08-28", "grade": "7.5"}
