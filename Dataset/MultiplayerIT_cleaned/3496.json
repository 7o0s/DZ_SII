The developers of Open Lab Games started from this far from obvious question to give life to Football Drama. The small local reality has tried to focus on the sport most loved by Italians from a diametrically different perspective compared to the one we are now used to experimenting with themed titles such as PES, FIFA or Football Manager. At the basis of the project, born from an idea by Pietro Polsinelli, there is an exploration that essentially goes beyond the football competition itself, with its economic interests, the controversial passions of the curves and the tantrums of the transfer market. On the contrary, Football Drama originates from an in-depth study of the literature referring to the world of football, also thanks to the contribution of authors such as Pier Paolo Pasolini and Umberto Saba and cinematographic influences such as the Forgotten Mundial (2011) and Prima del Calcio di Rigore (1972 ). All these ideas therefore served as a springboard for the creation of a strategic detail with a football background, in which the trend of an entire season can vary on the basis of the choices made by the player on and off the field. If the idea appeals to you, all you have to do is continue in our review of Football Drama to find out more. A football-themed strategy game Seven long years have passed since Mr. Rocco Galliano abruptly left the scene. The spotlight on the Marseille coach suddenly went out, the press seems to have quickly forgotten about him, but the man still retains a glimmer of hope to get back on top and return to his old glories. The opportunity comes when Boris Aluminovitch, wealthy president of Calchester FC, decides to entrust him with the leadership of his team in search of redemption after a disappointing season. Thus begins an eighteen-day championship journey, during which the protagonist will have to do his best to try and bring his new formation to conquer the Thiefa League championship, possibly trying to keep his name high and not end up sadly in the list of illustrious exemptions. In Football Drama you don't physically descend on the pitch to control your players. Game management is entrusted to an interface that regulates the progress of the match by pressing simple buttons. During the possession phases it is possible to decide whether to limit oneself to managing the ball through the ~Control~ function, waiting for a more propitious opportunity to strike, or whether to launch the formation forward by selecting the ~Risk~ button. Once you get close to the opponent's area, the two alternatives include going to the shot by performing a solo action or doing all you can for team play in an attempt to bag the ball into the net. On the other hand, when the game is in the hands of the opposing formation, it becomes necessary to decide whether to limit oneself to marking or to run into conflict with the risk of getting a card, while in the most delicate moments it is necessary to choose whether to lean towards passive or active defence. To enrich this rather basic game setting we find a system linked to the management of action cards that can be selected before the start of each match. Each of them basically corresponds to indications given by Galliano himself to his boys to try to unlock the inertia of the match with tricks that can more or less be correct. Ideas such as increasing pressure in midfield, passing the ball to the most talented in the formation, tiki-taka and changing formation, but also simulating non-existent fouls or looking for a fight to waste time, just to name a few. This range of alternatives varies and extends throughout the season, also by virtue of the fact that by forfeiting results new opportunities can be activated from the available deck. Before the match it is possible to select the training of one's formation on the basis of some predefined alternatives. This choice will affect the team's form and propensities in the attack and defense phases, also giving bonuses related to values such as Karma and Kaos, which are constantly kept track of during the game. When Galliano is not sitting on the bench, there is also a sketchy system of dialogues with multiple choices which in turn influence the coach's relations with some key subjects such as journalists and the club president. In some phases of the season, however, it will happen to come across unsavory characters who will not bother to tempt the coach with easy shortcuts such as doping or bribing referees, orpurely opportunistic actions such as football betting. As much as the concept behind Football Drama seemed interesting to us, the realization on balance reveals a series of obvious gaps. The main one is undoubtedly linked to the depth of the game structure: since it is a strategic title we would have expected a greater depth as regards the range of indications and strategies imparted to one's team. On the contrary, the system of choices proposed by the game was poor in variants despite the presence of action cards and winning games seemed all too easy. Taking into account the narrative context and the weight that the choices should have on the narrative progression, it would have been reasonable to also expect a better variety of dialogues, which instead turn out to be particularly repetitive, especially when interfacing with journalists in the post game or with the patron of Calchester. Also the management of the commentary is not in focus, characterized by superfluous and very repetitive comments that unnecessarily break the rhythm of the game.", "date": "2019-09-16", "grade": "6.0"}
