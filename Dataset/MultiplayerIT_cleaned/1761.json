{"name": "Ritorno ad Omaha Beach", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ritorno-ad-omaha-beach.html", "text": "After the film adaptation of the ~landing~, in ~Saving Private Ryan~, also the series distributed by EA, taking its cue from the film, paid homage to D-Day. What perhaps not everyone knows is that both for the filmmaking and for the videogame one, a lot of research has been done with the real protagonists. Based on the testimonies of old veterans, EA has managed to transpose the tension, fear and above all the feelings of bewilderment. The feelings mentioned above were ~protagonists~ in those moments, increasing the charm of the plot thanks to details known only by those who were on the front line that day. Like many games that have already appeared, Medal of Honor puts its trump card on cooperation. All the missions which are 19 overall, are divided into two parts, to succeed through these missions you will have to cooperate with your team. Initially everything will be focused on cover and mutual aid not covering your companions or simply trying to do it yourself if not requested will have only one outcome, the failure of the mission. Medal of honor lands on Xbox! As already mentioned, this game is multi-platform, in fact, it is present on all the latest generation consoles. The transposition box does not present major changes compared to the Ps2 and Gamecube versions, the graphic styling of the three versions is almost identical. The graphics sector has some flaws not at the level of Xbox's own graphics capabilities. You can also forget the stylistic glories of Halo in this game, I want to clarify it, but the plot, setting and some ingenious gimmick present in the game will still make you appreciate this title. The engine implemented in the version presanta Texture of a fair level but without excelling, despite this the models of the characters are executed with skill, despite the amount of polygons used is certainly not exceptional. Unfortunately, as often happens, this graphic research would be fine for Ps2 titles but for Xbox, this graphic sector could have been much more complex. The use of Bump Mapping has not been made as in the title of the Lies, in fact, you will notice as you approach walls and other objects that these do not have multiple texture levels but will go into detail. The characters are very well done. As happened in the previous episodes, the stylistic research done on the uniforms and on the characters is remarkable and very accurate, helmets and all the accessories of the soldiers are made with care like the physical differences. The reconstruction of the locations is recreated taking cues from Saving Private Ryan and other films such as the longest day. Leaving for the first mission, you will savor in person in every little detail, what Tom Hanks lived in the film. During the landing at Omaha Beach, in fact, you will be seized by the same bewilderment thanks to independent movements of the camera and with the support of vibration. All this will make the final result very likely. The carefully recreated city settings are also very beautiful, the digital counterparts of buildings dismembered and destroyed by bombing, which will become effective hiding places or strategic points from which to attack the enemy. The polygonal models of the weapons are very well done, recreated in a superb, almost obsessive way. The xbox controller lends itself as in the past to this type of game and as happens in other titles of the green X, you will not suffer from the absence of a mouse, in fact the commands are perfectly calibrated and precise. The enlargement of the firing range compared to the PC version will make up for the decentralization of shooting that often occurs with the pad. The sound is epic, everything fully returns to the real sounds, voiceovers, shots and explosions take advantage of Dolby Digital ensuring a total envelopment of the sound and total immersion in the battle. The Multiplayer mode is valid, you can play in 4 with split screen, dividing the two teams, two will be allies and the two remaining the Nazis. Unfortunately, this title does not support the upcoming Live, so the multiplayer part will tend to tire you after a short time. The magic of Medal of Honor This EA title, as I have already described in the course of the review, is well made, but unfortunately suffers graphically from a graphics sector that does little to exploit the Xbox potential. In fact, many of the players could turn up their noses at this title which could offer more aesthetically, but which fortunately offers a great impact as a game play. Single mode will ensure hours and hours of fun. The sore points come in Multiplayer which with only four players does not ensure a longevity that with Live support would have been almost infinite. In short, the game, drawing conclusions, ensures hours and hours of fun and is presented as a valid alternative for those who are ~tired~ of eradicating Covenant. A strong point of Medal of Honor: frontline is the story taken from real events in the Second World War, which, like few others, knows how to fascinate and retrace moments of world historical memory. We are facing a game that certainly has no equal, which will be remembered not as a great title but, certainly, a game that offers a realistic experience like few others. I would recommend this title to all Xbox owners, not only to First Shooter person enthusiasts, but also to all those who demand something more from a title. D-Day also for Xbox On June 6, 1944, Eisenhower addresses all soldiers, airmen and sailors. That these do not launch the assault of the Norman coasts we will accept only the total victory. Good luck to all and we implore Almighty God's blessing for this great and noble enterprise~. At 6.00 the operation called ~Overlord~ began, with her the hopes of saving the world from the Nazi menace that had already claimed too many victims. These arguments get lost among dozens and dozens of books and films because they are part of human historical heritage, clearly even the video game world did not take long to pay homage to the Normandy landings and the post D-Day events. The Medal of honor, was released for the first time on PlayStation in the form of First Shooting Person, managing to involve players emotionally speaking, in the facts of World War 2. Clearly this game has been transposed to next generation consoles.", "date": "2003-02-12", "grade": null}
