Clearly it wouldn't be a problem if missions on paper that were very varied but in practice all the same were based on a fun and well-crafted control system: even if we had to spend 90% of our time punching, we'd be happy if this would give us adrenaline rushes and fun! Wiimote and Nunchuck are well exploited and it is clear that the game was built around the control system and not vice versa: moving around the city has different methods but the one that immediately catches the eye is the ~slinging~ between a skyscraper and the another so typical of Spider-Man, who throws his cobwebs on buildings and on any solid surface to use them as lianas and move in the concrete jungle like Tarzan did in the real one: on Wii the two arms correspond to the remote control and the Nunchuck and we will have to shake them in turn to carry out the action. The system also features refinements such as analog stick control, rapid and abrupt change of direction depending on where you point the arm and increasing speed by pressing A (or alternatively a more complex but also more fun system), and is therefore not very immediate, but it is undoubtedly the best feature of the game. If already with a normal joypad in previous titles it was fun to go around the city in this way, here we reach peaks of fun as high as the Empire State Building, just to stay on topic, and you will hardly get tired of swinging happily between a tower block and the 'other! All the other acrobatics are implemented in a more traditional way but theoretically, once you become familiar with the control system, putting together a series of spectacular movements, climbs, acrobatics should be a feast for the eyes and for the arms, but unfortunately everything is often undermined by implementation flaws or by real bugs, such as an extremely capricious camera that can make climbing sessions frustrating. Swish! Pim! Pum! Pam! The other great branch of Spiderman's movements is that concerning combat; benefits from the system of enhancements described above which, over time, puts at your disposal numerous actions: you will thus be able to ring together increasingly elaborate combos (series of light and fast blows plus a devastating final punch), confuse your opponent by whirling around him, perform spectacular flying attacks, or even trapping it in your web and then spinning it like a rodeo or throwing it into the air and making it crash to the ground with a crash, also damaging its cronies, all, of course, by moving Wiimote and Nunchuck as it should. The combat is therefore extremely varied and would thus solve the problem of missions that are always the same, were it not that here too we find ourselves faced with a summary execution of excellent ideas: collisions with enemies, for example, leave something to be desired as there does not seem to be a criterion logical for distinguishing cases in which one attack will be successful and another will not, web attacks are great fun as long as everything runs smoothly but often Spiderman frees himself from the opponent trapped in the web when you really wanted to have some fun, and in general it can simply happen that sometimes the game does not respond to your requests, a sign of a very inaccurate testing and debugging phase. The dynamics linked to the black costume also become part of the combat system: unlike the other next-gen versions, here you will come into possession of the symbiote very soon and you can decide to use it when you want, even if for short periods of time to avoid that takes possession of your will. It's a sort of berserk mode which makes you more powerful and dynamic, but which prevents you from using the upgrades acquired during the game and from accumulating experience: ultimately, if you have the patience to unlock enough new moves, the red Spiderman will end up with being more powerful and versatile than the black one, making the use of the latter a simple, very charismatic divertissement, but nothing more. The Big Apple is pretty green Connecting to the initial speech on blockbusters, Spiderman 3 should present a technical / stylistic department at the highest levels, given due considerations on the hardware potential of the Wii. In fact, the engine at least plans to exploit some of the features of the console, it is perhaps the first time for a third-party game, we see. First of all, the streaming of the city should be commended: as you cross the huge urban area you will not even notice the loads that the game also carries out; it's a total technologyby now not brand new, but here implemented with mastery. The main character is well modeled and animated, and in the interiors, rich in details and with excellent textures but unfortunately very few during the game, the engine maintains a very decent fluidity. The amount of polygons on the screen in the exteriors, full of tower blocks, passers-by and cars, as well as the textures of Spider-Man, moreover embellished with vaguely next-gen light effects, are also commendable. The music is that of the film, therefore of quality, and the dubbing, Italian, is excellently done by the film's dubbers themselves; moreover, it is also well written and often draws more than a smile. even graphics and sound seem like a colossal hymn to the I wanted but I couldn't The Big Apple is pretty green A technical picture only positive, then? Not at all, unfortunately, and like everything we have discussed so far, the graphics and sound also seem like a colossal ode to the I wanted but I couldn't: the price to pay for streaming the city is a pop-up of polygons and textures of the skyscrapers that it has sensational in some cases and above all a highly inconstant framerate, as well as textures which, apart from some very sporadic cases, are dirty and opaque, and all the characters that are not the protagonist are modeled with few polygons, equipped with few routines of animation and with the usual low quality textures; finally, the music is repetitive. All in all, however, graphics and sound would be able to snatch enough because the overall effect is positive, but huge and scandalous bugs come into play, not so much because they compromise the game, but because they are really so many and there is no situation where check it out: we've already talked about the whimsical camera but how about, to begin with, the inhabitants who cheerfully pass among the trucks parked on the street? Of recovered hostages who at the end of the mission magically transform into normal passers-by, changing their appearance, clothes and often even their gender? Of the same hostages who sincerely thank you when you rescue them and then thank you again, but this time in a completely different voice and tone? Or even a mission that you can't complete because you wanted to throw the last villain into the water, with whom you would have to talk to move on to something else? He's there amiably keeping himself afloat, but as soon as you enter the water you are magically brought back to the mainland, so how do you do it? We should ask whoever took care of the testing It is also evident to the eyes of an inexperienced player: the main lack of Spiderman 3 lies in a testing and debugging phase which to define as not very thorough would be an understatement. It is clear that the VVs have been forced to release a game that cannot be defined as ready, to take advantage of the momentum of the film's release, and it is a huge pity because the only real structural flaw of the game is the lack of variety of lots of side missions. All in all, in fact, we are faced with a playable and well-structured product: the power-up system, the main plot, the desire to eliminate the criminal scum and the dynamics of slinging could also exert such a charm on you as to push you to complete the title, but the very little attention devoted to the final stages of production remains an absolutely unforgivable lack of consideration towards the player, and it is only for this reason that, in the end, Spiderman 3 for Wii, a title that could have been much more , is essentially rejected.Pros The slinging is exceptional, the moves very varied. Streaming of the city well implemented. Excellently structured. Cons. Graphically crude. Side missions not at all varied. Powered by Wii While the life of the Wii goes on with successes that until recently were completely unpredictable, it is normal to gradually leave behind the first phase of study by external software houses which consisted, more often than not, in tons of porting from other consoles with disappointing graphics and controls perhaps from good intuitions but from fluctuating realization. Spiderman 3, on the other hand, is a product built, from the first design phase, around the Nintendo console, in all respects. Vicarious Visions, who not surprisingly did not deal with the X360 and PS3 versions, created their own vision with the Wii in mind and for once it can be said that it is the PS2 game that shares its structure, a represent the port with poor graphics and botched controls, but that's another story. The main plot of the game, which also includes many side missions, is inspired by that of the film even if with necessaryand evident licenses here and there: basically we are faced with a Spiderman/Peter Parker who is very much in love with his MJ but who, given that happiness does not last forever in the movies exactly like in real life, soon finds himself facing the challenge greatest of his career, the one against his own dark side brought to light by a symbiotic alien entity who gives him a new, very intriguing black costume, so much more power but also so much wickedness, which will soon become difficult to control... Spiderman 3, on the other hand, is a product built, from the first design phase, around the Nintendo console, in all respects. Powered by Wii The game is structured around missions in a truly enormous New York, twice that of Spiderman 2, and which can be explored, in the exteriors, in absolute freedom by properly exploiting the powers ~given~ to Peter by the small radioactive spider that is at the origin of his epic. The missions are really many and are divided into different types: first of all we have those of the main storyline, which follows the story of the film, the only ones that interest us if what we want to do is only ~complete~ the title; once one is completed, the next one will be made available in a point conveniently indicated on the screen, all held together by computer graphic films of not exceptional workmanship. However, in this way we would miss at least half, probably more, of what Spiderman 3 has to offer: in fact, several criminal gangs operate in New York and compete with each other and with the police for control of the territory; Spiderman will be able to check the current situation on the map at any time to possibly decide to break the eggs in the basket of the bad guys and deliver that particular area to the police, or go to an area already controlled by the agents but which presents some problems and thus strengthen its safety. It is almost essential to perform tasks of this kind from time to time: in doing so, not only will the judgments that citizens have of you, which they express aloud without causing problems, improve hand in hand with the increase in security in the city, but above all you will gain the experience necessary to acquire new combat moves, new acrobatic skills and generally improve your superhero qualities, through an RPG-like system exclusive to this surprisingly deep, elaborate and successful version. Valuable experience is also bestowed by the ~challenge~ missions, which will see you show off your stunts in an attempt to improve a timed record, as well as by the police calls that you will occasionally intercept with your spider senses and which you can decide to listen to, thus solving a small or major crime just committed in the area you are currently patrolling. The dish therefore seems very rich, unfortunately, however, you could get bored very soon since, excluding the main plot which provides different types and different interactions with the game, the many secondary missions are limited to a sterilely reductive routine which consists in beating the bad guys, lots of bad guys, taking out a bomb every now and then and rescuing a few hostages here and there, and then going back to beating up the bad guys. What is a blockbuster? A blockbuster is a product of the entertainment industry, be it a film, a record, a book and for some time now also a video game, shot, composed, written and programmed specifically to be a success, to meet the tastes of the widest possible public in order to generate dizzying monetary returns and profits and to deeply mark a page of what we commonly call popular culture. A blockbuster must therefore be immediate, easy, fast, never boring, always spectacular, and it is for this reason that there will always be a segment of the public who will snub a product of this kind with a little annoyance, considering it not very suitable for stimulating their synapses evidently accustomed to a much different depth. Legitimate, but a mistake not to be made absolutely is to fail to recognize that behind the production of every blockbuster there are real geniuses, who know how to read, interpret and direct like no sociologist what ~people~ really think and want, and hard workers, who work hard to ensure that their little child is as close to perfection as possible. A blockbuster, therefore, is also and above all a product of great quality: Spiderman 3, the film, is certainly a blockbuster; the video game was born to be, but does it succeed?", "date": "2007-05-18", "grade": null}
