The first concerns the amazing care with which the cities of Florence, Venice, Forl and San Gimignano have been reproduced on screen, truly majestic and worthy of being explored and ~lived~ even just for the simple pleasure of doing so. The second concerns the gameplay, which despite the introduction of some innovative elements has highlighted a series of not insignificant limitations, which tended to make the experience very repetitive, especially if you stubbornly completed all the secondary missions as well (for don't talk about feather picking!). However, the writer remains convinced of the absolute artistic and playful value of AC2, considering it, despite its shortcomings, a title to absolutely play. The deserved success of the game has led to the creation of numerous spin-offs in the portable field, the most interesting of which is probably Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines for PSP. However, even on the iPhone we were able to savor the fifteenth-century atmospheres that form the backdrop to the singular story of Ezio Auditore, thanks to Assassin's Creed II: Discovery, a good quality platform in which we took on the role of the young assassin in his quest for revenge and truth. The eye of the eagle Assassin's Creed II: Multiplayer therefore stands as a sort of ~spin-off of the spin-off~, sharing the scenario with AC2 but not the story, completely absent given that the gameplay is focused exclusively on online multiplayer. A feature that never proved to be problematic as in this case: published on the App Store for free in promotion, in its first revision the game had great difficulty connecting to the servers, even and above all in the presence of firewalls. To overcome the inconvenience, Ubisoft extended the promotion until recently, allowing all users to download the product for free, and subsequently released a patch that at least partially seems to have fixed things (although several people they claim the opposite, i.e. that the drawbacks arose with the update). Once the game has started, which requires a wi-fi connection to work, we can simply choose whether we want to host a game or join a match that is about to start. In the first case we have to select the scenario among the available ones (Carnival of Venice, Slums of Venice, Cathedral of Rome), then invite any friends to join the group or, in the absence of online acquaintances, wait for the arrival of three other players from from anywhere in the world. In the lobby it is not possible to chat or communicate in any way: as soon as the minimum number is reached (two, three or four players can play), the game begins. The mechanics are quite simple: within a ~round~ structure, our assassin must first obtain a commission and then attempt to complete it successfully to obtain a certain number of points. The mission, whether it's assassination or ~persuasion~, involves interacting with one of our fellow players, who will be our target for the moment. But how will we be able to identify it among so many people moving on the street? We have to rely on a sort of radar that shows us the correct direction, but also observe people's behavior to notice something different. If we hit an unsuspecting villager, we lose points and drop in the game rankings, so mistakes are allowed but they come at a high price. Once we understand who our target is, we can approach and ~touch~ him for the character to attack. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins. As you can easily imagine, Assassin's Creed II: Multiplayer really has nothing to do with the game we admired on consoles and PC. However, the developers have tried to insert as many visual references to the original work as possible, usually icons. Our assassin is equipped with weapons but can collect other interesting objects to take advantage of his opponents: bombs, smoke bombs and the ability to use the famous ~eagle eye~. Technically, a far from spectacular job was done: the choice to use the top view does not go well with any visual solution, the scenarios are too similar but above all the characters have limited and mediocre animation. The sound sector is definitely saved, given that it incorporates the splendid original music of AC2. The versiontested ion is 1.0.1 App Store links", "date": "2010-04-06", "grade": "5.8"}
