Although Parappa the Rapper is considered the first real rhythm game, the manifestations of this successful sub-genre have even come from the 70s, in the arcade. And they have also had appeal at home where they have contributed to spreading the controversial motion controllers and contaminating different genres, including shooters. But the relationship between melodies and gameplay has also followed another path, a path less traveled by the developers yet full of surprises. One of these, the first and probably the most important, is undoubtedly Loom, a particular LucasArts adventure, released on PC in 1990, whose gameplay is based on melodies to find and play in order to cast spells. A magical title and which in some ways we can consider as the true father of many modern experiences capable of integrating gameplay, narrative and the artistic sector without bothering to respect those action canons from which many genres seem unable to detach themselves. In many ways FRACT OSC follows the same path, even if it chooses a decidedly different setting, that of first-person exploratory adventures, with sounds light years away from those of Loom. FRACT OSC blends music, space and puzzles into an intense sensory experience A game that makes noise The aim of the player, in FRACT OSC, is to activate ancient sources of energy to give life to different musical mechanisms that produce increasingly complex sounds, activate other mechanisms and transform into bridges, elevators, teleporters and passages to new areas. Movement does not involve jumping and the only way to pass a puzzle is to locate it, press the right button to activate the interaction interface and then solve it. Given the setting, it is the quality of the puzzles that gives depth to the experience and from this point of view, we say it bluntly, the work of the developers is amazing. Each level is a gigantic puzzle divided into areas full of puzzles of all kinds. There are the classic circuits to close, but there are also puzzles related to articulated melodies that produce effects of various kinds on the surrounding environment. And it is here that an aesthetic component stands out whose apparent modesty is largely dictated by functional reasons. Indeed, after solving some puzzles it becomes evident how the relative poverty in terms of polygons and the absence of textures allow a good part of the huge levels to be observed as a whole, enjoying suggestive glimpses to say the least as they come to life between rays of light , energy beams and huge structures. The inspiration, declared, comes from the latest Tron and it is no coincidence that the sounds closely recall the work done by Daft Punk with the soundtrack of the Disney film. But the stylistic signature of the developers still stands out with precise choices that are reflected in the obvious references to those stylized but effective images that have characterized the highest points of three-dimensional videogame experimentation. Stairs and walkways are generated in real time, and with suggestive animations, under our feet while the background is populated by luminescent towers and while the ether is filled with powerful bass and evocative synthetic sonorities. Music and space come together in a decidedly intense and capable sensory experience, provided that the player's tastes match the style of the title, of enveloping and involving with great intensity. It's not the first experience of this kind, it won't be the last and maybe it's not even the best in the absolute sense. It could have been faster, even more varied, more open and more lively and it is absolutely not said that an important artistic sector should give up the narrative component. But FRACT OSC still manages to impress thanks to the ability to bring to the highest levels that imaginary made of floors that light up as you pass, of worlds that react to the protagonist's actions, of audiovisual symphonies with a ~Disney-like~ aftertaste that mix chaos and harmony, power and elegance. The Phosfiend Systems title manages, in essence, to touch the right strings and at this point there is nothing left to do but talk about the duration of the experience which depends a lot on the time taken to solve the puzzles. Well, avoiding the use of external guides and aids it is very likely that it will take at least 8 hours to complete it and that is a lot for a title that has passed through Greenlight and sold at the price of a DLC which gives us another surprise. In fact, by solving the various puzzles a large number of tones and sound effects are unlocked which are then available in the intuitive but quite complex music editor.", "date": "2014-04-22", "grade": "8.5"}
