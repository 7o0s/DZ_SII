{"name": "I Griffin - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/i-griffin-recensione.html", "text": "Family Guy: the tie-in After the numerous video games dedicated to the Simpsons, it was appropriate to give the Griffins an official transposition, which you can find in stores at a much lower price than normal, almost from Platinum. The game takes up the graphics of the cartoon and puts you in the shoes of the three most important characters, namely Peter Griffin (the father of the family), Stewie (the youngest son, who can barely walk but hides more than a surprise) and Brian (the house dog, more often than not the most reasonable Griffin), within levels that are inspired by some episodes of the series. In this case, the stages in which we will be driving Peter are a sort of scrolling fighting game, in the sense that we will mostly have to fight and make our way through numerous enemies with punches and kicks; driving Stewie, however, we will find ourselves in the middle of an action game with platform elements, and we will be able to shoot opponents using a laser gun; finally, the levels starring Brian boast numerous stealth elements, albeit placed in ways that leave little to the free choice of the player, who is forced to move through predefined paths. The internships with Brian are mostly stealth... The situations are taken verbatim from the TV series. Cel shaded graphics are not supported. much in movement. Gameplay and technical realization The obvious references to the graphic style of the cartoon, the original music and the original voices of the characters immediately make a good impression, especially if you are a fan of the cartoon. Unfortunately, however, the game soon reveals its numerous weaknesses, especially in terms of playability: whatever the nature of the stages, the mechanics quickly become repetitive and boring, also because there is no character ~growth~ system and the game design, in general, brings to mind the least successful tie-ins in history. Just think of the attack actions available: varying from one to another often doesn't make any difference, and even in some cases we are forced to throw a punch instead of a kick simply to make us understand that there isn't just one way to eliminate enemies. Honestly, completing Family Guy in these conditions becomes a complicated and daunting practice... The game comes with graphics that quite faithfully reproduce those of the cartoon, with the characters in cel shading. The end result, however, is anything but exciting: the developers could think of a better way to transport the Griffins in a polygonal environment. Nothing to say as regards the sound, however: the music and the voices are the original ones, accompanied by a series of effects that certainly do not exalt but neither do they clash in the general picture. Stewie owns a ray gun to take out enemies. A customized version of Exploring the Human Body... As Peter, you fight most of the time. Comment Family Guy is a game recommended only for those who do not want to spend the money necessary for a full-price title and are also a huge fan of the series. It is an ~anomalous~ product, which seems to have been designed for a very young target on the one hand (a game design that is not simplistic and repetitive to define) but which incorporates situations that are not very suitable for the little ones (unless it is advisable to jump on the stomach of pregnant women and see them shoot out children, aliens, bolts and missiles...). In short, there is really a lot, a lot of work to be done if this is the starting point for a Family Guy tie-in. Pros: Sound faithful to the cartoon Some situations taken from the series On sale at a reduced price Cons: Technically poor Very little playable Simplistic and monotonous game design Family Guy is available for GameCube, Xbox and PlayStation 2. The tested version is the PlayStation 2 version. If you've never seen an episode of ~Family Guy~, well, it's time to fix it. The series created by Seth McFarlane along the lines of The Simpsons demonstrates from the very first episodes that it lives a life of its own, made up of absolutely incorrect jokes and quotations galore. Truly a very funny and ~bad~ cartoon, the last season of which was broadcast in Italy at prohibitive times due to the presence of scenes and topics that are not very suitable for children.", "date": "2007-03-14", "grade": null}
