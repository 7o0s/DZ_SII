{"name": "Overcooked! 2: Surf 'n' Turf", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/overcooked-2-surf-n-turf-recensione-dlc.html", "text": "Overcooked! 2 is one of those titles in which the more content there is, the better it is: Ghost Town Games knows it well, and that is why, a couple of months after the improbable culinary party game, it has decided to go back to the already excellent work carried out, enriching it with new materials. Overcooked! 2 - Surf 'n' Turf is the first DLC of Overcooked 2, and according to the quantity of content we enjoyed and the quality of the same, it is difficult to think that it will also be the last: new additions are welcome that encourage you to come back valid titles now left aside. Are you ready to go back to cooking with your friends? This time you will also have to bring your sunglasses and a pair of flip flops, because you go to the beach. Gameplay: a real expansion Overcooked! 2 - Surf 'n' Turf is a thematic expansion of the game published by Team17: it offers a certain amount of related content, including new levels, a new setting, new dishes and new characters, but all strictly with a tropical and holiday theme. Imagine the base game that you have already enjoyed for many hours in the company of your friends (or online), but set in a resort by the sea or directly on the beach: that's Overcooked! 2 - Surf 'n' Turf. After all, we have already seen enough of unlikely situations in the Overcooked review! 2: do you remember all the narrative events related to the invasion of Pane Malfermo? It was a simple starting point to then venture into the various levels, and above all into their kitchens: the same happens in the first Overcooked DLC! 2. Once the zombie parenthesis of the main story is over, our chefs are exiled together with the King of the Onion Kingdom to a seaside resort: a captivity all too similar to a well-deserved vacation after so many worries. But true chefs never rest, and visiting a new region means learning how to prepare local dishes as soon as possible. And that's how Overcooked! 2 - Surf 'n' Turf shows its nature as an expansion of the main game: it offers the same gameplay experience without innovating almost anything, apart from a couple of level design ideas such as a water sprayer to wash dishes on the fly from a distance . After all, what could or should he invent, being an expansion? The amount of content offered and the variations put in place are already more than enough to motivate the purchase, especially considering the very low price for the entire package. Access Surf 'n' Turf from the Overcooked main menu! 2 is not particularly intuitive, and this is the only real complaint that we feel like making to the developers. Loading up our old game we find ourselves in the main game world, but a quick tour of the surroundings with our trusty caravan immediately reveals the harsh reality of things: that's not where the DLC is. Rather, it will be necessary to go to the main game menu, select the ~extras~ item and then start a new game which will from now on be managed by a separate game file from the main adventure. This means that to go back to playing Overcooked! 2 - Surf 'n' Turf will have to go to the ~extras~ section each time and load the second save. The bonus levels added by the DLC can instead be found without problems in the menu dedicated to local and online multiplayer. Playstation 4 trophies Overcooked! 2 - Surf 'n' Turf arrives on PlayStation 4 with a new package of trophies, which will add to the basic list which also includes the game's Platinum Trophy. The DLC trophies can of course be obtained separately and at any time: there are seven in all, divided into five bronze trophies, two silver trophies and one gold trophy. All you need to do is complete the new DLC and get three stars in all levels to unlock them: so to speak, given that the difficulty is definitely set upwards. All new content Let's break down the most important point of Overcooked's Surf 'n' Turf DLC! 2: what new content does it add to the main game experience, which is already particularly rich in possibilities? First of all, the completely new game world made up of the summer resort: here the masters are levels never seen before based on swimming pools, beaches and lots and lots of sand, naturally with kitchens ready to await our excellent chefs. The level design proves to be perfectly up to the main production: once again the position of every single detail of the various kitchens has been thought of to the millimeter, there are multiple strategies to complete the preparation of the dishes but only some of them will allow you to achieve a perfect score. And of course there are environmental hurdles poised to slow down our cooks. cHow about a tourist train blocking your way while the blender has already completed its work and is about to explode? Taking advantage of the new carefree context, new characters with a summer holiday theme have naturally also been added: by completing the twelve new game levels with an excellent score we will be able to unlock the parrot chef and the island chef. Of course, the main course of the DLC are the dishes to prepare, and Surf 'n' Turf introduces dishes never seen before in the series, also strictly themed: there are smoothies and meat skewers, just to name a few. But don't think that the difficulty level is calibrated downwards: Overcooked! 2 - Surf 'n' Turf does not give discounts to anyone, and if the first level proves to be extremely affordable even for newcomers, the subsequent ones immediately set the record straight. Indeed, the entire DLC is probably thought of by gamers who have already spent several hours on Overcooked! 2 both locally and online, and who have achieved three stars in all levels of the main adventure. This is demonstrated by the requirements to unlock the next levels of the expansion: with less than two stars obtained for each kitchen you will not be able to continue until the conclusion of Surf 'n' Turf: it's time to roll up your sleeves and get back to collaborating until up to four friends at the same time.", "date": "2018-10-14", "grade": "8.2"}
