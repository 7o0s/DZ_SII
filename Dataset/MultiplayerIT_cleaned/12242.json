Four years have already passed since the release of Pokemon Sapphire and Ruby and a little less from the Emerald version, the last bastion of the real franchise that has fascinated millions of players all over the world for a decade. And this time we're not talking about Pokemon Ranger, or Pokemon Trozei, let's not talk about a spin-off: Pokemon is back. The real one, the most sold, the most awaited and played. The release of a real new Pokemon for DS is an event: in double edition, as usual, an infinite number of gamers will be able to hunt down the funny little creatures again and make them fight, training and growing them, exploring an everyday world in its fantasy. It's Pokemon, the original one, you can't go wrong. And there's also some news: mainly, the Internet connection. For the first time in its long history, the Nintendo series is approaching the telematic universe, but fans have been clamoring for an MMORPG for years, after all the basic concept would be perfect for that genre: the first step is done, now players can trade pokemon and duel over the internet, thanks to the wi-fi connection of the Nintendo DS, even talking into the microphone with each other. The potential for a real pearl (or diamond, make vobis) in the Nintendo DS toy library is all there, and Game Freaks can hardly betray the exhausting wait. The dilemma is another: but what has really changed? Walking with Pikachu This time the Sinnoh region will be the stage for our umpteenth wanderings, where about one hundred new pokemon live: the total of little monsters rises to 493, although obviously not all of them can be acquired only through Diamond and / or Pearl, but we'll talk about it later. For now, we can say that the incipit of the adventure is more original than usual: in the role of a boy or a girl, we will randomly come across the briefcase of a scientist, Professor Rowan, and to defend ourselves against an aggressive pokemon we will make use of pokeball inside. The scholar will be so impressed by our ability to manage pokemon, that he will give us the one used (according to tradition, chosen from three possible ones) and will start us on the canonical journey of growth and discovery already faced in every version of Pokemon in living memory. Having said goodbye to the mother, made friends with the scientist's granddaughter and made an appointment with our best friend (he too is now a Pokemon Trainer like us), the adventure will begin: and here we are again crossing prairies and deserts on foot, snow-capped mountains and beaches, passing for caves and aqueducts, with two main objectives: to capture as many pokemon as possible (although now it is not necessary to ~catch them all~ to complete the PokeDex, in fact it is enough to only see them ... thank goodness!) and acquire medals from the various Gym Leaders scattered throughout the region, which will allow us to use new skills and continue the adventure and exploration. As expected, a much more important third will be added to these two challenges: hindering Team Galactic, a criminal association that intends to exploit certain pokemon for shady business. In short, by replacing the name of the region with those already visited and changing Team Galactic to Team Rocket or Aqua or Magma, we find ourselves faced with the usual plot recycled for years since the time of the historic Red and Blue versions. In the meantime, the texts, a little less childish, and some simple but pleasant narrative twist has been added, but the cards on the table have not changed: the plot remains a pretext to motivate our wanderings, increasing the desire to increase our collection of monsters and overcome the new challenges. In short, the structure of the gameplay is absolutely identical, the great freedom of exploration is sometimes limited by obstacles that can only be overcome by using a certain pokemon skill, and then you will have to capture the appropriate creature and possibly unlock its power defeating the relative Gym Leader: in this new edition we notice a greater speed in the accumulation of experience points necessary to increase the level of the pokemon, making training and the simultaneous composition of our team more flexible and less repetitive, still of six pokemon at a time. Those who are familiar with the mechanics of the game will know very well that the simplicity of the commands and combat parameters hides an exceptional depth, which makes the creation of your own personalized party satisfying. As always, pokemon are divided into various categories related to ~natural elements~: fire, water, rock, electricity and so on, and those introduced from the Silver / Gold version onwards also return, such as Steel and Poison. Among them the rapport resembles that of the Chinese morra, and it will therefore be up to the player to assemble his own group to face the opponents on duty, also choosing the skills possessed by his own pokemon: each one can have up to a maximum of four, so they will be discarded carefully those in excess as the level of the creatures makes new ones available. And obviously there are also the evolutions of the pokemon to be taken into consideration, which can be activated in various ways. And then there's the fighting: in turns, as always, with the novelty of using the touch-screen to issue commands much more quickly and intuitively than previously. In reality, however, the touch-screen is only used in combat, to navigate the various menus, and sometimes in some mini-games: we expected to be able to move our alter-ego around the world with the stylus, like it happens in Final Fantasy III practically, but even there the inputs of the d-pad take over. Although limited in use, the fact remains that the touch-screen is not missed too much, perhaps because the design of the game, anchored to that of the previous versions, does not really require its exploitation, working perfectly even in this way, and the regret remains only for the purely conceptual issue of the console that we find ourselves in hand. The feeling of a minor upgrade to the proven concept of a decade ago makes itself felt overpowering, but the quality and depth of the game overshadows it by filling the player with things to do: mini-games, beauty contests, tournaments, exchanges... Even the real-time clock is back which alters the passage of time in the game too, so that some pokemon will be present only at night or during the day, others will transform or be weaker or more powerful, while from challenge to challenge we also get the possibility of import our old pokemon, grown in previous Game Boy Advance versions, using the lower slot of the console. Wifi! As mentioned, Pokemon can now be played via the internet: the DS' practical wi-fi system will allow players to access a network where the owners of the two cartridges enjoy exchanging pokemon and obviously challenging each other in battles at last blood. In the latter case, it is even possible to speak directly to our playmate through the Nintendo DS microphone: all this represents a huge step forward in the history of this series, and is probably something that players have been waiting for for years, and which could be the basis of more sophisticated and interesting future online-gaming projects. One of these is already the Underground mode, a sort of persistent mini-game, with a place that can be explored by several players simultaneously via wi-fi connection where you can challenge each other or even place traps against those who sneak into the labyrinth tunnels. The limitation to the great idea of online gaming is in the Friend Code, however: Pokemon Diamond / Pearl is practically armored, and Nintendo cannot be blamed for this choice, probably due to the desire to protect the little ones from unpleasant inconveniences. We've been waiting for it for years, and when Pokemon Diamond/Pearl arrived it definitely made headlines: on the one hand, the same concept as always, practically perfect and incredibly long-lived, assisted by a wonderfully functional technical realization, but on the other ... well, the same concept as always, exactly. The novelties are really minimal, in addition to the renewed graphic design (still maintaining the same feeling of the previous episodes) and other features that do not radically change a gameplay that is now stale and eager for real evolutions. But it is still an exciting game, able to entertain and intrigue users for hours and hours, opening up new game possibilities at every corner (not least, that of recovering the pokemon adopted on the GBA) despite the scarce use of the touch-screen and of the possibilities it would introduce. Finally, the internet connection absolutely enhances a delicious product, a Pokemon to the nth degree whose quality does not deny the great expectation and certainly makes up for, once again, the lack of innovation. For sure, those who have never loved Pokemon stay away from it! Pro Gameplay always up to the series Technically very pleasant Very long-lived, and finally online! Cons Stingy about innovations Little used touch-screen Game Freaks, the art of cut&paste If the deja-vue is constant and practically declared right from the start of the game, with a decidedly cheeky recycling of ideas despite their evergreen quality and the additions that further deepen and improve them, it is when you really start playing that you realize account ofhow difficult it is to judge such an exquisite product without being satisfied and disappointed at the same time. Pokemon Diamond/Pearl is delightful to look at: Game Freaks has chosen to implement a simple three-dimensional engine for the construction of buildings and structures of all kinds, keeping the sprites of the various characters on the screen two-dimensional, characterized by a super-deformed style that makes them extremely chubby. Diamante/Pearl is an orgy of colors that vary according to the time of day, carefully shifting from day to night, always keeping the revisiting of one place or the exploration of another fresh: visual simplicity, which is the strength of a game like this is embellished by a myriad of small details that make the experience very pleasant, but at the same time you can't shout who knows what miracle since the differences from previous editions are basically minimal, even in the graphic setting of the fights: unfortunately the two-dimensional sprites and their very few animation frames are back, and it is certainly not the tiny details that differentiate the male specimens from the females that make the static nature of our little creatures more pleasant, decidedly annoying. On the other hand, Game Freaks has visually reworked almost all the various pokemon attacks to make them more spectacular and appropriate to see on a DS, especially the more advanced and powerful special shots. Thus, the various battles are small pyrotechnic shows, albeit rather simple, but the almost completely immobile sprites continue to turn up their noses, now more than ever. And the same goes for the pokemon verses, a mix of whistles and noises that we will never get tired of saying it but they have had their day. The picture is completed by a series of cheerful and carefree tunes and marches, with some more serious and dark songs dedicated to the more serious sequences of the adventure: it is the music of Pokemon, nothing more and nothing less, suitable for the game, suitable for the action, but certainly not unforgettable or incisive.", "date": "2007-05-30", "grade": null}
