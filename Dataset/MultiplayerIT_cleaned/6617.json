For the manufacturing companies, these are often commercial operations that focus heavily on the nostalgia factor, but for enthusiasts they often prove to be an opportunity to relive certain emotions, or to try them for the first time for those who have not been able to play a title at all. time of its original release. This is the case of Resident Evil for PlayStation 4, a high-definition reissue of the remake of the progenitor of the saga, originally released on GameCube in 2002, enjoying among other things a certain critical and public success thanks above all to a first-rate graphic sector for the time, and a series of technical features and innovations compared to the 1996 version, such as the presence of new scenarios, the different location of text files, objects, puzzles and enemies, and a greater in-depth analysis of the themes relating to the story, thanks also to the presence of the character of Lisa Trevor. The remastered edition, we say it right away, is in fact an improved clone of the original version, with all the resulting advantages and disadvantages. But let's proceed in order. Resident Evil HD Remaster brings back the dad's remake of the survival horror genre in high definition That villa next to the cemetery For those few who don't know it yet, and to refresh the memory of everyone else, the game is set in 1998 and tells how, following the disappearance of a group of campers and strange incidents in the mountains near the town of Raccoon City, the local Police Department sends the B.R.A.V.O. special department team S.T.A.R.S. But its members disappear in turn shortly after, and the command is forced to send a second team on his trail, the one called A.L.P.H.A. Apparently attacked by a pack of ferocious dogs, four of its members take refuge in an old mansion, where they find themselves facing a real nightmare with open eyes, in a desperate struggle for survival. The mansion, which belongs to Lord Oswell E. Spencer, in fact hides in its bowels the secret laboratories of his company called Umbrella Corporation, where lethal pathogens and biological weapons known as B.O.W. Following an accident, the terrible T-virus got out of the control of the scientists, infecting all the occupants of the area: the villa and its surroundings are now populated by zombies and extremely aggressive mutated creatures. At this point the gamer comes into play, who in the role of agents Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine must try, as mentioned before, to solve the case, survive and escape. Once the game has loaded, the user can select the aspect ratio of the screen, available in both the traditional 4:3 format and the new 16:9 widescreen format (however, they can be switched at any time by simply accessing the game menu) , one of the three levels of difficulty and which protagonist to play between the two mentioned above, which are available both with the costumes of the S.T.A.R.S., and with the more recent ones of the B.S.A.A. The choice of playing one agent rather than the other has not only an aesthetic value, but changes the approach to the game, given that with them the type of automatic defense weapons, the arrangement of certain objects, some things to do and the characters you meet. However, being related to each other, in the end the two adventures play both. As far as gameplay is concerned, the structure obviously remains the same for both characters, and identical to that of the first chapters of the series, with fixed cameras and cinematic-style shots that constantly change even in the same environment, and which contribute to increasing the tension. The fact of sometimes not knowing what awaits him around the corner, pushes the user to stay alert, and often forces him to stop for a moment in silence, to listen to a moan or footsteps that may betray the presence of an enemy not yet caught by the camera. Then there are the doors that open only after a short film, the ~magic~ trunks where you can keep the objects that are not needed at the moment and take up space in the few slots available in the protagonists' inventory, the bullets and the ink ribbons to sip, respectively so as not to run out of refills during boss fights, or to save the game at the right time using the appropriate typewriters. In this regard, we would like to open a brief parenthesis: it is undeniable that given today certain mechanicsthat can be outdated and make some players turn up their noses. However, we must not forget the age of the game and the fact that this Resident Evil is not a reboot, therefore a product remade from scratch like for example the new Tomb Raider, but a high definition re-edition of a 2002 game, in turn remake of a 1996 title. Which is why it is quite logical that it cannot offer any sort of upheaval to playability or certain schemes. Precisely for this reason we believe that fans of the original or of survival horror in general, like us, will find it equally enjoyable to play, just as we are aware that those who are looking for a title technically in line with current standards, may not fully appreciate it, and will likely turn their attention elsewhere. However, returning to the game and to our review, there are several things to do during the adventure: explore the environments in search of clues and explanations about the villa and its former occupants, traps to avoid, puzzles to solve and monsters to eliminate (not necessarily). These range from the classic zombies, slow but lethal if encountered in narrow spaces or in large numbers, to the terrible hunters, creatures similar to huge humanoid reptiles capable of tearing off the heads of their enemies, up to mutated animals (Dobermans, spiders, sharks, snakes, etc.). Then there are creatures called Crimson Heads, which are nothing but a faster and furious variant of the ~normal~ undead, and therefore very difficult to defeat. These beings with bright red skin and long nails are in fact a sort of evolution of common zombies. When they are not shot in the brain or deprived of their heads, in some cases the corpses left on the ground continue to regenerate and after a certain amount of time they can mutate into Crimson Heads, jump up and start running after the unfortunate Chris or Jill. The solution, when you cross the helpless bodies on the floor, is to burn them before the transformation. To do this, the gamer has a flask at his disposal which he can fill with kerosene (two uses at a time) from special containers, and then pour it on the corpses in order to set them on fire with the help of the lighter. Our advice is, when possible, to dedicate some time to this operation in order to facilitate the task later in the adventure, avoiding crossing them ~alive~. Playstation 4 trophies In its new high-definition incarnation, Resident Evil offers the public 45 Trophies, including secret ones. 28 are those of bronze, 15 of silver, 1 of gold and 1 of platinum. To get them, you need to go from the simplest ones like burning a zombie or defeating an enemy for the first time, to more and more complex ones, like finishing the game without saving any of the supporting characters, taking all the weapons or completing the adventure in Enemies mode Invisible. Fear in high definition So what's really different about this edition, compared to the original on GameCube? The answer is to be found in the graphics sector, which we will discuss in depth in a few lines, and in the commands. In fact, these have a double optional control scheme, which therefore provide the possibility of playing with the classic ones or with a completely new set, which uses the upper left and right backbones of the PlayStation 4 pad to aim and shoot (strictly while stationary), or the analog sticks to manage the position of the body and the movements of the protagonists, which occur simultaneously with the position assumed by their bodies on the screen. The new control system works, but paradoxically becomes the real weak point of the game at times. Certainly by getting used to it, users can be able to adequately command the characters, but either for the sudden changes of shot, or for the control mechanics, in some situations running away from monsters can be a problem. Since it is possible to switch from one command scheme to another when you want, or even use both alternately using the directional cross instead of the analog sticks to replicate the movements of the old version, in certain situations we preferred to use the traditional controls for convenience. Moving on to the technical part, given the nature of the production, obviously no graphic upheaval is to be expected such as to suggest a radical change, one capable of transforming the visual system into something avant-garde. However, it must also be emphasized that the Capcom graphics have done a decidedly valid job considering the material, not limiting themselves to some simple aesthetic retouching, butengaging in making a whole series of modifications and optimizations that have returned a well-made product, quite different, positively, compared to the GameCube edition (you can see a comparison between the two versions in a photo on the right). In addition to the increase in resolution, which on PlayStation 4 (PC and Xbox One) is in full HD at 1080p, with the game running at 30 frames per second, we have a real restyling of the polygonal models of the characters, which among the others can count on a set of new, more detailed textures (especially those of Chris and Jill in the ~adult~ version, taken from Resident Evil 5), and a block of new animations that make them less rigid in their movements, even if equally not very responsive, especially when aiming and shooting. All this is corroborated by the integration of new, more refined textures also for the backdrops and objects, and by a series of image filters and various post-processing effects that had not been possible to insert in the game at the time of the original release. The reflection of the floor or of the glass, the flames, the glare of the lightning, the mist, all contribute to making the atmosphere of a scary place from which one would just like to escape. Even the beautiful plays of light and shadow, despite sometimes returning, with their sharp cuts, very dark scenarios, give their contribution. As far as the audio component is concerned, nothing to complain about: both the sound effects and the beautiful original soundtrack are reproduced in all their splendour, digitally remastered with the new dolby surround 5.1 multi-channel audio standard.", "date": "2015-01-19", "grade": "8.5"}
