{"name": "Tiger Woods 07 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiger-woods-07-recensione.html", "text": "The tools of the trades Subtitle: Multiplayer.it is your favorite caddy Full: These are the irons used to hit from the tee (in the case of the drive) or simply to hit long distances. Punch: This shot is useful when you want to ~kill~ the effect of the wind or simply avoid the branches of the trees, in fact the punch allows you to make shots with a low and tense trajectory. Pitch: It is a type of shot halfway between the approach and the full house shot, it allows the ball to fly at least 60 yards keeping it absolutely still, without damaging rotations. Flop: It's your caddy's favorite shot here. The flop is a very high trajectory shot, bad when there is strong wind but excellent for an approach on the green with enough precision. If you are very good, given the trajectory of the ball it often happens to hit the shaft and send it directly into the hole. Chip: It's the approach shot par excellence, perfect for those who want to hit the hole directly from off the green. It is more similar to a putter in terms of stroke type, but the ball is still lifted very little. Putt: When you finally find yourself on the green there is no other solution. It's a hit with the ball on the ground, so you need to study the trajectory of the ball down to the smallest detail to prevent it from deviating from the various slopes. Swing, swing, swing, swing. It has always been difficult to get golf enthusiasts to unconditionally love a video game dedicated to their sport: the absence of that ~something~, that sensation that is felt only along the grass of the 18 holes, difficult to recreate from a piece of plastic with two analog sticks, it has always been an obstacle that is difficult to overcome and only partially circumvented. However, Tiger Woods in this 07 version for Wii looks to the future, exploiting the technology inside the remotes that seems to wink at all those sports that base their experience on the use of a bat, a racket or an iron5 . The paths chosen by EA, in the development of the control system, are the evident result of a prudent choice useful both for making inroads in the hearts of golf enthusiasts and for gaining support from those who are still beginners, up to those who it had come to be in total symbiosis with the old control system. The control of your golfer within the game can be divided into two macro categories (with remote, with remote and nunchuk) which in turn are divided into other possibilities in order to adapt to any level of preparation. All types of control that can be performed through the use of the remote alone have been called ~Tru-Swing~, and as the word already suggests, they will imply the fact that the player performs a complete swing (in all respects similar to that of real golf ) to be able to hit the ball; easy, standard and advanced, the three possibilities for customizing the Tru-Swing will have to be chosen by the players according to their abilities: with easy, whatever the swing movement, you will always get a straight shot without effects, with standard and advanced instead you will he will be able to apply a fade or draw effect to his swing - and therefore subsequently to the trajectory of the ball (to give effect to the right or left) only by slightly modifying the position of the remote in his hand. The only control mode via nunchuk winks at the classic controls of the previous Tiger Woods, allowing you to make the swing only by pressing the stick first backwards and then forwards. Whatever control setting is selected to enjoy this golf experience to the fullest, on all shots it will be possible to interact directly on the rotation of the ball in flight by simply pressing the directional cross to the right or left and above all by moving the remote quickly (as if it were necessary to throw it into a tailspin). The remaining mapping of the control system is of a fairly classic matrix: with ~A~ you can view the landing area of your shot, with ~-~ you can move on to the shot preparation phase, making a series of test attempts without the ball, with ~B~ instead you will proceed with the actual shot, once you have selected the iron chosen for the shot using button ~1~. 1, 10, 1000 playing fields. One of the most appreciable things about Tiger Woods is the presence of an infinite series of modes with which to compete solo, in teams and all against all. In addition to the classic quick game in which up to 4 players will compete on one of the most famous golf courses in the world, all the most interesting innovations will be concentrated in the ~Game Mode~ mode. This mode is in fact divided into: Tiger Challenge, PGA tour season, traditional game and arcade game. Tiger Challengerepresents the real climb towards Tiger, a series of challenges with more or less famous golfers to beat to finally challenge Mr. Tiger Woods himself; this modality is of absolute importance to be able to earn money quickly, skills and above all to obtain an important sponsorship. PGA Tour is the second classic mode of the game, the player will go through all the tournaments of the season to become the undisputed king of golf. Traditional Game is in turn a macro category that brings together: Stroke Play, Match Play, Bloodsome, Greensome, Skins and Alternate Shot, all ways of playing (all multiplayer with the exception of the first two) that implement slightly different rules from the classic ones of golf, as in Alternate shot where the player will challenge three other opponents by strategically playing the same ball in turn for the entire duration of the hole, in an attempt to make the hole instead of the challengers. Arcade game, as the name already suggests, will offer a series of challenges based on rules slightly different from those of normal golf (Target, T-I-G-E-R, one-ball, Team one-ball, Skills 18, Capture and Battle golf are part of this category ). In parallel to the purely game modes, the ~My Tour~ option will take into account all the results and objectives achieved by the player, while ~Game Face~ will take care of giving a face (and suitable clothing) to the golfer in us. According to the usual face and body processing parameters, it will be - with some difficulty due to the excessive mobility of the remote - it will be possible to create your own virtual version, buy the clothing and tools of the trade from the shop and above all go and modify your Skills ( power, precision, spin, and so on..), thanks to the points obtained during the game, in order to increase one's ability on the court. The practical and very useful Game Tutorial closes the count of the modalities which, in addition to explaining the basics of golf, will be the perfect guide for learning what the new control system has to offer. If on the one hand the innovations are important and of absolute importance, however, it is wrong not to highlight the fact that they risk becoming the cross and delight of the entire golfing experience. However innovative the control system is, however, it remains linked to the player's will to believe that what one finds in one's hands is actually a golf club and not a sort of square remote control: the swing can easily be achieved with one hand only, and thanks to a series of motion detection flaws, it will simply be enough to give a slight flick of the wrist backwards to make the game autonomously carry out the first backswing movement (the one that brings the club backwards, in preparation for the shot) and then another forward strike to finish the shot. The putting phases are by far the ones most affected by problems, with the game that often and willingly (if the movement is not decided) interprets the preparation for the shot as the shot itself and comes out with a decidedly busted shot that nine times out of ten compromises the entire outcome of the hole. In addition to the in-game defects, one of the most annoying problems is linked to the bad calibration of the remote which makes it difficult to move between the menus and practically impossible to create a character with your own features. The graphic aspect of the game closes the bulletin of the negative aspects: Nintendo has never made a secret of the fact that Wii would have represented a minimal evolution in terms of graphics, but seeing (and playing) a game that seems to have come directly from Game Cube is still sad. Tiger Wood 07 on balance could be defined as a good starting point to work from. If graphically the game leaves something to be desired especially in direct comparison with the opposing platforms, the Wii recovers all the gap thanks to the innovative control system combined with a good audio performance, helped in part by the important presence of the speaker on the remote, very useful to increase the sense of impersonation. Unfortunately, however, there are defects, and they all reside in the control system in some phases that is very inaccurate (putting above all) and uncomfortable in navigating the menus, in the creation of golfers and in modifying one's qualities. A video game is always made up of a part of the imagination, of that ~quid~ that developers cannot insert but only the player can, whoever wants to put it in Tiger Woods 07 will find himself in his hands a great game. Pros: The remote is a perfect golf club Never has a golf game been so immersive Dozens of modes to play in both single and multi Cons: Control with the remote can and must be perfected Graphicsinstitution not in step with the times The navigation between the menus also needs to be reviewed When Nintendo finally announced its ~revolution~ in the world of video games months ago, there were many who - once they understood how the remote works - loudly exclaimed that they wanted a Tiger Woods with all the trappings of the case. Electronic Arts did absolutely no begging and confirming its absolute desire to become the second publisher in terms of importance and weight for Wii, it threw itself headlong into the development of a series of key titles that could on the one hand evolve the their way of making sport a video game, and on the other hand that they fit like a glove to the characteristics of the Wii-mote. The first EA title that baptized Nintendo's new ~weapons~ was the excellent Madden NFL 07, which, while not representing the most suitable sport to be summed up in the remote/nunchuk combination, showed the world that EA had the right mentality to undertake this new adventure. A few months have passed since the launch, however, it is time to discover the best cards for this 2007 of Electronic Arts, and for a just reviewed SSX Blur (here) that seems to offer excellent prospects for the future, here is also the much requested golf game everyone had turned their thoughts to the time of the announcement: Tiger Woods 07.", "date": "2007-03-26", "grade": null}
