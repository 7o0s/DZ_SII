Allora spara!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pistol-whip-recensione.html", "text": "You put on your visor, fire two shots on the menus and start the game. This is the strength of Pistol Whip, one of the great successes of virtual reality which, after delighting Meta Quest and PlayStation VR users, is back in a shiny state, also compatible with PS VR2, the new Sony headset (the update is free for who already owns it on PlayStation 4). It wouldn't be a lie: even if Pistol Whip lacks the martial grips that Keanu Reeves inflicted on his enemies, the feeling is just that of dressing his - very elegant! - clothes. In terms of gameplay we are faced with a mix between the splendid Super Hot VR and Beat Saber, where music and action will drag us into one of the funniest arcades around. Let's find out in the Pistol Whip review. Fire bullets Pistol Whip: the pre-game options where you can set your preferences In Pistol Whip you don't have to worry about moving like in a normal video game, as the level automatically advances at walking speed. But be careful, sometimes you will be called to avoid obstacles: if there is a wall in the way you have to physically sprint to the side, if the pipe is too low you will have to crouch. And all this you'll have to do while enemies appear everywhere whose shots, and here's the surprise, will go at a speed that allows you to dodge them as if you were Baba Yaga herself. So you'll have to kneel, sprint on the bands, squirm while avoiding one, two, three incoming cross bullets, all the while worrying about returning fire with one, or even two, pistols at the ready. There are fifteen shots available; reloads by aligning the pistol downwards with the leg; you aim with the naked eye and instinctively. Pistol Whip: Sometimes the graphic style will get caught up in the music... As a game, Pistol Whip would be tempting enough, but there's more. Its levels, always very short in length (and it's a plus in this case) are all inspired by imaginary action movies, surrounded by high quality electronic soundtracks. The music is extremely important in the cathartic experience that is created, and gets you in the right groove to ring headshots like professional killers. The game helps you feel unstoppable, straighten out the shots a bit, but he's adamant on those we can receive: two mistakes can compromise the game. Each level can count on three different difficulties: the first is fun and can be useful for getting the hang of it, while from the second upwards, get ready for a lot of physical exercise. After two levels someone may already ask for a break, on the other hand a little cardio never hurts. The PlayStation VR2 version is everything that the one dedicated to the previous Sony viewer could never be: finally very precise and able to capture our movements at three hundred and sixty degrees. There has also been a big leap in quality in resolution, even if we are still talking about a very simple game graphically and therefore unpretentious in terms of hardware, but with a lot of character and this is sometimes much more important! Ready to use Pistol Whip: The game includes more than thirty levels Virtual reality has a natural propensity for these arcade titles, and by this we mean one-time experiences, such as those offered by the now mythological arcades. You entered, inserted a token, did ten minutes of Neo Turf Master, three laps of the track on Virtua Racing, a double at Metal Slug, and then off to new adventures. Inside Whip Pistol is also the soul of Virtua Cop and Times Crisis; this game is to all intents and purposes an evolution of those simple but captivating concepts. Put on the viewer and go, in this the practically zeroed uploads help in no small way, then you pass the viewer and pad to your friend and you enjoy the video scene with the included cell phone. Compared to the content available at launch, Pistol Whip now also offers many more levels and music tracks. What was once a fun but sparse action game is now a nice finished product and, after two small expansions, richer and more appetizing than ever. There are more than thirty levels, but they are so much fun that they are worth double. There are also some interesting variants, such as the dual wield mode which will allow us to face the same level but holding a gun in each hand. And if you get caught up in high-score fever, in two months on the beach you risk even showing off a statuesque physique...", "date": "2023-02-17", "grade": "8.0"}
