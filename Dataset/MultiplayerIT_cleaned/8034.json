The protagonist of the game is in fact a private investigator who, after receiving a letter from his father, goes to the town of Redcliff, but finds it practically deserted. Where has everyone gone? It will be up to us to find out, interacting with different places, changing the view to control every detail and solving puzzles that often require a pinch of imagination. Gameplay Tiny Room Stories: Town Mystery, one of the first rooms that we will find ourselves exploring As mentioned at the beginning, the main peculiarity of Tiny Room Stories: Town Mystery is to put us in front of diorama-style scenarios, represented on the screen with a three-quarter view that can be rotated. This operation reveals from time to time new details with which to possibly interact through a simple touch: doors to open, electronic devices that require a code, ventilation grilles, light switches, furniture and so on. The adventure, available in format free (and currently marred by a problem with advertising that allows you to ~cheat~, getting hints on puzzles without even having to watch trailers), is made up of several chapters and it is also possible to unlock the latest additions to the story by making a single in-app purchase from just 2.99. A truly negligible sum compared to the quality of the solutions put in place by the developers, frankly. In a market that rewards the more conservative and less courageous choices, even on mobile, Tiny Room Stories: Town Mystery is in fact an undoubtedly innovative project, whose only flaw is the lack of a traditional narrative and therefore a campaign that, thanks to the pleasantness of the gameplay, it slips away very quickly. Some puzzles are less immediate than others, but the compartmentalized structure, with each setting including the solving elements for its own puzzles, helps to carry forward the reasoning and intuitions necessary to unlock a particular lock, find a code, open a pass or interpret specific data. And rotating the camera always makes a difference, adding a surprising element to the experience. Graphics and sound Tiny Room Stories: Town Mystery, the exterior of Redcliff bank, also deserted The graphics of Tiny Room Stories: Town Mystery make use of a very pleasant low poly style, elegant and minimalist, which gives the scenarios a particular charm. As mentioned, these are real dioramas, full of details, which can be rotated four times to observe them from all angles and discover objects that were not previously visible. The final result is excellent and brings to mind classics of the past like Flashback, albeit only on a visual level, while the sound has the enviable ability to contribute to the atmosphere of the game while doing the bare minimum.", "date": "2022-04-09", "grade": "8.0"}
