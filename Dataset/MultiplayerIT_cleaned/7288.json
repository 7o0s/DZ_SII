It was in fact a solid and fun real-time strategy game, featuring cartoon-style graphics and an interesting upgrade system for the protagonist - a prince determined to reconquer his kingdom - and his troops, divided into units of various type and with different abilities. Each mission of the substantial single-player campaign consisted of conquering a stronghold by destroying its defenses, gradually attracting new soldiers (based on a bar that recharged over time, positioned at the bottom of the screen) and leading them to victory. Simple but effective, as well as damn well done and downloadable for free according to the canons of freemium productions. Well, almost a year and a half later, here is the awaited sequel, Royal Revolt 2, which starts exactly where the first episode ended: the prince is back on his throne, but now comes the hardest part, or defend the walls of the kingdom from the attack of neighboring countries. How? Here comes the fun part: the developers of flaregames have thought of enriching the structure of their title by introducing a ~casual~ management section, with the traditional buildings used to accumulate gold coins or pieces of bread (the former necessary to buy updates and anything else, the seconds to go into battle), as well as the inevitable hard currency that is required of us to quickly complete constructions that otherwise can take up to twelve hours to complete. Royal Revolt 2 revolutionizes the structure of the series by inserting various novelties, but not all of them positive Attack and defend In front of the city walls there is a short avenue that we can modify by adding ~junctions~, building barricades and defense towers, as well as selecting the troops who will take care of countering the advance of the invaders of the kingdom. We must pay close attention to this phase, because in reality the game dwells little on this aspect while it reveals itself to be fundamental in the economy of the gameplay. Why? Because it is precisely that short customizable path that constitutes the battleground in our missions. Royal Revolt 2 does not have a single player campaign like the first chapter, but puts us in front of other human players in strictly asynchronous mode for the conquest of a variable cash prize. This is a potentially excellent idea, but which unfortunately collides with a couple of problems that should not be underestimated. In the first place, the lack of emphasis on the defense construction phase: faced with corridors devoid of bite and characterized by scarce defenses and variety, the action phase loses its charm and becomes extremely repetitive, making the general enthusiasm and the desire to progress by acquiring new wealth, new units and new skills. Secondly, the freemium system soon proves too limiting, allowing us to tackle three or four missions at most before having to wait for the ~bread~ to be recharged. Otherwise, the system is the same as the original Royal Revolt! and here too it proves to be effective, though without introducing substantial innovations. For example, there was a need for greater attention to the sometimes chaotic controls, but it was decided not to change anything in this sense, as in the technical sector.", "date": "2014-02-26", "grade": "7.3"}
