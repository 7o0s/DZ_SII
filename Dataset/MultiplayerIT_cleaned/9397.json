The idea was very popular and it took Square Enix more than ten years to decide to propose it again in a more convincing way. Dissidia: Final Fantasy for PSP is a concentration of fanservice that no fan of the famous JRPG saga could ever miss: a cross between a fighting game and an RPG in which the protagonists of each episode of the series go to great lengths. But this is not a commercialized end in itself, because already with that first episode Square Enix had managed to convince the most skeptical of the goodness of the concept and with Dissidia 012: Duodecim Final Fantasy, the softco tries to repeat its excellent success. Why do you fight? Fans of the franchise who expect a solid and compelling narrative component from Dissidia 012: Duodecim Final Fantasy, as the series has accustomed us to in its various incarnations, could be greatly disappointed. As in the previous iteration, also in this case the underlying plot is nothing short of insane, even if it certainly stands at least a head above the average of similar productions where the wrestlers fight each other without a real why. In this case, the fight between good guys and bad guys revolves around the war between two entities called Cosmos and Chaos: in the previous Dissidia we discovered that this battle is cyclical and the protagonists are destined to face each other forever, in fact Dissidia 012: Duodecim Final Fantasy is a kind of prequel that reveals the events of the twelfth war, to be precise. Mind you, this is just an excuse to show a series of technically excellent cutscenes in which the various characters exchange melodramatic jokes about the meaning of battle and life, with more or less veiled references to the personal stories of the games they belong to. In short, narrative depth close to zero, and fanservice galore. From this point of view, the most striking addition consists of the new characters that have joined the roster, curiously all from the ranks of the ~good guys~: Lightning (Final Fantasy XIII), Tifa (Final Fantasy VII), Laguna (Final Fantasy VIII ), Yuna (Final Fantasy X), Vaan (Final Fantasy XII) and Kain (Final Fantasy IV). There are also two extra characters, Prishe (Final Fantasy XI) and Gilgamesh (Final Fantasy V). Each of the new characters has a more or less important role in the story and a very personal fighting style: Square Enix has done an excellent job to integrate them into the roster by proposing some peculiar elements, such as the Optimum system that characterizes Lightning or the shots based on ~summoning~ by Yuna. The variety of the new proposals, and of the corresponding internships, is therefore remarkable, despite the fact that the combat system, in the end, has essentially remained unchanged. Evolution Dissidia 012: Duodecim Final Fantasy is a sneaky game. Anyone who enjoyed the previous episode will surely have spent dozens of hours on the PSP stick learning every animation or combo by heart. At first, the sensation is therefore unsettling: the new game looks absolutely identical and it's even a little difficult to spend the first hour without getting bored, especially if you're a veteran of the prequel... or rather, sequel. Each fighter has two types of attacks and while one enhances our offensive capabilities, the other has the purpose of directly damaging the opponent until he is defeated. The heart therefore remained the same: even Dissidia 012: Duodecim Final Fantasy soon turns into a ballet in which the challengers try to hit each other, avoiding each other's attacks and looking for that moment of uncertainty or distraction that allows you to deliver the decisive blow. More than a real fighting game, Dissidia's gameplay is reminiscent of an old glory like Power Stone. To the foundations of the game already laid a year ago, Dissidia 012: Duodecim Final Fantasy soon adds those elements which, of course, do not distort the gameplay, but make it even more fresh and intriguing. We start with the Assist, a command that allows us to call a ~partner~ who will launch a rapid attack against our opponent: each character has a different type of Assist and the choice of supporting actor therefore becomes more tactical than it appears. The introduction of the Assist strengthens the already simple but deep combat system, as well as the EX counterattack that allows you to interrupt the opponent's combos and take advantage of a few seconds of invincibility or the possibility of interrupting the opponent's EX mode using the Assists. It goes without saying that each new character has specscompletely new EX Modes and final attacks. Then the Summons return, the experience points and the equipment that provides the characters with temporary or fixed bonuses and which, as in a traditional JRPG, must be carefully selected to get the better of the opponents. However, Dissidia 012: Duodecim Final Fantasy is not a total copy-paste even with regard to the rest: Square Enix has well thought of retouching the roster a bit, balancing some characters to make them more inviting or less advantaged. The result is therefore a product that is more than it seems, as demonstrated by the various game modes. Where is my airship? One of the neatest features of the first Dissidia was the Story Mode. While repetitive, in the long run, it alone made up a large chunk of the game time, thanks to the care taken in designing a mode that wasn't a dry sequence of fights. Now it has gone one step further and players even have a kind of ~world map~ clearly inspired by the one proposed in Final Fantasy XIII: you control a character in the third person in a three-dimensional environment where you can interact with other characters, even create a kind of ~party~ and select the next fights to face. In reality, the map is almost completely useless but adds that JRPG touch to the game that sets it apart from the crowd. Between the new maps and the old boards, players can conclude the new Story and then also unlock the plot of the original Dissidia: on balance, Dissidia 012: Duodecim Final Fantasy includes practically the entire first game, updated to the gameplay of the new edition. A somewhat burning discovery that makes the old version even more obsolete. And in addition to the story mode, the pseudo-arcade mode also returns in which it is possible to train and collect experience points; to these is added the Labyrinth mode, which essentially allows you to ~customize~ a series of challenges to test your skills, and an editor that allows you to create and share self-produced ~levels~: this mode unfortunately does not take advantage of the link to Internet and the same goes for the rich Multiplayer sector, full of options which, however, are based on an unlikely ad hoc connection. Not that this will deter more solitary players, considering the amount of content. To see and to hear To be honest, that of the maps seems almost an excuse to once again show the excellent technical sector of the game, which manages to give its best in the frenetic and colorful fights, between explosions and light effects which, to be honest, sometimes tend to produce slight slowdowns and frame-rate dips, usually solid and without uncertainties. The new characters are faithful reproductions of their original counterparts and some of them, like Laguna, we can finally hear the voice: despite the fluctuating quality of the script, the dubbing (in English) is excellent and passionate. The polygonal models are once again carefully detailed and animated, each sporting different 'costumes' taken directly from the original games. The only flaw remains the camera: just like in the previous Dissidia, the shot sometimes struggles to follow the very rapid movements of the players and is often positioned in an inopportune way, especially if the battle develops in the corners. Needless to mention the stratospheric quality of the rare computer-graphic sequences, but it is imperative to underline the excellent work done by the composer Takeharu Ishimoto: the soundtrack boasts numerous remixes of the original music of the series, associated in a particular way by episode and related characters, and the the result is a kind of compilation of the best songs of the franchise.", "date": "2011-03-24", "grade": "8.8"}
