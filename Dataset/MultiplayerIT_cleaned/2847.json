In the course of the review we will clarify this point in detail, given that at present the bugs are the predominant feature of the entire game. A few weeks ago we wrote the test and even then we noticed the many bugs that ended up in the final version, but at that stage it was still unfair to start describing them, because we nurtured the hope that they would be fixed during construction before launch. However, the one week release date brought forward some doubts: how will they solve them all? Evidently, however, someone decided that it was better not to risk direct competition from Amnesia: Rebirth and, therefore, to try to come out earlier even with a frankly unthinkable product. The result is simply not justifiable and it is even less so if we use Remothered as a yardstick: Tormented Fathers which, albeit with some minor problems, was on a completely different level already at launch. Bugs What makes Remothered: Broken Porcelain even more angry is the fact that there is no shortage of positive elements: the story of Jennifer and her working stay at the Ashmann Inn is interesting and the plot works well. Maybe it's a little difficult to follow, especially in the ending, since it relies heavily on time jumps to reveal the identity of its characters, but in general, trying to understand what's happening is an excellent motivation to move forward, despite the difficulties. The scenario is also really well defined and takes up in a coherent way what is told in Tormented Fathers, while not a little tangling the whole story. The hotel in which Broken Porcelain is set is decorated with excellent taste and is set up to appear large and varied. The references to horror classics such as The Shining and Misery must not die are evident and pleasant, as are those of titles such as Clock Tower and Resident Evil, especially the fourth episode. In short, there are some good features, many and such in reality that they would have made us close even the third eye if there had been fewer problems. Unfortunately, when you are faced with blocked enemies, objects that do not work as they should, to a boss that is impossible to beat following the directions given to you and a myriad of moments where you can't figure out why what should have worked didn't, the rest fades into the background. The most striking example is deaths from failed interactions with hideouts. The first version of the game left all interactions active during chases, so you found yourself opening a drawer instead of a wardrobe while an enemy chased you, ending up badly killed. Non-essential interactions have now been patched out, but strangely in some cases you still can't hide from them. In others, however, it is enough to bow down behind any object, even a very small one, to become essentially invisible... or it is enough to hope that intelligence fails and you find yourself with the tracker stuck somewhere, so as to have all the time to escape. Be that as it may, in other cases the pursuers prove to be real tanks, so much so that they don't suffer the effects of the objects we throw at them and so much so that they flush us out of hiding places even if in theory they didn't see us enter. Another bug that has happened to us at least twice is that of the death of the interface. By doing it is not known what we have caused the blocking of every interaction. The only solution in these cases was to reload the game. But these are just a few examples of the vast collection of bugs offered by Remothered: Broken Porcelain, so vast that frankly it ends up ruining the experience, making it frustrating. How can you get passionate about history if every minute you have to fight with some bug? How can you admire the beautiful graphics if problems appear from everywhere, such as the body of the protagonist that prevents you from reading important documents or the sudden cuts of the filmed sequences, just to name two of the most eye-catching? The tension itself soon subsides, because the concern becomes not so much avoiding being seen by pursuers using the stealth system, as hoping not to run into yet another bug. More bugs Too bad that in this way the many positive ideas of Remothered: Broken Porcelain end up in the background, such as the crafting system to create more effective objects against pursuers, which even allow them to be injured, a fact that is not very frequent in titles of the genre (you can backstabbing), or Jennifer's power gimmick to useking of moths to solve some puzzles. Here, in all cases there is always some bug that crops up to spoil the party and to cool the excitement for the novelty, such as the really fluctuating artificial intelligence of the enemies, which makes them move in an often reckless way, or like the simulation of the flight of moths, which makes it really difficult to control them without ending up planted everywhere (unfortunately they have a time limit, so you are often forced to try the same action over and over again, having to wait for the power to cool down). So what could really be a new Clock Tower reinterpreted in a modern key, turned out to be just a product that we hope will be reviewed and adjusted over time, in order to make its potential, albeit present, blossom. From this point of view, applause goes to the developers who have released at least three patches in the space of a few days. There is much more work to do, but at least the support seems to be there, hopefully enough to save it from oblivion.", "date": "2020-10-19", "grade": "4.0"}
