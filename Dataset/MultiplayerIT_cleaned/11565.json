We are talking about a product born as a simple minigame within Project Gotham Racing 2 for Xbox, whose starting idea has proved to be so strong and valid as to allow it to make a decisive leap in quality: first online distribution, now a version that enriches very much the original title and gives it a great thickness. Geometry Wars: Galaxies was created simultaneously for Wii and Nintendo DS: the game has the same structure on both consoles, which can be linked to unlock a bonus galaxy. Galaxies and styles Collecting geometries is the main purpose of the game, both for a question of scoring (each planet requires a certain score to assign us one of the three major medals) and to proceed with the purchase of new stages and new ~styles~. The latter are introduced for the first time in the series, there are eight different ones and each one changes the cards on the table: the ~attack~ style induces our pod (an independent external unit) to help us in battle, the ~collection~ style it scatters on-screen automatons tasked with collecting geometry for you, the ~turret~ style causes the pod to become a rotating attack emplacement, etc. Shoot'em-up heaven The mechanics of Geometry Wars originate from the typical dynamics of classic shoot'em-ups: destroying everything that moves on the screen, while performing spectacular evasive maneuvers so as not to fall prey to enemies. Moreover, these elements are enhanced and enriched in different ways: we will be faced with a veritable orgy of opponents and bullets, truly exhilarating for the nostalgics of ~shoot and run~, and we will have to collect bonuses capable of doubling or tripling our score, as well as to upgrade our weapons. Galaxies adds to this starting package a very high number of scenarios (sixty) distributed within galaxies, in fact; these galaxies must be unlocked by spending the credits collected in the form of ~geometries~, or objects that arise from the elimination of enemies and which must be collected promptly. The various planets in which our battles will take place are not only number, but the gameplay varies in a more or less important way: each stage has a different shape (with possible ~obstacles~ inside it) and opponents that change both in appearance than in the modus operandi. It is clear that the more you advance, the more complicated things will become, with elusive or very resistant enemies, from whose elimination lethal fragments are released. In short, the quantity and variety of opponents is one of the strengths of this new Geometry Wars and represents a valid ~surprise element~ to entice the player to see ~what's next~ where this task cannot be entrusted to the scenarios. Game structure Each battle has a ~slow~ start and grows as time passes, reaching situations from which it becomes really difficult to escape: in those situations, it is appropriate to activate the classic smart bomb, capable of clearing the screen of enemies and giving us a moment of respite. In any case, even in the first stages it is very difficult to score the scores required to obtain the most prestigious medal, and one cannot help but notice that part of the fault must be attributed to the game control system, which on Nintendo DS must necessarily make some compromises. The original concept of Geometry Wars, in fact, was based on the combined use of two analog sticks, one deputy for movement and one for attack: this configuration allowed complete freedom as regards evasive maneuvers, given the possibility of shooting in any direction and, therefore, to open a gap quickly and quickly, even in the presence of many enemies. On the Nintendo portable console, all this freedom has been irretrievably lost: the game allows us to move our ~ship~ using the d-pad, while the attack is assigned to the main buttons or the touch screen. By opting for the buttons, the action certainly becomes more immediate and intuitive, but you end up rarely resorting to the diagonal attack (obtainable by pressing two buttons together) and therefore you are limited in the possibilities of movement. Using the stylus and the touch screen, you can shoot in any direction but less precisely, and also playing is much more tiring due to the position you have to take with your hands. Extra mode Apart from the welcome presence of Retro Evolved as a nice bonus episode, Geometry Wars: Galaxies also has a series of multiplayer modes that are certainly interesting. Sessions can be organisedshared or take advantage of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to find a game or host it ourselves, choosing between the ~collaboration~, ~simultaneous~ and ~contrast~ modes. While not adding who knows what value to the product, the multiplayer is well done and allows us to try our hand at something different from the usual. Technical realization Geometry Wars: Galaxies uses very sparse and essential vector graphics, which however are characterized by beautiful colors (which stand out against the black background) and above all by the ability to move a disproportionate number of objects on the screen, always maintaining great fluidity. There is no shortage of uncertainties when situations get really messy, of course, but these are slowdowns that are also welcome in the end, as they make it easier for us to survive and extricate ourselves from the dozens of enemies we have on our heels. A bit like the classic Thunderforce 4 for MegaDrive, right? Let's say that the two titles have many points in common as regards the concept of difficulty, although they belong to different categories. The sound sector does not shine for variety, but it is strong in truly engaging techno music, which blends perfectly with the game action and represents a very welcome extra. We have already talked about the control system: it can be precise and immediate, offers two different configurations and works very well, even if it is far from what was possible to obtain with the use of two analog sticks. Comment Innovative, fun and full of style: Geometry Wars: Galaxies can be summarized as follows. In this version for Nintendo DS, the game does not lose its own personality and indeed is enriched by an interesting structure, which sees its strengths in the large number of stages and enemies. This is not a title suitable for everyone, and from this point of view it goes a bit ~against the tide~ compared to most titles for the dual-screen portable console: it is literally a paradise for shoot'em-up lovers, since it takes up and reinterprets the dynamics of this genre, putting them together a bit like a sort of bizarre puzzle game in which you have to aim for a high score not only to satisfy your ego but also to be able to proceed between the available planets and galaxies . If you have already tried Geometry Wars and found it fun, jump into this Galaxies without fear. Pros: Innovative and fun Numerous stages, numerous enemies Technically excellent Cons: Not a game for everyone Control system inferior to the original Particular mechanics, perhaps too much", "date": "2008-03-14", "grade": null}
