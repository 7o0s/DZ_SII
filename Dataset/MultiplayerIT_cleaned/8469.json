What's better than waiting your turn at the dentist, killing time exploring dungeons, chopping up enemies and collecting new items? And when it's our turn, just press a button to put the console in standby and resume as soon as we're done, maybe during dinner that we'll have to skip because of a sore cheek. Okay, actually there's better not going to the dentist, but don't be picky. The point is that the genre lends itself damn well to this type of fruition, so when Square Enix announced this Heroes of Ruin, practically an unpretentious Diablo clone, we decided that all in all the anonymous graphic style and the advertising campaign practically non-existent they could hide a real pearl and many hours of treasure hunts and virtual massacres. The stick and the carrot A good dungeon crawler should never lack loot in abundance, and from this point of view Heroes of Ruin certainly cannot be criticized, given that it floods the player with objects from the very first minutes of the game, forcing him to evaluate which piece of equipment should be used as long as the character is able to wear it. At the beginning of the adventure we will in fact be required to choose our class, which corresponds to a specific race: there is the Avenger who wields a two-handed broadsword and uses limited healing skills, the agile Pistolero who fights from a distance, the He is a slim Alchitect capable of using magic and a ferocious Savage skilled in close combat. It is possible to change the color and cut of our alter ego's hair, a limited but welcome customization that offers a good variety of combinations. Once the character is created, it's immediately war: Heroes of Ruin is an action game that is exceptionally simple to play, with the backbones used for collecting objects and parrying or dodging somersaults; a front button is entrusted to the basic attack combo while the other three will host as many skills, carefully chosen among the numerous that will be unlocked by leveling up and spending the appropriate points to buy new ones or enhance those already learned. The level limit set to only thirty prevents the acquisition of any skill or upgrade in the game, a rather questionable solution that immediately closes the doors to any experimentation. Heroes of Ruin is in fact characterized by multiple outdated design choices like this, which make the experience much less captivating than it appears during the first few minutes. For example, there is a limit to the number of objects that we can carry to wear them or simply resell them, forcing us to often open the menu to consult the list and decide what to abandon and what to keep. In short, it almost seems that n-Space had quite confused ideas during development, as demonstrated by the entire multiplayer sector. The 3D effect Without infamy or praise the stereoscopic effect, which however has the great advantage of making otherwise banal or unnecessarily complex settings more incisive. 3D therefore has no practical purpose and offers no advantage during fights, except to make the action spectacular at the cost of the frame rate. Here and there Heroes of Ruin promotes cooperation from the very first screens, inviting the player to register their account to confront the community on the web and to make their games public, so that they can face the adventure together with up to three other players. To its credit, it must be said that the net code of the n-Space game is really satisfactory: everything runs smoothly, without particular lag or interruptions, and it is even possible to take advantage of a modest voice chat to communicate with your teammates perhaps with the aim of insulting them for having stolen a particularly appetizing object from us: the loot is in fact shared by the whole group and, in essence, first come first served. To tell the truth, however, there is no point in getting angry, Heroes of Ruin is not a particularly difficult game and does not require particular strategies, distributing healing potions in industrial quantities. In short, you die very little, and even most of the end-of-dungeon bosses don't have very different skills from their henchmen. Bizarre therefore the choice not only to propose a single level of difficulty, but to block access to dungeons already completed unless you join the game of a player who has yet to explore them. In short, this means that once you have completed the game or reached the maximum level, there is practically nothing else to do but start over with another character or dedicate yourself toand additional challenges that n-Space allows you to download every week. If the adventure had been longer, the single-player experience would certainly have benefited from it, but it is possible to complete the story and all the sidequests in about six or seven hours and the type of character chosen does not involve narrative differences. From a purely technical point of view, Heroes of Ruin is a bit fluctuating: the design is rather anonymous but pleasant and there is a good outline of cutscenes completely dubbed in Italian which carries on an overall enjoyable plot. The 3D effect also left us a bit dumbfounded, which makes the settings more captivating and also underlines the aesthetic variety of the loot, but which sideways significantly decreases the frames per second especially when facing multiple enemies simultaneously.", "date": "2012-06-28", "grade": "6.5"}
