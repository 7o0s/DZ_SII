{"name": "CSI: Il gioco mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/csi-il-gioco-mobile.html", "text": "Created by Anthony E. Zuiker, the television series ~CSI: Crime Scene Investigation~ has been on air in the USA since 2000 and has reached its eighth season. Over the years, the show has not only received important awards (above all the Emmy Award), but has also given rise to two spin-offs set respectively in Miami and New York. Each episode revolves around the discovery of a corpse, which the scientific police officers must analyze to reconstruct the crime scene and to find any suspects. The characters (Gil Grissom, Catherine Willows, Warrick Brown, Nick Stokes, etc.) are well characterized, each one has different skills and experiences, but it is only thanks to their collaboration that cases are solved. It is likely that the Gameloft developers wanted to do some experimenting with the creation of the CSI: Miami tie-in, then dealing with CSI: The Mobile Game with a greater baggage of experience. The fundamental structure of the two titles is identical, but in this new installation of the series the mechanics have been refined and there are more elements at stake. Crime scene analysis is always the first step: in this context, evidence must be identified and collected, using the right tool for each one. At first, the game takes us by the hand, suggesting choices to make, but after a while we'll find ourselves having to make the decisions ourselves. Once the collection phase is over, we'll have to move to the police laboratories for sample analysis, which differs from the CSI: Miami video game because it involves running some simple minigames. For example, the comparison of fingerprints will see us identify or not two identical fingerprints, while DNA analysis involves throwing ~colored balls~ towards others of the same color. The phases that take place in the laboratory can help us find implicated people, who we will then have to interrogate, paying close attention both to the questions we ask and to the way we do it. Moving from one place to another takes place simply by calling up the map of Las Vegas, and in the same way it is possible at any time to check an updated diary on the evidence, the suspects and the places where the crime took place. The similarities between CSI: The Mobile Game and CSI: Miami do not only concern the structure, but also and above all the technical realization. Both games make use of scanned photos to represent the characters, in a context where animation is practically absent. The locations are done very well, in this case better than the previous episode: excellent use of colors, excellent level of detail and a certain attention to detail. Scenes aren't limited to a single static screen, but scroll horizontally with parallax across three or more levels. The interface has hardly changed at all, we have the usual pointer controlled via the joystick that has to pass over the interactable objects to signal them to the player. Then you go to the collection, opening a context menu that shows all the tools available. A good job has also been done as regards the construction of the laboratory and the various instruments that must be used for the analysis of the tests. The minigames are extremely simple, but somehow have the merit of breaking up what would otherwise be a monotonous progression.
