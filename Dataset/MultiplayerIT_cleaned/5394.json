Concepts such as astrodynamics, gravitational attraction, orbital speed or big words like perihelion, aphelion and Delta-V seemed absolutely incomprehensible to us if explained by a scientist or a professor with chalk and a blackboard but, when all this was inserted in a video game whose protagonists are Kerbal (funny humanoid inhabitants of the planet Kerbin) and we players were left with the pleasure of building spaceships and experimenting in absolute freedom, we understood that the vision of Felipe Falanghe (developer and main creator of the game who has been thinking about this project since he was a kid) would have been something revolutionary: it doesn't often happen that such a playful video game is acclaimed both by NASA itself and by Elon Musk, head of SpaceX (the first private company to be awarded the contract for transporting supplies to the International Space Station)! Last year, with the release of version 1.0, Kerbal Space Program left Early Access for PC but now, finally, console owners too can enjoy its arrival on Playstation 4 and Xbox one, while by the end of the This year will land on Wii U. Due to some minor distribution problems, it is currently only available on the American Playstation Store but the European release is imminent. In this article we examine the conversion work done for the black monolith from Sony (the name has never been more appropriate given the nature of the game) whose game version is updated to the latest available, 1.1.0.1157, corresponding to 1.1.3.1289 for PC which, as far as the new features are concerned, is the one that helps new players the most since it integrates the very useful Kspedia (initially it was on an external website) which can be consulted at any time within the game . As already underlined last year in the PC review, this is not a game for everyone, however we can say that we have rarely experienced, in a video game, such satisfactions as when you manage to orbit a rocket around a planet or land on a distant celestial body. Scientists, directors of an entire space program or simply builders and experimenters of planes and spaceships: Kerbal Space Program is all of this. Kerbal Space Program, the best space travel simulation finally also for PlayStation 4 Dozens of commands in one pad! The center of the action is the planet Kerbin, positioned in the habitable zone of the solar system of the star Kerbol (similar to our sun although with less mass) and it is precisely here that the buildings that are part of the spatial complex of which you are virtually are positioned top. There are three game modes, the sandbox in which you will have every object in the game available and in which the buildings are immediately at the maximum level, the science mode in which you will have to get science points by experimenting in many different ways and you will progress by unlocking an always more pieces and, finally, the most complex or the career mode in which you will have to deal with the available budget, so failing in the missions can prove fatal to the progress of the game (although it is always possible to ~rewind the tape~ and repeat the throws). The biggest obstacle to face in Kerbal Space Program is certainly the learning difficulty which, despite the new tutorials implemented in this new version, makes it a game not suitable for those who lack patience, especially for the rescue missions of adrift spaceships (and in general for all randez-vouz) for which we have literally spent hours to succeed. Even having all the pieces available in the sandbox can be quite confusing and, often, it will seem that you have built a wonderful spaceship which, however, will not even get off the ground or will not be able to keep stable after a few thousand meters; in reality, it will be enough to follow a minimum of logic and experiment to have incremental successes and get further and further. Initially, even just putting an object into orbit around Kerbin will seem like a feat but, when you become familiar with the basics, then you will reach the first visitable satellite planet, Mun (the Moon's correspondent), and perhaps you will build a base on it by transporting us of the pieces from the mother planet: only the imagination is the limit. Remembering the many commandsof the PC version we worried thinking that the DualShock 4 could never hold a candle to the keyboard and mouse - nothing could be more wrong. The Squad team has completely redesigned the system for the console version, including implementing a new icon, accessible at any time, which lists all the commands. Reading the various combinations of L1+Right stick or R1+square or circle is a bit discouraging but it only takes a few minutes of play to find them absolutely comfortable and, in many cases, much faster than those of the PC. In general, the left stick will perform the functions of the mouse and the right will control the camera by combining with the other keys for the various zoom in and zoom out or to switch from the view of the spaceship to that of the map with the orbits. The only flaw of this control system is that by default you will find yourself with the arrow that moves with the motion sensor of the pad so it will ~run away~ anywhere on the screen if you tilt or move it; fortunately, just hold down L3 for two seconds to disable this annoying function. Playstation 4 trophies Kerbal Space Program trophies are mainly based on the discoveries you will make, the contracts you will complete and all the various gaming experiences ranging from your first EVA (extravehicular activity) to reaching a distant planet. Each of them is accompanied by a witty comment or a reference to a true event in the history of space exploration. Some will be very difficult to obtain and you will only succeed when you have complete mastery of controls, vehicle construction skills and fuel calculation for a given company. A real challenge! Exploring deep space The main recipe for the success of Kerbal Space Program is certainly the ability to combine a serious and difficult subject such as space exploration (with its problems of trajectory, combustion, astrophysics, disastrous accidents) with the funny world of the eyed and big and bumpy heads and with the huge smiles they do even when they are about to crash at thousands of meters per second or when they are about to burn up due to a mistake in choosing the angle of atmospheric re-entry. Fortunately, the Kerbal power supply has been omitted, otherwise there would have become just too many elements to control in an already so complex game. The graphic style faithfully reflects the spirit just described: once you enter the spaceship construction hangar you have at your disposal fuel tanks, engines, on-board computers, scientific instruments of all shapes and sizes, each one full of details; putting your spaceship on the launch base you will seem to be in Cape Canaveral but, looking closely inside the cockpit you immediately find yourself in the minimalist and fun style of Kerbal with one or more kerbonauts who, with funny faces, move excitedly for the imminent departure if they are pilots or terrified if they are tourists or engineers. The console port of Kerbal Space Program is simply identical to the PC version in every way, including graphical glitches and texture issues that were never fully resolved and plague the game especially in camera switches or time warps. In any case, the graphic effects of the various phases of the game such as explosions, re-entry, crossing the various layers of the atmosphere or the transition from light to dark when rotating around a planet are very accurate and realistic. Even the sound effects and music tracks are identical to the ones we had already praised in the PC version. If you want to nitpick, the loading between the various phases of the game are slightly slower in fact, sometimes, there are slowdowns in the screen changes between the construction building and the launch base compared to the very recent 64-bit version -bit for the PC, which almost nullifies them: nothing really annoying anyway. Overall, this is a very good transposition. Furthermore, the courage of the Squad team to bring such a complex game to consoles is commendable. Unfortunately, Kerbal Space Program is not localized in Italian and, to tell the truth, in a game with all these elements it would have been useful; in the PC version there is a mod for the Italian language but, as happens for many other console titles, the many mods of Kerbal (see our special) are not accessible: a real bad luck for this game, given that on PC they allow both to have concrete aids and to add graphic elements that make the experience even more realistic. PlayStation 4 users can wait no longer, it's time to leave the earth to explore newand inaccessible worlds...", "date": "2016-07-21", "grade": "9.0"}
