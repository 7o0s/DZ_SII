{"name": "Pokmon Channel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-channel.html", "text": "For better programming A short introductory video explains that you have joined a TV ratings statistic of the Pokemon Channel broadcaster and allows you to familiarize yourself with the game interface immediately afterwards. It is immediately clear that you will spend most of your time watching TV (yes, the real one was not enough: now there is also the ~virtual~ one). The programs will not all be available immediately but will grow in number as you complete the vision of those accessible. The inevitable Pikachu will keep you company while watching the programs, sometimes actively participating in the show. The game interface is really basic: by means of the stick you will move the classic little hand, and when you find yourself above the sensitive areas, with the ~A~ key you will interact (by means of Pickachu) with the object in question, while with that B you will receive information about it. The TV also has some ~shortcuts~ via Pad and can be turned on and off directly by pressing the Z key. The R and L buttons will allow you to scroll through the various programs. As I let you guess, generally you will not be able to interact directly with objects, but it will be Pikachu who will perform the appropriate operation under your command: now rummaging in some points, now talking to another Pokmon. From time to time it will happen that Pickachu is distracted, and in these cases you will only have to repeat the command. It may also happen that Pickachu asks you to perform certain actions, the most classic is to turn on the television. In addition to your bedroom, you can also visit a handful of places where it is possible, among other things, to meet other Pokmon, play ball, sing, and have a nice fishing, obviously of Pokmon. All we need is De Filippi However, most of the player's attention is reserved for television. After watching the first programs you just have to ~send the audience data~, or, in simple terms, save the game. Thanks to your data, Dr. Oak will prepare new programs and give you different gadgets from time to time. Among the former there is a tool that will allow you to ~photograph~ the television screen and color it using a rudimentary graphic editor. Some programs are useful for collecting as many gadgets as possible, others will allow you to partially participate in the show, and still others will be totally passive. Among those made available at the beginning, I point out the quiz channel (where you will be asked questions about Pokmon), the Shopping channel, the TG channel, and the first episode (of 5 total) of the cartoon ~Pichu & Pichu: Pokmon in party~. All programs, like the entire game, are fully translated into Italian with good results. Through the shopping channel you can enrich your collection of stickers, wallpapers, Pokmon puppets as well as some bus tickets useful for moving to areas further away from your home. In these places you can meet other Pokmon and answer various questions to collect more stickers. In addition to the TV screen, you can also glance at the Pokmon-mini, gadgets similar to the old portable games, even smaller in size and marketed by Nintendo several years ago. The Pokmon minis are ~perfectly~ reproduced and playable: of course, you have to find them all first. In short, Pokemon Channel boils down to this: a little collecting, a little curiosity about the shows, a little questions about Pokmon. The game is based on the GameCube's internal clock, the external settings will therefore respect the real times, and even the new programs designed by dr. Oak air from set times and days. Transmission technical tests The technical realization appears to be a rather standard job. The graphics are very essential and clean, with particular attention to the Pokmon models. The colors are bright and warm, and the (few) buildings are very primitive. The sound aspect can boast the support of Dolby Prologic II (also used rather discreetly in some situations), and of the Italian dubbing for what concerns some voices of the cartoon. About the cartoon: in the first official presentations of the GameCube there was a computer graphics video showing Meotwo grappling with an electric guitar: you will find some clips of the video (if not all) in the last episode. A special mention goes to the AI of Pickachu. Yes, it really feels like the little yellow monster is following the TV with you (you have the option of watching full screen TV, or staying further away and checking Pikachu's reaction). Depending on what chand it happens in the video, Pickachu reacts in different ways: astonishment, fear, disappointment, and all in sync with what is happening in the video. If in the video a Pokmon tumbles down a tree, Pickachu will follow its fall with a ~brr~ on impact with the ground. During the quizzes he will cheer for the contestants and from time to time he will also suggest answers (whether right or wrong). It even happens that he starts playing with the buttons on the TV with all the effects that can ensue. He will also develop his motor and singing skills by following the various programs with you. The little ones will be amazed. [C] One of the late stages of Pok&egrave;mon Channel You can also visit the forest. [/C] Comment Pokemon Channel is a title dedicated exclusively to younger trainers, and there is no reason why a mature player should give even the slightest consideration to the game. On the other hand, children will be easily struck by the title, both for the illusion of ~alive~ that Pikachu manages to give to the player, and for the secondary activities of the game. The collection of gadgets, the coloring of the tables (complete with an exhibition and auctions), and the quizzes on Pokmon will be able to entertain him for a sufficiently long period, while the programs, however numerous, will run out rather quickly. Pokmon Channel is not even to be taken into consideration as an educational product, in fact, in addition to questions about Pokmon, and a specific program that teaches the child to distinguish an even number from an odd one, it offers little else. Pros: A title for the little ones. Cons: Only for the little ones! The Pokemon phenomenon reappears from time to time on the home market, and it is precisely on these occasions that designers go too far in the creation of the most extravagant concepts, as if to say that the type of game is not so important as the presence of little monsters. And so after Hey You, Pikachu! (title that allowed interaction with Pikachu via a microphone) and ~Pokmon Snap~, both released a few years ago for N64, here comes another title about Pokmon ~out of the ordinary~. What is mainly Pokemon Channel? It's not a simulation, it's not an rpg, it's not an adventure, and it's not even an educational game; but for sure it is aimed at the younger audience.", "date": "2004-05-04", "grade": null}
