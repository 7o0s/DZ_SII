{"name": "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-4.html", "text": "It smells like camel. Now in 2003 Jordan Mechner returns, already creator of the very successful first episode, and returns behind a Ubisoft-branded desk, to present us with other new adventures of the acrobat prince who has heavily redone his makeup for this round. The plot of this fourth chapter of the saga (yes in fact there was even a Prince of Persia 3D published with painful outcome in 1999) does not have particularly significant elements: the protagonist assaults the fortress of the perfidious Maharajah together with his father's army the name and background are amiably ignored, with the very noble aim of plundering the entire palace and killing the ancient sovereign. Inside the fortress, the prince discovers two very precious objects, whose enormous power will be unleashed by himself, bringing the entire kingdom to ruin and transforming the inhabitants into sand monsters. Grateful for this delicious change, all the villagers of the kingdom will gather to break the back of the beardless (and rather not very clever) protagonist, while he will try to remedy the damage caused by jumping from one platform to another. This is the story that will flow before your eyes for the approximately ten hours of gameplay offered by Ubisoft and Mr. Mechner: light but entertaining, flavored with incense and couscous. An aesthete prince. It's not just couscous that appears before our eyes as soon as we play the game. Despite the ~porting~ from the console is heavily felt and the lack of details is noted compared to other contemporary titles for PC (it would be enough to think of Mr. Payne), the graphic aspect of Prince of Persia surpasses the sufficiency by measure, touching at times levels of certain excellence. The graphics engine runs lightly, no noticeable jerks, no slowdowns and at the same time the presented scenario often passes from ~good~ to ~delicious~. It's not a technical question, but rather the wise use of color palettes, special effects and level design. All these elements are amalgamated in a remarkably (and surprisingly I would add) balanced measure in each scenario of the game, with the result that each level you visit will easily remain impressed by its scenic impact. If I had to mention some more significant detail I would have to mention the deformation effect of the water, nothing new under the sun, but decidedly well done and picturesquely effective. Within these landscapes from ~One Thousand and One Nights~ our hero moves, sliding and hopping from platform to platform more and more fluidly. It will be understood that I am going to end up with the animation of the character and even in this case my critical verve is silenced by fluid, soft and cartoonish animations worthy of the 1989 vintage prince, or better yet, worthy of some Don Bluth cartoon or Disney, your choice. Music of the East. Good food must always be accompanied by good wine and a good game must definitely have good audio to ensure the player a memorable experience. Prince of Persia certainly does not have low-level audio: as far as various sounds and effects are concerned, we are constantly above the mere sufficiency, the EAX is used adequately and all the noises produced by us and by the surrounding environment are nothing less than realistic. clear and generally well sampled. The note should be made to the soundtrack, well written and set to music, but not so good as to remain impressed as happened, just to mention, in Morrowind or in Medal of Honor. Indeed the judgment on a soundtrack is even more difficult as it is even more linked to one's subjectivity more than any other detail, despite all the Middle Eastern themes of PoP just fail to hit the target, limiting themselves to accompanying the scene, but without constituting it a decisive part. Move the prince. If we have talked about the shell so far, now it would be good to enter the heart of our little prince, to find out in the end what it is that Ubisoft brings to our shelves. The answer is a 3D arcade-platform, frequently seasoned with a series of puzzles that are absolutely within everyone's reach due to their childlike linearity and which, more than reasoning, will instigate you to dizzying sequences of acrobatic maneuvers to overcome increasingly impervious levels. The numerous fights against palace guards and sand monsters will also contort the player's phalanxes, although even here the gameplay is ~ofdisturbed by a certain simplicity one cannot fail to notice the spectacularity of the prince's movements in combat and, in any case, given the unfavorable numerical ratio, every battle won will equally give satisfaction. The automatic save system is fundamentally perfect, always intervening before each critical step, but if that weren't enough, think about the possibility of going back in time: as if you could press the ~rewind~ button on a video recorder to magically go back the wall of that ditch in which you were about to crash... if I told you more I would be guilty of ~spoilerism~ by revealing a surprise that is more pleasant to discover by yourself, but I can add that what you will find in PoP is perhaps one of the most original novelties ever introduced in an arcade, able to change the playability in a way that is as decisive as it is unexpected. There is a mole in all this splendor and it is quite evident: the control system. The appeal of the title, the realization and the playability are so great, so much is it painful to move our bold prince. The camera sometimes swerves like a drunken camel, and very often you risk losing orientation in spectacular, but too sudden and rash changes of view and/or rotations of the camera. It's a real pity it was not possible to give the PC version a more rational and functional control system, in any case this is perhaps the only objectively serious defect from which this Ubisoft title suffers. Final comment Ubisoft has definitely pampered us this year, between Raven Shield, XIII and this Prince of Persia we could say that we have been used to it all too well. As you can guess from the tone I decided to be good to the prince, to be honest I started with the idea of assigning a 7.5: this rating should be taken into consideration by anyone who hates arcades and the prince himself, demonstrating that in in any case, even outside its category, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remains a great game. For all the others, half a point more can be easily added, because despite the tenuous plot and the frequent problems in using controls, PoP is a title with masterful technical realization and a great atmosphere. The arcades have a new ruler: the prince has returned to his former magnificence. Pros: Graphically brilliant Good gameplay Cons: Confusing controls Not long-lived Fourteen long years... Year of grace 1989, what a distant time it seems to see it from the perspective of eleven years ahead. Yet I remember very well the first Prince of Persia running on my dear old 8086 with a mega of ram, a real luxury, far from the Amiga! Good old days when Broderbund Software came up with this wonderful platformer, full of atmosphere, action and technical brilliance. The animations, for the time were simply unparalleled and by themselves made up half the game, it was a triumphant success and the prince fleeing the catacombs entered the history of video games by right. Years later the Broderbunds tried again by presenting a sequel: despite the graphics in step with the times, prince number 2 soon ended up being forgotten, as a failed and somewhat pathetic attempt to repeat an all too sensational success.", "date": "2003-12-23", "grade": null}
