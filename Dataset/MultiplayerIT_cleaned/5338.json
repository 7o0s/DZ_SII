Over the generations, series such as Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport have risen to true icons, pillars of a genre which, thanks to the explosion of digital delivery and innovative financing systems, is enriching itself with works with smaller budgets. pharaonic but still able to speak to the hearts of enthusiasts. Among them are certainly the excellent Dirt Rally and the very Italian Assetto Corsa, whose brilliant success on PC has laid the foundations for console conversions, despite a particularly rigorous approach to driving dynamics. After some painful postponements and an increasingly nerve-wracking wait, also linked to the positive tests sustained during the press presentation, we finally managed to get our hands on the definitive version of Assetto Corsa for the Sony flagship. Assetto Corsa stands as a new, fierce rival of the most famous racing sagas on consoles Uppercase simulation We know Assetto Corsa very well, having grinded hundreds of hours on Steam by thoroughly stripping all the downloadable content published by the talented Kunos Simulazioni, the Roman software house proudly led by Marco Massarutto and Stefano Casillo. For this reason, before immersing yourself in reading this article, we suggest you not only go and retrieve our review for PC, but also those of the three Dream Packs released in the following months, given that the console versions basically contain all the cars and circuits included in them, for a total of about ninety cars and over twenty track configurations. It is therefore a substantial amount of content that will undoubtedly be fleshed out in the future; just think of the Japanese Pack and the Red Pack already released on PC, in addition to the awaited DLC dedicated to Porsche announced following the agreement with the historic Stuttgart house. For the record, we would like to point out that some cars are linked to the so-called Prestige Edition, and we have also noticed the removal of the Trento Bondone hill climb time trial, the less refined Assetto Corsa route. Closing the necessary premise, let's immediately answer the question that all enthusiasts have been asking themselves since the announcement of the console versions: will the depth of the physical-dynamic model and the pure driving pleasure be really up to the PC ones? The answer, after putting the simulator to the test with an excellent Thrustmaster T300 Ferrari GTE Wheel, twin of our trusty Thrustmaster TX Ferrari 458 Italia Edition, is definitely yes, although there are some simplifications that are completely understandable in the console environment. What matters, however, is that the emotions behind the wheel resulting from the control of each single vehicle are genuine, diversified and extremely satisfying, the result of painstaking work conducted by the developers on the algorithms that support tire performance, aerodynamics and other aspects fundamentals of four wheels. If you want to deepen the question, we renew the advice to read the various articles dedicated to the PC version, since the simulator has matured a lot over the months. To all this must be added the Laserscan technology applied to the tracks and the fabulous force-feedback effect, thanks to which it is possible to appreciate the slightest bumps and interferences of the asphalt for an out of the ordinary realism and involvement. It is enough to travel a couple of kilometers on the Nurburgring Nordschleife to be literally bewitched by the solidity of the work done by the Italian team, capable of making any noble racing game released on consoles pale to date. Each car has its own soul, and going from a 1964 Abarth 595 SS to a very powerful Mercedes-Benz C9 1989 LM offers a driving experience that is radically different in every respect, with a myriad of alternatives and nuances in between. Suffice it to say that two years after their PC debut, many virtual drivers are still refining their driving technique with the most difficult models to tame (who said Lotus Type 49?). As specified, on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One there are some inevitable limitations from a purely simulation point of view, for example in the management of specific technologies introduced on some cars, nevertheless the pleasure and the essence of the driving dynamics have remained intact. We are very curious to find out how the Ferrari S-F15T will be replicatedpresent in the Red Pack already launched on PC, whose more intimate management requires a plethora of commands to be set on the keyboard. Naturally it is possible to intervene on the mechanical set-up of the cars and on various parameters to adjust the depth of the simulation; these include ABS, traction control (even in real time by pressing the appropriate button), stability control, automatic clutch, fuel and tire consumption, turbo and so on. There is no question that Assetto Corsa was designed to be enjoyed with a good steering wheel, the purchase of which is warmly recommended to all players, however the good support reserved for the DualShock 4 should be underlined, which behaves very well with less nervous models and with electronic aids enabled. The Kunos Simulazioni work naturally presents various visuals, including a couple of external ones, but since it is a real simulator the only really exciting ones remain the internal ones, especially the latest one introduced on PC, which thanks to a close-up shot of the cockpit, as well as offering a wide field of view, it showcases the spectacular rendered instrumentation model, precisely replicated on each car. The simulation picture is completed by the presence of mechanical and aesthetic damage, flags and pit stops. Playstation 4 trophies Assetto Corsa presents a total of forty-two trophies, of which one in platinum called ~Sim Racer~ and linked to the conquest of all the others, two in gold, thirteen in silver and twenty-six in bronze. The bronze ones are mostly related to the completion of some series and the conquest of specific medals; The silver ones, in addition to completion targets, offer unique challenges such as beating a time of 7 minutes and 30 seconds on the Nordschleife or driving for two hours in a single session, while the golden two refer to conquering all gold medals, both in Special Events and in Career. Different twins Having ascertained the goodness of the driving model, let's focus on the other features of the console version. Let's start first with the menus, completely reworked to be consulted from the sofa with a joypad. Cleaned of the myriad of technical settings and configurations present in the PC interface, the screens are usable and easy to understand, with a series of progressive pages that guide the player step by step from the choice of mode to the arrival on the track. The accompanying music is very pleasant, which we would not mind being able to listen to even in the ~silent~ Steam edition. The main menu is divided into six main sections, namely Special Events, Guide, Career, News, Replay and the inevitable Options, where you can adjust the control system, audio and video settings relating to the field of view, the HUD and the color filter. The Special Events mode includes a hundred demanding challenges consisting of fast races, hotlaps, time attacks and drifting, in which to whip practically all the racing cars in the garage. From this point of view there are no substantial differences with the Steam version, beyond a couple of additional challenges dedicated to the Ferrari FXX K, the cover car not yet released on PC. In Special Events it is possible to adjust the level of difficulty up to the masochistic ~Alien~, while the number of laps and opponents (up to a maximum of sixteen on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One), the weather, the temperature, the and penalties, which can instead be customized in the Driving mode competitions. We remind you that Assetto Corsa does not have rain and night races, but a time window that goes from 8:00 to 18:00 and specific weather conditions such as fog and various cloud intensities. Under the substantial heading ~Guide~ the free modes are accessible such as practice, quick race, complete race (with practice and qualifying sessions), hotlap, time attack, drift and online, which we will discuss shortly. As far as the Career is concerned, we were a little amazed to find ourselves before the same as the PC, a sequence of various events which, starting from the debut series with more docile cars, goes as far as competitions with historic Formulas, to be unlocked by conquering a number of medals class after class. Unfortunately, the contents of the Dream Packs are not involved. The sense of progression is linked to the possibility of competing with increasingly powerful and exotic racing cars, but there are no economic rewards for unlocking new models and the like; overall it is a simple series of single challenges, timed races and points championships accompanied by short text descriptions and some cutscenes. If on PC such a setting was also welcomed thanks to the modular structuredesigned for mods, with myriads of custom careers flocked to dedicated sites, the console public may find it not very ~elaborate~, being used to the structures of Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport. A similar argument can be made for the online component, completely similar to the PC one, one of the features that is constantly updated and often in the sights of users. In fact, it is not possible to create rooms or organize private races, but it is necessary to ~hook~ to one of the car/track configurations proposed by the Client Server model. In simpler words, the servers offer a series of pre-established cyclical competitions where you can freely access, qualify or jump directly to the race with a simple voting system. It is a more restrictive model which should guarantee fewer latency problems, but could dissatisfy those used to managing competitions on the network in complete autonomy. From our preliminary tests, carried out after the release of a patch of about 200 Mb, the netcode was solid and efficient, but as always it is necessary to wait for the release in stores to get a more realistic picture of the situation. Sacrifices and virtues From a purely technical point of view, the console version of Assetto Corsa obviously cannot compete with the PC one, which can also be enjoyed with the wonders of 4K and virtual reality, nevertheless, net of some understandable sacrifices in terms of texture quality, shadows , polygonal and effects complexity, in particular the particle one, we are faced with a title that is certainly pleasant to see. One of the most appreciated aspects in Assetto Corsa lies in the rendering of the materials and fabrics of the interior, a detail translated with great care also on PlayStation 4, where the title runs at 1080p and sixty frames per second. The only real flaw we found is the presence of a tearing that is sometimes a little too intrusive, while the fluidity is solid overall, albeit in the most congested situations - for example on the Green Inferno with sixteen cars on track and in some replays - some drop may be felt, which fortunately never affects the enjoyment of the ride. The polygonal models of the cars are also very good, which compared to the PC ones have a more accentuated aliasing, a few less details and a rendering of the shadows with some rougher nuances. Overall, however, the general glance is satisfying and is embellished by the excellent lighting system, which enhances the realistic liveries of the racing cars. The behavior of the artificial intelligence is good, supported by the years of development conducted on the PC version, whose significant improvements have followed build after build. In reality, the Steam version and those consoles are not perfectly aligned (for example, on PlayStation 4 there is not yet the false start recently introduced on PC), however Marco Massarutto has indicated to us that a ~non-simultaneous but progressive~. The audio sector is also delightful, the flagship of Assetto Corsa especially as regards the performance of the engines, each with its own soul exactly like the reproduced cars.", "date": "2016-08-25", "grade": "9.0"}
