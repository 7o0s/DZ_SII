{"name": "Fifa 2005", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-2015.html", "text": "Honey, Fifa has shrunk for me Let's start by saying that Fifa Soccer is essentially a miniature replica of the 128-bit counterparts, with obvious graphical compromises that denote the developers' imperfect familiarity with the new hardware. But as a first attempt it remains undoubtedly impressive, everything that characterizes the latest episode of the saga has been compressed into the small umd, ready to be consumed anywhere. A complete and pleasant interface welcomes the player after a long loading (and unfortunately he won't be the only one), offering, as mentioned, all the contents that one can expect from a Fifa: possibility of playing championships, friendlies, games against another player through the wifi connection. But the real protagonist remains the boundless database, which has always been the strength of the saga, which includes the beauty of 350 licensed teams (including the Italian Serie A and B), stadiums and official sponsors, plus a series of extras that can be purchased through credits earned in matches. A large and eclectic series of musical pieces completes a decidedly luxuriant picture, perfectly designed to push the player on the field with a feeling of justified exaltation. We are facing the best Fifa ever: a balanced rhythm, satisfactory ball physics, goalkeepers who do not slip on unforgivable ducks, are all signs of a commendable effort on the part of the programmers And it is precisely on the presentation of the stadiums and the subsequent entry of the players that the capabilities of the Sony console are enjoyed. The first impact is destabilizing in the context of a laptop, and even if the peaks of Ridge Racer or Wipeout Pure are not reached, the ability of Canadian coders in adapting the polygonal engine to the Psp verb is undoubted. Footballer modeling, EA Sports signature spectacular direction, fan chants and satisfying English commentary are all worth bragging about with friends. This visual marvel even leaves room for fussiness, which teases maliciously about some less well-finished details: the sponsors on the shirts are very blurred, the polygonal simplification of the players in distant shots is annoying, the framerate betrays some uncertainty, the audience in the stands is practically immobile . Are we too strict? Perhaps. Are we facing the most graphically impressive portable football ever seen? Absolutely yes. What interests us the most, however, is the fact that Fifa Soccer is not a game on TV, but a football game, and when we talk about football games it is impossible not to think of the complexity of Winning Eleven/ Pro Evolution Soccer, which has been a thorn for years in the side for the EA Sports saga, which has gone through countless playful forms uncertain between an arcade immediacy and the simulation rigor. Freestyle mania Yet, like the 2005 edition, we are facing the best Fifa ever: a balanced pace, satisfactory ball physics, goalkeepers who do not commit unforgivable ducking, are all signs of a commendable effort on the part of the programmers, the step forward to the mess of past editions it is tangible. Shooting no longer requires the unbridled tapping of the key assigned to the action, the players cover the positions credibly, offering even rather complex game plots, moreover the ~one man show~ effect of the previous chapters has been significantly reduced, which put the acrobatics of the individual rather than a team chorus. Unfortunately, however, there are also shadows that it is impossible not to highlight, in particular the control system. The desire to adapt the freestyle system of the 128-bit versions on the PSP keys leads to cumbersome control. For those unfamiliar with this feature, we specify that it is a system for performing special moves, originally designed for the right analog stick of the pad. On Psp these moves are managed by the directional cross, forcing the player to alternate the thumb between the latter and the analog stick, not exactly intuitive. As a consequence, the less persevering will soon do without it, significantly flattening the gameplay. It was difficult to think of a better key mapping than this, but a simplification adapted to the possibilities of the Sony handled would have been desirable, perhaps not limiting the movements of the players to the analog stick (not very convenient in this context). Everything that characterizes the latest episode of the saga has been compressed into the small umd, ready to be consumed anywhere Freestyle mania We must also include among the defects the small pauses that occur before the interlude scenes in the game, of course these increase the realism and the show, but their loading blocks the gameco for a few seconds, for example when a footballer misses his shot on goal, quite annoying. It is probably a non-optimal management of the Psp hardware, also in this case EA Sports pays for haste and inexperience on the new Sony hardware, so let's hope for filings in the European edition. Fifa Soccer is currently the best football simulation available on the Psp, thanks also to almost no competition (World Tour Soccer cannot compete). All the features of the 128-bit counterparts are at your fingertips, it must be said. Unfortunately it is downsized by the haste and inexperience of programmers with the new hardware. The graphic impact is impressive, but necessary technical compromises must be accepted, which lead to long loading times and irritating pauses in the game. And it's a shame, because many of the gameplay problems that plagued previous editions are now a distant memory. If you are willing to overlook these factors (and a somewhat cumbersome freestyle system), what remains is a fun football simulation, certainly indebted in many respects to the Konami one, but benefiting from greater accessibility and, above all, a database/ truly unattainable licenses. Nonetheless, this is a promising start from EA Sports. Pros: Official licenses and teams in quantity A real pocket Fifa A step forward compared to previous episodes Cons: Cumbersome feint control Irritating pauses during matches Still far from the Konami series Review of the NTSC version UsaEA Sports has never missed the opportunity to bring its sports brands to new platforms, and considering the close relationship between the new Sony portable jewel and Playstation 2, it was reasonable to expect conversions in record time. Among these, Fifa certainly could not be missing, an extremely popular football saga and a good exponent for the diffusion of Psp in Europe. What we have in our hands is the American edition, certainly indicative of what we will find in that pal.", "date": "2005-07-07", "grade": null}
