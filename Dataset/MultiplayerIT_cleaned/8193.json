Downloaded by tens of millions of people, it has transformed a small independent company into one of the most successful software houses on the world stage. As always, the idea behind the game was squeezed to the bone with expansions and additional episodes that simply changed the setting and introduced some new ~angry bird~, see Angry Birds Seasons and Angry Birds Rio. Then it was the turn of Angry Birds Space, which introduced important innovations in the gameplay that we all know thanks to the speech of orbits and gravitational forces of attraction. Now, about eight months later, after the important parenthesis of Bad Piggies (which we hope doesn't stay that way, of course), Rovio is back to work on the franchise, linking it to another brand with... stellar appeal. When Angry Birds Star Wars was announced, we all thought of a pure and simple commercial operation, a product essentially the same as the others which, however, thanks to the characters created by George Lucas, could once again count on millions and millions of downloads. Is this the truth? Not exactly, because luckily there is more than mere commercial discourse behind this game, which probably stands as the best Angry Birds ever. Not the least expensive, mind you: to the 89 cents needed to buy it (99 on Windows Phone, while on Android, as per tradition, the game is free) you have to add 1.79 euros to unlock the contents of the third scenario, ~Path of the Jedi~, while another free update (~Hoth~) is coming soon. However, the solutions found by Rovio to enrich the experience worked great, giving us something unexpected. A long time ago, in an aviary far, far away... The classic protagonists of Angry Birds, which everyone knows by now, are transformed into Angry Birds Star Wars characters from ~Star Wars~. And so here is the well-known red bird with Luke Skywalker's hair and his lightsaber, the yellow one dressed like Han Solo while wielding a gun, the black hooded bird who ~plays~ Obi Wan Kenobi and has the ability to use the Force to move objects; and again R2-D2's ~metallic~ bird, capable of roasting targets with an electric shock, or his inseparable companion C3-PO, who ~disassembles~ on command, and then Chewbacca, Princess Leia .. no one is missing, while of course the Storm Troopers and the evil Darth Vader are actually mischievous little pigs. The presence of special abilities for each bird represents the most important novelty of the gameplay, given that it effectively manages to mix the cards on the table and allows us to resolve the various situations in different ways. In some stages, for example, the enemies will have attack positions or will shoot themselves in our direction, but we will be able to deflect their lasers to use them to our advantage, for example by moving a metal object or impacting shots with Luke's sword. The physics of the materials remains the same as always, with wood and glass that fall apart quite easily, while steel resists more substantial impacts. It's especially fun to throw the little bird Han Solo, since with his gun he can knock out not only the target he will physically reach, but also other opponents reached by his fire. Another important element is added to this, namely the bivalence of the missions, which alternate classic-type scenarios with Angry Birds Space-style space settings, complete with ~planets~ and gravitational forces to be considered at each launch. As it was reasonable to expect, the technical sector can count on the sounds and music of the ~Star Wars~ saga, but also in terms of graphics there are evident improvements, with the objects flowing in ~parallax~ when we move the view up one level. The only drawback: on the iPhone you are very often forced to zoom-out extremes in order to view the trajectories in full.", "date": "2012-11-12", "grade": "8.5"}
