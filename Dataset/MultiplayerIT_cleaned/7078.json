The first episode of Fuga was not a commercial success: despite a big hug from the community, a fair amount of goodwill from the press and a legacy full of passion from the Solatorobo team, the box office was not favorable to Malt and co. . However, it was enough to convince CyberConnect2 to continue the journey undertaken, not stopping at the first obstacle, telling the story of a whispered world through simple artwork, a barely sketched dubbing. The Japanese team simply did what everyone, basically, should do: do not adapt the ambitions of a project with the real sales prospects and ignore them, in defiance of any commercial adviser. Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 follows the structure of the first episode in an almost analogous way, with some nice additions and gimmicks to color a fascinating and touching journey, even more mature than the first. A tale of revenge The parties aboard the Tarascus will serve to develop ties with the team: take advantage of them, the opportunities are limited If the first Fuga is comparable to the story of a group of small anthropomorphic heroes fighting against an evil empire, with a rather sweet and delicate progression, the second chapter immediately starts off like a rocket with a total distortion of the status quo: the Tarascus, a chariot demonic weapon of the first Fuga, it becomes the group's vehicle of struggle against the Taranis, the weapon that helped Malt and his friends to defeat the empire. An obscure character, a distant world and old characters arrive on a stage that doesn't give up on transmitting the atrocities of war, the difficulties of the peoples who suffer it but doesn't even stop telling the deeds of small and sweet fighters, matured since the first trip and , unfortunately, faced with an incredible desire for revenge. Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 brings together again the direction and photography of the first Fuga, delivering to fans a product which, between the warmth and sweetness of a childish cast, fascinates and charms, pushing forward an interesting and never banal narrative ball. If the first chapters will make you feel aboard a chariot in a desperate race, get ready for an even more marked and merciless crudity: perhaps, from this point of view, Fuga 2 is more similar to a traditional JRPG in terms of narrative setting, less focused on an all-out and more vertical war on an ethereal type of narrative, which comes from afar: we liked the choice to differentiate, the team was able to not trivialize itself in an obvious re-proposition. CyberConnect 2 has been able to offer a different key to the setting, its characters and their growth, orchestrating interesting and sometimes unexpected twists. Airships and emotions The structure of this sequel follows the setting of the first episode: those who know the franchise will feel at home Perhaps the greatest lack of the first Fuga was precisely the absence of flight, of air, of the journey between islands so dear to those who arrived in this world from Solatorobo. This time, the team has decided to integrate the airships, albeit not in a marked way, allowing for variations to the classic one-way route management: the ship can take us back to some areas of the progress line to make us replay sections, or attack of enemies along the way. The gimmick blends perfectly with the addition of the Managram, the Tarascus cannon, which unlike the Taranis weapon - which sacrificed a character - does not completely kill the sacrificial victim, but cancels the collection of experience for that battle and destroys the morale of the team, making Link Events, the moments in which to increase the bond with the members, impossible. If you were wondering if combat and tank management had remained unchanged, the answer is yes: the clashes are always turn-based, with management of active and passive skills, weak points of enemies, special shots and Hero mode. Even here, however, there is a new gimmick: during the game, Malt will have to make choices, which will move his personal personality bar towards understanding or determination. Depending on how we develop the protagonist, we will unlock passive skills that will be activated randomly, helping us in the clashes. Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 is reconfirmed to be very solid: the combat system is even more galvanizing, brutal, strategic and full of possibilities, just as the exploration of cities and ruins have been enriched and made denser, more similar to expectations from JRPGs. Instead, we can confirm the absence of English dubbing (Japanese and French only) and theability to speed up the progress of the Tarascus, absolutely welcome addition for the second, third and who knows how many trips you'll be making.", "date": "2023-05-29", "grade": "8.5"}
