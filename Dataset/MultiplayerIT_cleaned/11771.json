However, where the latter was a pure arcade, where teams of two players challenged each other with dunks and sci-fi moves, this Kobe Bryant Pro Basketball 2008 instead chooses the path of realism, proposing real NBA formations and a more ~serious~ play structure ~. Gameloft's intentions can already be understood from the list of modes: the game offers a massive season made up of 80 games (faithful reproduction of the real championship), the inevitable Exhibition Mode and a section dedicated to three-point shooting competitions, to be carried out by challenging the clock or a human opponent. All inclusive of a mountain of names, figures, statistics and tactics, all strictly official and which will certainly delight fans. As already seen with the ~cousin~ Real Football, Gameloft has however tried to combine the search for a satisfactory level of realism with a gameplay that was both complete and immediate, and once again we can say that the goal has been achieved . Much of the credit goes to the control system, decidedly efficient while using the least number of keys possible: in addition to moving with the directional cross (or with the equivalent '2', '4', '6', and '8' ), the user can make passes, steal the ball and block using the '5' key, perform a special move with '*' and finally shoot with the '0'. Also in the latter case the dynamics are absolutely intuitive, in fact it is sufficient to stop the appropriate indicator inside the green zone to send the ball to the basket (obviously the segment decreases as one moves away from the board). Kobe Bryant Pro Basketball 2008 is also very accurate with regard to some ancillary aspects: therefore there are replays for each slam dunk performed and the so-called ~shots of desperation~ which are unlocked in the event of a tie at the end, just to name two . The attention to detail is also reflected in the graphics of the product, which are truly excellently made: the various arenas offer scenarios with attention to the smallest details, with lots of spectators in the stands and benches on the sidelines. However, it is in the sprites of the athletes and in their animations that the Gameloft title excels, reaching qualitative peaks that easily outclass those of the (few) other games of the genre in circulation. The sound is also good, however limited to the effects of the ball, the shouts of the public and some music that underlines the most spectacular points PRO Solid play structure Suitable for both experts and novices Top notch graphics AGAINST Obviously not rigorous simulation", "date": "2007-12-03", "grade": "S.V."}
