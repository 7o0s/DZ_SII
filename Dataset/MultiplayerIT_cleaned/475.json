{"name": "Recensione Flatout 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-flatout-2.html", "text": "It is extremely difficult to judge a title that comes out between two generations. Although the technical appeal does not represent the identity of a title, at least not completely, on these occasions it is natural to wonder what the same title developed using the new technologies available would be like. In part, the Bugbears escape this difficulty by continuing in their race to dust off the destruction derby and managing, despite the now evident limitations of last generation technology, to enrich an already commendable game engine. Comment Flatout 2 is a good arcade, with its flaws and its strengths, enriched by a physics engine capable of significantly spectacularizing it and by a graphics engine capable of amplifying the gaming experience of the prequel. This recipe makes it a title endowed with meaning capable of having its own space in the market and its own slice of admirers especially considering the lack of titles of this kind that afflicts this generational transition. Unfortunately, despite the impressive enrichment work and the obvious effort of Bugbear, Flatout 2 does not offer relevant innovations related to the game structure and the small tweaks made here and there are not able to eliminate the defects already found in the first title. Obviously it is an unmissable title for fans of destruction arena, derbies and similar activities and I think I can also recommend it to dispassionate arcade lovers especially if they haven't had the opportunity to play the first Flatout. Pros: demolition and physics engine together sixty rather varied tracks more mature graphics engine Cons: sometimes excessively uncontrollable better artificial intelligence but still schematic In detail The structure is always that of the old Off Road mixed with the wildest arcade. In simplistic terms Flatout 2 is about dosing the turbo and calculating the drift of the vehicle which often splashes on the track like a bar of soap on an oil stain. More than the greater attention to design and the enrichment of each compartment, what gives Flatout 2 an edge is the increase in elements sensitive to the laws of physics. The tracks are literally teeming with objects, bins, barricades and above all with buildings, bridges and architectural objects ready to explode into pieces as we pass. Obviously the destruction of the track, as well as the demolition of the opposing vehicles, guarantees the recharging of the nitro, the turbo in practice, which in Flatout 2 plays a leading role and a resource to be dosed with extreme care. In fact, the difficulty has grown fairly well and the opposing pilots have been characterized in such a way as to have a more or less recurring behavior and to balance a rather lacking artificial intelligence. The first effect of this choice consists in meeting pilots determined to slow us down and pilots who think only of crossing the finish line first and the pursuit of a precise objective avoids the annoying phenomenon of situations of paperwork which, in Flatout, ended up annoying us or , sometimes, made our race too easy with opponents busy bumping into each other unnecessarily. Unfortunately there is still an exaggerated difficulty in keeping certain vehicles stable. a choice that I would have appreciated when faced with more technical and less bumpy courses and which sometimes translates into situations of loss of control that completely escape the player's possibilities and skills and irreparably compromise a race causing a creeping and annoying feeling of helplessness. With the naked eye The technological improvements can be seen with the naked eye, both in terms of the number of details and polygons present on the screen, and in terms of the vehicle models, which are less crude and decidedly more refined. Credible vegetation, rocky gorges, suspension bridges and a large number of objects, decidedly higher than that found in the predecessor, literally fill the tracks of Flatout 2 giving a very particular credibility to the world around us. And despite the significant increase in parts, debris and destructible structures, the engine shows no signs of failure, on any platform, and remains fluid in all circumstances. The soundtrack is characterized by famous names among which Nickelback, Rob Zombie and Supergrass stand out and perfectly marries the burglar and carefree atmosphere of the title. Scuffs, roars and impacts, especially the latter, enjoy an extremely varied sampling and are able to drop us right in the middle of the track. What is obvious, even from a purely technical point of view, is that the physics engine remains the prominent element of Flatout, as far as the weightor relative of objects is precisely relative. But in the midst of the chasm the fact that objects take off spectacularly is more a virtue than a defect, at least in the Bugbear title, and we will hardly stop to brood over the fact that a piece of wood and a boulder of stone shouldn't flutter in the air in the same way. Cross-platform The gaming experience is almost unchanged on all platforms and the game engine is fluid and without uncertainties. In some situations there are hints of clipping in the distance that are slightly more marked in the PS2 version. Flatouts 2 x Between rock solos and songs by artists like Rob Zombie or Nickelback we find ourselves once again in the mud and dust committed to maintaining control of masses of incandescent metal, shot at full speed along rather unstable paths and populated by opponents anxious to reduce us into a mass of scrap. The game structure is almost identical to the one encountered in the first Flatout and the lion's share is always played by the physics engine capable of making every race and every confrontation spectacular. Once again we find a series of circuits set in the different US climatic zones and we also find the first advantage of Flatout 2. In fact, the design of the tracks is certainly more refined both from an aesthetic and a technical point of view. The proliferation of double curves, canyons, jumps and bottlenecks full of obstacles makes the task of reaching the finish line particularly difficult and we have as many as 60 goals to cross, some of which are placed in rather wild areas such as the forests of the Rocky Mountains. The number of routes is not the only factor to grow in this sequel which seems oriented towards the most unbridled enrichment of the first Flatout. The mini-games become 12, always all oriented towards the exploitation of the game's physics engine. Target shooting is back, carried out with the pilot launching through the windshield, and more complex disciplines such as baseball are added. In any case, the common denominator is the indiscriminate and sadistic use of the body of the unfortunate pilot launched towards objectives and targets of all sorts. The destruction derby arenas are also inevitable, where, in the absence of a path to win, the sole purpose remains to destroy the opponents and keep a few bolts of our racing car attached to the bodywork. The arenas also increase in number and variety with ups and downs and obstacles designed to generate orgiastic accidents of sure impact and the number of available vehicles grows, enriched by rather extravagant models of muscle cars and vans equipped with aeronautical jets. Finally, we also find a change that has nothing to do with the quantitative sphere and it is the possibility of owning multiple vehicles at the same time, it is a non-radical but rather relevant change for the game experience that allows us to change vehicles and racing strategy depending on the route ahead. The 8-player multiplayer completes the picture of a title that, while not revolutionizing itself, grows substantially in content and this mode is the first to benefit from the increase in arenas and vehicles.", "date": "2006-06-05", "grade": null}
