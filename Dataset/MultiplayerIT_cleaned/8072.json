{"name": "Galassie isometriche", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/112614-drox-operative-galassie-isometriche.html", "text": "From the origins of the video game to today, the hack & slash genre has crossed several borders, merging with strategy, flowing into fighting games and mixing on several levels with role-playing games. But with Drox Operative the acclaimed genre takes a cosmic leap by bringing the typical gameplay of the genre into space. Obviously there is no shortage of drops of increasing quality, stash, levels, upgrades of all kinds and tons of enemies to be slaughtered in sequence. Furthermore, the view remains the usual one, isometric, but there are no terrains or dungeons in the background, but a blanket of stars, with the reference points that are represented by suns, planets and space-time anomalies. The games of the title created by Soldak take place, in fact, within randomly generated solar systems that represent scenarios to be completed in succession. Levels populated not only by monsters but also by races, initially neutral, intent on expanding their domain. A possible evolution of the genre To the classic hack & slash gameplay, Drox Operative therefore adds a strategic component that allows us to also pursue peaceful objectives by influencing diplomatic relations between the races that contend for a solar system. These have a ~character~ that determines their behavior and this means that sometimes it is not possible to come to terms, given the aggressive attitude of some factions. But when the actors involved in the space dispute are willing to reason, it is also possible, by working on diplomacy, to obtain victory without going through the destruction of the rival forces. To influence diplomatic relations it is possible both to use exchanges, based on objects obtained by massacring enemies, and to defend the planets of a faction, and to attempt espionage, sabotage or propaganda actions. Another interesting activity is undoubtedly to complete the various missions obtainable in the allied planets. These can range from the colonization of a planet, carried out automatically by stationing on it, up to the annihilation of an entire race. But the possibilities for action are not lacking even when all races in a game are at peace. In fact, the galaxy is always full of generic enemies, marauders and furious aliens who roam between anomalies and old space stations to shoot us down and plunder us. The complexity increases when one faction begins to attack the neighbors and the others, in return, ask for our help. Obviously, intervening means creating enemies but, in the case of less diplomatic teams, even the lack of intervention can be considered an offense capable of deteriorating relations. Finding a balance, therefore, is not always easy. Furthermore, when the enemies become too numerous, survival becomes a difficult matter, especially when the level of our spaceship is still low. But death is an integral part of the gameplay, as in any hack & slash, and includes respawn accompanied by a malus to experience points. Furthermore, as the level goes up, the use of force becomes more and more convenient, even if the difficulty increases as the level increases and it is said that destroying everything that moves is not the most satisfactory and functional way. Without allies, in fact, it is not possible to carry out exchanges or accept new missions and this limits financial income forcing us, among other things, to hang around a shield recharging station to survive, given that there are no allied forces to defend us. In any case, the presence of a strategic component greatly broadens the horizons of the game even if it is based on simple and largely random mechanics. In short, we find ourselves in the role of simple mercenaries in a spatial micro-universe that is largely managed independently. Furthermore, the dynamism of the context and the variety of situations are counterbalanced by a rather significant lack. Having generic and all similar spatial systems as a setting, in fact, leads to an evident lack in terms of variety and exploratory possibilities. The maps, or the solar systems that make up a galaxy, are circumscribed oval areas outside which there is cosmic nothingness. The only thing that changes is the arrangement of the planets present in the different systems which end up looking alike both within the same game and when we create a new galaxy. But Drox Operative, despite being less courageous than it appears at first, still manages to bring an imprint of originality to the genre and opens up interesting prospects for the future, highlighting how MOBAs and the like are only one of the possible evolutions of the RPG in a key action. Small important differences The spa settingThis game, which involves the use of spaceships, also involves some differences in relation to the hack & slash mechanics. Mines, ballistic projectiles and guided lasers respect the canons of the genre and work well thanks to the spot-on timing. Furthermore, the percentage of critical or off-target hits is not only linked to aiming but also to a virtual dice roll as for RPGs and fantasy hack & slash. But the trajectories of movement of the ships must be added to the classic formula, necessarily less free than those of a Diablo & co character, which can be exploited to escape the opponent's blows or attract him to an atomic mine. Furthermore, even if the formula is close to that of the classics of the genre, complete with a four-player cooperative and object exchanges, the management of equipment and skills is not the same. In fact, in the Soldak title there are no classic skills but the spaceship's possibilities of action are determined by a series of devices to be installed in the respective slots of the vessel. These spaces are shared with the other elements of the equipment, such as the skin of the spaceship: this involves extreme freedom but also forces us to choose whether to focus on a greater number of weapons, on increasing maneuverability or on the solidity of the defense . But there is another limitation that involves armaments and it is an energy bar which, once depleted, prevents us from firing. Furthermore, to mount ever more powerful components it is also necessary to install auxiliary energy sources which also occupy equipment slots. This setting guarantees a fair variety and, at the same time, prevents our spaceship from being upgraded too quickly. Nothing revolutionary, mind you, but the choice is decidedly functional in giving longevity to a title which, once the strategic scenarios have been exhausted, relies almost completely on upgrading the spaceships through levels and equipment improvements. The maps, however, while inevitably poor, have some elements to take into account. It starts from the gravitational well of the stars, which slows down the spaceships becoming a relevant element for the gameplay, to arrive at numerous spatial phenomena, scattered around the map, which can hide objects of great value, lurking enemies and anomalies that lead us to interdimensional filled with enemies. In any case, the mechanics are the central point of the title which does not even allow too much space for graphics. Not that Drox Operative is bad to look at: the graphics are technically poor and the spaceships are not particularly inspired, but lights, explosions and lasers are taken care of and are undoubtedly the most important elements given the preponderance of the fights. Furthermore, the minimum hardware requirements, i.e. Pentium 4 and GeForce 2, are meager to say the least.", "date": "2013-01-02", "grade": "7.8"}
