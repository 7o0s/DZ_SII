{"name": "De Blob - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/de-blob-recensione.html", "text": "Coloring is power From its narrative premises, de Blob appears as a product endowed with great personality: the story revolves around the evil intentions of the INKT Corporation, which - led by General Black - has sucked up all the colors from the lively Croma City, transforming it into a metropolis gray and sad. The protagonist Blob enters the scene here, who joins the subversive movement of the Chromatic Rebels in order to restore the city to its original appearance and to save its citizens. The primary purpose of the game is therefore to roam around ten vast scenarios and paint as many buildings as possible, taking advantage of Blob's innate ability to take on different colors and to extend them to every surface simply by coming into contact with it. To do this, it is necessary to stock up on paint, an operation made possible by the presence of numerous little robots loaded with red, yellow and blue tanks: by running over these automatons, Blob takes on the corresponding color and gains ten color points, a value that can get up to 100 and that determines the energy and greatness of our protagonist. However, the choice of paint is not a random fact: beyond the fact that it is possible to mix the three primary colors to obtain other colors (orange, green, purple and brown), there are various factors which stimulate the user to reward the variety. The game therefore awards a quantity of points proportional to the number of colors used to paint particular portions of the scenario, while some missions require the exploitation of a particular color on specific objectives. And yes, because the Croma City scenarios are underpinned by indicators concerning missions assigned by the various members of the Chromatic Rebels: in addition to the situation described above, one can therefore find oneself having to knock down a certain number of enemies in a limited time, to make a race checkpoints and so on, in a set that adds panache and variety to the game but which manifests a certain repetitiveness in the long run. The main Story Mode is then subject to some rules that contribute to giving further pace to the user's progress: there is therefore a time limit to respect, which however can be fleshed out by completing objectives and missions, and a scoring system that requires reaching certain steps to unlock new areas to explore. Add to all this the great variety of bonuses to collect, extras to unlock and achievements to obtain and it will be easy to understand how de Blob is also a product with a high replay value, despite the basic longevity already reaching quite high levels (keeping consider the main ten levels and the secondary ones). To the detriment of appearances, the work Blue Tongue is not a ~simply~ lively and light-hearted platform game, perhaps to give to your younger brother: in fact, under an apparent subtlety there is a challenging gameplay, especially in the more advanced levels, where the structural complexity of the internships and the difficult achievement of some objectives will give even the most experienced users a hard time. Author blobs In addition to the freshness of the concept and the solidity of the play structure, de Blob can count on a respectable technical realization, which significantly contributes to the global appeal of the product. From the first moments, the impact with the cosmetics of the title is excellent, thanks to the CG intro and the cutscenes that open the curtain on each of the game levels: beyond the good technical values demonstrated by Blue Tongue in this coveted, the stylistic value of these sequences is particularly high, with funny characters and comic situations that on more than one occasion have brought to mind the famous Pixar short films. Everything proceeds on very high qualitative peaks even during the in-game phases: de Blob makes the most of the Wii characteristics, focusing little on the polygonal complexity and pressing on the accelerator of the use of colors and the goodness of the animations. Blob, the members of the Chromatic Rebels, the citizens of Croma City and the minions of INKT seem to come straight out of a cartoon, their movements have been cured for a long time. But obviously the colors are the highlight of the whole package: seeing the city that gradually comes to life thanks to Blob's painting is a real show, to the point that we often find ourselves painting substantially useless portions of the scenery for the simple sake of do it: all leaving out small touches of class such as the color trails left by the passage of the protagonist, or the real chromatic explosions caused by some power-ups. The sound also plays its part, with funky music that accompanies the action without ever getting boring, emphasizing the achievementnto Blob targets with rapid intensity spikes. Especially in the light of the care taken by Blue Tongue in many key aspects of the production, it is sad to note however that the attention of the developers has been overlooked on a couple of elements that would have deserved some more precautions. We refer first of all to the control system, and in particular to the management of the jumps: while to move Blob it is sufficient to act on the stick of the Nunchuck, to make a leap one is called to shake the Remote towards the other, an initially pleasant operation but which it is very tiring and imprecise in the long run, leading to some frustration. Again, the virtual camera does not always prove to be reliable, and although it is possible to rotate it via the D-Pad and bring it behind the protagonist using the C key, especially in the more advanced levels, its shortcomings can prevent the correct display of objectives or bonuses. Finally, a last criticism must be leveled at the lack of effective indicators that suggest to the user the targets of the mission in progress: here too, we are dealing with a problem that mainly concerns the second part of the adventure, where it is not uncommon to find yourself wandering without destination in search of what to do. Gaps that prevent de Blob from a higher evaluation, but which do not affect its usability that much: the Blue Tongue work therefore remains a purebred platformer, perhaps a little repetitive but commendable for the originality that leads to a genre often inflated. The developers should also be given credit for not limiting themselves to the game content: in addition to the Story Mode, there is a Free Painting section, a multiplayer part with four different mini-games (a bit impromptu but still fun) and an Extra mode where view artwork, movies and the like unlocked during the adventure. Comment Even if it cannot properly be defined as a sleeper hit (as evidenced by the awards received in the last sector fairs), de Blob is certainly a nice surprise, which moreover happens in a not too happy moment for Wii owners looking for a platformer up to it. The Blue Tongue work is therefore very respectable, both in terms of the technical realization and above all as regards the gameplay, simple to assimilate but which demonstrates an unsuspected depth in the more advanced levels. A certain basic repetitiveness and some gross oversights hold back de Blob's glorious advance towards higher peaks, but one can definitely ~satisfy~...
