Pocket Trap's approach is that of a small studio that evidently has a passion for My Hero Academia: the school where Otto and his companions find themselves throwing balls between their teeth, for cast and humor, refers a lot to Horikoshi's manga. There are no superheroes or bad guys, but the common thread between academia, characterization of the characters and challenges with superpowers traces a palette capable of transmitting a lot of fun and summer freshness. There is something in this dodgeball developed by the Brazilians that works damn well: it mixes match duration, frequency of clashes, speed and dynamism with balance, it tells an enjoyable story, it creates a small ecosystem that works and somehow refers in style and gameplay to some sacred monsters like Paper Mario and Windjammers. In dodgeball school The bucolic landscapes of Dodgeball Academia Otto was supposed to be a referee, but his passion for the dodgeball (or dodgeball, or dodgeball) leads him to try his luck in the best existing school on the discipline. Here he meets friends and enemies, but above all he begins an adventure that in its dozen hours takes him around the campus with different things to do. We have just translated into synopsis the tutorial that allows you to discover casts and game flows: as per RPG tradition, the emphasis has been placed on playing games, going around buildings, improving equipment and wandering around the map, even if the exploration is definitely the weakest aspect of the title. Perhaps it is the result of a lack of ambition or perhaps of a precise design choice: having set the game in a few areas leads to immediate familiarity with the geography, simplifying orientation and fast forward, but unfortunately the map runs out of some speed its offer. One of the characters from Dodgeball Academia The gameplay of the Dodgeball Academia newspaper is relatively simple: a tournament as a macro-event in which to advance day by day, a main quest connected to it to mark the days, scattered missions, improvements to be developed and some bins with surprises to break . It is a choice of progression that assimilates quickly and keeps the pace high, without disorienting the player and accompanying him thanks to a simple management of points of interest: the map provides indications of progress, quests and challengers ready to throw balls. Protagonist and supporting actors work, the dialogues are from a medium light-hearted brilliant indie game, the school has its routines and the progression is natural, it has the right distances, correct times and pleasantly nice situations. Too bad for some frame drops here and there, but it's a minor thing; even the equipment didn't galvanize us as much as we'd hoped. Position dodgeball Dodgeball Academia Special Shots We now come to the central point, dodgeball: simple as a concept, intelligent as an implementation, the sport around which the work of Pocket Trap revolves is functional to a dynamic gameplay made up of reflexes, dodges, timing and release, capable of not tiring and Not to exaggerate. The rule is nothing more than playing team against team to throw balls at the others, with many variables: there are charged shots, special shots, dodges, the possibility of sending an ally to the other side of the small field to annoy behind the opponents, crazy balls, elemental balls, skill challenges. There is good variety, it must be said: you can pass the ball, block it, kick it back with a kick or a baseball bat and so on. Each character has its own characteristic, values that can be increased with the use of consumable items, a sequence of skills and improvements that can be unlocked by leveling up. Dodgeball Academia is a small but complete role-playing game that certainly shines in the most interesting phase, just dodgeball: the gameplay is fun and balanced, capable of gradually increasing in difficulty. It must be said that, in the face of a balanced progress between main and secondary quests, very, very little is lost in Dodgeball Academia. It's a shame? Not necessarily, but it would have been nice, sometimes, a slightly higher difficulty coefficient. Your own team stats in Dodgeball Academia As logical as it was, the depth is unfortunately not sufficient to prevent the game from being able to continue using practically always the protagonist, going to the remaining characters only in the event of Otto's defeat. There is, it is a non-trivial differentiation prerogative to manage and which composesta lot of work by a team in providing sufficient obstacles and ideas capable of forcing a change of main player, however it would have been an excellent incentive to vary. Artistic side, the characters are good, the environments are not very good: in the face of a good direction regarding the 2D character design, the detachment with the rest of the 3D production is quite evident, but it is also the result of the production level with obvious limitations. The lot is completed by a versus mode - also multiplayer - with all the options to customize the clash and a soundtrack that accompanies it discreetly.", "date": "2021-08-08", "grade": "7.8"}
