Quite unexpectedly, the idea worked perfectly and the Bluehole game, which started as a simple mod of Arma II, has become a mass phenomenon. From here to the arrival of the clones, nowadays, the step is short: in recent months we have witnessed the birth of emulators, modes that follow the mechanics of the game within other titles and recently also mobile games, which alongside the full-fledged portable PlayerUnknown's Battleground, which is also on its way. So here is Rules of Survival, which also arrives almost simultaneously with another title with a completely similar structure, called Knifes Out and incredibly published by the same publisher, or NetEase, albeit by a different team. This just to give an idea of the invasion that awaits us in the immediate future as regards the Battle Royale of this type, and there are already others that we are not going to mention. In any case, Rules of Survival seems to be the slightly more accurate and complete proposal among all those that have emerged in recent days, waiting to see the official PlayerUnknown's Battleground in mobile format, therefore it can give a more precise idea of what they can aspire to titles of this type on these platforms and the public response, at least in terms of server population, seems to be positive for the moment. However, the structure is the same: you choose a character and decide whether to play alone or in a team, then you are parachuted into a large game map with a total of 120 players scattered around the setting. Once they hit the ground there is only one rule: eliminate each other until there is only one fighter left standing.

Last man standing All in all it is a mobile transposition of remarkable fidelity compared to the original, were it not for the fact that it should be a different game. In short, Rules of Survival is a shameless clone of PlayerUnknown's Battleground, but at least it's a very well done clone considering the limitations of the platforms it runs on. The basic mechanics and game situations are the same as the phenomenal PUBG Corp title, with the vast open map to explore to collect weapons and equipment, the need to periodically leave the forbidden areas and the action that progressively concentrates in a smaller and smaller portion of the setting, forcing the 120 players parachuted into it into close battles, until only one remains. The game is a third-person shooter that allows you to explore outdoor areas and buildings, even with the possibility of using vehicles if you find any that work within the map. The main limitation of Rules of Survival is the control system, usually a huge bottleneck for all titles that try to re-propose an action mechanic transposed directly from other platforms to mobile devices: the chosen solution is a sort of virtual double stick with various keys to press shown superimposed on the screen, something that turns out to be decidedly uncomfortable in the most agitated phases (that is, as soon as you meet an enemy) also because you tend to cover part of the interface with your hands or press some keys by mistake, this at least as regards the use on smartphones and not very large screens. In general, however, the response to the commands is not optimal even on tablets, where, however, the grip is particularly uncomfortable. Some inconsistency in the frame-rate further complicates things, even if the technical flaws can almost be considered a stylistic code of this sub-genre, at this point: the realization of the game world and of the characters is remarkable, considering the claim ofadopt graphics in a realistic style, but there are currently some pop-up and texture management problems that could still be corrected with future updates, while fluidity drops in the most demanding stages even regardless of the graphics settings adopted, although it is a rather minor problem. The interface is confusing and unpleasant but all in all it does its job without causing too many problems, it should also be noted that Rules of Survival is distributed as free-to-play and, at least for the moment, does not seem to hide elements of importance the gameplay behind sneaky paywalls.", "date": "2017-12-15", "grade": "6.8"}
