There were some slight nicks which were fixed and we could finally hear the voice acting of all the characters, but we realized with some regret that the experience turned out to be much shorter than expected. Started off in an interesting light, Willy's journey to lift the veil behind his father's mysterious disappearance ten years earlier was in fact almost completely resolved with the demo we tried at the time. The full game added a second part that was more hasty and watered down than the previous one, where our actions were so limited and guided as to deprive Willy Morgan and the Curse of Bone Town of all the charm that had prompted us to help this bizarre fifteen year old. Ay ay Captain Briefly summarizing the plot, Willy is the son of two famous explorers who apparently lost his father ten years before the events of the game: Henry Morgan has disappeared without a trace after being last seen in Bone Town, his hometown in which he went at least once a year. The wife has decided to bury that tragedy and has thrown herself totally into work, while the son seems more tied to the memory of his father. One day he receives a letter from his father, dated shortly before his disappearance, who begs him to go to Bone Town and leaves him some cryptic clues on how to behave once there. From now on, control passes to us and we will have to guide Willy first in the difficult task of leaving the house on a bicycle with questionable safety, then along the alleys of a town that seems to have been left to die slowly despite the presence of some inhabitants . Bone Town is in fact a ghost town without being completely one yet, a place that has lost the jovial spirit that animates the memories of our young protagonist to give way to a slow self-destruction. As we have already anticipated, Willy Morgan and the Curse of Bone Town follows all the typical dictates of the 90s point and click that preceded it, from Monkey Island to Day of the Tentacle, although the difficulty of its puzzles is more calibrated towards the bottom and is less abstruse. In the search for all the fragments of the map that belonged to a notorious pirate, and here it really seems to be in The Goonies, we will explore Bone Town from top to bottom and get to know bizarre characters, some of whom seem to have happened there absolutely by accident without having nothing to do with the atmosphere: this very contrast, however, makes them special and brings a smile to see the absurdity with which they have been contextualized. Very inspired, too short The town is rather articulated, even if a particularly small inhabited center may be, and although it is divided into ~sectors~ (or micro areas within which we know one of the pieces of the map is located) it manages to maintain a certain homogeneity in its puzzles : it will not be rare, in fact, to collect one or more elements in as many places before being able to overcome certain obstacles and thus obtain the coveted prize. Rarely does the game get bizarre enough to leave you thinking about the solution for a few minutes, but otherwise the adventure is immediate in its development. Part of the problem is this. Beyond sometimes detours, even in a witty and absurd way as only certain point and clicks can be, to reach an apparently simple goal, the game doesn't allow itself much else. It could have been understandable if the adventure had had a moderate length but this is not the case with Willy Morgan and the Curse of Bone Town, which finds its greatest flaw precisely in its brevity: the adventure ends in a couple of hours and where the first part, including the prologue, manages to be captivating and engaging enough, bringing us back to the glories of its genre, the second is resolved in an instant and is so guided as to leave a bad taste in the mouth. Just when the story takes a turn, opening up to possible scenarios, the game has a setback and decides to solve the plot in a hasty way, putting us in front of puzzles that are not really puzzles in favor of a watered-down conclusion . Between classic and modern Nothing to say instead as regards the artistic sector, which confirms the good impressions of the demo: we are faced with a style that refers to the classics but decides to give itself atone all its own thanks to softer strokes, reminiscent of post-2D Disney and films like Coraline and the Magic Door (the intro in particular shouts out Laika Studios). The same goes for the sound design, which offers a series of tracks that are right for the atmosphere of the game and which only on a couple of occasions seemed ~overbearing~ to us, intruding into the scene for no particular reason. The dubbing, which we have finally been able to hear in full, maintains good standards and manages to differentiate the characters from each other, more or less in agreement with the idea we had of them in the preview phase. Modernity, however, does not concern only the aesthetics but the same gameplay: perhaps wanting to touch the strings of those who are not too accustomed to point and click, Willy Morgan and the Curse of Bone Town adds a couple of aspects that improve the quality of life but we are also free not to use: let's talk about fast travel to move from one zone to another and the possibility of activating an indicator that signals which elements we can interact with. A choice that may not find favor with purists, however the fact that it is at the discretion of the player makes it one of those appreciable additions that do not necessarily undermine the balance of the experience. Obviously, for those who are wondering, the game is available in Italian at least as regards the texts: the dubbing remains in English instead.", "date": "2020-08-12", "grade": "6.8"}
