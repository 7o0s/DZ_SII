So it hasn't been a long time since we were able to try the aerial shooter experience developed by Kazutoki Kono and his Project Aces collaborators, but in this case we are talking about an absolute debut for the franchise on current generation platforms . A troubled production, in any case: originally announced in 2015, the game should have been released two years ago but has suffered a couple of postponements, perhaps due to the difficulty of implementing the interesting virtual reality mode exclusive to PlayStation VR. From the point of view of design, in fact, Skies Unknown is a well-defined, solid product, which gets rid of some of the experiments put in place by the previous chapters in favor of a consistent experience, with your feet firmly planted on the ground, this expression may clash with the nature of the project. Missions The Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown campaign is made up of twenty increasingly complex missions, in which a plot that has its roots in the history of the brand is used as a glue, with some interesting references but without expecting users to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the 'fascinating lore created by the authors. Suffice it to say that in the alternate universe of Strangereal, after the events narrated in the fourth and fifth episodes of the series, the forces of Hosea and Erusea arrive at the military clash and some characters end up being involved in the war against their will, such as the skilled repairwoman Avril Mead and the pilot known by the code name Trigger, the one we will control throughout the game. The two are sentenced, albeit for different reasons, to serve a prison sentence in a sort of suicide squad made up of thieves and cheaters, which however will end up distinguishing themselves and making a difference during the course of the conflict. Introduced by the traditional briefing and suggestive cutscenes that carry the narrative forward from Avril's point of view, the missions adopt a formula that fans of the franchise know well, and which sees our plane engaged in a series of tasks that often include furious dogfights in the clouds, the conclusion of which is usually followed by the arrival of enemy reinforcements for a sort of frenetic ~second round~ in which the final outcome of the battle is decided. As mentioned above, the variations on the theme with other vehicles and even the alternative view with modified controls, which can be activated during close-quarters battles, have been eliminated in favor of a concrete and coherent gameplay, which also and above all works on the details to revive and enrich the original vision of Ace Combat. Gameplay and news Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown offers two control systems that can be selected at the start and allow even novices to grapple with the experience without major problems, although in reality choosing the advanced layout right away is not a problem and indeed it can provide a concrete advantage in the long run, when the execution of some aerial maneuvers will be useful for completing the internships. The controls are the same as always and in the same way the management of the map and the combat system, with its lock-ons and the emphasis on evasive maneuvers, immediately put anyone who has already had the opportunity to try an episode of the series at ease . The story immediately introduces the theme of drones and their effectiveness in battle, and it is therefore against this type of enemy that in many cases we will have to confront, using up our resources and making the best use of the aircraft equipment, which can be customized first to access a new mission. A rich and multifaceted tree allows you to spend the money earned after each success to unlock new aircraft, related special weapons and a large number of items that can improve maneuverability, resistance and attack power. It will therefore happen to use very long-range missiles, guided bombs that can easily eliminate targets on the ground, swarms of ideal rockets against multiple targets, and so on. However, the most relevant innovations must be sought elsewhere, for the precision in the rendering of atmospheric agents: far from being just an aesthetic feature, the presence of extremely realistic volumetric clouds, which leave drops of condensation on the passenger compartment at each passage, translates into a determining factor within some missions, when perhaps it is hidden behind a low clouda huge stone monolith, to be avoided at the last moment. These unprecedented phases of the experience, which prove to be truly exciting when tested, also see the presence of strong winds that push our aircraft, making it difficult to control, and lightning gusts that can momentarily drive the on-board instruments crazy, transforming some fights in challenging, furious and immersive sequences. The multiplayer modes Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown includes two multiplayer modes, both of which are competitive: a two-on-two or four-on-four style team deathmatch and a battle royale for up to eight players. We got to test both of these options, experiencing fast and effective matchmaking, solid netcode and the lack of excessive latency issues. Perhaps the numbers are missing, in the sense that we have often found relatively empty lobbies and struggled to fill them, but we imagine that the bulk of users want to complete the single player campaign before dedicating themselves to something else. That said, the online segment of the game is in many ways also a cruel reality check of the skills you think you possess: characterized by independent unlockables and a good progression system, competitive multiplayer requires a great deal of commitment, precision and talent to be able to close matches with a win. The PC version The sensations we experienced playing Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown on PC were decidedly positive, so much so that we can say without fear of contradiction that the Windows version of the game is the best currently available. The Unreal Engine 4 is a widely tested engine but not everyone has shown that they know how to make the most of scalability, so we had some doubts about how the graphics would behave with our configuration, fortunately being reassured after a few minutes: with a GTX 1080 Ti Bandai Namco's title keeps the 60 frames per second constant at 4K resolution, with all effects maxed out and v-sync activated. This means that there is a certain gap and we were interested in knowing its extent to understand if it was even possible to introduce a bit of supersampling using the scaler present in the options. By unlocking the frames and disabling vsync, the average we totaled was around 70 fps, therefore perfectly in line with the performance obtained. If we consider that 1080p is not exceeded on PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X, with even some uncertainty in terms of fluidity, the difference in terms of detail and performance undoubtedly appears considerable. In addition to resolution, frame rate lock (at 30, 60, 75, 90, 120, 144 fps or unlocked) and v-sync, the PC edition of Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown allows you to adjust to three different presets ( low, medium, high) aspects such as scaler, shadow quality, textures, effects quality, post processing quality, screen space reflections and antialiasing. The latter is unfortunately present with only the FXAA technology, the most basic and lightest of those available today, but in the end this does not in any way represent a visual limit once in-game. Much more remarkable is the lack of HDR at launch and a list of compatible flight sticks which currently includes only four models, but will certainly be enriched with the next updates. Finally, the sound sector is excellent, both as regards the dialogues (in English or Japanese, subtitled in Italian) and for the effects and the soundtrack.", "date": "2019-02-03", "grade": "8.7"}
