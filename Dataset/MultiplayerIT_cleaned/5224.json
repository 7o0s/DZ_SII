Thanks to a very simple idea, that of offering various mini-games based on music and timing, which have enhanced the control system of Nintendo portables and given several carefree hours, in a context in which their impeccable realization led to the search for the best score , perhaps without missing a single step. If anything, the staggered release in the various markets, even after months, and the different name, Rhythm Tengoku in Japan, Rhythm Heaven in the United States, thought about creating confusion on the different chapters. The chapter for Game Boy Advance, among other things, has never officially arrived in our area, but finally on Nintendo 3DS it will be possible to play a super complete version of the series, with the suffix Megamix, including the most beautiful mini-games from the previous chapters, a handful of completely unpublished (fourteen), challenges, extras and for the first time a story mode. The review of Rhythm Paradise Megamix, the most complete and fun version of the Nintendo game The 3D effect The essential and clean graphics of Rhythm Paradise Megamix brings as a gift an equally clean and defined 3D effect which does not cause any discomfort, but which on the contrary adds a pleasant aesthetic level of depth. Clearly the very nature of the backgrounds related to the minigames does not allow who knows what changes in three dimensions, especially for the older and simplistic ones in the realization. For new minigames and those, for example, where the objects come from the screen, the result is certainly more evident. One, two, three... star! Rhythm Paradise Megamix puts the player in the role of Tippy, a cute purple creature who fell from the celestial world. To get home he has to go through some settings manned by as many crazy characters who require, for the passage, the resolution of some mini-games, in order to restore the now lost sense of rhythm. Those who know the series will immediately find themselves at ease, for newbies it is enough to know that you have to face some rather short schemes (we are always in the order of 1-2 minutes for each) in which, for example, hitting or avoiding objects, imitating what they do your companions and so on, all always timed to the rhythm of the music, vital for finding the right timing when pressing the keys. Each scheme has its own different background and graphic style; always with a colorful and light-hearted tone, often in contrast with the type of action to be performed. The Nintendo 3DS version offers a double control system, entrusted solely to the stylus, as on the Nintendo DS, or to the A, B keys and the digital cross, the best solution from our point of view to get high scores. The progression of the story is initially linear, seasoned with some dialogue; every so many settings you reach a portal that offers a more difficult mini-game, according to three levels of difficulty. The lowest one requires a greater number of coins, the remaining ones to scale; coins are obtained as usual by completing each test with a high score, without making a mistake and collecting the talent star, linked to perfect timing in a key moment of the action. Once you reach the tower for the celestial world, you have more choice on how to continue, up to the levels called Remix which offer the five mini-games previously faced alternating with each other. Within the main menu, you can also access the bar and the challenge section, which add variety to the overall package. The bar is divided into different areas, including the museum where you can replay all the unlocked schemes, see the gallery of objects and access a section for duels against people met using the Street Pass. The latter are sanctioned by a specific mini-game between two robots, who with punches (always timed by the music) must inflate the opponent's balloon until it explodes: in case of victory you get vegetables that allow you to feed a goat (!) present in another room, which every ten levels gives a coat of arms to collect. There is also the shop, in which you can buy (with coins) music and objects related to each rhythmic game, or (with rhythm spheres) another 18 not present in the main mode. The rhythm spheres, in turn, are obtained in the challenge mode, which offers three rhythmic games to be completed in sequence with a minimum score. In this section you can play wirelessly with other people, and send the test to another Nintendo 3DS to play together. The Megamix suffix exists rightly because it is the most complete version of the series ever, with 71 levels, 10 remixes, at least 19 challenges, without considering that part of the mini-games present in the main story have one or two additional versions, with the original backgrounds , voice notes and a higher level of difficulty. Such an enormous number of levels offers variety for all tastes and excellent general quality, net of some less successful proposals. Among the old glories we have ~Karate Ka~, in which you have to hit objects at different speeds, ~Table Rhythm~, or ping pong with three types of exchanges at different speeds, ~Buca in uno~, which offers the classic mixed golf to baseball in terms of timing and ball to hit. The mini-games from the other chapters have been adapted from a graphic point of view, the unpublished ones have a superior but always essential graphic sector, and are generally of excellent workmanship, with peaks of excellence and fun represented for example by ~Gatti carpenters~, in in which a bear has to cut logs of wood provided by two cats, with more or less blows depending on their size; or by ~Sumo Twins~, who, always to the rhythm of the music, must alternate the use of their legs and arms, assuming a synchronized pose at the right moment. Dulcis in fundo, the Remixes, as mentioned, offer a level of challenge that requires greater alertness of reflexes due to the constant change between the mini-games, and represent among the most successful moments of the title. Rhythm Paradise Megamix is distinguished by a spartan but colorful graphic sector and fully in line with the light-hearted tone of the production, the story adds a minimum of structure to the progression and allows you to enhance the excellent translation of the Italian texts, which elicit more than a smile when, for example, in the barber's tower he states that his customers suffer from a sort of rhythm alopecia, asking to restore it. There are so many things to do, therefore, for an offer in our opinion excellent for fans of the genre but also for fans of the Rhythm Paradise series.", "date": "2016-10-18", "grade": "9.0"}
