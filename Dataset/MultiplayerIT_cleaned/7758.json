{"name": "Un destino perso nell'oscurit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/120742-eleusis-un-destino-perso-nelloscurita.html", "text": "Eleusis is part of that lineage of first-person graphic adventures born thanks to increasingly simple and accessible development tools and graphics engines. The term used to describe them is First Person Adventure and in some ways they take up, excluding the puzzles, the old trend of aesthetically inflated adventures through pre-rendered images and computer graphics animations. Today fixed screens are no longer necessary, given the power of home gaming machines, and good quality graphics are also within the reach of independent productions. This is precisely the case of Eleusis, which uses Unreal Engine 3 to translate the mechanics of a classic point-and-click graphic adventure into three dimensions. Eleusis takes us on a night trip to the mysterious Greek countryside Suddenly a village appears The narrative component, pivot of the experience, starts with an important letter that leads the protagonist to take a road immersed in the woods of Greece in the middle of the night. Suddenly a large boulder falls on the road, hitting the protagonist's jeep by chance. Footed in the middle of nowhere, our man is damned lazy and has no intention of proceeding along the main road which, to avoid temptations of any kind, is delimited at both ends by a couple of classic invisible walls. The only possibility is therefore to follow a path that enters a forest illuminated by the moon and decidedly threatening. A true act of courage if we consider that the small path might not even lead anywhere. But luck meets our hero, and here his laziness is rewarded with the discovery, a few hundred meters from the road, of a suggestive Greek village built entirely of stone. Predictably, it soon becomes clear that bad luck or luck had nothing to do with the accident and the finding of the village. And since escape is impossible and there is a girl in trouble to save, the only solution is therefore to solve the disturbing mystery we have come across, starting with the simple task of finding a key with which to free the damsel in danger. To do this, it is necessary to explore the game area by bouncing between walls and gates that the protagonist, although he can jump, just can't get over. But by solving the first puzzle, the playing area expands and the same thing will be repeated several times during the adventure, leading us to explore an increasingly vast territory. A long night walk in the Greek countryside The main problem of Eleusis is precisely linked to the size of the game map, which does not get along with the point and click graphic adventure mechanics. The title asks us, as happens in the great classics of the genre, to find and mix various objects to solve a series of puzzles that lead to the inevitable ending. But due to the size of the map, which grows from puzzle to puzzle and almost always remains entirely explorable, it happens that the player has to walk for several minutes just to check if the opposite corner of the explorable area has activated a new event or there is a key object previously overlooked or initially unavailable. Eleusis thus amplifies the biggest problem of classic adventures by exposing the player to the fearsome demon of frustration that has often found itself at ease in this genre. Fortunately, here and there there are some elements that break the boredom, such as the shadows that move in the woods, the sudden showers and the suggestive glimpses of the Greek countryside that manage to sustain the atmosphere just enough to make backtracking almost bearable. Furthermore, there are a couple of surprises, such as the double ending and a sudden action session, and the developers, aware of the shortcomings of the title and eager to improve things, have added a sort of action component with patch 1.2, populating the forest with enemies and granting the player the ability to throw objects to defend themselves. The combat is certainly not of the highest quality but if nothing else the constant threat distracts the player while moving and gives meaning to the interactive objects that proliferate on the map. Objects such as bottles and hammers, which before the update had the sole purpose of weighing down an already extremely massive engine, which, even with our configuration, often allowed itself unjustified slowdowns. But if nothing else, the heaviness of the code corresponds to a valid aesthetic component that also includes some DX11 effects. The village is suggestive, the post processing is of excellent quality and the sound sector, which includes a gemgata to the gameplay, it is poor but valid and exploited well, with the few dubbed lines of dialogue that are placed in the right places.", "date": "2013-07-04", "grade": "5.9"}
