On Xbox360 and PlayStation3, the Canadian giant has already amply demonstrated an undoubted competence in developing the excellent foundations laid by the previous FIFA 10; now let's see how the developers behaved on the Wii, considering how their latest ballistic release on the Nintendo console had caused mixed reactions within the gaming community. All against all Let's immediately extinguish the hopes of those who wished for some radical change in this FIFA World Cup in South Africa 2010, as the gameplay has remained substantially unchanged compared to the arcade system set up by FIFA 10. The outline has been fleshed out and adapted to the context of the world championship , but every single playful aspect - positive or negative - has undergone a complete transfer without going through a filtering that would certainly have benefited EA's work. However, let's start from the news sector, represented in the first instance by the 199 selectable national teams, all characterized by official formations and updated as far as possible. In terms of game modes, the dish is quite rich and does not end with the simple simulation of the tournament, however present in a big way: the user can in fact choose to follow the trend of reality, aiming for victory with one of the teams that they have actually qualified for the final phase, but it is quite possible to shuffle the cards on the table or even to create a 100% personalized scoreboard. Then a section called Dream Team Zakumi makes a good impression, a sort of Fantasy Football applied to the action on the field: in essence, you start with a mediocre team and you face increasingly stronger teams, from which it is possible to subtract an athlete choice in case of victory to thus strengthen their ranks game after game. A well-crafted and quite stimulating divertissement, the importance of which is underlined by a particular option that allows you to save the dream team in the memory of the Remote and then use it to challenge your friends. As often happens in the Wii environment, on the other hand, the FIFA World Cup South Africa 2010 is decidedly unbalanced in favor of multiplayer, and this is demonstrated by the three modes dedicated to it. First of all, the game allows up to 31 different users to challenge each other in the same championship, binding themselves to a team and trying to lead it to the final victory. Then there is the so-called Total Elimination, a kind of survival game that can be used by two to four players: everyone chooses four teams, and whoever arrives at the end with at least one undefeated national team wins following a series of cross-matches. The roundup ends with an online mode without too many trappings, which does its duty without infamy and without praise, having to deal with a network infrastructure light years away from the completeness of the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network services. Head down It is a real pity that, in the face of such a commitment made by the developers in the creation of a package as complete as possible, an adequate review of a gameplay that had not exactly thrilled in FIFA 10 and which is proposed here again is not paid in all and for all. The list of invariances is inaugurated by the control system, once again variable based on the player's experience: those familiar with football games can therefore choose between the Remote + Nunchuck combo and the Classic Controller, while the more casual public an option that uses only the Remote is dedicated, simple but terribly limiting. On the playing field, FIFA World Cup South Africa 2010 is characterized by overtly arcade-style mechanics: acrobatics, shots that break through the sound barrier, slow motion and tennis scores are therefore the order of the day, in an undoubtedly pleasant ensemble that lends alongside the same criticisms addressed to the previous EA production. Each shot aimed at the ball therefore translates into a cannon shot that is bagged in the seven, stripping the title of even the smallest strategic ambitions applicable to football; the mediocre AI of the opponents controlled by the CPU takes away the bite from the single player challenges, which often boil down to solitary bucking towards a goalkeeper to slip without any difficulty; again, the excessive use of slow motion aimed at emphasizing the most spectacular plays is immediately boring, and it is not allowed to deactivate it in any way. Conversely, the positive factors highlighted by FIFA 10 also remain, above all the original and fun execution of set pieces and theexploitation of small quick time events to intercept penalties or balls contested by two players. In short, the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa proves to be an all in all pleasant experience - albeit light years away from the reality of the sport to which it refers - but which would certainly have benefited from some expedients. Instead, something has been done on the visual front, especially as regards the likelihood of the virtual athletes with their real counterparts: the game is still characterized by a caricature style that you may or may not like, but at least small steps forward can be recorded .", "date": "2010-04-28", "grade": "7.0"}
