{"name": "Final Fantasy IX", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-ix_a.html", "text": "E=mC^2 Many of you may ask me why review FF9 now, very close to the release of the continental version? Well, I want to give you a taste of what the game is, so that you can jump at the speed of light, chez your trusted dealer. So keep following me in silence, come on! Once upon a time... The story in FF9 revolves around a young thief named Zidane (now, without making unnecessary controversy, it really seems that the fame of the Juventus players has also reached Japan J), a beautiful princess named Garnet; a knight named Steiner, and a very confused character by the name of Vivi. At this point I won't tell you anything else, if you want to know the story you know who to contact! Cartoon-style, please! Final Fantasy 9 comes in 4 CDs, full of lovable game. The undersigned greatly appreciated the new character design: now they are more in site Snes than in a realistic style (see Final Fantasy 8); clearly this is just an opinion but I think I agree with most of the readers. The other big news is that at most only 4 characters are controllable. This makes battles more free and interesting. Final Fantasy 9 manages to mix the best elements of 2D games with the best graphics aspects of 3D games. Here is the real innovation; this fourth episode is simpler (friendly I would say!) for new users, and very rewarding for the more savvy. Everything else is rhetoric, and I don't waste time making already heard speeches. It goes without saying that the game costs your entire social life or that this is the best graphics ever seen on a 32bit. Useless. It goes without saying that you will love the characters, and that you will follow their stories with the same passion that lives only in a novel. Really inflated speeches, but never so true! Music sound's better with you! The talented Nobue Uematsu, who is famous for composing other FF soundtracks, still delights us with truly incredible music. Here is perhaps the extra touch of the whole saga; always too neglected aspect, it contributes decisively to the maintenance, on incredible levels, of the general pathos of the game. Playstation rules! The controls are similar to the entire Final Fantasy saga. What to add? As a famous local comedian would say, I have to ~break an arm~ in favor of Square and Sony: they have once again demonstrated how the Psx hardware is simply something exceptional: without detracting from all future consoles, I think it is was (or rather, because it is still alive and well) such an exceptional project that it will take years to find another one. Trust me, if you haven't done it yet, run to the shopkeeper and book a copy... Playstation rules!

That's right, dust off your ~greystation~, or similarly brand new ~whitestation~, insert the CD, close the big door, and press the round button. You will be transported in an instant to an incredible world", "date": "2001-02-06", "grade": null}
