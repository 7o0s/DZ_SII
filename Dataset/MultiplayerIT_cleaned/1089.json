From some points of view Pirates could be defined as a role-playing game. Yet all the stylistic features typical of the cRPG genre are missing. The statistics to customize the player character are missing, all those elements that help to simulate their growth are also absent, just as there is no real supporting narrative structure with noteworthy dialogues and narrative interweaving. ...a plausible and extremely dynamic context, subject to the player's continuous choices and actions... Pirates in pills For others, however, Pirates could almost appear as a strategic one, at least for the large number of clashes (in real time and not) and for the various strategic choices (precisely) that during the game could lead us, for example, to make enemies of a nation or make friends with another one. On balance though, the only way to describe Pirates is to describe their purposes. The stated intentions of Pirates are to offer us a plausible and extremely dynamic context, subject to the player's continuous choices and actions in order to allow him to live in a real pirate life simulator. Repeating ourselves: not pizzas and figs. In a Sid Meier game, a real encyclopedia on gaming, pirates and the Caribbean in general could not be missing... What helps to make Pirates even more unique is its continuous use of heterogeneous game elements in a context that however always appears clear and well defined. Simplifying the concept further, in Pirates many aspects of a pirate's life are summarized (or reduced, depending on your point of view) to a series of games of skill or tactics. There are also purely exploratory sections and other almost adventure sections as well as, obviously, combat. All of this was already offered to gamers 17 years ago: a non-linear and virtually infinite title that allows those able to identify themselves with a unique and unrepeatable gaming experience. Stories of Pirates Just like George Lucas taught us, every story must have a beginning and the story told by Pirates! they start from the childhood of our alter-ego, when during a family reunion organized to celebrate the imminent arrival of peace and prosperity, the bad guy - or villain, called in English - on duty bursts in and, claiming a series of debts never paid, he decides to take justice into his own hands, not just ruining the jovial atmosphere and kidnapping all those who fall under his hands. When it is said to be touchy Obviously all the diners are captured except the protagonist of the game. Thus, after a childhood spent sweeping and shining the decks of ships and peeling potatoes in the galley, the mutiny of the ship's crew, now consumed by the harassment of its captain, represents a good opportunity to stand out and be made captain of the rebel vessel. The name of our vessel says it all: Revenge - Vendetta. From that day all your strength will therefore be directed towards the aim of finding all your missing relatives and accumulating new wealth useful for making your family name shine again. Or at least this represents the casus belli of your events, then everyone can also decide to care less about it and devote themselves to an honest existence as a pirate who is a bit official and a bit - why not - a gentleman. You start as a Pirate Once we have chosen one of the numerous levels of difficulty we will have to decide in which subject to make our character excel, among the various options we will be able to excel in the guise of swordsman, merchant or maybe even just in those of a dancer... Once the nationality of the first has been selected convoy on which to embark (we will be able to choose one of the four nationalities in the game: France, Spain, Holland and England) it will therefore be time to finally dive into the game, when the intense blue of the Caribbean Sea will stand out in front of us. From a strictly technical point of view Pirates! it appears just enough, fortunately the particular characterization of the entire graphic style manages, at least in part, to improve one's fortunes a little. Halfway between the cell-shaded style and the direction of cinematographic works such as ~The Curse of the Black Pearl~, on balance the visual setting, with an intensive use of bright and extremely gaudy colours, cannot fail to recall that of the videogame pirate series par excellence, Monkey Island. The Caribbean archipelago will thus appear more alive than ever, withthe bright blue of the ocean in sharp contrast with the emerald green of the atolls and with the strong pastel colors that represent all the various towns and outposts. Even the game interface, as well as all the various information screens (Civilization-style for instance) enjoy this inspired and successful style which, if graphically cannot amaze all lovers of anisotropic filters and various bump-mappings, equally will not stop never to marvel at the artistic vein and very pleasant. Rich and quite varied - within the limits of what is allowed given the setting of the game - the soundtrack, which offers us a rather full-bodied number of motives with a clear pirate flavor (the whistled one is beautiful), as well as all the sound effects that more than once they almost tricked us into opening the window to get the smell of salt air out of our room. For example, when you are at sea, the cry of the seagulls accompanies the unfolding of our sails in the wind propelled by the typical whistling of the wind. Almost a Zen experience. Just as happens in ~The Sims~ by Maxis then, the characters of Pirates do not speak but express themselves with a sort of onomatopoeic language that manages in a funny and successful way to underline the mood of the characters. In this regard it is good to say that the game is entirely localized in Italian. People of the sea / who go away / where they want / but where they don't know The game section where you will spend most of your pirate life is on the deck of your sailing ship. The control of the ship is performed using the ubiquitous numeric keypad and is extremely simple and immediate. Once at sea, you can decide at any time to attack opposing ships or fleets, land ashore or moor in one of the many Caribbean ports. All this without any constraints, except that of your personal goals. Combat between ships is governed by some simple but fundamental rules such as the direction in which the wind blows, the folding of the sails and the type of ammunition you want to use to attack your opponents. Depending on the type of boat available (there are about thirty different ones) you can favor one type of approach over another. With a small and agile Sloop, for example, you will be able to make better use of the wind and make fun of the slow and mammoth War Galleon at the mercy of the wind, circling it and shooting at it the ~grape~ cannonballs useful for reducing the enemy crew. When and if you deem it more appropriate, the time will come to shout to your men ~Boarding!~, in fact if the opponent has not yet raised the white flag you can board the enemy ship and then literally challenge the enemy captain. At this point it will be possible to win (or lose) in two ways: either by beating our challenger in a duel or hoping that in the meantime our crew will take out all the enemy. Using our trusty numeric keypad as always, we have different types of parry and other attacks available: the secret in the game lies in following the right timing to dodge the opponent's blows and to store the answer. What do you want to do today? To tell the truth, we would have liked a little bit more. more variety between one port and another... Especially at the higher difficulty levels, the fencing sections are always fun and stimulating, thrilling and unpredictable right down to the last jab. Seeing is believing. But you certainly won't be able to stay at sea all the time, after all the provisions will sooner or later run out and above all your mob will begin to show the first symptoms of impatience. Therefore, it will often be advisable for you to visit a port and, occasionally, divide the loot with your men in order to appease any bad moods. This is definitely one of the game departments where we would have liked more variety. After all, each town varies only in name, nationality and wealth of goods. Therefore, every time we arrive in a port, we will give rise to a sort of reflex instinct which will lead us, rather mechanically, to always carry out the same sequence of actions: talk to the governor in order to hear the latest news and possibly get assigned some mission or enjoy a well-deserved promotion, fix the boats of our fleet rather than sell or upgrade them, sell or buy stocks of merchandise or various materials, take a tour of the tavern to hear the latest news buy some rare item from the foreigner on duty or simply hire new crew. As you progress through the game, it may happen that you are not well liked in certain ports, therefore, unless you want to sneak instealthily in the city (giving you the opportunity to try your hand at a mini-game with a vague stealth inspiration) you can also decide to loot, perhaps attacking the city militias from the ground. In this case, the title involves the use of mechanics - albeit simplified - typical of turn-based strategy games. Also in this case we are far from the spectacularity of modern titles, and also from the depth of the greatest exponents of the genre, however, like the rest of the game, it represents a nice digression on the genre. Able to be appreciated by all players, even the less experienced ones. Speaking of digressions, how can we not talk about the possibility of seducing the most beautiful daughters of local governors? As ? Obviously with our skills as a dancer: in this case everything will depend on our quick reflexes... and we assure you that dancing to the rhythm imposed by our lady on duty will prove to be perhaps the most difficult thing for a pirate like you... In the collective imagination, however a Pirate cannot be called a Pirate without having a treasure to seek. Sid Meier's pirates could not be outdone. From time to time, attending the most infamous taverns and talking to the most reserved patrons as well as learning news of distant ports or buying rare objects with the strangest properties (such as a set of swords to aid in combat, rings useful for courting girls or disguises necessary to avoid being recognized in enemy ports) you will be able to get hold of some pieces of the map. Equipped with our inseparable telescope and sense of direction, we will thus be able to wander the seas in search of the reference points marked on the map and then land on land and, armed with a shovel, go down with a landing party in search of one of the numerous treasures ( or city) hidden. A world that lives What you have just read is only a part of everything you can do in Pirates! For example, we have not talked about the numerous missions (infinite and continuously generated in a pseudo-random way) that can be assigned to you by local governors and not even about your adventures that may be necessary to find your relatives. However, part of the charm of the game is that it continues to amaze with small details of this type. There is a subtle common thread that unites all the different facets of Pirates!: every action corresponds to a reaction, often infinitesimal, other times imperceptible... but it is there. Thus, for example, if we manage to stop the arrival of a new governor in the port of Tortuga, it will later be easier to sack the city because it is left to fend for itself. Similarly, intercepting merchant ships heading to a certain port will lead to a rapid depletion of that port. These are just two trivial examples of what can happen during the game that demonstrate how although the game always wants to favor the general public by offering a rather instinctive action, on the other hand there is no lack of willingness to give even the most demanding players a sop. A world that lives While we play, the world we are immersed in lives on. There are wars, peace treaties, city sackings, and more than once our perhaps marginal action, such as that of having attacked a military transport ship, could influence the course of these events. While we play, the world we are immersed in lives on A world that lives A large part of the game is based on the subtle games of balance on which we will navigate during our games. Sometimes to make a nation happy we will have to accentuate our attacks towards a certain objective, causing a retaliation from this which will not fail to put a bounty on our head attracting the attention of both the military and other pirates in search of glory and easy wealth. Of course, there are sometimes basic inconsistencies. For example, we don't understand how we can be appointed admiral of the Spanish navy, when the day before we thought well of assaulting the Treasure Galleon... Yet they are necessary contradictions to make the title always playable and never too frustrating, considering that in principle the game world always responds in a coherent and plausible way to our in-game actions. Ease is perhaps another basic problem of the title, even at the highest difficulty levels, after a few hours of intensive play it may prove very easy to do what you want. Even the mini-games are precisely mini-games: reduced and simplified versions of game mechanics that we may find in other in-depth titles with greater breadth. This, for many, could leave a bad taste in the mouth, especially once they get the hang of it", "date": "2004-12-14", "grade": null}
