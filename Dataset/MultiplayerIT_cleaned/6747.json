It's all part of Nintendo's grand plan to launch every new Pokmon simultaneously worldwide and prevent players from knowing too much before it even hits shelves; a commendable goal which, however, makes our job anything but easy. Judging Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, then, was particularly complicated for a whole series of factors, the most important of which is the so-called ~nostalgia effect~ that applies to remakes: the writer plays Pokmon for work and for pleasure from the legendary Blue from 1999, and although it's always a joy to take a walk in the woods hunting for funny little monsters, you have to deal with other problems, starting with the fact that our last excursion into the Game Freak universe dates back to just a year ago and Pokmon X and Y. This time we went back in time to visit Hoenn, home of those 2003 Ruby and Sapphire that are still among the most fan-favorite iterations today: a bold choice or a step too far? Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby demonstrate why releasing one Pokmon a year isn't a good idea The alpha and the omega Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire, to date, was the only generation not to have had a remake as happened with the original one on Game Boy Advance or Silver and Gold for Nintendo DS. It is therefore not surprising that Game Freak has thought of reproposing it by making her wear the clothes of the sixth generation, the one for Nintendo 3DS inaugurated last year by versions X and Y. The problem, if anything, is the times, and in every sense, but we will discuss it shortly. For now it's worth dwelling on the setting and the reasons why it didn't particularly convince us. Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby are reimaginings rather than remakes. This term, which is trendy nowadays, simply means that they are not a slavish copy of the originals, but that something new has been added to bring them up to date. And here is the first problem. The story of each Pokmon can be summarized more or less like this: a young trainer explores the continent to capture pokmon and defeat the gym leaders, ending up enmeshed in the shady plans of the criminal organization on duty before being able to face the Elite Four and become a champion . Simple, linear, almost a pretext. In recent generations, however, something had changed, and Game Freak had begun to better characterize antagonists and supporting actors, thanks also to the introduction of short cutscenes and more articulated dialogues. In X and Y, for example, an enemy with a certain charisma was proposed to us and the friends of our alter ego made the adventure more engaging. There was even a romantic subplot! In Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby, on the other hand, we took a step back in respect of the original plot... while inserting concepts such as Mega Evolution, introduced in X and Y, which seemed quite forced to us. A real contradiction. The plot is always the same, with the Magma and Aqua teams vying for control of the legendary Kyogre and Groudon to change the world. The ecological nuance of the story is barely sketched and the sense of apocalyptic threat thinned by the perennial optimism that pervades the world of pokmon: in the Game Freak universe nobody is ever really bad, and that's fine, but in Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby they the mark has gone a bit with passages bordering on idiocy. The criminal on duty who steals a precious artifact and then, once defeated, gives it to us to be forgiven, while threatening to take revenge in the next dialogue? Come on. Two steps forward, one step back Basically, Pokmon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby play exactly like X and Y and like every other Pokmon before them: you catch little monsters, you grow through battles, you face Gym Leaders and dozens upon dozens of occasional battles, you brings the main storyline to a conclusion and, finally, the Elite Four are challenged and we move on to the postgame. Nothing new, of course, and otherwise we would have been surprised. The remake, for its part, perfectly reproduces the map and the progression of the original Sapphire and Ruby, among the best structured Pokmon of the entire franchise. The variety of settings is enormousand Game Freak has made small changes here and there to modernize some passages without conceptually altering what was conceived ten years ago. In short, those who have played Ruby and Sapphire will know very well what to do and where to go, even when the game does not clearly suggest it and the progression becomes a bit too dispersive. From a gameplay point of view, Pokmon is in dazzling shape as always: an intuitive and at the same time incredibly complex combat system that still gives a hard time to the most famous exponents of the jRPG genre. And then, of course, there are the pokmon, hundreds of them, scattered throughout Hoenn in compliance with the original distribution with some additions here and there that adapt to the many balances made over the years (just think of the new type Kobold introduced in X and Y). Having said that, the news can practically be counted on the fingers of one hand. Obviously compared to the original Sapphire and Ruby there is a lot of irons in the fire, but nothing really new compared to the X and Y of just a year ago, which brings us back to the discussion on the times we mentioned in the previous paragraph. Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby, long story short, came out way too soon, and it shows. Let's take the PokNavi, for example, the very useful tool that allows us to access various functions such as the map or the PokDex: it also integrates the Pok Me & You and the Virtual Super Training already seen in X and Y, which have not changed since one iota, not even graphically. The NaviMap offers some new functions, such as the possibility of seeing the pokmon yet to be captured in a certain area or following the growth of the berries planted around, and it is certainly the best iteration conceived in all these years, even if the various options could be arranged more organically. Sideways, NaviTalk seemed purely useless to us: it performs the function of televisions, that is to offer chatter and rather superficial suggestions at any time. The bikes are back, of course, indispensable for traveling more quickly around Hoenn, and in the wild areas the ~rare~ encounters have been implemented which it is possible to sneak up on, acting slightly on the analog stick, to take the pokmon by surprise. However, many other small features that embellished X and Y and that could have been implemented just like the Mega Evolution are missing: there is no photographer, for one thing, and not even clothing stores. The real problem, though, is the PokDex. At this point, anyone who has played X and Y will probably have completed it, or almost: the implementation of the Global Trade System via the Internet has allowed players to easily recover practically any little monster, making us regret the old person exchanges at certain times. Between the GTS and the PokBank where we have kept various generations of pokmon, painstakingly transferred from a cartridge to the ether, we didn't feel at all encouraged to dive into the bushes in search of pokmon that we have already caught and trained in the past and that we couldn't wait to be able to collect from the internet. Also thanks to the relatively low difficulty of the fights, we found ourselves composing a provisional team without giving too much weight to the details and without sifting through each path more than necessary: a more unique than rare case in the long history of Pokmon, which convinced us of how it is very wrong to show one iteration a year, saturating not only the market but also the experience of the players. The 3D effect When it works, the stereoscopic effect is remarkable and makes the fights or the shot spectacular. The problem, however, is that it almost never works. Game Freak has it forcibly disabled even more often than in X and Y, and in case it is active it heavily affects the frame rate, unjustifiably slowing down practically any fight. Reluctantly, we suggest you keep the stick down. A nap on our laurels The mention of the absence of clothing stores further underlines the problem of balance that affects this remake, a little too straddling past and present: Game Freak has slipped in the Mega Evolutions, ~old~ and new, but has inexplicably removed those little details that we liked so much in X and Y last year. Not only in terms of gameplay (Pokmon Center and shops separate again, goodness) but also in terms of visuals. The limited customization of our alter ego hit us hard: already the character design of the two protagonists is not exactly the best, but the impossibility of modifying their clothes, headgear and hairstyle greatly limits the sense of involvement to which we had become accustomed X and Y, especially when ininteracted with other players. The approximate alternative is represented by the costume that our character wears on the stage of the Live Competition and by the new ~cosplay~ system for Pikachu, the only pokmon that can be dressed up with bizarre pre-packaged themed clothes. Nothing to tear your hair out about, mind you, even if the Pikachu luchador looks good. The real problem, if anything, is precisely of a technical nature. Pokmon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby uses the same engine as X and Y: Hoenn has been rebuilt in three dimensions, but the structure of most of the settings has remained as it was then, preventing the implementation of those small refinements, such as dynamic camera shots or the sudden movements of the camera, which we saw last year (but also in Black and White, if we want to be picky). Game Freak, if anything, seems to have focused on some pleasant but frankly superfluous details: some special moves are a little more pyrotechnic, for example, and special attention has been paid to the effects in some situations, such as the pokmon evolution sequence. The backgrounds during the fights, on the other hand, seemed much more accurate and detailed to us, and some small details that embellish the exploration made us smile, such as the improved reflections, the atmospheric effects or the non-interactive fauna that makes the settings more alive . Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby are just as much a feast for the eyes as X and Y, but why didn't they think of also improving that dancer frame rate that continues to afflict the graphics engine? The developer's solution was simply to forcefully deactivate the stereoscopic effect in the vast majority of the game, but even in inactive 3D there are significant slowdowns when the polygonal models in the field are particularly elaborate. Frankly, we expected a little more effort on this front, but it seems that everything has been concentrated on the soundtrack: if that of Ruby and Sapphire was already one of the best in the series, the new arrangement has made it decidedly superlative. The show goes on One of the harshest criticisms that was leveled at the excellent Pokmon X and Y last year concerned the so-called ~postgame~. Anyone who has played at least one Pokmon will know that defeating the Elite Four is only the beginning: new challenges, battles and Pokmon await the new champion, often able to explore previously inaccessible areas. From this point of view, the offer of X and Y was quite limited, with few legendary monsters to capture and a handful of Mega Stones to collect around Kalos. We can't express ourselves in detail about the postgame due to the usual, evil NDA, but the trailers published in abundance by Nintendo should have given you a vague idea of what awaits you: lots of new Megastones to find, an additional storyline (known as Delta Episode) that allows to get their hands on Rayquaza and Deoxys, and pretty much every other Legendary in existence. To squeeze the postgame of Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby to the maximum, it is necessary to unlock the interactive flight, probably the best new feature of this version that allows you to freely fly over the three-dimensional map of Hoenn and land wherever possible. A mechanic that we fervently hope to see in the next iterations of the series as well. Then the large multiplayer sector returns, which it was not possible for us to put to the whip but which, judging by the PokNavi interface, should be absolutely identical to the one seen in X and Y. The last two game modes on which it is worth spending a few lines are undoubtedly the Live Competition and the Super Secret Bases. The first was already there in the original Ruby and Sapphire: it is a performance in which it is possible to enroll one of our pokmon, whose success is based on some parameters that it is possible to balance, increase or decrease with the sound of Pokblocks. The mechanisms have been significantly altered to make room for Mega Evolutions and a series of refinements that make each Live Race a little more engaging, even if it is a pastime that, today as then, did not particularly intrigue us. The situation is different for the Super Secret Bases, scattered around Hoenn and customizable a bit like the houses of Animal Crossing or Fantasy Life. The player can buy or find numerous furnishing elements with which to modify the interior of each Secret Super Base, including furniture, dolls and other gadgets, through a very simple interface. Obviously it is also possible to invite our friends connected to the Internet, but this is a function that, again, we have not been allowed to try in the first place for", "date": "2014-11-18", "grade": "8.0"}
