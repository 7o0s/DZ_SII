Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. After making the unforgettable Elite Beat Angels for Nintendo DS, the episodes of the Lips series for Xbox 360 and, recently, the mobile rhythm game Symphonica, the developers of iDiS are back on iOS and Android with a tower defense that on paper closely resembles Plants Vs. Zombies, but which makes use of different mechanics. The setting is that of Eden Verde, a planet inhabited by sentient plants which is suddenly attacked by an alien race of metallic monsters. Within over seventy missions (but new ones will arrive with the various updates) set in twenty zones, our task will be to deploy the plants we have available to defend a special twig, which constitutes our base, from the advance of robots. Sometimes the missions simply involve eliminating the enemies on the screen, sometimes you have to resist the attack of virtually infinite hordes of aliens for a certain period of time, or even reach with our units the chains that imprison one of the trees of life to free him and end the fight. The gameplay is illustrated to us in a short tutorial which however is largely incomplete, in the sense that it will be necessary to try a certain number of missions before understanding exactly how the various mechanisms work, both those of the action phase and those of the management phase. Eden to Green is a tower defense of excellent workmanship, pity only for the freemium limits Those plants that don't grow well Powered by the powerful Unreal Engine 3, Eden to Green offers over forty different plants, each with its own range, power and unique characteristics. There are plants designed for offensive action, capable of striking even from a distance, and others that are instead the ideal solution for a defensive approach, perhaps to be placed in front of the base to protect it from the onslaught of machines. We can freely dispose of the little flowers that expand our initial territory, without which not even the other plants could live, and sometimes the simple operation of placing flowers towards the objectives proves effective. In many cases, however, we will have to carefully select the plants and proceed with caution, trying to read the opponents' moves as best as possible. Each victory corresponds to a certain amount of money in gold coins (the game's virtual currency, where the real one is emeralds), which we can then spend to pick ~fruit~ from a tree in order to obtain new units. Between one mission and another we will be able to manage our small army through cloning operations, which increase the number of single plants available, and evolution, which literally transform plants. A further substratum of the experience is represented by the day/night cycle, which changes every eighty minutes and forces us to review our strategies, as the units are divided into day and night, and using them at the wrong time of day means exploiting only part of their potential. Progressing through the campaign, completing the various zones and perhaps replaying them at a higher degree of difficulty helps us to level up and thus increase the total amount of energy available to us. And unfortunately this is the only real weak point of Eden to Green, given that you can't play more than three missions in a row due to these constraints, which clearly depend on the freemium format, and you must therefore try your hand at the game in a ~fragmented~, also considering the exaggerated cost of the emeralds. It's a pity, because also from a technical point of view the iNiS developers have done an excellent job, giving us very detailed and fluid graphics, with high resolution textures and a freely zoomable and zoomable scenery.", "date": "2013-06-29", "grade": "8.0"}
