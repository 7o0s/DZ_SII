{"name": "Animal Crossing: Wild World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/animal-crossing-wild-world.html", "text": "Singular feminine Population growing! One of two daredevil village guards it is peaceful coexistence, it is knowing how to live and knowing how to grow, expanding and developing one's own taste in furnishings, it is learning to live with people with strange phobias and still managing to create a relationship of intimate friendship, it is learning to living with what nature has to offer, that's Animal Crossing. The crossroads of animals If you have to start somewhere, then first of all it is useful to say that Animal Crossing is in fact a sort of life simulator set in a funny world populated by animals with bizarre habits, where time passes as in real life following the time set inside the ds: if you turn on the console at seven in the evening you will find yourself at sunset, if you turn it on at three in the night everything will be dark and with the vacationers in bed. The game begins through the eyes of the protagonist who, sitting in the back seat of a taxi driven by a frog, travels on a rainy day to reach his new home. Through the questions of the curious taxi driver, through a series of multiple answers, the game will automatically calculate the somatic features and gender of the protagonist so as to arrive in the village with a fully formed identity. Upon reaching their destination, the player will be in possession of an empty house, ~kindly~ granted by Tom Nook, the raccoon who owns the only shop in the village. The meeting with Tom also highlights one of the main rules of the game: nothing is free and everything must be earned with hard work and a lot of good will; the main debt incumbent on the game is that linked to the payment of the house: Tom Nook is a good merchant and as such, while not requiring tight delivery times, he still expects to receive money for the services offered. In the early hours of the game, given the actual poverty of the character, Tom will offer the player the opportunity to perform a varied series of jobs with the dual purpose of earning money and following a tutorial. In this tutorial the player will have to face practically all the possibilities offered by the game ranging from planting trees and flowers, to writing promotional messages on the public bulletin board, to delivering packages among villagers, to writing heartfelt letters of thanks for the loyalty towards Nook and its store. These operations, as trivial and boring as they may seem, are the perfect mirror and testing ground for the character's future abilities, because in fact this deals with Animal crossing: it is peaceful coexistence, it is knowing how to live and knowing how to grow, expanding and developing your own taste in furniture is learning to live with people with strange phobias and still being able to create a relationship of intimate friendship, it is learning to live with what nature can offer, it is Animal Crossing. Arts&Crafts As previously announced, the possibilities offered by this strange virtual life are the most varied and however idyllic life in the middle of nature may be, one of the first things you will learn is that it is essential to make money. This strenuous debt collection activity can be carried out in various ways, the first - the simplest - being linked to fruit plantations: at the start of the game the player will find the village full of trees of the same fruit which can be sold at the shop of Nook for a ridiculous amount, the secret of your success will be to exchange fruit with your neighbors or friends to grow as many 'exotic' fruit trees valued at almost their weight in gold. Fishing will offer other excellent ideas for making money, the most important thing will be to have an excellent nose for the highest paid fish (it will be possible to make a first skimming by choosing from the size of the silhouette of the fish in the water) and impeccable timing. In the same way, insects can be caught and fossils brought to light. In addition to selling what nature offers, it will be possible to bring everything to the municipal museum and donate it, in fact it is possible to find here four different collections related to the marine world, fossils, insects and paintings. The difficulty of filling the museum lies entirely in the constancy and patience that the player will have in the succession of seasons: insects and fish in fact reflect the natural course of things and as such some will only be found at certain times of the year or if of particular climatic conditions.

[/C] Gamecube vs. DS The Ds, during the game proves to be the perfect tool for vLive this strange world: the movement of the character is much more immediate than with the pad, just place the stylus on your character and then guide it anywhere within the village; to dig, simply point the nib at a cleared area of ground and - shovel in hand - a perfect semi-spherical hole will be made; the fishing phase is lightened by the very useful grip suggestion offered by the force feedback of the cube pad, but it is enriched by the possibility of simply touching the float when the fish bites to be able to capture it (and here you can easily say goodbye to furious sessions of tapping on the poor button A of the cube); finally writing is no longer a handicap or a boring pastime, but a feature that finally has the importance it deserves with a tool that allows the quick creation of letters and announcements. In addition to the important and obvious innovations dictated by the presence of the touch screen, Wild World inserts a series of new elements and new modalities; the first news comes from the tools owned by the character: to the classic set consisting of shovel-axe-fishing rod and net, a slingshot is added to hit the gift packages floating in the sky and a stopwatch, useful entertainment in multiplayer mode for competitions impromptu fishing or timed hide-and-seek sessions. The village undergoes some slight modifications to meet the new ways of using the game: compared to the cube version, the police district has disappeared, replaced by the village gates, useful for visiting friends and strangers; the landfill was placed inside the town hall in the form of a dumpster; the mail has been merged with a sort of bank which gives the player the possibility to deposit money and receive monthly interest. The Able sisters, the village seamstresses, remain substantially the same but add a corner to the shop for the sale of accessories, real character customization objects (there you can buy dozens of hats, glasses, masks, mustaches, fake beards , headdresses and much more than what a human mind could imagine); the same goes for Tom Nook who remains equally unchanged, with the only addition - in the advanced expansion level - of a hairdresser. [C] Witch hunt Har Har Har! Parade on the beach [/C] Animals online Thanks to the new possibilities related to the wifi service, Animal Crossing is proposed as one of the fantastic four launch games of the service: the online one had been one of the worries at the exit of the chapter per cube which only allowed two players in possession of the game met through the 'sharing' of the data present on the memory card, the further problem was that a player could visit a friend's village but without this being present (and only on this could an article be written about the devastation wrought in the other people's villages...). After announcements of possible sequels on cube with online service, Nintendo has decided to shift the project directly to ds, a platform much more accustomed to online gaming. The game can be used both in LAN and in WiFi, in the first case it is possible to play up to four people at the same time in the same village with the possibility of chatting and exchanging objects: a step forward in the most appropriate direction for a game of this kind . As in the chapter for the cube, here too it will be necessary to pay attention to the correspondence sent to one's holidaymakers because they will not think twice before showing it to the first person who happens to visit the village (with moments of great embarrassment). The wifi mode works in the same way as Mario Kart: there will be no possibility of finding a stranger wandering through our village, because the only way to enter will be to have the friend's friend code and make him open the gate to let us through: undoubtedly limiting but in fact the only way to prevent online gaming from suffering from barbaric actions by users less close to the spirit of the game. For those who, due to lack of friends or the desire to find new ones, don't want to play using a friend code, Nintendo still leaves a window open to randomness through the use of messages in a bottle. These, common items bought in Tom Nook's shop, will contain a customizable message which, entrusted to the network, will look for other players in the world who, also bottle in hand, will be waiting for a still unknown friend. Cats... K.K. the wandering guitarist ...and owls Animals online The graphic sector does not aim to amaze for power but for the colorful, comic look and for the assloud, crazy and temperamentally believable characters created for the game. A very successful gimmick for this chapter is the spherical distortion of the terrain which ideally transforms the village into a real miniature world. The music is entrusted once again to the real equivalent of KKSlider, Kazumi Totaka, who has created a set of songs that really adapt well to the light-hearted air of the game. It should be noted that the music changes every hour and is linked quite well to the different moments of the day with more rhythmic songs during the hours of light and more relaxed during the night. Gorillas dressed as bouncers, superhero squirrels, zombie dogs, metal rhinos, Animal Crossing is all this and more, an experience that must be lived, a life that must be tried. An excellently crafted sequel with everything its predecessor lacked and on a platform that fits perfectly with the needs and spirit of the game. However, there are still some defects related above all to the exploitation of the multiplayer service, probably too neutered by the 'all out' policy imposed by Nintendo. Pros: The touch screen is used perfectly Animal Crossing seems born to be played on DS It's Online! Cons: the online service could and should have been more massive, it takes a lot of patience and perseverance to play it properly Animal Crossing: Wild World is the new chapter of a franchise born for the Japanese market on N64 under the name of Animal Forest, brought to success and notoriety in the western world through the chapter on Gamecube, and finally programmed from scratch for the new portable nintendo implementing what are the mechanics suitable for the use of a touch screen. Animal Crossing is one of those games that is difficult to explain in a few words, of those games that have so many possibilities that mentioning just a few of them diminishes the final value of the product and three reviews probably wouldn't be enough to list them all. To support this thesis, the simple type of game, the so-called ~virtual life~ between animals, fruit, fish and fossils, debts, trees to plant and to care for, a museum to fill, appointments to respect and good neighborly relations to maintain . In short, a life at full capacity that will not fail to amuse the player with the weapons that Nintendo has always used to impress video game enthusiasts: catchy music, colorful graphics and endless game possibilities. All that remains is to continue reading, take the first available taxi and prepare to live in this wild world.", "date": "2006-02-24", "grade": null}
