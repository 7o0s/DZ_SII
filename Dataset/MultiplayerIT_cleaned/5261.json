And also if it was hard to believe that the game would have remained forever forbidden to owners of the current home platforms of Microsoft and Sony, the news of the porting has caused more than a few sighs of relief among fans of the series, accompanied however also by some legitimate perplexities about the conversion work, entrusted to the external team The Workshop and above all weighed down by the aftermath of bugs and various problems that afflicted the very first releases of the PC version. After testing XCOM 2 on PlayStation 4, let's go and find out how Firaxis's strategy behaves with the pad and see if the eight months after the original have actually served to fix something. While inevitably inferior to the PC version, XCOM 2 on console remains an excellent strategy game Not beautiful but charming Let's start by specifying the contents of XCOM 2 on consoles: the game is obviously the same, a beautiful title that on these pages our Simone Tagliaferri had rewarded with a robust 9.1 in its original PC guise, but those who expected the presence of all the DLCs released so far in the standard edition are bound to disappoint. In fact, anyone who has grabbed a copy with a pre-order is entitled to the Resistance Warrior Pack (i.e. a large collection of extra customization elements for the soldiers), while only the Digital Deluxe version also includes the three expansions created by Firaxis in the past months which add new missions to the campaign as well as additional trophies and achievements. Having clarified this aspect, we can move onto a more strictly playful terrain, emphasizing how in this article we will focus mainly on the peculiar characteristics of this console version and the main differences with the PC counterpart. Let's start by analyzing the performance of XCOM 2 from a technical point of view, an area that immediately arouses some slight discontent regarding the considerable length of the uploads and the shots that punctuate the sequences that accompany them. Nothing that affects the gameplay, of course, but in any case signals of a port that is certainly not destined to enter the history books: in this sense also the failed corrections of certain distortions that clearly emerged already eight months ago (above all the camera that often goes crazy while following the actions of the soldiers in the field) and who reappear here. A frame rate subject to sudden and not always understandable drops completes a picture that certainly cannot be defined as idyllic - above all considering a merely discreet visual system - but which fortunately fades into the background in the presence of the indisputable qualities of the play structure of XCOM 2, which also here we confirm capable of enriching and expanding the already phenomenal alchemy revived by its predecessor. Playstation 4 trophies XCOM 2 offers 51 trophies, divided into 38 bronze, 10 silver, two gold and one platinum, the latter obtainable as usual after unlocking all the others. A task that does not envisage an easy task, given that - excluding a large part of the prizes awarded with the natural progression in the campaign - the greatest challenge consists in completing some specific objectives at the highest levels of difficulty, an undertaking dedicated to the most skilled and patient strategists. You don't live by mouse alone If from a technical point of view this port of XCOM 2 does not give entirely positive sensations, on the other hand it is difficult to complain about the work done on two fundamental aspects for a strategy game that comes out on consoles, namely the interface and the control system. While largely based on a formula that we had already had the opportunity to appreciate in the previous chapter, it is right to underline again the merits of a system that allows you to experience the countryside without regretting too much a desk setup complete with mouse and keyboard. The navigation of the menus that make up the planning and operations planning phase (to understand what happens inside the Avenger, the flying base that acts as headquarters) is made particularly agile by a good use of shortcuts assigned to the main keys and using the bibs to quickly switch between sections of the various areas of interest. Text windows and on-screen information are always clear and easy to read, with the only exception of longer descriptions which feature automatic scrollingico way too slow. The world map also does its job well, showcasing all the necessary data and allowing you to move from one area of the planet to another in just a few inputs. Good sensations that continue also and above all on the battlefield, where you can count on all the tools necessary to manage your troops more than satisfactorily. The analog sticks allow you to move the cursor and move the view, while the left rear trigger manages the zoom and the d-pad allows you to rotate the isometric camera and to raise or lower the reference plane, greatly facilitating navigation on the structures developed in vertical. Some small duty is paid when the right trigger is pressed to select the different actions that can be performed by the soldiers in their turn (variable according to the class they belong to and the type of equipment), a procedure that can sometimes be a bit cumbersome and that would undoubtedly have benefited from the presence of a greater number of shortcuts via keys. To say that XCOM 2 is played more comfortably on PC is equivalent to discovering hot water, but the fact remains that even in this console incarnation the Firaxis title is extremely enjoyable, while guaranteeing a softer approach to users less accustomed to the genre.", "date": "2016-10-04", "grade": "9.0"}
