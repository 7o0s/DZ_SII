{"name": "CivCity Roma - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/civcity-roma-recensione.html", "text": "The dawn of an empire To begin, let's immediately forget the cold numbers: about 20 hours of play to finish the ~campaign~ mode (and many more if you also want to tackle the single maps and the sandbox), 75 different units, 115 different types of buildings, 34 missions and 27 maps. A lesson that one learns early on, right from the very first levels, is that as in all self-respecting ~serious~ strategists, even in CivCity Roma there is little room for approximation and a certain amount of planning is required for one's actions : even just choosing the right location for a residential centre, a well or a watchtower can prove to be much more important than one might think. Thinking before clicking is therefore the first and most important rule to keep in mind: playing carelessly and casually leads in 99% of cases to compromising the mission and therefore having to reload the last save. Acting wisely, the mechanism will be set in motion and the city will begin to thrive. To understand how fine certain mechanics are, we can give this example: in everyday life every citizen has a precise and delimited range of action, which makes him lean towards frequenting only the places closest to his home; to optimize practicality in this sense, it is also possible to decide to intervene directly and have entire families moved to areas closer to the workplace or to the services they need. the artificial intelligence is developed in a more than good way, and unlike what we find in similar games, the inhabitants of the cities are not a simple mass of mindless entities The dawn of an empire To keep an eye on everything, the player has at his disposal the usual series of menus and summary screens from which it is possible to evaluate every single aspect of city life in just a few clicks, from the level of happiness of the inhabitants to the public finances, from the number of unemployed to religious statistics. Artificial intelligence is developed in a more than good way, and unlike what we find in similar games, city dwellers are not a simple mass of mindless entities. Each person is unique, and has his own name and surname, a family, and if he's lucky enough, even a job (from this point of view we can say that little or nothing has changed in more than 2000 years...). The very high care dedicated to animations and small details allows you to follow any citizen and see him as he lives his life: at work, at home with his family, at the temple to pray, at the amphitheater for recreation and so on. The hard life of the governor Initially the player takes on the role of an ~itinerant~ governor, who is moved from one small settlement to another with the aim of bringing prosperity where there were only small, civilly and technologically backward villages. The first big assignment comes only after a few missions, when Rome entrusts the player with the construction of the city of Taranto. Continuing to be successful, the Roman senators will be impressed to the point that they will request our services in the Eternal City. The underlying strategy of the game, of course, is to build a city where wealth and prosperity reign. To do this, a myriad of aspects will have to be kept at bay: it will have to be ensured that citizens are happy by providing them with jobs, housing, fair wages, not too high taxes, entertainment areas; the creation of farms, cultivated fields, mines, oil mills will have to be planned in the best possible way; it will also be necessary to establish economic agreements with other nearby cities or with Rome. the underlying strategy of the game, of course, is to build a city where well-being and prosperity reign The hard life of the governor The game is not only reduced to a peaceful and undisturbed construction of the city, but also ranges in the field of services and in the military: in fact, it will be necessary to set up watch towers to avoid attacks by wild beasts, as well as set up firefighters in the areas with high fire risk; when certain progress has been made in the game it will then be necessary to arm a real army to defend against enemy attacks. Far from the complexity of a Rome: Total War, the real war aspect is reduced to building forts, barracks and armories to be made available to the troops, who will be automatically enlisted. In addition to patrolling the city borders, troops can also be sent out to intercept any enemy forces (and thus prevent attacks) or even to conquer enemy cities and subject them to the glorious Roman Empire. The basis on herethe game system rests on it is solid, but CivCity Rome pays too much resemblance to the famous Caesar 3, not stealing from Civilization 4 those gameplay elements that would have brought a nice dose of innovation to the ~city-builder~ genre (a part of the obvious elements on the research of technologies and wonders). Learn by playing Inside CivCity Rome we can find the ~Civilopedia~, a sort of small encyclopedia that collects a large amount of real historical facts that can be consulted at any time (more than a thousand in total). In this sort of ~tourist guide~ of ancient Rome you will find all the curiosities concerning the life and development of the city. Not one of those extras that tip the balance in favor of the game, but undoubtedly a nice little addition and, if you like, also with a certain cultural component. Graphics and sound The two series of which CivCity Rome is the son, above all Civilization, have never amazed users from a graphic point of view, but have always aimed at functionality. Once again no exceptions, but while not reaching hitherto unexplored technical peaks, CivCity Rome is certainly satisfying, above all in function of the almost maniacal care used for the numerous animations and small details relating to each different construction or each different inhabitant. The engine, of course, is completely in three dimensions, and the game view can be rotated and zoomed at will using the mouse or keyboard, but it cannot be tilted, and this may displease the most curious since it does not allow you to peek inside properly each structure. The graphics engine is not particularly heavy, and can be pushed to the maximum even on mid-range PCs. The menus are easy to read and quite practical, but perhaps they occupy too large a portion of the screen, sacrificing the view of a part of the play area. The sound effects and ambient music perform their assigned task well, while the dubbing, entirely in Italian, stands at more than fair levels. Final comment A good real-time strategic/management title, which, although it fails to keep all the promises that are implicitly made by the high-sounding names involved in the project and does not reach the depth levels of Civilization IV, manages to satisfy even the finest palates and offer a sufficiently challenging challenge. Its biggest flaw is that it knows too much that has already been seen and does not introduce particularly newsworthy innovations. The mechanics are very similar to Caesar 3, which for the record is a game released in 1998 and of which the highly anticipated sequel will soon arrive. Another flaw that should not be underestimated is the lack of multiplayer mode, present in Civilization IV despite the turn-based nature. In a nutshell: recommended mainly for true enthusiasts or total newbies of the genre, for whom CivCity Rome could be an excellent ~school ship~. Pros Deep and sufficiently challenging Good artificial intelligence Attention to detail Cons Poor innovation Long loading times and swapping with 1 gig of RAM or less Lack of a multiplayer mode CivCity Rome is the result of a collaboration between two software houses particularly appreciated in the strategic field: FireFly Studios, the developers of the Stronghold series, and Firaxis Games, to whom we owe none other than the Civilization series. This first premise alone is enough to make the mouth water of fans of the genre, certainly fascinated by the potential of a project carried out by such expert minds. In short, a sort of spin-off like Alpha Centauri was, but with a strong historical imprint. Wanting to present CivCity Rome in a nutshell, it could be said that it can be seen as a chapter in the Civilization series where instead of the turn-based system the real-time system is used and instead of the construction of immense and boundless empires the focus on a single city, which in this case is not just any city but the mythical, the eternal one: Rome. Wanting to be even more synthetic (and maybe even a little naughty), we could say: ~a kind of Caesar 3~. But what matters is the final result: will it be what everyone expects, that is a clever mix of intriguing game mechanics borrowed from two very famous series, or an anonymous slop that disappoints expectations?
