Of course, the distance between the two products remains wide, given that on iOS and Android we are talking about a simple gestural fighting game, a sub-genre that has recently become the most popular in the mobile sector but which has somehow yet to find its own identity, given the frequent concessions to trivial and repetitive mechanisms. One thing is certain: for this new episode we got rid of the cards and quick time events in favor of a more practical and resolute approach, with rather rich modalities although the story mode currently includes only the first chapter and therefore presents itself as a open construction site, to be developed over the next few months. The plot and cinematics are the same, splendid, seen on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (Italian dubbing aside), so we are talking about a very engaging and well-told story that supports the matches between heroes and villains of a DC universe alternate in which Superman lost his mind and decided to establish a totalitarian world regime to nip crime in the bud. What changes is the structure of the fights, which in this case takes advantage of the traditional teams made up of three characters and a control system based on touches and gestures, not without a certain degree of strategy but often redundant. The mobile version of Injustice 2 substantially improves the experience of the first episode It's an injustice! The mobile version of Injustice 2 offers the aforementioned incomplete story mode, an arena mode for asynchronous multiplayer matches and a very long campaign, built according to the typical style of freemium productions and therefore characterized by sudden increases in difficulty that force you to make some ' of grinding or investing real money in strengthening your team. Another crucial aspect of the experience lies in the unlocking of heroes and villains in multiple versions, obtainable by opening the inevitable boxes and upgradeable with the use of materials obtained by winning fights. In short, we are talking about a traditional progression system, which bases its charm on obtaining new characters but at the same time places a series of limits on the use of the experience, such as the aforementioned increase in difficulty and the energy of action, which requires the spending of some points (rechargeable over time) to be able to try new missions. Injustice 2 therefore proves to be pleasant but extraordinary, although from a technical point of view a great job has been done: not only are the cutscenes present in the console version of the game, as previously reported, but also the polygonal models and the spectacular specials look for to trace what is available in the ~major~ edition, net of a necessarily lower yield. So yes, you will send your opponent into orbit with Batman and then have him targeted by the Batwing, or as Cyborg you will send the enemy to Apokolips to be kicked by Darkseid's troops and welcome him back with a powerful laser beam.", "date": "2017-05-17", "grade": "7.7"}
