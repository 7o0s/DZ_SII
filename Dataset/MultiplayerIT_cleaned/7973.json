The third chapter arrived in an overbearing way on PlayStation 3, closing the story of Kratos and proposing a spectacular technical sector, which consecrated Santa Monica Studios as one of the most talented teams around. Even if we are convinced that there will be a fourth official chapter, the Californian development studio has decided in the meantime to delve into other events concerning Kratos and which take place earlier than we have seen to date, adding a multiplayer section to the package according to the classical sense of the term. The most fearful who see the latter as an aberration for a title of this kind can rest easy: we completed God of War: Ascension in about 10 hours, the standard for the series, and it didn't seem that the multiplayer component has taken away resources from the realization of the main story. Troubled ascent Between flashbacks and revelations, but with little imagination and twists, this chapter begins shortly after the killing by Kratos of his family, up to his attempt to get rid of the blood pact signed with Ares, the god of war. Getting in the way are the Furies, primordial entities who are neither Titans nor gods, neither ghosts nor humans, who on the one hand plot together with Ares to take possession of Olympus, on the other they trap those who try to rebel and do not honor pacts like the one between Kratos and Ares himself. That's exactly how the game begins, with the ~cut off~ face of the main protagonist in the foreground, as per tradition, trapped and tortured by one of the Furies. The ball passes immediately to the player; however, it is necessary to constantly check the jaw and salivation because, like the third chapter, the first steps with God of War: Ascension are a mixture of adrenaline and incredible events, which highlight even more the fundamental canons of the saga and cause pleasure and constant amazement. Perhaps a little more diluted but also more prolonged, just think that the entire first part of the game takes place above the Centimani, a monstrous and enormous creature trapped by the Furies and on whose skin enormous structures have developed and the same lair that Kratos intends to reach to free himself from his innermost nightmares (not knowing what will happen to him in the next three chapters, we add). From fighting some of his mutated hands, to buildings being ripped apart as Kratos fights inside them, to the ~horseback~ clash of a huge hand against the head of the Centimani himself, God of War: Ascension is a feast for the eyes and really gives the feeling of being immersed in something huge. The graphics engine doesn't spare itself from shooting everything it has to offer in the face, up to the last polygon, while the main protagonist is controlled in all this graphic orgy interspersed with interactive sequences, dialogues and mutations of the game environment. Following the curse of the game director, also for this chapter we have a new one, Todd Papy, who together with the developers cut his teeth with the first chapter for PlayStation 3, introducing various variations on the theme and refining an already spectacular technical system . Obviously the foundations of the gameplay are the usual, excellent ones of the series: a third-person action that gives its best thanks to the bloody and spectacular moves of the main protagonist, interspersed with ~quicktime~ sequences to finish off the most difficult enemies, platform sections and of connection and puzzle of physical type. Always in view of the spectacularization mentioned above, God of War: Ascension is one of the very few titles that still today can afford to have automatic management of the view and camera; the beauty is that it works 99% of the time, offering breathtaking views and never ~snapping~ the action, a real godsend to focus on the fights and all the good things that happen on the screen. Starting from these solid foundations, there is actually more than one novelty that characterizes the gameplay, mixing old and new elements and making the execution a little more dynamic. First of all, the control system which provides a new function of the circle key, no longer used for grappling but for the secondary weapon. In fact, during the course of the adventure Kratos can rwelcome different types from the surrounding environment or from defeated enemies, and then use specific moves depending on their type. These weapons may or may not be ~permanent~ while the classic sword grappling and finishing moves for opponents have been ~transferred~ to the R1 key. For the rest we are immediately at home with the right analog used for dodging, X for jumping, square and triangle for light and heavy attacks, L1 for parrying. Playing with the elements Kratos still doesn't have the signs of the most acute suffering on his face, but he has lost his family a few months ago and has to fight with the Furies who are able to change the reality that appears before him; the Blades of Chaos are faithful friends and for this chapter the developers have decided to imbue them with four elements that are unlocked as the adventure continues. The first is the fury of Ares, which enriches each slash of the god of war's fire, then the lightning of Zeus, which together with the remaining two is recalled with the digital cross. Each element is linked to a bar of anger present in the lower right corner of the screen, which fills up when you ring in combos without taking hits; when the apex is reached, Kratos' shots become more lethal and the pressure of L3+R3 allows you to release a sort of special move that is different depending on the chosen element. There is also the classic magic related to mana consumption (with R2), which becomes a panacea when you are a little too surrounded by enemies. The interesting thing about this system is the progressive unlocking of the various skills through the well-known red spheres; only the fire of Ares makes (almost) everything available immediately, for the other three elements you need to wisely spend the spheres available and choose which skills can be better in the most agitated moments of combat. To close the circle on the control and combat system there are three artifacts that Kratos obtains during the adventure and which heavily affect the gameplay. Thanks to the Amulet of Ouroboros, for example, Kratos is able to rebuild or destroy entire pieces of the scenario, as well as suspend the debris in the air in such a way as to create platforms to climb. It is easy to imagine how this possibility has been used by the developers to create very interesting wide-ranging puzzles, never too long to complete and not even trivial. All indulging himself with top-level graphic effects, always attesting to how the graphic engine of God of War: Ascension has very few rivals with which to compare. Orkos' oathstone instead allows Kratos to split into two, so think about the possibility of leaving your clone to turn cranks, use its weight on some pressure platforms and more. Not infrequently we have had to use our gray matter to solve them. These artifacts also have an attack value, in fact they are activated with L2 in conjunction with the front keys of the pad and allow in the first case to slow down the enemies, in the second to have a fighter at your side for a short time. All these variations on the theme and various reshuffles have led to a more fluid execution of the combos by Kratos, and a less cumbersome combat system than in the past but equally spectacular. We happened to throw a couple of slashes with the square button, then a decisive blow with the triangle, and still a succession with the secondary weapon, perhaps an axe, and finally a hold that ended with the launch of the unfortunate opponent. Combinations like this can be much more frequent once you have mastered the various combos available, perhaps even taking advantage of the always full rage bar to dance on your opponents and finish them off in an extremely spectacular way. We must also take into account which element to use also because some enemies release spheres based on this, from the golden ones necessary for anger to the green ones for energy; at the intermediate difficulty level things get serious starting from the second half of the adventure, even if the veterans of the saga will have no difficulty completing the game with few deaths. Starting from the difficult one, to continue with Titan where the enemies beat like blacksmiths, we noticed how compared to the past it is more necessary to use parry and dodge to avoid reaching premature death, together with the above combos that can make life more easy. The enemies are partly taken from the previous chapters, especially the ~minor~ ones, however they are enriched in detail and in physical features; others are completely unpublished apart fromire from the Centimani and from those of more generous dimensions. Between platforming and exploration The synergy with the Uncharted developers, assumed by us but fueled by a dedicated trophy, has given the game wider platform sections where Kratos climbs, for example, the statue of Apollo and other ledges, or when to reach the city of Delphi the the main protagonist must activate some huge gears which in turn move mechanical snakes that intertwine with each other, while the Spartan warrior switches from one to another on the move, the camera glimpses are spectacular and maybe you even have to fight some opponents. We can give another example when we have to face the guardian of the oracle, who must be chased while the whole setting collapses underfoot, in a completely similar way to what happens in Uncharted 2. And again when Kratos finds himself going down to all speed while avoiding obstacles and then grappling with the blades from handhold to handhold. Slightly more fluid gameplay, more airy platform sections and puzzles that make good use of the environment and the artifacts acquired by Kratos, with these credentials therefore God of War: Ascension can be defined as an evolution of the previous chapter, which thanks to these small corrections never gets boring and pleases throughout its duration. From here we refer once again to the technical sector, which in the Santa Monica title is truly sensational. The opponents and the characters are even more detailed and full-bodied from a polygonal point of view, in some situations it is really difficult to metabolize everything that happens on the screen, also thanks to the often sustained action. The depth of field and the light sources give the scene an exceptional impact, with bloom everywhere and an obsessive attention to detail. The graphic effects do the rest and the textures are well-made for a good part of the time, even if less in dark environments. Honorable mention for the final fight, a riot and a frenzy of graphic detail and action, something incredible and imperious that exalted us and made us appreciate the work done by the developers even more. Then there are a whole series of touches of class, such as the most insignificant candles which in any case shed light on Kratos and on the walls and in general the artistic side is of the highest level as regards structures, characters and chromatic choices of a good part of the environments. All this goodness is paid for with a fluidity that oscillates between 30 and 60 frames per second (which is slightly noticeable even if the response to the commands has improved) and by a less marked use of anti-aliasing than in the third chapter , with some settings, those with the highest contrast, appearing a bit dirty. It would have been fantastic to have always perfect fluidity and graphic cleanliness, but this does not mean that the Santa Monica title is graphically sensational and in some respects unattainable for other productions on consoles. God of War: Ascension is completely in Italian both as regards the dubbing and the texts, we must say however that in the first case there are too many ups and downs especially for the secondary characters, when instead the original one in English maintains an ever better quality. Purists and undecideds can select the dubbing in one language and subtitles in another, but a better job could have been done. With the soundtrack you are immediately at home, as it is the well-known one of the series enriched by new arrangements, therefore excellent quality but little novelty. All roses and flowers? No, there are some flaws, more or less important depending on one's degree of attention and tolerance. It is clear that despite the innovations listed above, we are faced with the fourth regular chapter of the saga and the sixth overall, it is therefore normal that some things surprise less and are seen as taken for granted, albeit never boring. The more introspective story, with a less violent Kratos against ~normal~ people (and no sex scenes, a little respect for those who have just lost their family), could in our view be told better and enriched with supporting characters charismatic beyond the Furies. God of War 3 in this sense we liked it better, after all Kratos began by climbing Olympus, facing Zeus' henchmen and destroying everything until the end. A pathos of this kind has not been reproduced here, both for the intermediate ~historical~ period and also for deficiencies from a purely narrative point of view. Even if the duration can be defined in line with the other chapters, a couple of huge bosses more would not have hurt, but it is true that the Centimani and the final part clearly demonstrate a", "date": "2013-03-07", "grade": "9.3"}
