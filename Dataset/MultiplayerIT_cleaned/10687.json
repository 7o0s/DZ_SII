The possibility of collecting and throwing objects throughout the map, as well as illustrating the evolution of physics in modern videogaming, had aroused interest in the community linked to FPS who never would have imagined finding it on XBox Arcade and Playstation Network. Unfortunately the economic nature of the title has not led to substantial improvements as regards the exploitation of physics, indeed it is clear that compared to the tech demo there has been a massive downgrade in the engine's possibilities, but the title has somehow developed, focusing his attention on the arena component that recalls the progenitors of the genre among which Quake Arena, Unreal Tournament and in some situations even Tribes stand out. All for one, one for all It is therefore a multiplayer shooter for consoles that tries to find a place in a panorama dominated almost exclusively by Halo on XBox 360 and by Killzone 2 on Playstation 3, excluding the Call Of Duty series which also in multiplayer mode maintains a strong link with reality. It was probably the imperative need to offer something more that led Psychokinetic Wars to embrace the entire panorama of multiplayer arenas starting from the previously mentioned Unreal with which it shares the basis of the graphics engine and the style of the weapons. In fact, in no uncertain terms, we could consider Cellfactor as a large container, a clear attempt to integrate the map design and weapons of Quake and Unreal with a style of movement that in some situations recalls Tribes, obviously adapting everything to the pad that allows you to perform several moves at the same time thanks to the layout of the keys. In a nutshell it is a large recovery and adaptation operation which unfortunately does not include the game modes, limited exclusively to the very classic Capture the Flag, Assault and Deathmatch. Even the single player mode is not particularly inspired and represents more of a mega-tutorial for a couple of hours equipped with an influential scoring system only for unlocking objectives and rewards, i.e. bonuses that allow you to slightly customize the abilities of the characters, even in multiplayer, varying the gaming experience based on your tastes. In any case, the inclusion of bots with decent intelligence in an economic title is a good thing in itself. Flour from your own sack? Fortunately, Cellfactor adds its own ingredient to the recipe, already evident from the title, which characterizes the three characters available. We are talking about the psychokinetic powers that allow you to throw objects, protect the characters, jump, fly and run at super speed and which, in practice, justify the fact that the three characters embody three different ways of playing typical of the fps of this genre. In fact, it is precisely the psychokinesis that gives the Bishop the ability to glide and that directly recalls the typical style of play of Tribes, but at the same time the gameplay is enriched and includes the ability to deflect shots, stun opponents and throw multiple objects at the same time. Even the BlackOp can deflect enemy projectiles but can only throw one object at a time and instead of flying must rely on a short-range teleportation that refers directly to the Unreal Tournament teleporter. As an extra ability, the BlackOP is the only character able to collect and use the timed mines scattered around the map, essential for effectively defending a base or a flag. Finally, the Guardian towers over all, a powerful figure who has no defense but can rely on enormous firepower thanks to the ability to wield any two weapons simultaneously. In order to defend himself, the Guardian must resort to a rapid dodge and to move quickly he can perform a super jump that can also be performed in mid-air, saving the character from falling into the void and from too excited and dangerous situations. The latter character also has a short superrun available which can be used to repel objects that are thrown at him and to instantly kill an opponent who is in his path. Xbox 360 goals Completing the 30 single player challenges grants a pretty easy 95 points. Multiplayer achievements are also pretty straightforward and net an additional 40 points. For the last 65 points it's a mere matter of time as you need to reach the million points and unlockare all the rewards. Rich but ugly The three characters and the amount of moves available certainly represent a plus for a title which, despite being located in the cheapest market segment, offers an enviable variety of situations. On the other hand, these are almost exclusively situations that have already been seen elsewhere but which, once mastered and chained together, build a tight and exciting style of play that offers, in addition, the possibility of unhinging bulkheads and supports to hurl them without too many compliments on the snout of the enemies. In a nutshell, a rich experience that, once the defense techniques of all the characters have been mastered, reveals a pretty good balance, both online and offline. A factor that allows both the possibility of launching into quick skirmishes and without too much effort, and the possibility of increasing one's skills by becoming real war machines. Given the immediacy of the fight, however, it is advisable to avoid games with too much latency in order to avoid annoying nervous movements. We then come to the downside or a rather poor technical realization which translates into the total lack of credible physics as a result of the blows and the impact due to objects thrown against the characters. Moreover, from a graphic point of view we are faced with an antiquated engine that certainly does not shine for the quality of the animations or for the variety of objects and textures. One of the most irritating problems derives from the difficulty in recognizing the opposing models, and therefore the relative combat capabilities, due to anonymous models, antediluvian textures, precise contours and a sea of gray that envelops most of the maps devouring the already meager details. An anonymous soundtrack and a set of unconvincing samples conclude a not exciting technical picture.", "date": "2009-06-17", "grade": "7.1"}
