Unlike the previous package, the update was not accompanied by sensitive changes to the simulator code, however the enthusiast community was piqued by a cryptic tweet from developer Brian Ekberg, which heralded a ~special surprise~ scheduled for the same week launch of the eBay Motors Car Pack. Although there has been speculation about hypothetical expansions similar to Rally and Storm Island appreciated on Forza Horizon, to date the words of the American developer seem to have fallen on deaf ears, and the only substantial change in recent days has been the introduction of the notorious microtransactions, received anything but positively by the players, although it is a completely irrelevant feature on the normal usability of the title. While waiting for news from Dan Greenawalt and associates, we took our trusty Thrustmaster TX Ferrari 458 Italia Edition and unleashed the horses of the seven new racing cars made available by Turn 10. The legendary McLaren MP4/4 arrives in the Forza Motorsport 6 eBay Motors Car Pack The road ones We begin our analysis with the fascinating Datsun 2000 Roadster, a series produced by the Nissan subsidiary between 1961 and 1970 which was able to distinguish itself as a valid economic alternative to the more expensive similar cars of the time, such as the Spider ~Duetto~ Alfa Romeo and the B by MG. Driven by a 2.0-litre engine with 135 horsepower, the little sports car, which won several races in the Sport Car Club of America championship, allowed you to enjoy the landscape with the wind in your hair and also indulge yourself in cornering. On Forza Motorsport 6 it is present with the 1969 model included in the new Class E (253), the ~slowest~ of the title and which generally includes classic cars of the same type. Stunning in the iconic red colour, the car is characterized by an excellent polygonal model spotted only by a pinch of aliasing on the chrome bumper, while the interior is also perfect in the rendering of the shadows. Although it is particularly docile and stable, the Datsun 2000 Roadster ~embarks~ easily in bends and has rather poor pickup, so much so that on the famous climb of the Circuit of Americas it stalls in third gear. Offering no particular flashes in terms of driving pleasure, it is an interesting model above all for its admirers. From the land of the rising sun we move to Australia, home of Holden, a car manufacturer known mainly for the Commodore. Among the most iconic cars it produced is the Torana, a series which between 1967 and 1980 was declined in numerous variants, some of which were able to impose themselves in the touring championships of the time and above all in the very famous Bathurst 1000 at Mount Panorama. On Forza Motorsport 6 we find it in the A9X version from 1977, a model equipped with a powerful 5.0-litre V8 and characterized by peculiar mechanical solutions. Included in the E(298) class, the Torana unfortunately does not involve either from an aesthetic point of view or for driving pleasure, presenting a polygonal model marred by a lot of aliasing and by a mediocre rendering of the interior. Behavior on the track is all too nervous and at high speeds, especially on uneven stretches of asphalt, you lose control very easily, a phenomenon amplified by the continuous need to make corrections to the trajectory and by particularly ineffective brakes. However, the glorious history makes the Torana attractive for Australian players, who will be able to appreciate the faithful replica of the engine roar. The last road car in the package is the beautiful Plymouth Prowler, the swan song of the American car manufacturer that closed its doors in 2001. Produced from 1999 to 2002, in the last year under the protective wings of Chrysler, the Prowler stood out above all for its fascinating line, deeply inspired by the legendary hot rods and characterized by some references to the Formula Indy. The car was equipped with a generous 253 horsepower 3.5-litre V6, an engine still considered ~too small~ by demanding American motorists. Despite the criticisms, thanks to the technological solutions used and the lightness of the frame, the Prowler guaranteed very interesting performance, especially during acceleration. On Forza Motorsport 6 it is present with the 2000 model and is included in class C(420), where it is appreciated for its stability, precision and driving pleasureout of the ordinary for a ~muscle car~ with stars and stripes. The polygonal model, splendid in the iconic yellow and orange, has interiors that are positively striking above all for the plastic shaders, while the aliasing is limited only to the edges of the doors. The damage system is not very realistic, also due to the front ~uncovered wheels~, while the engine sound is deep and vigorous. Unfortunately, unlike the 2000 Roadster and Torana, the Prowler cannot be used in career mode. The racing cars There was a time when Lancia produced splendid road cars capable of imposing themselves on the track as well, and the Lancia Corse Beta Montecarlo Turbo was undoubtedly among the most representative of the company together with the Delta. Derived from the Beta Montecarlo coup, the ~silhouette~ variant included in Group 5 was developed to compete in the World Sports Prototype Championship (formerly the World Championship for Makes), where it conquered the title in the two-year period 1980-1981 driven by very skilled drivers like our own Riccardo Patrese. On Forza Motorsport 6 it is an R(806) class and is particularly interesting both for the behavior and for the quality of the polygonal model, practically devoid of aliasing except for the rear lights. Thanks to its 480 horsepower 2.0-litre Turbo and exaggerated aerodynamics, the Lancia Corse Beta Montecarlo Turbo is fast, precise and above all extremely fun to drive, scratching the asphalt with a powerful sound that conquers for its vigor and modularity. It is undoubtedly a first choice in the Early GT Racing group of the Corsa Pro career volume. The second Italian racing car released with the eBay Motors Car Pack is the Maserati n 35 M. Calamia Swiss Team MC Trofeo, a 2014 GranTurismo modified to participate in the so-called Maserati Trophy, a competition born in 2003 to ~give~ wealthy customers the thrill of the track, like the analogous Ferrari Challenge. Included in the S-Class(774), the car has an excellent polygonal model especially in the exteriors, with little aliasing to affect the splendid yellow-black livery, while the interiors are a little too dark and poorly defined in the details. Being a brilliant touring car with a particularly stiff set-up, driving pleasure is enhanced by the precise force feedback effect returned by the steering wheel, as well as by the convincing roar of the engine. We return to Japan once again with the Mazda SpeedSource Lola B12/80, an LMP2 class prototype featuring an innovative 450 horsepower SKYACTIV-D diesel engine, developed to ensure excellent performance and reliability in endurance racing. In the title Turn 10 Studios it is included in Class P(961), and although it is not among the fastest cars on the very long straights of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, it amazes for its excellent grip and excellent visibility, a characteristic often sacrificed in this specific category. The sound of the engine is also excellent, with a hoarse and deep timbre that is especially enhanced when climbing. Although it suffers from aliasing in the upper portion of the chassis, the polygonal model is overall very solid, especially in the well-kept interior, where it is possible to appreciate the curious racing wheel that integrates the digital display inside. We close our overview with the ~queen~ of the package, whose feeling in our opinion has not been adequately reproduced by American developers. We are talking about the legendary McLaren MP4/4 of Team McLaren, the most victorious Formula One in the history of the sport (fifteen grand prix victories out of the sixteen raced in 1988) which has made headlines also due to the very heated rivalry between the two team mates , Alain Prost and the unfortunate Ayrton Senna. Included in Class X(999), the car has all the statistics set to the maximum, except for the top speed where it gets a 7.7 instead of the full 10. The sound of the engine, unfortunately, is absolutely not up to the original symphony, while the interiors, in addition to presenting shadows that are not very precise and defined, suffer from heavy and annoying aliasing. Although it is a very aggressive car and overall pleasant to drive, the force feedback effect is too lax and does not do justice to the sensations that such a model should have given. A real pity for those who play with the steering wheel.", "date": "2015-11-27", "grade": null}
