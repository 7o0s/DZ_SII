{"name": "Gungrave", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gungrave.html", "text": "How comfortable the coffin on the shoulders Gungrave is a third-person 3D action game in which the player is called upon to take on the role of the protagonist, Grave, going through levels absolutely crammed with enemies to be killed without thinking too much. The exploratory component is reduced to a minimum, so much so that the crossing of the various locations is not subject to any other condition other than the physical elimination of anything that moves. The key delegated to the use of the firearm is literally tortured during the game sessions, reaching levels attributable only to old school shooters. Playing the Sega production means turning off your brain and throwing yourself headlong into a storm of bullets; nevertheless, adrenaline and excitement soon leave room for listlessness and boredom, mainly due to very evident and difficult to ignore structural defects. In fact, although Gungrave was born as a 100% action-oriented product, and without the slightest intention of detaching itself from this definition, the Red Entertainment effort already fails miserably in the main cornerstones of such a title, starting with the control of the main character. In fact, Grave's slowness of movement is so accentuated and cloying as to appear completely out of place with the frenetic rhythm of the action; in fact, the clumsiness of the new hero prevents any attempt to avoid the waves of enemies that rush against him, thus effectively forcing the player to face the entire game head-on, limiting himself to passively eliminating anyone who comes within range. In reality, a key for running is present, and at least makes Grave's gait bearable; unfortunately, the programmers have decided to prohibit the possibility of shooting while sprinting which, in a game in which you find yourself shooting in 99% of the cases, makes this feature absolutely useless. In a questionable attempt to compensate, Red Entertainment has therefore deduced that if the main character of an action title cannot avoid the blows, then he must be immune to them. Yes, because Grave is in fact an almost-superman, resistant to enemy attacks in an absolutely exaggerated way so as to make his death a more unique than rare event; furthermore the ability, available during the adventure, to recover energy, makes the protagonist practically immortal. Faced with this feature, the key delegated to the ~Max Payne~ jump, as spectacular as it is useless in the economy of the game, also immediately loses its importance. The system for supplying special shots should take care of resolving the flatness of such gameplay: in other words, the execution of combos or in any case the non-stop destruction of both enemies and elements of the seabed leads to the increase of a bar which, once completed, gives the player an additional chance to take a ~Demolition Shot~. Among these, we mention the use of the coffin that Grave carries on his shoulders as a rocket launcher, or the frantic rotation of guns in his hand, with the relative elimination of anything within range. However, once the surprise factor has passed, this feature too soon turns out to be absolutely negligible, and in any case certainly unable to give rhythm and variety to a game that is chronically devoid of it. I want you on TV The structural poverty of the Sega production contrasts with the excellent graphic style used, a cel shading of splendid stylistic workmanship with a design that makes it more similar to an ~anime~ than a video game. From this point of view, the cartoon interlude sequences are small works of art, capable of at least delighting the player's aesthetic sense. The presence of aliasing and the all in all poor poligon counting are certainly negative aspects from a technical point of view, but dwelling on these defects would be a crime against the style adopted by Japanese graphics. It should be understood, however, that this point in favor of Red Entertainment's effort is absolutely not able to revive the fate of an unquestionably poorly balanced product in its contents, and which among other things is also blatantly flawed on the longevity side: the 6 levels present are in fact that can be completed without problems already in the first game session, and the extras to be unlocked are not even remotely capable of extending the life of the title. Comment Gungrave is a great cartoon, but a really bad video game; this is, in summary, the judgment that the latest Sega production for Ps2 deserves. Fort of a kinggraphics of the highest order, thanks to a design and a style that make it practically indistinguishable from a high quality ~Anime~, however it collapses miserably under the aspect of the game mechanics, as trivial and devoid of bite as boring and repetitive, due to more or less serious structural defects that are absolutely impossible to overshadow. Pros: Fabulous graphic characterization interlude sequences of very high quality spectacular for the first 5 minutes Cons: Repetitive and monotonous game action Intolerable slowness of the protagonist Excessive ease and longevity to a minimum To give life to a video game capable of remaining etched in the memory for a long time, numerous ~ingredients~ are needed which must be dosed with great care and attention. Among these, the validity of the gameplay certainly has a fundamental importance; but the style and design adopted should not be underestimated either, since that is precisely the aspect that invites the user or not to delve into the discovery of the game mechanics. It often happens that titles are born with strong imbalances on one or the other side, thus inevitably resulting in poorly balanced and therefore unattractive products. If on one side of the spectrum there are therefore examples such as the recent Haven, sunk by one of the ugliest and most anonymous character designs that history records, on the other we find the Gungrave here present, as exciting from a stylistic point of view as poor from that structural.", "date": "2003-01-10", "grade": null}
