{"name": "Grandia III", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grandia-iii_a.html", "text": "The Battle System The gameplay and the combat system have remained more or less the same as the previous chapter, which, at least for the second point, is in our opinion a good thing. In Grandia III there are no side-quests (excluding the Casino phases) but a single linear adventure that will take you from start to finish without much possibility of changing the path of our PCs. We are on the island of Titalos, where a 16-year-old boy, Yuki, has a secret dream: to become a pilot of ~flying ships~, thus emulating the deeds of his hero, the legendary ~King of the skies~, the Captain Schmidt, finding himself involved in an adventure together with the Elf shaman Alfina, who has the power to communicate with a powerful spirit called Grypt The Guardian, with the combative mother Miranda, and, later, with Alonso, Ulf, Dahna and Emelious. The battle system of the Grandia series has, as mentioned in the introduction, always been considered by enthusiasts as one of the best in the genre, if not the best ever. And also the one at the basis of the third episode of the saga is no different. Once again, in fact, it turns out to be the most interesting aspect of the game. Taking up a large part of the concept developed in the previous titles (frenzy, fun, strategy), the types of GA have implemented some new controls and a new ~move~, the Aerial Combo, which have made it even more attractive. Grandia III proposes, like its predecessors, a structure that provides for the absolute absence of random encounters: the enemy is visible on the screen and in most of the times can be avoided if you want. Only in the event of physical contact, i.e. going against the opponent, are you catapulted into the appropriate combat screen. This is really interesting, because it does not force the user to annoying and continuous interruptions during the exploratory phases or the crossing of certain areas, which is sometimes frustrating in other well-rated role-playing games. Interestingly, depending on where our Pg has touched the enemy on the map, our party will attack the latter from behind, from the side or from the front. Basically, the battles take place with the characters who move freely on the screen following the commands given by the gamer through the canonical graphical interface located this time in the upper left corner of the screen, in a circular shape. The icons relating to the characters and opponents scroll on it. When one of these icons reaches the Com point, the represented character will be able to choose which type of attack to undertake and see its effects in the subsequent Act point. Air attack Much of the combat strategy is based on the concept of ~cancel the enemy's move before he cancels you...~ . In fact, by taking advantage of the longer application time that some enemy moves may require, the implementation of one of our special abilities or a particular attack can totally cancel the ongoing offensive attempt of the opposing faction, if it is ~loading~ between the point Com and Act. This peculiarity, already appreciated by most in the previous episode of the series, means that we are never bored during these phases, as it forces the player to always make important choices during the course of the fights. Compared to the previous Grandia, as mentioned above, there is the novelty introduced of the Aerial Combo, a type of attack that nine out of ten will throw the unfortunate opponent into the air. While this is happening, if the icon of one of your PCs reaches the so-called Act point (Action) before the enemy touches the ground, by selecting the Combo command it will be possible to carry out a spectacular and devastating air attack, once again sending the opponent even more up and thus allowing another teammate to ~charge~ the icon up to his Act point for another Aerial Combo. If you manage to kill an enemy in this way, perhaps a very powerful one, you will finally get the Aerial Finish. By killing an enemy, especially if with one of these special abilities, the party will be able to collect many Items, with particular attention to the so-called Mana Eggs. It is precisely these mysterious ~Mana Eggs~ that once again manage the administration of the spells and skills of the various PCs. Magic Eggs A Mana Egg is nothing more than a container of spells, which can be extracted in special shops (techniques and spells can only be equipped at the ~shops~ or save points, normal or special). But if the gamer wishes, he can also limit himself to equipping them as they are, since ~unopened~ they can increase the power of the various elemental characteristics of the party members. Mana Eggs also have an extra functionwhich allows the user to fuse them in order to obtain more powerful eggs from which to extract equally powerful spells. As can be seen from all this, Game Arts grants the player a lot of freedom of choice with this system on how to customize the skills of their favorites. As with the eggs, even the Skill Books, other Items suitable for the growth of one's Pg, can be equipped to enhance the basic techniques or consumed to extract special abilities. Each of the heroes also has its own unique abilities based on five power levels. These skills can be increased thanks to the canonical Experience Points obtained after defeating enemies. By increasing power these skills can later, in addition to becoming more devastating, allow you to learn some new techniques to be used later during a fight using simply the Combo command. Speaking of PE and Level-Up of the PCs: contrary to other RPGs, in Grandia III the enemies do not present an increasing degree of difficulty, in the sense that you may encounter very strong opponents in apparently simple areas that are found after few hours from the beginning of the adventure. Once killed, these enemies will give you several Exp points, even higher than those obtainable perhaps by eliminating opponents who are in advanced levels of the game. So it will be up to you to decide when and where it is appropriate to stay and fight to increase your LE or when instead it is more appropriate to go back or continue in search of areas where there are certain types of more attractive monsters. An (almost) stunning graphic Graphically, the Game Arts title is very ~particular~, let's say so. The engine is truly remarkable, one of the best seen at work on Ps2, and manages to manage without particular problems (apart from some flickering here and there) scenarios with a vast horizon, globally splendid landscapes. However, it mysteriously alternates respectable aesthetic elements, with touches of class that visually satisfy the player's eye, especially in the initial part of the game, in the surroundings of Acriff or in the Dragon Valley, with others of just a sufficient quality level, and a little dull . It is true that the latter are in any case embellished with well-made particle effects, such as those of light or sand which, in the open, tend to make the difference that would otherwise exist with the other more refined areas we mentioned earlier less clear. but the reason for this technical difference is not understood. In short, to be honest, not all the scenarios are ~inspired~, and even the creation of the main PCs stands out more when compared to that adopted for the NPCs, but despite this, the work done is generally more than excellent. The audio sector instead, in addition to the soundtrack by a fairly fit Noriyuki Iwadare, already author of the music for True Love, the two Lunar for Psx and Radiata Stories, as well as the previous episodes of the series we are talking about, which remains on average quality levels, it also boasts a discreet dubbing and a sampling of sound effects in line with the old productions of the development team creator of the series, which however in the end proves to be without infamy and without praise, limiting itself to remaining in the limbo of ~average products~. Conclusions Grandia III is a good RPG, not a great RPG. This is our final judgment. Game Arts has packaged a product that is valid from almost every point of view, but, in some ways, incomplete. The Battle System is fun and rewarding in the long run, this is probably the videogame aspect that alone keeps the game up. But it can't be enough. The plot, another key element for an excellent role-playing game, appears structurally full of narrative holes, and while making the idea behind the story well, the protagonist's dream of flying, etc., seems to lack something, a point of solid cohesion on which to move certain events in detail and deepen them. Here, Grandia III really lacks in-depth analysis: technical (more Npc to talk to, side-quest), history, setting (small areas). For the rest, however, we are equally faced with a valid title, which while not making you cry ~masterpiece~ lets you play, and which could give you about forty hours of good fun. Pros: Fast loading. Great combat system. Well made graphics. Cons: Not long-lived. Linear plot and not very thorough in some places. Too many cut scenes. Although it has never been a production on a technical level on the same level as Final Fantasy or Suikoden, the Grandia series remains one of the most popular sagas in the Rpg sector. Its success is such that it hasled over the years to the birth of numerous fanzines exclusively dedicated to the phenomenon, record collections, and much more. Published for the first time by Game Arts under the SEGA label for the good old Saturn, the progenitor of the series was, if not the first three-dimensional RPG in history, certainly one of the most revolutionary, almost on par, with the right differentiations, of Final Fantasy VII. If this was and is the ~nonplusultra~ of the genre, with its well-finished plot and the spectacular style adopted in its general technical realization, Grandia was for the creation of a fighting system (still today one of the most appreciated) of the all immediate, but which left the right space for strategic planning and advance response to enemy attacks thanks to a well-studied turn-based structure, in semi-real time which allowed a reasoned counter-offensive and a good performability of the actions. Grandia III tries to resume that game concept, trying however to redo the look and adapt to the aesthetic and structural standard that have characterized the recent productions of other software houses. This third installment of the series proves to be a rather atypical RPG right from the start, at least in terms of how it is structured: spread over two DVDs, the game offers few characters, little interaction for the gamer in the first part, small environments and locations. The exploratory phases, at least at the beginning, are very limited, as if they had been taken verbatim from Xenosaga II: a fairly long movie, two-three minutes of action, and again cut-scenes, and so on for a long time. Luckily after a few hours things improve and you can start playing seriously, even if the game takes off, just to stay in theme with the plot, starting from the second DVD, when the dungeons get bigger, so how the overall difficulty level increases.", "date": "2006-06-05", "grade": null}
