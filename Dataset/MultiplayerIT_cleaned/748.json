{"name": "Ninja Gaiden Black", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ninja-gaiden-black.html", "text": "Mind you, the backbone of Ninja Gaiden has not changed, and a lot of praise has been spent on the most anticipated Tecmo title of the current generation, on balance completely deserved. For details in this regard especially for those who do not know him yet, we invite you to read our review and all our side articles, which you can find at this address: Ninja Gaiden card In Ninja Gaiden Black two new difficulty levels have been added, one dedicated to the super experts of the game, in order to further increase the challenge, the other, fortunately, meets the needs of the less skilled, or if we want, of those who can't spend too much time playing video games. This level of difficulty, which is not very easy compared to other games, can be activated if you are killed in the early stages of the game, especially facilitating the clashes against the Bosses at the end of the stage. One of the strongest criticisms leveled at Ninja Gaiden, in fact, was the extreme difficulty of the Tecmo title. Another welcome news for users from all over Europe comes from the elimination of the censorships introduced in the version of NG for the old continent. The title is now rated as suitable for players 18+, on a par with the American and Japanese versions, and features all the elements of the original release, including beheadings. As already written, the backbone of the game remains unchanged, albeit with some tasty additions including some new cutscenes, created directly with the game engine, new unlockable costumes, a handful of new monsters placed in strategic positions within the levels , and as many new weapons, new extras to unlock, and a better balance of the damage inflicted through certain combos. The restyling of NG could not be complete without the new camera, certainly among the most welcome additions of the first Hurricane Pack. Using the right stick of the pad it is now possible to control the position of the camera, a solution that becomes particularly effective in some situations such as in better calibrating jumps and various stunts, but always limits the action a little during the most chaotic fights. A separate mention belongs to the ~Missions~ mode or the mode dedicated to NG super experts. Already present in the Hurricane Pack 2 in Ninja Gaiden: Black, this mode has been expanded from five rooms to about fifty, progressively increasing the difficulty of the enemies to be faced. Let's talk about rooms because the concept is precisely to stage a sort of all against Ryu, who finds himself inside real arenas surrounded by an ever-increasing number of enemies who attack him more or less simultaneously. It goes without saying that the slightest mistake leads to certain death. The last detail to mention for the Mission Mode is the possibility of uploading your Karma score to Xbox Live. This value, which is obtained at the end of the levels or when you are killed, is calculated according to various factors, including not only the point at which you arrive, but also the strategies used and the type of attacks chosen. Comment In summary we are faced with a title that left its mark when it was released in 2004, and which today is rediscovered as further improved. The elapsed time has not affected the quality of the Tecmo game which, at the gates of the next gen, still manages to get noticed for the graphic details and for the goodness of the system in general, confirming itself as a must-have title for every Xbox user who adores action games. The last note regarding Ninja Gaiden belongs to the price, which is set on a par with budget titles or at  29.99. In short, if you still don't have the Tecmo title in your video game collection, this is certainly the time to start buying. The latest gift to Xbox users from Team Ninja is called Ninja Gaiden: Black, a revised and corrected edition of one of the best action games of recent years. A few months after the release of Ninja Gaiden, there was talk of ~Hurricane Packs~ or update packages, strictly free, that Tecmo has gradually released on Xbox Live. Today all these updates, and other new changes, have been bundled into a new version of the game for all those who have not had the opportunity to access Microsoft's online service.", "date": "2005-11-19", "grade": null}
