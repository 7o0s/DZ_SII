Let's find out how it went with our Stormland review. This is not just any virtual reality game: it is the first attempt by Insomniac Games to exploit this technology, by a software house which is therefore already well established and able in the last twenty years to develop a huge number of successes, from Spyro the Dragon to Ratchet & Clank, through the more recent Sunset Overdrive to the very latest Marvel's Spider-Man on PlayStation 4. As you may already know, after the huge success of this latest game, the company was bought from Sony and works exclusively today, but before this important event, Insomniac had the time to pull Stormland out of the magic cylinder, a precious new Oculus exclusive. My name is Vesper The Insomniac game puts us in the gears of an agile robot called Vesper who wakes up, half broken, in the rarefied atmosphere of Stormland; this is in fact both the name of the game and of this ethereal planet, used in the past to build a monumental techno-messianic apparatus. Who knows how many it was ago, but it could also be weeks, something irreparable happened on Stormland: earthquakes, explosions, and an army of invading robots who immediately took control of it. But Vesper and those like him are still alive, not many but enough to hope to reverse the situation. And then Vesper is us, and we are the customers who are always right, as they sing in the theme song of Daltanius: extraterrestrials away, from this land of mine, remove your paws or you will leave them. And that's how it will go, but first it will be necessary to put on our favorite Oculus and its controllers! A bit like flying After having repaired Vesper, we will begin to explore this strange world composed essentially of small islets that emerge from a thick blanket of clouds. To move from one area to another, we will be able to literally surf on this soft surface, almost as if it were sand in constant movement: it is also necessary to get into position, pushing our arms forward to gain speed. Initially the approach is clumsy, but after a while things will improve making each movement a rather fun activity, after all we are talking about an Insomniac game, and the pedigree can only emerge in the dynamism of each movement. With a full optional Vesper, in addition to gliding through the clouds, it will be possible to glide by jumping into the void, even fly, as well as climb practically on any surface. This wide range of possibilities multiplies the ways in which each zone can be ~cleared~, especially when this will involve fighting with the different enemy robots. For example, it is possible to climb on the back of a structure to glide against opponents in order to take them by surprise, sneak up on another robot to steal the medikit from his belt and immediately after hit him with a mega steel fist spending it in the unknown , zap three rather aggressive drones with two SMGs at the same time and leap into the air by jumping off a cliff. And these are just the first examples that come to mind in our short but intense game. Yes, short, you read right and it's certainly not an admission of guilt: short because Stormland doesn't last very long, indeed there are games that don't last long but that make you feel full while this one already ends by dragging it out a bit. It's bad when you've finally acclimatised, you're enjoying it great and enjoying it even more thinking about what's next, and the game is already starting to end. Stormland is essentially like a Far Cry in which the outposts are the real fulcrum of the game: of course there are other islands to explore, to visit if you aim to collect all the upgrades dedicated to Vesper's weapons and skills, but to go on you have to free specific areas: one in the first level, two in the second and three in the third. Then there is a further area called Terminus where we will be called upon to recover six keys (the first three from three different islands and the last from a fortress) to be inserted from time to time into a mechanism that will lead us to the end credits and the endgame. Two is always better As a structure it is not bad at all, a pity that it is so repetitive even in its short duration. Luckily there are two rather interesting things that make Stormland that bit more precious than it might appear: in the meantime there is the coop, and playing in VR for two is really too much fun, especially in this context, and then for those who finished the game there is theCycle. Instead of every month as in reality, the Stormland Cycle changes the mood of the game every week: with new islands emerging from the clouds, old ones slightly shifting in shape, and a new placement of upgrades and enemies. From what we have been able to see, it is a slow mutation rather than a radical change in the construction of each level, but it is undeniably a good idea that deserves to be exploited better. Technically Stormland is extremely pleasant, with some artistic intuition, such as the benches for customization and alien vegetation, really very fascinating, moreover it is equipped with several very physical interactions and capable of returning really good feedback, especially when we are going to manipulate our equipment.", "date": "2020-01-30", "grade": "7.3"}
