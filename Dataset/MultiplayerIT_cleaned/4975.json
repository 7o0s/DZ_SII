FlatOut represented an interesting homage released 9 years later which was followed by a couple of chapters with ups and downs, but the gist of the game is more or less always the same: racing on absurd tracks, with an unconventional industrial setting, excessively designed cars, imaginative mini-games, a forgiving driving model and great care in showing the damage of the cars. All obviously accompanied by a soundtrack that offers punk-rock-ska songs that are almost completely indistinguishable from each other. Will this fourth chapter have managed to do better? FlatOut 4 continues the tradition of destructive racing games but crashes before the finish line Playstation 4 trophies FlatOut 4 has some pretty simple trophies to get, just win the various tracks, complete the various championships and buy a certain number of cars. However, there are some decidedly difficult trophies linked to minigames that could seriously take your sleep away. Getting them all will be a much more difficult challenge than you might think. A few steps forward Considering that the third chapter boasts a brilliant 23 on Metacritic and an honest 4 in our review, it was easy enough to do better and this Total Insanity must be credited with having succeeded in the feat. However, there is a big difference between better and good and the knots come home to roost after the first laps. Just to be on the safe side, Kylotonn has decided not to go too far off the topic and propose a title that fits within that tradition that we described above. The game basically offers two main paths: a career in which to buy ever more powerful cars to modify to compete against increasingly fierce opponents, and then a FlatOut mode in which to look for the maximum score in a series of quite crazy challenges. If you want, you can also compete online or have a quick race. Just to see how everything worked we immediately got behind the wheel in a fairly simple race. The game offers three different classes of cars that are increasingly fast and difficult to drive, so to start calmly we have chosen a copy of the VolksWagen beetle and the first track set in a forest and a sawmill. After a few laps it is evident that the driving model has some problems. Cars obviously have to be light in order to be able to perform absurd stunts, the problem is that this sometimes causes sudden spins, capsizes or changes of direction because we have had contact with a tiny piece of debris. We've had the experience of taking off simply by passing over a railroad track. Sometimes, however, the car simply decides to swerve sharply to the right or left due to an irregularity in the terrain. Add all this to the counters and, in some cases, Mario Kart-style bombs and you will understand how getting out of a race alive is often a matter of pure luck. There are times when you can't help but see your car bouncing in the air because you are constantly being bombarded by enemies. As far as artificial intelligence is concerned, in fact, we have ups and downs. Sometimes it's nasty, relentless and unattainable, other times we finished the race bored on the last lap because we had no one behind us anymore. We also happened to play a game of Capture the Flag and find that once we placed our car in a very high position in the game arena, no one was able to reach us anymore. Expendable pilots In the FlatOut mode, things get even more absurd, and we'll be able to compete in the online ranking or against a friend in races that in most cases will require us to shoot our driver at a certain angle to get a certain result. In fact, we will be able to use it to play golf, billiards or bowling, we will be able to use it as a flat stone to bounce on the water or as a curling stone, see how high we can get it or use it to destroy buildings. The ragdoll effect is very 2003, but in general they are quite fun mini-games and also quite difficult in which it will be very difficult to get good results right away. Of course, there is also the classic free-for-all destruction derby in an arena that still represents one of the funniest moments of this genre given the high rate of unpredictability, added to the exaltation of hitting an opponent in the side who has just overturned and see him explode into a ball of fire. To be able to gradually unlock allin the events of the FlatOut mode you will have to accumulate a certain score in the various tests and you will soon discover that it is absolutely not easy: the problem is that the frustration comes before the desire to continue, also because the minigames can also be tried in the free mode, if you just have the curiosity. Twisted sheet metal Graphically speaking FlatOut 4 does not offer particular peaks, the light effects and sparks are not bad but the cars, even if they are devastated, do not offer moments in which the twisted metal sheets are scattered everywhere and the design of the tracks lacks a real inspiration that makes them really fun to drive. Just do a few solo rides to realize it. In general, the game doesn't seem particularly good at enticing us to continue, and this is also due to the fact that the criteria for unlocking cars and routes are mysteriously hidden. We know that there is content that we could obtain with certain characteristics... but we don't know what they are! Also, the Career mode which is supposed to be the real engine of the game quickly tends to get boring and repetitive. First of all, the prizes for victories are so low that it is much better to try to upgrade your car than to build a team, but when you finally accumulate enough money to move up a category, you are faced with the same paths, perhaps in reverse, only with cars slightly better. Difficult to find the will to continue in these conditions, there is a lack of a real sense of challenge, of progression, also because the ranking of the drivers almost always sees the same people at the top, a sign that artificial intelligence is not particularly developed but limits itself to making ordered little trains that only you or chance can make more interesting.", "date": "2017-03-27", "grade": "6.5"}
