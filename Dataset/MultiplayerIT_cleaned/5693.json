That is, let's hope that at the home of the nice Colossal Order, the development team of the PC hit Cities: Skylines, it's cold, because here February was a really warm month. Fortunately, by installing Snowfall things will change and your home will plunge into absolute frost, as if Hyoga, aka Crystal the Swan, had launched an Aurora Execution in your living room. Maybe if you turned on the radiators things would improve, but they are details. What is Snowfall? But the second major expansion of Cities: Skylines (didn't you understand what we were talking about?), which allowed us to return to our favorite city builder for some years now with insane curiosity and passion. Deep down we are romantics and the idea of building organic and well-functioning urban agglomerations fascinates us enormously; Therefore, variations that allow us to explore new aspects of the mayor's work are welcome. Before talking about the contents of Snowfall, it is right to mention those of patch 1.3.0-f4. As already happened for the launch of After Dark, Colossal Order has released a big update valid for all owners of the game. This is free material that does not require the purchase of the DLC. Among the innovations, the new theme editor certainly stands out, which will delight those who love changes, and the new interface for public transport, much clearer and more functional than the previous one. On an aesthetic level, various atmospheric agents have been added which give an extra touch to the old maps. We are talking about fog and rain. These are obviously purely cosmetic features, but they are very well made and, above all, they are free. So there is little to complain about. Obviously, since this is a patch, there are various bug and glitch fixes, as well as tweaks to other secondary graphic elements. In short, even without Snowfall it is worth reinstalling Cities: Skylines even just for the 1.3.0-f4 patch. Despite the frost, we reviewed Snowfall, the second DLC of Cities: Skylines Winter is coming full of our discontent What does the cold mean to city life? If we really think about it a lot. Those who live in particularly harsh places will know this well, as they find themselves having to face long months of frost every year, battling against snow and bad weather. In fact, until today, the cities of Cities: Skylines were too sunny, to the point that citizens were able to walk around in a tank top and flip flops in every season. All right, let's not exaggerate... also because there were no seasons! After Dark introduced the day/night cycle, but the weather has always remained clear. Snowfall remedies this shortcoming by proposing three maps of very cold places, where it snows more than at the Barrier. Snow, unlike rain and fog, has more than just aesthetic implications. Sure, it's nice to see it fall, perhaps at night when the streets are less busy and the flakes stand out chaotic in the light of the street lamps; but as happens in reality, a snowfall is not only beautiful, but also problematic, especially for the road network. Thus, in the event of a heavy snowfall, it is necessary to have snowplows to clear the streets and allow traffic to flow smoothly (with snow on the roads, vehicles are slowed down). But when does it snow? When it's cold. Not a very scientific statement and certainly to be explored, but what interests us in this context is the cold; because if the snow is the most visible novelty, the temperature is the most substantial. Fighting the cold in the city requires preparing a whole series of interventions made possible by some new infrastructures, such as the boiler, the geothermal station and the special pipes for heating. If an adequate heating network is not set up, citizens will consume electricity to have the coveted warmth, enormously increasing the city's needs, with a consequent increase in revenue. Especially industrial areas will become expensive without heat pipes. So, although they cost a lot, it is still worthwhile to build them, if only to increase the happiness of the population. Stick to the tram Other important content included in Snowfall is the tramway, which will delight public transport enthusiasts and fills a lack of the original title. Trams travel on special roads equipped with tracks and are much less affected by traffic than buses. They also have their own depot. Otherwise, unfortunately, Snowfall is little else. Sure, there are the new themes, some extra decorationa, a theme park and four special buildings, but in terms of actual gameplay there is nothing. At this point we don't want to be misunderstood: we consider the lack of content a problem only for those who have abandoned the game for some time or have not considered it at all. Part of the community seems to accept the formula chosen by Colossal Order for the publication of its DLCs, because although they are not very full-bodied by themselves, they are still a way to reward the constant support provided by the developers to the community, which has always translated into a great deal of content free for all. In fact we should wonder if such a dedication would have been possible without the prospect of selling some extra content from time to time. In short, you will surely have already understood it, but it is better to make it explicit: Snowfall is an essential purchase for those who have not yet tired of Cities: Skylines, despite the year on the back, and play it with a certain regularity. The others don't take it badly, but this isn't the expansion designed to make him change his mind.", "date": "2016-02-20", "grade": null}
