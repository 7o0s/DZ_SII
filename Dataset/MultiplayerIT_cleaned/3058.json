{"name": "Monster Train", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/monster-train-recensione.html", "text": "The Monster Train review tells of a game that screams Slay the Spire from every pore, but still manages to define its identity thanks to some interesting design choices. It is a deck builder with roguelike elements mixed with tower defense. What seems like a pastrocchio in the definition is actually a successful and very balanced mix of genres, in which the player has to lead a train to the heart of hell to be able to thaw it with the last incandescent pyre left alive, facing the forces of heaven who want to stop him. Basic mechanics Beyond the thin plot, which only serves as a canvas to justify the action, the player is called to build his deck of cards, different in each game, with which to erect the defenses of the three floors of the train, in order to don't let enemies get to the pyre (which has its own defenses, but very limited, especially against the final bosses). The cards are of various types: there are the artifacts, which give automatic effects that last throughout the game, adding up to each other; then there are the creatures, i.e. cards that summon defenders on the selected plane who fight directly against the celestials; then there are spells, attack, defensive or support, which produce different effects, not only according to their value, but also according to the circumstances. For example, the attack spells that cause more damage the higher the overall value of the armor of the creatures summoned on the selected plane, or the spells that multiply the values of the creatures and so on. Each turn, five cards or more are drawn from the player's deck with which to deal with enemy units that penetrate the train, always starting from the floor below. Each card has a cost which is deducted from the available turn reserves. In this way it is not possible to play all the cards, but you have to weigh your actions by evaluating the situation from time to time, choosing where to act. All cards can be upgraded in the shops located along the railway, by spending the money accumulated by playing. Each card has two basic slots in which improvements can be inserted which give, for example, more life points to creatures, or which intensify the effects of spells. The clans An important point that we haven't addressed yet is that of the clans: there are five of them, each with its own specific cards that greatly modify the gameplay. Clan selection is made at the start of each game and is essential in determining the style of play and the cards you will have available. Consider that two clans must be selected per game with the first, dominant, which determines the hero of the train (a special creature card at no cost and which can be upgraded three times during the adventure) and the second as support. As if all this were not already enough to have an immense variety, the Monster Train clans can also level up, unlocking new cards and new powers. We thus have twenty possible combinations of clans, for more than 220 upgradeable cards and 88 artifacts. If desired, we can also add the twenty-five difficulty levels and the contents that are unlocked after winning, such as new bosses, and you will understand why we are talking about hundreds of hours of play (consider that each game, getting to the end, lasts about an hour ). Game structure The good thing is that everything works great. Monster Train is one of those titles that you find yourself playing for hours without almost noticing the time passing, arguing about the cards to play, which ones to take and which ones to boost. There are so many factors to consider and the unique variables of each match so imponderable, that it's really hard to get tired. We also imagine that, given the success it is having on Steam, we will soon also see some expansions that will extend the longevity of the game even further. The only defect we found is the excessive rigidity of the game structure, which does not offer big surprises: after defeating the bosses, particularly powerful creatures who arrive at the end of each fight and who often rage even during the assaults of their minions, you must choose one of the two branches of the railway available, then take all the bonuses on the selected path and finally click on the icon of the next encounter. Repeat the formula eight times, which is the total number of bosses to beat to win, and you will have the overall view of a game of Monster Train. This is not a very serious defect, since in any case there are all the other elements to make the gameplay varied, but after a few hours you end up wanting something less predetermined (perhaps more branchingni or a few more events). In any case, if everything we have described were not enough for you, it is right to report the presence of some multiplayer modes, well done but in our opinion not essential: Hell Rush, in which eight players compete against each other in real time using the limited resources available, the same for everyone: Daily Challenge, which as the name implies is a daily challenge in which you compete to enter the world rankings; Custom Challenge, where you can customize a game and invite friends. A final note also deserves the technical side, which does not upset but is generally well done, with very well designed cards and creatures, lots of animations and with the clashes made spectacular by well-made special effects.", "date": "2020-06-04", "grade": "9.0"}
