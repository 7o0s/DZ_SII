Inaugurated slightly early last June 17 with the announcement of the partnership with Porsche, summer 2016 in the offices of the Vallelunga racetrack must be really on fire; not only are we one step away from the highly anticipated publication of Assetto Corsa on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, scheduled for August 26th, but the Roman software house has just released the RED PACK for PC, a new thematic DLC that is having a great success amazing on Steam, where since its debut it has been navigating between the first and second position of the best-selling products. The reception from enthusiasts was even warmer than that reserved for the excellent Dream Pack and Japanese Car Pack, and the reason is all linked to the ~name~ of the package; in fact, red is the color historically associated by the FIA with Italian racing cars, and in the RED PACK there is a selection of seven beautiful cars from the Bel Paese, translated by prestigious brands such as Ferrari, Lamborghini and Maserati. Red is also included in the name of the new Laserscan track, i.e. the fascinating and extremely fast Red Bull Ring in Spielberg (Austria), which rounds out the list of official tracks available in the Italian simulator. Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati and Spielberg's Red Bull Ring in the Assetto Corsa RED PACK Evolution continues Before diving into the analysis of the new racing cars, it is necessary to say a few words on the 1.7 update of Assetto Corsa, which introduces some very interesting innovations both in terms of features and pure simulation, without forgetting the free Maserati Levante S for everyone, a powerful crossover SUV pioneered in the title garage. The first detail that catches the eye of the virtual drivers is the new pre-race view, which instead of framing the track focuses on the silhouette of the chosen car, strictly from the side and with the door open to show its well-kept interior. Having taken the wheel, we must finally pay attention to the false start, which penalizes the players on the basis of three distinct types of sanctions. However, it is once on the track that the most important interventions are noticed; in addition to a more refined artificial intelligence, with more unpredictable driver behavior and intimately linked to the specific characteristics of the controlled car, especially when overtaking and cornering, there is a further step forward in the performance of the tyres, the flagship of the work Kunos Simulazioni. The new Tire Model (V10) is available on almost all the cars in the RED PACK and in the future it will be exported to the rest of the garage, as will brake temperature management, which in future updates will be accompanied by other algorithms to even simulate pads and air streams. The most demanding gamers can finally set the settings of turbo, ABS, Traction Control (TC) and more directly on the wheel, a ~taste~ of the plethora of rumors related to the Ferrari SF15-T, which we will discuss shortly. Added to all this are improvements to the 3D models and the sound of some cars, new parameters for the Apps, more realistic weather effects and a whole series of fixes that improve the racing experience, from the penalty attributed to those who go to the pits via the ESC command up to a new multiplayer code to improve the connection. In short, Assetto Corsa continues in the constant process of evolution and maturation promised by Kunos Simulazioni. Bull and Trident We begin our analysis with two old glories of Formula 1, a category well represented on Assetto Corsa. The Maserati 250F 6C made its debut in the 1954 Argentine Grand Prix driven by Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss, a true icon that conquered the world championship in the very year of its debut and in 1957. Characterized by four gears, weighing Weighing 670 kilograms and 270 horsepower, the car takes a great deal of practice (and patience) to push to the limit, due to the skimpy tyres, poor brakes and constant tendency to oversteer. The spin is in fact always around the corner and it is necessary to caress the gas pedal to avoid unpleasant inconveniences. The polygonal model is excellent both indoors and outdoors, as is the sound of the engine. With the 250F T2 12C, the heir with twelve cylinders and 310 horsepower, the situation is not very dissimilar, although it oversteers with less unpredictability. The model differs from the 6C in the five gears, a couple of obvious humps on the bonnet, the more aggressive roar and a different arrangement of the indicators on the dashboard. For theselegends of F1, some dedicated special events are available, such as Source of pleasure in Magione, Up and Down in Zandvoort and Almost at home in Imola. Staying in the house of the trident let's move on to the fascinating GranTurismo MC GT4, a racing car which, after six years of success, replaced the Trofeo in the World Series. The new Maserati has about 50 horsepower less than the previous model (from 488 to 430) to enter the category, numbers obtained thanks to an intake flange, a new rear wing and a different diffuser. The engine, on the other hand, remains the classic 4.7-litre V8 with a maximum torque of 535 Nm. On Assetto Corsa the car is precise, fast and easy to handle and can be ~easily~ pushed to the limit if you are familiar with other GTs: the Factory setting however, it does not include ABS and TC, so it should always be treated with respect. The sound of the engine is amazing, both at low and high revs, and it's also one of the loudest even when stopped in the pits. The polygonal model is splendid, which suffers only a pinch of aliasing on the wheel arches, while in the purely racing interior the carbon anthology, the Sparco steering wheel and the digital display with a curious salmon-colored background stand out. The free Levante S of the 1.7 build is added to the three Maseratis in the RED PACK, a powerful crossover SUV weighing 2,018 kilograms, 424 horsepower and accelerating from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in just five seconds. We close the paragraph with the Lamborghini Aventador SV (acronym for SuperVeloce), a family of cars that is even more exclusive and extreme than the custom-built cars from which they are translated. 50 kg lighter than the base Aventador LP750-4, thanks to the work carried out on materials and aerodynamics, this jewel does 0-100 km/h in just 2.8 seconds and reaches 300 km/h in 24 seconds; thanks to the powerful naturally aspirated 750 horsepower 6.5-litre V12 that pushes the car to a top speed of 350 km/h. From a stylistic point of view, the Aventador is almost a spaceship, not only for its aggressive, taut aesthetics full of aerodynamic appendages, but also for its aeronautical-inspired interiors. What is striking, in addition to the fine fabrics with red stitching and the profusion of carbon, is the peculiar digital display with a yellow background that enhances the progression of the engine. On Assetto Corsa the polygonal model is perfect as is the sense of power due to the spectacular rendering of the rumble, although the understeer behavior makes this car rather difficult to master to the limits. However, it remains one of the most fascinating and fun racing cars to launch while drifting and on long straights. The redheads If you were to ask an Assetto Corsa enthusiast to indicate their favorite car, most likely the choice would fall on the Ferrari 458 Italia GT2, thanks to an exhilarating engine sound and an engaging driving pleasure to say the least. The Ferrari 488 GT3 featured in the RED PACK is the racing version of the new 488 GTB, and as expected it is another of Kunos Simulazioni's masterpieces. Equipped with a 3.9-litre twin-turbo V8 delivering 500 horsepower and 640 Nm of maximum torque, the car is more manageable and precise than the 458 Italia GT2, especially out of corners, and it also amazes with the refinement of the engine roar, in this case embellished by the classic 'puff' of the pop-off valve that we are used to hearing on rally cars. The polygonal model is splendid and the interiors are very well-kept: just look at the materials of the containment net around the pilot, which seem practically real and tangible. The other two reds present in the RED PACK are probably the ones that prompted many to invest the ten Euros to buy it; we are in fact talking about the F138, the Formula 1 car driven by Alonso and Massa in 2013, and the FST15 of the 2015 season. The first of the two represented the ~swan song~ of naturally aspirated endothermic engines in the premier class, given that since 2014 hybrid engines have entered the scene with the related aftermath of controversy. The F138 on Assetto Corsa is splendid to drive and to listen to, thanks to a truly amazing reproduction of the 763 horsepower 2.4-litre V8 that is exalted above all during replays. The simulation also involves the Kers and the DRS, and since there are no ABS and traction control, if you overdo the gas or touch a curb at the wrong angle, you immediately end up spinning; however, the behavior of the F138 remains balanced and offers simply crazy reactivity, speed and precision. The SF15-T is undoubtedly the most complex car ever introduced in a driving simulator, and only to manage the electrical part of the engine, between MGU-K, ERS, ICU, braking distribution and other acronyms that mean little to the laymanor nothing, there's really going crazy (with joy) on the controls on the steering wheel, which must necessarily have a sufficient number of buttons, unless you want to bang your head on the keyboard. Adapting the single-seater to the characteristics of each circuit is a meticulous job and to take full advantage of it it is necessary to study its specificities in depth; it is no coincidence that Aristotelis Vasilakos, the developer who takes care of the excellent physics engine together with Stefano Casillo, has released an in-depth guide to understand the secrets of this virtual jewel. Due to the greater power of the engine, the SF15-T is even more nervous than the F138, but is ready to give immense satisfaction to anyone who manages to tame its exuberance and above all its technology. The polygonal model and the sound of the thruster are rendered perfectly.", "date": "2016-07-22", "grade": null}
