But then something broke. Perhaps the excessive attachment to a specific formula has prevented the software house from growing sufficiently in certain aspects, or simply we have begun to notice how their products give excessive importance to form over substance, because, although splendid from the point of graphically, they were never as pad in hand ... Whatever the truth, to date the name CyberConnect2 is no longer able to turn heads as in the past and the production chain of the house seems to have settled on quality productions decent with an unmistakable style, but always markedly far from what today can be defined as a ~masterpiece~. Yet, in the history of this eclectic group of developers, there have been some attempts to make a serious leap in quality and one of the most evident also had one of the most popular intellectual properties in the world behind it. Let's talk about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R, a fighting game markedly closer to the ~classic~ formula than Naruto Ultimate Storm, which already at launch managed to stand out due to its look and more successful gameplay than expected . At the time, however, the ~weak points~ of the CyberConnect2s had partially cut the legs off the work, primarily due to serious technical limitations - the game ran at 30 fps, already abnormal for a fighting game and not even stable - and a netcode that made it a real challenge to play decently on the net. Today Bandai Namco, also driven by the recent popularity of the anime linked to the legendary Araki saga, has decided to re-propose everything in a revised and corrected version, finally at 60 fps and complete with an expanded roster and new contents. Find out if the plastic poses of CyberConnect2's ~new~ work are able to compete with the most modern fighting games on the market, in our review of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R. Contents and Changes: NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R: yare yare daze Considering the R at the end of the title, one could think of a simple remaster operation, but, as mentioned above, the new JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R has received improvements that in our opinion cannot be reduced to this. Let me be clear, the graphics sector has not been particularly retouched, apart from a higher resolution and superficial improvements, yet it is difficult to complain about this aspect: the base game was aesthetically very similar to Araki's work and had even managed to replicate the most picturesque techniques of the various characters (and we're talking about JoJo, so it's a picturesque with a capital P) and minimal tweaks were enough to still be fantastic in motion. However, the transition from thirty to sixty fps cannot be ignored, because it enormously changes the response of the commands, the general speed (which originally appeared practically slowed down compared to the competitors due to this aspect) and the stability of the experience. So goodbye optimization problems (think, in the past in tournaments there was a tendency to select specific arenas to avoid drops) and clear delay of the moves after pressing the keys: the CyberConnect2 fighting game finally plays it on the same level as the other representatives of the genre. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R: anyone using a stand usually has more complex than average cancels, more diversified specials, and shots with a wider range available. Be careful The other significant improvement? The contents, with a particular focus on the roster of characters. In fact, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R has about fifty fighters, with many new features in addition to the additions deriving from the old DLCs (such as Baoh, the protagonist of another Araki manga). Anyone expecting superficial and botched additions will immediately have to change his mind after a few minutes of testing ~in the laboratory~, because practically all the newcomers boast the same attention to detail as the original choices. Indeed, some new warriors are even more interesting than the average, which is far from obvious in a fighting game like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-StarBattle R. If the work of CyberConnect2 has, in fact, a primary distinctive feature compared to the competition, this lies precisely in the diversification of the roster. For heaven's sake, the combat system does not favor particular virtuosity nor enhances the inspiration of the most skilled players to extraordinary levels - but we will talk about it in more detail shortly - yet it is practically impossible not to find someone suitable for your style in this game. The main reason why there is so much variety is to be found in the subsets into which the fighters are divided: the primary ones are three and correspond to the masters of the concentric wave (or Hamon, if you prefer), to those who used the stone mask and to those who are able to use the iconic stands born from the mad mind of master Araki. Already these distinctions would be enough to offer multiple options - especially if we consider that each of them has its own mechanics - yet to this we also add fighters who do not fall into any category, mix of types, or stand users with absolutely atypical mechanics (especially in uncataloguable warriors abound in this group). JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R: There are fighters on horseback. And this should be enough to show how crazy this work is The rest of the content has also been reworked. The arenas, for example, have increased (some seem to have been recycled from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven, but their look does not clash at all) and even the original story mode has been eliminated to make way for a new campaign, in all better sincerity. True, the story mode of the game boasted various texts that summarized many of the events of the manga, but the narration was obviously incomplete and overall it was not about who knows what content. The new mode, predictably called All-Star Battle, instead offers a series of challenges of variable difficulty, all made more tantalizing by various modifiers and to be completed to unlock more challenging boss battles than we thought. It's a nice transformation, which overall improves the single player experience, albeit without real peaks. On the other hand, the management of tutorials and online modes (to which we will inevitably have to return later): little or nothing has been inserted to decently introduce the various systems to players outside of a series of texts that illustrate them broadly, the training mode is still among the sparsest around (with very few options to properly experiment with the most advanced maneuvers) and the online filters are really limited . Here, undoubtedly, work could have been done better. Gameplay: MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R: fight between father and daughter In any case, we are talking about a fighting game and the core of the experience remains the gameplay. Above we mentioned how JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R does not boast who knows what subtleties and technicalities in its system and, in fact, we are dealing with a product rather suitable for newbies of the genre (yes, despite the skimpy tutorial), due to of combinations that can be performed without too much difficulty and maneuvers that are generally easy to master at decent levels. However, these simplifications do not necessarily imply that the title does not have complex elements worthy of further study, or mechanics of a certain level capable of reinvigorating or overturning the clashes. On balance, the game still presents the vast majority of the advanced mechanics seen in the competition, with one simple, but significant difference: they are spread across character types. Therefore, if on the one hand everyone can perform simplified cancels during normal attacks (at the cost of part of the HH bar for the execution of the super) to lengthen the series of blows, on the other hand mechanics such as EX moves, the super jump or the passive charge of energy are used only by the masters of the concentric wave, where those who use the stands have other specific cancels and multiple styles available with changes of special moves, and again the additional variations have completely different peculiarities (the characters of Steel Ball Runs can perform combos on horseback, so to speak...). The base system, End Time, offers various options to increase the damage dealt and the complexity of the combos, limited three-dimensional movement - complete with perfect dodges - to avoid enemy attacks from range and counterattack at the last moment, and the need to manage one's resources carefully to obtain advantages in battle... factors that are not easy to manage, which however, due to this ~fragmenting~ of the mechanics between the fighters, never really manage to overwhelm as happens in games like a Blazblue, a high level Tekken, or a King of Fighters. It was a very clever formula in the days of the original and it remains so today. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R: New entries are great, but we expected more characters from Jojolion. Instead once again there is only Josuke There are also classic Japanese fighting game simplifications, such as Easy Beat, which guarantees basic combos by repeatedly pressing a single key, but we believe that here they are even more useless than they already are in other exponents of the genre, since it takes very little dexterity to perform medium-level combinations. Overall, however, Cyberconnect's work, now that it has reached the fateful 60 fps, is solid and exciting and its stratospheric roster even manages to ignore some of the cruder elements, such as certain hitboxes of shots that are anything but well calculated (so as to make the game in neutral a bit awkward at times), the rather limited management of movement during the offensive, and the presence of strong imbalances between the warriors. In short, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R absolutely does not touch the peaks of other fighting games, yet it is a lot of fun and the typical spectacularity of CyberConnect2 productions only amplifies it for anyone who is a fan of Araki's works. The netcode problem: WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R: Johnatan is a Joestar with few tricks, but you don't want to get hit by a player who knows him well. You will see your life points disappear in an instant However, where certain structural stumbling blocks are largely negligible, it is really impossible for us to ignore a defect that sadly negatively affects the quality of the entire production: the netcode. In fact, if this re-release generally represents a step forward in almost every aspect of the original game, the same cannot be said for the stability of the multiplayer experience, given that the developers have once again actively chosen to rely on a ~delay based~ system. ~ instead of the much more advanced rollback technology. Let's face it, to date, ignoring the netcode rollback in fighting games is, bluntly, suicide: extremely deserving titles supported by respectable intellectual property have seen their online communities disappear within a few months due to the inexplicable will of the developers to use an obsolete netcode. Rollback has amply proven to always be the best option, even when player connections are exceptional on both sides - especially considering the importance of online for the continued survival of a title of this type - so imagine our surprise when once again we found ourselves facing matches devastated by network latency during our test. For the record, even this flaw could be somewhat mitigated if JoJo's All-Star Battle R online experience turned out to exceed expectations , but what we tested didn't seem much superior to the netcode of the original work, which at the time was really bordering on unplayable. Maybe we were unlucky, however less than half of the matches found were fluid and without problems, and it is even impossible to force the game to a limited search for those with a respectable line, due to the already underlined lack of filters for matchmaking. We cannot explain how CyberConnect2 has painstakingly taken care of almost every aspect of its game, only to then fall with a dry thud on an element that influences the survival of such a game. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R: if you see Requiem, the game is most likely over for you If nothing else, it's a testament to their talent that today JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R can easily compete with many modern titles of the same genre, thanks to the exceptional animations of the supers, the successful cel shading and the respect for the original material. The fanservice in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R is a lot and everything of high quality, which only amplifies our irritation related to the poor quality of the online experience. JoJo fans deserved a reissue with attention to every aspect and with a netcode with the stability necessary to support the community for a long time. As it stands, unfortunately, this fighting game is just a fantastic exercise in style, enjoyable offline, but which doesn't have the legs to survive on the market.", "date": "2022-09-04", "grade": "7.5"}
