{"name": "NBA Elite 11", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82838-nba-elite-11-lesclusiva-che-non-ti-aspetti.html", "text": "NBA basketball always exerts a certain fascination even in our parts, because it expresses the concept of entertainment in its purest and most entertaining way, by far in contrast to the excellent and tactical European basketball, which however is much less ~televised~ than the American one. And so, even in Italy, the video games dedicated to this championship have a moderate following, also because their realism is often superior to most of the simulations dedicated to other sports. The NBA Elite case caused quite a stir, as after seeing the name change from the famous NBA Live it suffered a sudden cancellation in its latest incarnation due to obvious technical and gameplay problems, which decreed its postponement to next year and moreover in the hands of a new developer. However, all these vicissitudes did not affect the iPhone version, which promptly appears in the App Store and easily wins the prize for the best basketball simulation on the device created by Apple. The testimonial of this new edition is Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma Thunder and the game obviously comes with the full license of the National Basket Association complete with logos, fields and players; the options, on the other hand, provide everything one would expect, with the view and the rules of the game, the possibility of setting the duration of each quarter and the various penalties associated with a real basketball game such as 24 seconds, basket, shooting fouls and so on, in such a way as to choose the desired degree of simplicity and realism. Slam dunk In short, the necessary bases for a simulation worthy of the name are all there on the iPhone as well, and the options related to the game start from the classic exhibition with all the NBA franchises plus the two representative All Stars to get to the complete season, directly to the play phase off and finally to the three-point contest. In the latter case we are dealing with the same event that always takes place during the weekend dedicated to the All Stars Game between the two NBA East and West teams; each player has 60 seconds and 5 balls (worth 1 point except the last one which is worth 2) from each of the six different positions designated for shooting from the outside line, obviously whoever scores the most points wins . Once on the field, EA Sports chose a not too complicated approach to managing the gameplay, also because the touchscreen control system is completely different from that of the pad. On the left of the screen there is the classic virtual analog stick necessary to move the players, on the right instead two buttons, which change function contextually to the fact of being in possession of the ball or not. In the first case the upper one allows the shot, in fact it is enough to leave it pressed to see an icon appear on the head of the player broken in two, which according to his skills must be ~framed~ when the two parts match. In addition there is also a color that indicates the difficulty or not of the shot in relation to the more or less free shooting view. As far as dunks are concerned, it is enough to have a sufficiently good shooting line and use the relative icon in conjunction with the analog stick to successfully conclude the action thanks to a multitude of variations. The passages enjoy the same treatment thanks to the appropriate icon in conjunction with the direction, leaving pressed instead all one's companions are highlighted with a different color depending on the difficulty of the passage itself, at this point just literally click on the chosen one to let them arrive the ball. In defense the shooting and passing icons become respectively used for blocking/interference attempts and stealing the ball/changing players to complete the defensive phase. The system created by EA Sports works quite well therefore in relation to the type of device, obviously the gameplay cannot be as deep as the counterparts from home but manages to be fun just enough to guarantee a good feeling and the desire to continue playing. Too bad that the title does not enjoy any multiplayer mode both online and offline, as well as a progression system linked to Game Center, Open Feint and company, factors that would have simultaneously increased longevity. Last but not least, the technical sector does an excellent job, the animations are quite good in general and a little less in the transition phase between one play and another, for example after a penetration followed by a dunk. For the rest, however, the impact remains rather pleasant while commentary (in English) and accompanying music make theirduty without special honorable mentions.
