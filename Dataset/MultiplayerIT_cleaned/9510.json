Therefore, considering the ample room for maneuver left by this first experience, Miniclip decided to seize the opportunity by creating this Gravity Guy, characterized by a concept practically identical to the previous one but also by an exponentially greater care for all the surrounding elements . Let's see what came of it. On the run forever The user takes on the role of that Gravity Guy who gives the title to the game, a sort of superhero locked up in a cell by an evil organization of robots: having escaped from prison, he will have to escape his pursuers and this is where it comes to life of the action. The product is structured like a simple two-dimensional platform, with the difference that you don't have direct control over the protagonist: he runs automatically towards the right side of the screen, and the only thing the player has to do is tap on the touchscreen to reverse the influence of gravity. A simple touch and our hero will find himself running on the ceiling, to glide back to the ground at the next solicitation. The entire playful sector of the product is based on this feature, benefiting from a more than honest level design, which often shows peaks of pleasant inventiveness already after the very first settling bars: in fact, if initially the obstacles are single and easily overcome, it takes very little for the matter to become complicated with a rapid succession of barriers that must be circumvented using cunning and quick reflexes in equal measure. It must be said, however, that often these two virtues are not enough, given that Gravity Guy relies heavily on the beloved/hated trial and error mechanic, the one that sees the player forced to die a couple of times before understanding what to do, simply because the action is too fast to react adequately on the first blow. Fortunately, the main adventure is divided by many frequent checkpoints, so the bogeyman of frustration is exorcised as long as you dedicate averagely short game sessions to the title. Also because completing the Story Mode doesn't take much time, leaving room for a frankly forgettable practical mode and a local multiplayer section that instead works unexpectedly well: up to a maximum of four users can share the same iPhone, by touching the dial assigned to them to manage the progress of gravity and try to reach the finish line before the others. A perhaps slightly confusing but certainly welcome addition, especially for an application sold at such a modest price. The technical sector itself is not typical of a budget production, denoting convincing stylistic choices and simple but at the same time clean and pleasant graphics, while the soundtrack performs its duty without infamy and without praise.
