Vijay Singh", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-golf-2007-feat-vijay-singh.html", "text": "The first striking element of the Gameloft product is the considerable quantity and variety of events and modes available: quick and single game, tutorial and career stand out on the main menu, with the latter made up of eighteen events and shops where you can buy new items and ability. In short, for all sports enthusiasts, Pro Golf 2007 is a decidedly rich dish, which fortunately also offers full-bodied substance beyond its good looks. The gameplay follows in the best way in the footsteps traced by the milestones of the sector, with the typical mechanics known to anyone: a direction indicator to define the trajectory of the shot and an icon that moves on a bar, to be stopped at the right point to establish power and accuracy. If it is true that from this point of view all golf games are similar, the qualities of the individual products must be sought elsewhere, for example in the creation of the various courses, in the level of challenge and in the degree of realism. All elements in which Pro Golf 2007 proves to be decidedly valid and cared for: the holes are sufficiently diversified and pleasant, the difficulty is rightly progressive and the simulation is rigorous enough without however leading to frustrating or sectorial. Both the expert and the novice will therefore be able to enjoy Gameloft's work in equal measure, a symptom of a perfect balance. But obviously the eye also wants its part, and Pro Golf 2007 does its best to satisfy this. The game offers two different views, one behind the golfer at the moment of the shot and one from a bird's eye view used to manage the direction and to observe the trajectory of the ball after the shot: both denote extremely accurate graphics, with bright colors and a fair level of realism, although the animations appear a little too smooth. PRO Good graphics Lots of irons in the fire AGAINST Boring for those who don't like sports Slow animations", "date": "2007-04-02", "grade": "S.V."}
