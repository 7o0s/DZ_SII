{"name": "FIFA 09 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-09-recensione_c.html", "text": "The duel between the two football series par excellence, FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer, has never been more uncertain than this year. On the part of Electronic Arts there has been an enormous work, above all from a technical point of view, with extraordinary graphics and the possibility of challenging each other online even in ten against ten; on the part of Konami, however, there have been much fewer innovations and an online still poor, with the game that can always count on the feeling that has always distinguished it. For some time now, the challenge has crossed the borders of home consoles to arrive on the screen of portable ones, therefore also on Nintendo DS. Last year we witnessed the clear victory of FIFA 08, which turned out to be somewhat superior to Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 in all respects, even if it didn't shine at all: the EA Sports title was perhaps too devoted to an arcade approach, with players always aiming for goal, lacking a fatigue gauge and occasionally plagued by dubious control response. Has any progress been made for this 2009 edition? Now scoring goals gives much more satisfaction, precisely because you have to look for it insistently. Something old, something new... The game offers a large number of modes, combining the classic and inevitable ones with some interesting novelties. On the one hand we have the quick match (~kick-off~) and the tournament, with the latter allowing us to replicate any national or international cup; therefore we will have to choose our team among the many available and then face a series of opponents in sequence. On the other hand, we have the ~coach~ and ~professional~ modes: the first sees us taking on the role of coach and taking care of a team that will have more or less high objectives depending on the blazon, complete with a budget available for acquisitions. We will have the task of following our players, signing new ones and possibly selling someone, deciding on the formation and form as well as the strategy. After that we will have to show the goodness of our work in the field, bringing home useful results. As for the ~professional~ mode, it is basically about choosing a single player and controlling him during the matches of an entire championship, being able to decide when and how the ball will be passed to us but without directly controlling the other elements of the team. The game will provide us with visual indications to make us understand what we should do (advance, retreat, etc.) as well as to warn us of the possibility of a clean pass. A really interesting and fascinating modality, which however in practice is often chaotic and possibly boring. The multiplayer options complete the picture: the local one and the one via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, which as usual works just fine and offers us the opportunity to challenge players from all over the world in single matches. The harsh law of goal As mentioned at the beginning, the 2008 edition of FIFA for Nintendo DS had a too ~arcade~ approach, with players who never got tired and always managed to frame the opponent's goal. Unfortunately, this year the fatigue factor has remained unchanged, but there have been clear changes of course as regards the infallibility of the attackers, who from very skilled snipers of the corner have suddenly become normal people: more than once it will happen that you make a mistake goal practically done, shooting high when all you should do is push the ball into the net. Perhaps the developers have even exaggerated in this sense, but the fact remains that scoring goals now gives much more satisfaction, precisely because you have to look for it insistently. The passes appear slightly more precise, but the problems in this sense remain: often you end up giving the ball to the farthest partner instead of the closest one, and the through balls would still need a tweak to be effective. Not to mention the crosses, which more than any other shot must be ~dosed~ by keeping the button pressed, with the risk of nullifying a splendid sortie in the opposing area. The ability of the goalkeepers varies greatly according to the team, alternating between those who let themselves be punctured from every angle and those who literally act as a human wall in front of the goal. It is possible to use the touch screen to modify the strategy in real time, with the novelty of being able to manage the barriers ~by hand~ during set pieces, by moving them or adding elements to them. Also in this 2009 edition the controls can be modified ~to PES~, so those who are used to playing with Konami football will not find any difficulty in switching to FIFA. Technical realization The graphics in FIFA 09 are virtually identicalapprox to that of last year, and it's a shame because the room for improvement was and is quite evident. Without wanting to condemn the paucity of the polygonal models, with all their ~edges~, it must be said that often unfortunate chromatic choices have been made, with some players showing off a complexion that is anything but relevant to reality (Ibrahimovic, to say one, looks like good old Davids...). Furthermore, it is not clear why photos of the players have not been inserted directly into the training management screen, given that we find ourselves with faces that in most cases have nothing to do with their real counterparts. The graphics engine manages the teams in the field and the scenario without problems, with only a few small uncertainties in the most agitated phases, and provides a good number of alternative views to the default lateral one. The stadiums are not beautiful, but they do their job decently and offer some decent weather effects (rain, snow...). The commentary in English has remained unchanged, while the ~signed~ songs that make up the soundtrack have changed, reproduced surprisingly well on the speakers of the dual-screen Nintendo console. Comment As can be seen in almost all sectors, competition is good for the market and stimulates the various parties to improve their products. In the specific case of FIFA on Nintendo DS, the competition has unfortunately not frightened so far; and, barring surprises, EA Sports football should reign supreme this year as well. The game structure has been slightly improved compared to the 2008 edition, especially from the point of view of shots on goal, but there are still many things to work on: the accuracy of the passes, the management of the crosses and the AI in general. Not to mention the technical realization: the DS will have its limits, but it is certainly possible to do something more. The classic modes have been joined by two interesting innovations, which together with the already tested local and online multiplayer constitute enough material for a good longevity. If you want a football game for the Nintendo DS, FIFA 09 is currently the best you can have: the EA title is far from perfect, but it will keep you entertained for quite some time. Pros Quite playable, despite the dreadful d-pad Many game modes Improved since 2008 edition... Cons ...but still a lot of work to be done Mediocre graphics Often inaccurate passing", "date": "2008-11-10", "grade": null}
