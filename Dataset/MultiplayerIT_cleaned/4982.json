{"name": "Gatto Loco(Roco)", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/181283-the-big-journey-gatto-locoroco.html", "text": "Many will fondly remember LocoRoco, released on PSP eleven years ago and capable of conquering everyone with a perfect combination of a unique graphic style, a perfectly fitting musical accompaniment and a ~soft~ gameplay accessible to all. Also thanks to a control system that made extensive use of the console's accelerometer, the example of LocoRoco has been followed since the dawn of gaming on the iPhone by very valid products such as Rolando or Leo's Fortune, which imitated the characteristics of the title without too many compliments sony. A trend that evidently hasn't faded over the years, and which returns to the fore with this The Big Journey, a LocoRoco clone that adds an important factor to the equation: delicious round kittens... Not only cute and cuddly, The Big Journey is an enjoyable experience suitable for all ages Rolling east The protagonist of The Big Journey is Mr. Whiskers, a pot-bellied blue feline who is particularly fond of steamed dumplings, who decides to embark on the great journey that gives the application its title when his favorite cook Mr. Choo mysteriously disappears. The adventure unfolds over 25 levels divided into five chapters set in as many scenarios: these are certainly not mind-boggling numbers, and if we consider the very low level of challenge offered by the game, it is clear that the Armor Games product does not aspire to become the longest-running mobile game in history. Considering the modest price applied and above all the openly transversal focus (with an eye to younger users), there is however little to complain about, also because the dish offered by The Big Journey compensates for its modest quantities with a considerable taking care of all the aspects that matter, starting with a gameplay that is as simple as it is effective. The software contemplates two control systems to roll Mr. Whiskers on the two-dimensional plane that distinguishes the various stages, one that exploits the accelerometer of the device (which is therefore inclined in the direction in which you want to proceed) and the other that makes use of two special virtual keys: whatever the user's choice, the short list of inputs is completed by a simple upward swipe to be performed on the screen to allow the protagonist to jump. With these tools you have to lead the kitten to the end of each level, in a structure that could even be said to be too linear, given that the obstacles are few and easily overcome, the small enemies can be eliminated with a trivial head and there is not even the shadow of environmental and similar puzzles: you continue rolling blissfully, trying to collect the pre-established number of insects and ravioli scattered along the way and reaching the finish line within a certain time limit to get all three stars that represent the objectives of each stage . It is literally a piece of cake that even less experienced users shouldn't worry about, but the lack of the actual challenge does not affect the general pleasantness of the experience, sweetened by a delightful audiovisual sector. Strengthened by an undoubtedly refined design especially as regards the look of the characters, The Big Journey enchants with its bright colors, velvety scenarios and immaculate animations, accompanying everything with such catchy music that it almost regrets not being able to count on a tracklist more numerous.", "date": "2017-03-23", "grade": "8.0"}
