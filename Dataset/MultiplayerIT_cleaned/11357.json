{"name": "Sushi Mania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sushi-mania.html", "text": "Sushi Mania is part of the Hands-on Mobile program called ~Best of Korea~, which involves importing some of the best mobile products from the Asian country to western soil: an operation inaugurated with the interesting Heroes Lore and which confirms your goodness with this latest release. In fact, we can immediately say that Sushi Mania proves to be as fun as its premises are bizarre: the user's task is in fact to guide 12 different pieces of sushi (each with its own peculiar skills), committed to rolling over the course of 20 levels at search for the missing ingredients and the chef who will cook them. In practice, this translates into gameplay comparable to that already seen in the excellent SolaRola: our sushi will therefore be called to jump obstacles, collect coins and defeat enemies, all using an extremely simple control system. The '4' and '6' keys are therefore used to move left and right, while '5' allows the sushi to make a leap. The Hands-on product stands out first of all for an excellent level design, not only for the variety of the same, but above all for the presence within them of multiple paths that favor the replay value. The stages are also full of elements such as trampolines, buffers, air currents and so on, an aspect that confirms the developers' commitment in this sense; also noteworthy is the presence of real bosses to defeat (six in total) which, once overcome, lead to the unlocking of as many mini-games accessible from the main menu. The latter exploit the same rolling mechanics of the real game, but with specific objectives such as collecting the highest number of coins or jumping all the ditches that present themselves in front of us: here too, applause must be given to the developers for their commitment in offering additional content to the main adventure. It therefore appears evident that Sushi Mania is a fun and certainly well-studied action game (and this explains its success at home), however not without defects. We are talking specifically about a not particularly fluid scrolling and a control system that does not always allow optimal control over the round protagonist. Returning to the positive notes of the Hands-on product, however, the graphics are very pleasant, which relies on manga-style characters and colorful levels, with a minimalist look that is very reminiscent of LocoRoco for PSP.
