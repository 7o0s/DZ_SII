This time it's the turn of 7th Sense, an independent software house that presents itself with this Fallen - Episode 1, the first chapter of an episodic series inspired by old-fashioned survival horror. Falling away with you Fallen - Episode 1 puts the user in the role of Roman Mendez, a small-time criminal committed to serving his sentence in prison: one fine day our ~hero~ wakes up only to discover that he is one of the few survivors of a massacre operated by monstrous creatures from who knows where, and think well of getting to work to save his own skin. The script is anything but exciting and least of all original, but it does its dirty duty leading to the construction of that mystery that will probably be revealed in the next chapters. Unfortunately, a bad beating is given by the paucity of the text on the screen in English, full of grammatical errors, even rather gross ones, and almost totally devoid of interesting content: Roman's lucubrations on the elements of the scenario to be examined are, to say the least, vacuous, while the dialogues with the small NPCs are almost always useless to the plot. On a more strictly playful level, Fallen - Episode 1 follows the canons traced by the first Resident Evil, thus offering a mix of puzzle solving, collecting objects and fighting. It must be said that the 7th Sense production fails to excel in any of these areas, in particular as regards the last aspect: colliding with demonic creatures is a cumbersome activity devoid of any technique, which only requires you to press furiously the key dedicated to the attack in the hope of killing the opponent before his energy runs out. On the front of the puzzles, fortunately things are better, if only because the effort on the part of the developers is evident to propose sections that exploit the characteristics of the iPhone: so here we find ourselves using the touchscreen and accelerometer in a quite creative way , even if you end up encroaching on minigames for their own sake rather than ad hoc puzzles. Thumbs down instead for inventory management, absolutely inconvenient and which should be reviewed for the next episode. The sector in which Fallen - Episode 1 shows off its best qualities is certainly the technical one. Although not free from criticisms, the title offers a convincing audiovisual system, starting from a graphic characterized by two-dimensional backdrops and 3D characters: the former are very good, the latter a little less so, which suffer from rather woody animations and polygonal models not particularly complex. The scenarios, on the other hand, are rich in details, while the shots chosen for some frames are not convincing at all, resulting alternatively uncomfortable or redundant. The game also features short CG sequences which are actually not too successful, but which are still pleasing for the purposes of the narrative. The sound accompaniment is positive, with music and atmospheric effects, while we return to the painful notes in terms of longevity: the adventure can be concluded easily in less than an hour, even if in this sense the price must be taken into consideration budget (1.59 Euros) of the title.
