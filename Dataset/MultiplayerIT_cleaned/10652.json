Well, in the opening sequence of Tales of Monkey Island we see LeChuck holding a monkey by the neck and threatening to sacrifice it. So it's true, Monkey Island is not a memory: we have gone back to the times of one of the most acclaimed sagas by two generations of players. And by the hand of Telltale, which brought together most of the people who worked on the original project, with the exception of Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert, who however contributed to the conception of this new series. We don't want the younger ones, but first of all we have to make sure that this is Monkey Island even beyond appearances. So here is our report. Appointment at the usual place There are several hints of Ron Gilbert in Tales of Monkey Island: Launch of the Screaming Narwhal, and this allowed Telltale's Dave Grossman (also present in the original project), to smooth the edges and better manage the characters. Right from the start, it's clear that we can breathe a sigh of relief. The debut of Elaine and Guybrush takes place simultaneously with that of LeChuck, the fearsome undead pirate, bitter enemy of the blond hero. From the very beginning, Guybrush must rescue Elaine from the bearded corsair's ship and prevent him from carrying out a voodoo spell. But something doesn't go right, because the ship explodes and Guybrush is shipwrecked on an unknown island. What's more, his left hand is now affected by a curse that binds it to LeChuck. And in fact, first of all, he slaps him of his own free will. It should be noted that Guybrush wears the wedding ring in that hand, a subtlety that is understood only at the end of the episode. The complicity between our hero and his bride is effectively rendered, and this demonstrates how far the Telltale guys have gone in their search for Monkey Island's alchemical formula. It is true that some secondary characters are annoying, but there is at least one memorable: a new villain, the Marquis de Singe, brilliant from his first appearance. In any case, it was Ron Gilbert's humor that made many fans fall in love with him in the past, but that cannot be copied, it is one's personal dimension. On this point, every old player will have their say, but we were satisfied. Tales of Monkey Island even made us laugh out loud. In conclusion: we are no longer children, and it would have been naive to expect emotions similar to those of childhood, but this first episode of Telltale is consistent with the series that inspired it and does not sound like a sour note. This is already a success. Curiosity Tales of Monkey Island is a series composed of five chapters and inspired by a saga of the nineties, The Secret of Monkey Island. The work is carried on by Telltale, with the collaboration of a large part of the original team. The episodes are released on a monthly basis and from time to time you can read the review on Multiplayer.it. NOTE: at the time of launch, all Tales of Monkey Island episodes are only available in English. After some time, Telltale releases translations of the subtitles in other European languages, but there is still no official announcement about the timing. The SCUMM entry leaves the dictionary When LucasFilm (now LucasArts) released The Secret of Monkey Island in 1990, they employed the proprietary SCUMM engine. This implied, among other things, a well-defined and recognizable interface, through which the player could combine the objects collected in the inventory or make them interact with others present in the background, choosing from a list of possible verbs. Now everything has simplified, and we can only combine some objects with a click of the mouse. The multiple choice dialogues are still present, although they are less extravagant than the original ones. The puzzles have also been updated: keep in mind that in the past, puzzles that made the player lose whole days were not uncommon. Now, although bizarre situations abound, the reasoning is enough to overcome any puzzle, even if we have to immerse ourselves in the mentality of the game to be able to do it, thinking like a pirate from the saga would. In any case, four hours will be enough for an experienced player to complete the episode, demonstrating that it is more a matter of style than substance. The music is the work of Michael Land, composer of all four old episodes, which however is not distinguished by an interpretationenthusiastic tation of the original soundtrack. Beyond the technical aspects, what makes this first chapter a good start is the genuine approach with which it refers to its predecessors. It owes much to the quality of the story, which does not end with each episode but connects them to form a wide-ranging narrative.", "date": "2009-07-07", "grade": "8.1"}
