{"name": "This War of Mine: Stories - Father's Promise", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/this-war-of-mine-stories-fathers-promise-recensione.html", "text": "This War of Mine: Stories is the latest series of DLC created by 11 bit studios for the famous survival game set in a besieged city, in which our goal is to survive long enough to see the end of the conflict to be able to return , if possible, to a normal life. Erasing weeks of tension, sacrifices and mourning is clearly not easy, and this aspect of the experience developed by the Polish team is certainly the most plausible and realistic, as well as the most distressing. With the introduction of a further element of difficulty at the time of the launch of The Little Ones expansion, the authors wanted to complicate the life of the characters even more, responsible not only for their own life but also for that of their children or however, of children who found themselves sharing the same ruined house during the military invasion. In short, there are many similarities with Father's Promise, which can be purchased in a stand-alone version on the App Store and Google Play at a price of 2.29 or 1.99 euros, if we consider that in this case the protagonist is a father determined to save his young daughter sick while war is around them. The gameplay mechanics are those that we have come to know over the years and editions, but in this case they are put at the service of a story rather than the mere survival of the character, which we will discover is not the main objective of a story in which many of these implications are observed in a different light. Story and gameplay We had completed Father's Promise at the time of reviewing This War of Mine: Complete Edition for Nintendo Switch, so we already knew what to expect from this short but significant DLC. The system, as mentioned, is the same as always and even on a smartphone screen it proves to be precise and playable, although clearly it is preferable to enjoy the experience on a tablet to avoid often resorting to the zoom. The story begins with this man at the bedside of his sick daughter after the death of his wife, unable to treat her due to lack of medicines and with his brother urging him to leave with him to take advantage of a humanitarian corridor that would ensure everyone's survival and three, but which appears a smoky and unrealistic hypothesis in the eyes of the protagonist. After a few days, an event occurs that changes the cards on the table, and it is at that point that the exploratory mechanics and stealth elements of This War of Mine return to be seen with arrogance, urging us to go out at night to enter more or less dangerous, looking for information and essential materials for the creation of food, tools, essential furnishing components (a bed, a chair...) and even weapons. The latter can solve certain situations, but remaining in a plausible area: you don't expect to be able to kill a guy armed with a rifle if you only have a knife in your hand. A rash choice will inevitably result in something very undesirable, whether it's wounds to heal or even death. The rules that the authors had established are therefore still valid and will accompany us on a poignant and desperate journey, among ruins and people who have lost hope, or sometimes even their humanity. The music helps to create a certain atmosphere, as do the almost monochromatic graphics, very detailed in representing the settings and characterized by a clear and legible interface. The touch controls are more intuitive than ever, since it is enough to touch a point on the screen for our character to move in that direction, urging him to run with a double tap and using the same method when interacting with NPCs or tools.", "date": "2019-04-05", "grade": "8.0"}
