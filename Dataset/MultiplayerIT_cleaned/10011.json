After last year's burn with Crystal Dynamics' Avengers, the somewhat muted announcement and even more silent launch seemed like the classic signs of an unambitious project, almost as a filler really suitable only for the most ardent fans of Star Lord and company. On the contrary, however, this lack of expectations has allowed us to surprise positively thanks to a game that is certainly more structured and mature than the GaaS made in Crystal Dynamics. The Guardians of the Galaxy work, they take full advantage of the comic books to put on the plate a narratively perfect title. Net of a combat system far from excellence, the latest effort by the Deus Ex team is perhaps much more than we would have expected and this can only please many. If you are interested in learning more about everything, but really everything we think of the game, we refer you to the review of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy in the console version. Today we will focus on the PC version, since it can count on many highs, but also on a handful of negative points. Hello, we are the Star Lords, or maybe the Guardians Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: artistically a jewel It would have been easy to go and replicate the story read in any of the splendid books dedicated to the Guardians. Even stronger than the cinematic success, the galactic gang is at the height of its commercial splendor and, as we know, sometimes it takes very little to make a certain type of fan happy. However, Eidos did his homework, studied the source material in depth and decided to leap into the void by creating a totally original story. The Guardians have been watching over the galaxy for more than a decade now and, exactly as already seen in the Spider-Man of Insomniac or in Avengers itself, here too the origins are left in the past, without getting lost in particular lengthiness. The tone of the Guardians is known, just as famous is that of their presumed leader, Star Lord, a half-human with great self-esteem and a sharp irony. During the fifteen hours needed to conclude the campaign, all the spirit of one of Marvel's most charismatic groups will come out, seasoned with a series of small dialogues here and there that also denote the thickness of the production. It is enough to know that this is the title with the largest number of lines of dialogue in the history of the software house, which for those who have worked on titles such as Deus Ex Human Revolution and Manking Divided almost seems like a joke. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: The variety of locations is incredible The relationship between the Guardians is hilarious, the situations are equally so and the plot itself, although not free from defects or delays of any kind, is and will remain for a long time one of the best examples of transposition of a comic into the video game. What concerns the gameplay is different, totally devoted to frenzy, so much so that in some sporadic situations confusion takes over, and using Star Lord directly and the other Guardians via a combination of keys to perform precise attacks, is not always possible reveals quickly and painlessly. Net of this, and of a certainly not extraordinary depth, the possibility of setting the difficulty as best we believe gives us great freedom of expression, going to create the game we really want to play. The best version? Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: Astronaut Dog Report Needless to go around it: when analyzing the PC version of a title, even net of a console generation that has just begun, one always expects to be faced with the best incarnation of the product. For the Guardians of the Galaxy, the thing does not change and we launched the game on our configuration - equipped with RTX 3080 - just to understand what Eidos' work was made of. Let's start with an incontrovertible fact: Marvel's Guardian of the Galaxy it's technically splendid. This aspect is not only related to the mere polygonal count of models and environments, but also and above all to a stylistic and artistic research of the various (many) environments, which allowed us to identify ourselves even more with the pirates of the galaxy. We played the game always at 1440p, both with ray tracing on and off, testing a whole range of parameters. The game itself, to be honest, allows fewer choices than it seems at first glance. In fact, many items in the settings menu seem to be placed there just to make up the number, with a difference in practice that is anything but substantial. The value of ray tracing is emblematic and you can see it even just by taking a lookat the frame rate. The revolutionary option introduced by Nvidia with the RTX 20xx series cards moves in alternating steps. It's clear that activation alters the image, but until you push into the reflections you can't really tell a big difference. As always, it is essential to also keep DLSS turned on, another technology that exploits AI to, brutally, make it more sustainable for the card to digest the computing power required by a heavy element such as ray tracing. In our test, mostly done with maximum ray tracing and DLSS on performance, the loss of 25-30 frames on the total does not seem to us to be considered justified. Surely going down to simple Full HD would improve things, but who would choose to play at 1080p after buying a monitor - perhaps one with excellent performance - only to find themselves admiring a few more reflections than normal? If you add to this the fact that the game is truly already splendid in its smooth version, the advice is certainly not to overdo the useless frills, so as to enjoy a fluidity worthy of the platform on which you are running the game. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: the combat system can be spectacular and confusing at the same time We have instead encountered some critical issues regarding the mapping of the commands and a series of small problems that are afflicting the PC version of the game. If you use a pad, in fact, for a totally unknown reason, only two of the four face buttons will be reversed. As exhilarating as it may seem, we assure you that it will risk generating a certain labyrinthitis, especially if you have always used a pad and therefore the automatism of the key is almost a simple reflection. Online there are guides to solve the problem, but it is still curious in the light of a title that makes the pad its most suitable control tool. In addition to this, just a few hours before writing this article, it was impossible for us to access to the game due to an alleged server error. It would almost seem that the start requires some kind of license verification, perhaps something dedicated to anti-piracy, which however is making it impossible for the user to start a single player title. We investigated and discovered that this error has proved to be generalized and what does not convince us is its origin. We are sure it will be resolved in a short time, perhaps already when you read these lines, but for the record it seemed right to point it out to you.", "date": "2021-11-08", "grade": "8.0"}
