The formulas to achieve fame and wealth invented by these individuals are many, but they all have one thing in common: they don't serve a well-loved club. The truth is that success can only be achieved with a fair mixture of the sweat of the brow and a stroke of luck, sometimes in equal measure, and sometimes with a strong inclination towards one of the two factors. In the case of Psyonix there was a perfect convergence of two things: a brilliant game called Rocket League, and the ability to slip into a niche never considered by other developers at the right time, which exploded beyond all possible predictions. To date, the community of the title is enormous, its earnings monstrous, and the ports on the various platforms a practical certainty; it was therefore only a matter of time for everything to appear on Nintendo Switch too, given the sales of the hybrid console. Clearly, all we have to do is evaluate this version as well; but it's not ~exactly~ the same as the others... Benji trains, stepping on accelerators We really don't think it's necessary to explain the basics of Rocket League in detail for the thousandth time. After all, it is a very intuitive variant of sports titles, which adds jet cars capable of performing spectacular maneuvers to soccer matches (but boasts a significantly higher mechanical finesse than that perceived at first glance). Its ingenious formula immediately conquered a passionate community, which was also properly nourished by the development team thanks to a series of excellent updates, cars inspired by pop culture, extra modes and so on. The fun that a game of Rocket League manages to convey can hardly be compared to other online titles, and the sense of progression remains stable thanks to a clever system of leaderboards and unlockable customizations. Consider that, despite the presence of aesthetic boxes with keys to be purchased separately, the game has been largely ignored by the controversies that have arisen recently, as it is still full of free and low-cost content (after all, we are talking about purely aesthetic changes). The Switch version, for its part, maintains the characteristics of all the others in terms of content: you will have a handful of cars at your disposal at the beginning - which can be customized with a few objects - but from game to game you will get other chassis and countless goodies to make it more unique your car, from special ~headwear~ to simple turbo dyes. The only novelties in this field are two cars, one inspired by Mario Bros. and one by Samus Aran's ship (not available immediately), very well studied and capable of marrying well with the original fleet of the title. For the rest we have the same list of modes (including snow games with hockey pucks and challenges on the basketball court), and the typical online match system. No protests about the netcode of course: the game runs like a marvel, and we hardly had half a latency problem during our games, not to mention that a few seconds pass between one challenge and another because the community on Switch is already very large. i can see you, pixel However, if online stability cannot be criticized (provided you are not part of that unfortunate group who cannot play online with Switch due to their router), you still need to make some notes on the technical sector of the title and its controls. who didn't come out of the passage as untouched. Let it be crystal clear: the game travels at 60 fps with very few drops, it's always a pleasure to control your car, and the response of the controls remains excellent; however, to maintain this fluidity, the Psyonix had to sacrifice the technical sector, demonstrating a lack of experience with the Nintendo Switch architecture. Rocket League is in fact at 720p in docked mode, and the resolution seems to be even lower on the tablet, where you can see very clear graininess, a very low general level of detail, and the sacrifice of too many particle effects. There is no mention of a lowering that makes everything unpleasant to the eye, but if you have had the opportunity to observe the other versions it will be a decent eyesore, we assure you. From the point of view of the controls, however, the problems derive more from the Joycon's not excellent analog sticks, whose dry response makes the maneuvers of up to a little more difficult than usual. The problem clearly disappears with the pro controller,but be sure to undo the deadzone from the options when using it, for maximum accuracy. The other choice we don't understand concerns the splitscreen: it can't be activated without two profiles on the same console (both registered on the Nintendo network), a somewhat convoluted solution that was certainly not necessary. Apart from these marginal problems, however, Psyonix's work remains fun and being able to take it everywhere is an added value that cannot be underestimated.", "date": "2017-11-27", "grade": "8.6"}
