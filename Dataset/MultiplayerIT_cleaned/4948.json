This does not mean that it is not yet possible to distinguish between those who adopt this approach with great commitment and criterion and those who instead adapt to what has become in effect a new canon, and Momodora: Reverie under the Moonlight demonstrates how this type of representation still has a lot to offer, especially if combined with a game mechanic that works well. On the other hand, it's not really a new title, being the fourth chapter of a series that, for those who follow the indie scene a bit, has already made itself known for about seven years now. The first Momodora dates back to 2010 and with the second chapter they have been available for free on PC for some years now, while the third was published on Steam as a purchasable game, but it was with the fourth chapter that the series made the definitive leap in quality , which prompted Playism to bring the game to consoles as well, where games of this type are establishing themselves even if we are still quite far from the open and fervent landscape that characterizes the PC on these fronts, and a game like this comes more easily if he has already proved himself up to the task, he has contacts with some high sphere of producers or leans on some high-sounding name. Momodora: Reverie under the Moonlight is instead a game developed with all the trappings of indie production: carried out by the four people of the Bombservice team, identified by nicknames as befits the style of a genuine garage developer. Momodora demonstrates, once again, how much the return to classic styles can bring fresh air Almost Metroidvania Also due to its background, expecting a full Metroidvania would perhaps be misleading, because Momodora, as well as the famous Cave Story, is moved to somewhat different mechanics, more focused on the immediacy of the action than on the rigorous construction of a level design to explore inch by inch in search of hidden passages or on the evolution of the character with role-playing ambitions. However, there is the opening of the setting to suggest belonging to the particular hybrid genre and its non-linear structure that allows you to master a large map made up of different rooms and scenarios to be approached with considerable freedom. This does not mean that there are no ~adventurous~ moments, in the sense of digressions bordering on adventure, but the substance is found above all around the purely platform action and in the clashes, even very demanding ones, with the numerous enemies that infest the areas complete with inevitable bosses. It is therefore a question of focusing above all on the moment, on the constant danger that keeps the tension and the level of challenge at a high level, translating into an excellent pace of play and the need to bring out a certain skill in order to be able to get to the end, rather than concentrating on the evolution of the protagonist and overcome the problems with higher levels of experience and equipment. This too is a choice in line with the genuine classicism chosen by the team, also derived from the natural evolution of the structure adopted in the first Momodoras, which inevitably could not present excessive insights into different territories given their nature of action games developed practically in home. Yet this concentration on a few but good gameplay elements has brought out a particular character and style of play that is not to be taken lightly. The hard work of the nun Kaho has a rather unique fighting style, as she attacks with nothing but a leaf in hand for close range engagements while relying on a more traditional bow for those at longer ranges. Don't mislead the idea though, because the leaf proves to be a lethal weapon and the effect it has is similar to Strider's classic shot, so the protagonist is well equipped to deal with threats. The encounters immediately prove to be quite challenging and require you to learn how to use evasive maneuvers in an optimal way to avoid attacks, given the small amount of energy and the considerable attack capacity that the various enemies scattered around the map demonstrate from the early stages , obviously not to mention the bosses. We therefore return to the origins of the action also for this element: analysis of the attack patterns, dodges with the right timing and identification of the weak points and the best moments to launch the blows, all very ~hardcore~ also because small mistakes cost a lot and Game Over appears often and willinglyyesterday, also considering that bailouts aren't always around the corner. Put these characteristics together, the reference to Dark Souls can only make its way into the mind, given the impact of the From Software game in the current panorama, but the connections are much more solid with the action/platformers of the 8 and 16-bit era , without trying to bring out the usual suspects. It is therefore a challenge from another time, demanding and at times even frustrating, which balances a not exactly impressive length of the game with the need for various attempts (we are under 10 hours, close to 5), even if the perfectionists they will have enough to go back to explore its meanders. Xbox One goals The unlockable objectives are only 10 for the usual total of 1000 points, so these are all very rich achievements. The flip side is that no one is particularly easy to conquer: a first simple progression of the game guarantees the achievement of only a few objectives and for a substantial collection it is necessary to commit a lot, completing not simple performances. A dark fairy tale The graphic style adopted is a clear homage to more 8- and 16-bit 2D productions, with the classic ~lo-fi~ effect that induces the effect of a sort of low resolution with large pixels composing the drawings. This does not mean that the work was carried out with extreme attention to detail, clearly visible in the beautiful animations of the characters and elements of the scenario, scattered with touches of class, self-propelled elements and particular and very varied atmospheres between a setting and the other. We are more in the realm of the fairy tale rather than the real fantasy, with a twist towards the darker and darker interpretations of this, albeit tempered by the soft anime-style stretch that characterizes the whole scene. The similarity with Castlevania is clear, but Momodora has a very marked identity thanks to this contrast between dark and cartoonish fairy tale, perhaps even clearer here than in the previous chapters of the series. The story is very simple but functional to stage the advance of Kaho among myriads of enemies: the world is invaded by monsters of various types and everything seems to have started from a curse cast on the Kingdom of Karst, so the only hope be a talk with the local queen looking for a solution. There are some twists even if the narrative system is not exactly the key element of the game, but there is still a story that advances and is told above all through the interactions and dialogues with the non-player characters, characterized by the inevitable portrait of the subjects that appears superimposed with the text lines.", "date": "2017-04-05", "grade": "8.0"}
