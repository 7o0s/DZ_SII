{"name": "Gray Dawn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gray-dawn-la-recensione-200537.html", "text": "Some titles are more complex than others to review, and Gray Dawn is one of them. If the problem were only to give him one or more ~labels~, all in all we would get away with little: what is Gray Dawn? Is it really horror? Or rather, an intricate psychological thriller? Can we consider it a first person adventure? And how do you classify it, even in the light of frequent and varied environmental puzzles? These answers can more or less be answered in a rather objective way. But Gray Dawn is treacherous, as are the protagonist's hallucinations and real ~visions~: he plays with symbolic plans, with religion, with Satanism and blasphemy, and mixes his cards so intricately that one once his narration is over, we turn off the monitor, clasp our hands in front of our faces and think: ~Well, it's a really nice title. But what did I play?~. It's not easy to answer, but it seems that Interactive Stone's goal is just that, and now we'll explain why. A plot suspended between heaven and hell We told you about the first three acts of Gray Dawn, in a version obviously devoid of any spoilers, in our preview: what we played at the time was a real first-person horror, made up of asphyxiated environments, perpetually present anxiety and also a few jumps from the chair. At the same time it was already understood that Gray Dawn wanted to offer something else, something completely new, both in the contents and in the proposed game mode: now it seems reasonable to conclude that he has succeeded, but at the price of some compromises. We take on the role of Father Abraham, who on Christmas Eve 1920 finds himself in a very unfortunate situation: he is accused of the murder of his altar boy. He claims to be innocent, and it immediately becomes clear that there is something very strange happening around his home and the nearby church: visions, ominous omens, a suspended atmosphere very different from the ~pure~ one of Christmas; inside the house it's even worse, with noises, bloodied objects, things that aren't where they should be and goodies collected here and there from the wide repertoire of anxiety-provoking horror. But if at the beginning the title proceeds in a rather linear way making us explore Abraham's home, the narrative soon takes a turn that we could define as ~mystical~, and begins to address themes, problems and events related to religion. A religion, mind you, that mixes orthodoxy with very deviant traits coming from mysticism, satanism or a smug blasphemous intervention by the developers. This blasphemy, it should be underlined, is made acceptable and almost necessary not only by the story told, but also by the way in which the development team introduces it: it is not a heap of random ideas bordering on obscenity as in Agony, but something much deeper and, so to speak, delicate. They are faces of religion, aspects of the scriptures, interpreted in a very particular way by the mind of the protagonist and by the Demon, who remains our main antagonist in the game until the end. The beauty of Gray Dawn, what makes it really special, is that out of the blue the horror, anxiety, fear suddenly disappear, dragging us instead into a first-person narrative adventure based on the exploration of small areas of outdoor gameplay and about solving rather simple environmental puzzles. These stages of the game are set in Heaven, or rather in Abraham's heavenly visions. The gameplay and peace of mind Imagine Gray Dawn like this: a first-person psychological horror based entirely on the telling of a story. The plot continues by exploring closed and terrifying environments, always anxious, for a good half of the title; moreover it alternates continuously with completely opposite phases, relaxed and serene. In these cases the horror disappears completely, and the game becomes an adventure based on environmental puzzles, always simple riddles that the developers have been careful not to complicate even in the final stages of the adventure. The reason is obvious: Interactive Stone, it is now clear, was simply interested in telling a good story, and they wanted to do it by exploiting certain themes. These, in turn, needed some ~genre labels~ that Gray Dawn actually proposes: all the game modes are simple, the objects to be found in the environments are more or less in plain sight, and the puzzles are solved spending just a couple of minutes in reasoning. Gray Dawn is therefore a title that must be played straight away, only once, and which does not offer any replayability, unless you want to think again about the ideasintellectuals that launches, very profound, but which will interest just a handful of connoisseurs. Gray Dawn can actually mislead those who look at it superficially: it really looks like a horror, even from the trailers, but it's not, or at least it's not how you imagine it. You don't hide, you don't fight, you can't die, there's no game over: it's a long, intense exploration of a few environments, but which launch important ideas on some fundamental themes. Does God Exist? And the devil? And if God exists, what is he? An intelligent presence or a blind physical force? What is Sin? The developers answered these questions with their particular ideas, always leaving a window for alternative interpretations. At the same time, a very particular passion for the blasphemous also emerges, which is really in Gray Dawn, and it is also very heavy, but justified by the ~evil~ inherent in the religion itself: Satan. And then there is also a certain interest in Alchemy, in the Kabbalah and in esoteric rites, of which it seems to us that the producers have an excellent knowledge. Gray Dawn, from a strictly videogame point of view, is completed in a short time: a handful of hours running, a couple more exploring everything calmly and enjoying the many details scattered everywhere. Artistically, visually and technically, it's a little gem, it just lacks in the animations of human beings. Unfortunately, the inspired artistic direction fails to support all the shortcomings of the gameplay on its shoulders: the difficulty borders on zero, because what matters is only the story; puzzles almost solve themselves; the few collectibles present do not encourage the exploration of rather similar and in any case small-sized environments. However, if we evaluate the proposed price and all that is offered to us, even at the cost of many compromises in terms of playability, it is difficult not to be satisfied. We repeat: we ended the adventure dazed, but happy with the intense, reflective and visually very beautiful experience we had. We turned off the PC with the desire to go and dig up somewhere a reliable book on exorcisms, or the Old Testament directly, to check if the quotations we read were faithful. I am. Isn't that enough to guarantee a title, if not an excellent grade, at least more than a fair one?", "date": "2018-06-09", "grade": "7.5"}
