{"name": "Hindsight", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hindsight-recensione.html", "text": "Over the years, the world of independent video games has led us to discover intimate and personal stories, based entirely or partially on the real life experiences of the people who are part of these small and ambitious creative teams. Telling about one's difficulties, the obstacles encountered on the way or even just the adversities overcome by other individuals, near or far, allows the player to get very close to the themes and topics covered in these titles, leading to a personification of the minds that they stand behind these projects, no longer seen as inanimate human assembly lines, but as flesh and blood individuals, with their own limitations, problems and goals. Hindsight is a video game that fully falls into this category. Distributed by Annapurna Interactive and developed by Joel McDonald, the title aims to touch the player emotionally, telling a theme that, sooner or later, encounters the path of every human being: mourning. Let's see if he managed to hit the mark in this Hindsight review. Coping with mourning Hindsight: an unexpected mourning takes us back to the past Hindsight is a video game focused solely on storytelling. The protagonist is a woman who, after her mother's death, finds herself forced to return to the house where she grew up. Through the objects that inhabit it, the woman begins to remember her past, looking for comfort, but also for answers towards her mother, with whom she had always had a difficult relationship. The game takes place in a mostly linear way , asking the player to solve some perspective games (if we can call them that) with which to literally open a window on the past. Through these continuous passages between the present and the past, the narrative continues as an uninterrupted sequence shot, leading the player through this more than ordinary life, characterized by happiness, sadness, loneliness, love and, of course, loss. Accompanying us is the narrative voice of the protagonist, who gently and sadly guides us into this deep existentialist well, from which there seems to be no way out except by choosing to accept one's condition and embrace life. Audiovisual simplicity Hindsight: simplicity that pays off You don't necessarily have to propose complex animations or photo-realistic graphics to be able to convey the intensity of an emotion. Many video games have shown us this in the past and Hindsight is further confirmation. Through a simple visual style, composed of few polygons and a color palette that expands on the elements on the screen in large backgrounds, the game manages to express everything it has to. The player is allowed to spin around objects and situations freely, but will follow a set of pre-established tracks to move from one scene to another. We're talking about scenes because the whole game unfolds as if we were immersed in a motionless diorama, where the only thing that moves is the game room and a few other elements (the characters are most of the time motionless, except in rare cases). This choice, as if to recall the fixity of the photographic medium, marries perfectly with the elusiveness of memories, confused, opaque, which come to mind like lightning in the darkness of one's memory. If from a visual point of view everything is done to recall the theme of memory as if it were an artistic sketch, in the audio one we find a soundtrack that does everything to enhance the emotions aroused by the simplicity of the images. The narrative voice sometimes seems to merge with the musical commentary (not too original, but effective), showing an attention to the rhythm that proceeds steadily from the beginning to the end of the adventure (except for those few times when you get lost a bit ' time to find the next object to interact with). In short, the technical sector does not seem to have been chosen at random from a host of possible styles, but meticulously selected to communicate its message effectively and immediately (which is by no means a trivial matter).", "date": "2022-08-03", "grade": "8.0"}
