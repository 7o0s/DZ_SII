It's a pity that behind this attractive facade there is a product that suffers from various naiveties, a revisable balance and really too much, too much advertising. Bowmasters idea is nice, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired Shoot with each other The premises of Bowmasters are extremely simple: two contenders are positioned at a safe distance on a two-dimensional plane, and in turn they must launch the supplied weapon trying to hit the opponent, with the aim of reducing his health bar up to killing him. All of this is represented by Sunday morning cartoon graphics which clash (deliberately) with the brutality of the effects of the blows: in fact, every successful shot causes huge losses of blood and strips the victim to flesh by exposing the skeleton, not to mention the Fatalities - different for each character - which turn out to be a riot of dismemberments, explosions, incinerations and so on. As mentioned at the beginning, Bowmasters is played using the mechanics made famous by Rovio's angry birds: it is therefore necessary to swipe your finger on the screen to adjust the angle and power of the launch, and release to start the dart. Evidently the Playgendary developers thought they were in an iron barrel thanks to these elements, and did not bother to take care of some fundamental aspects properly, inevitably leading Bowmasters to prove to be a forgettable product after just a few games. To begin with, the system at the base of the duels blatantly lacks strategy or depth: in fact, it is sufficient to always shoot at maximum power and at a medium/low angle to have an excellent chance of hitting the target, repeating the operation in the following rounds to conclude victorious in the fight. It doesn't help that arenas are simply flat surfaces with few and irrelevant elevations and no obstacles to make pitching more challenging. We realize in a short time that the only variable in the field is represented by the choice of the character and the weapon in his equipment: the game can count on a considerable number of elements, some unlockable by spending the coins earned for each victory and others obtainable only through prize roulette which is activated at the end of a game. Even here, however, it is a work that leaves something to be desired: if it is therefore true that the various instruments have a slightly different behavior in flight and cause customized Fatalities, on the other hand the differences in terms of gameplay are so minimal to reduce the preference to a mere aesthetic fact. The progression system adopted by Playgendary is also definitely perplexing: initially the menu allows you to face only the challenge mode against artificial intelligence, and it is necessary to accumulate games in order to unlock the other items. Of these, only the local or online multiplayer component is worthy of interest, while the rest is reduced to a boring tournament and two negligible variations on the theme that respectively require you to shoot down birds and try to hit an apple on the head of an unfortunate victim. Already unconvincing on the content front, Bowmasters then puts the proverbial icing on the cake by going far beyond the bounds of ad sustainability: commercials are literally everywhere, from pop-ins during matches to screenshots between loads to the full of videos that you must watch in order to open the prize chest obtained after a victory. There is the possibility of removing everything with the inevitable dedicated in-app purchase, but it is simply not worth it.", "date": "2016-09-10", "grade": "6.0"}
