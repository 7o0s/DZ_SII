{"name": "Quelli che il tennis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125380-wii-sports-club-quelli-che-il-tennis.html", "text": "With over eighty million copies sold, Wii Sports has given a new face to casual gaming, consistently boosting Wii sales and bringing the Nintendo console into the homes of many people who had never previously approached a video game. The fact of being able to use the controllers to obtain a faithful reproduction of the movements on the screen and try out live with five sports disciplines (tennis, bowling, golf, baseball and boxing) was a really interesting novelty in the home environment, and it doesn't matter if structurally the product was little more than a demo: it worked well, it was a lot of fun and people were excited to play it, especially with friends. There has been talk for some time about what Wii Sports was good for and what instead, guilty, had not been implemented in the game, primarily online multiplayer. Seven years later, with a new flagship console, Nintendo tries to put a piece together and focuses again on the casual sport par excellence, hoping it can also make a substantial contribution to Wii U sales. The approach chosen by the Japanese company for Wii Sports Club, however, surprises: rather than opting for a traditional retail distribution, perhaps bundled with a Wii Remote Plus, the only digital path was initially chosen, with limited-time licenses (fortunately not only those) and the release cadenced, with tennis and bowling available from day one and baseball, golf and boxing arriving months later. The retail release took place only when the collection was completed and is set for 11 July, but the purchase and rental options on the eShop remain valid, respectively with time passes or definitive licenses from 9.99 euros for each package (in this case tennis, bowling, golf and baseball + boxing). Wii Sports Club is a title that moves through thick and thin, with some good ideas and some blunders Gentlemen, tennis The choice to start with tennis could not have been more apt, considering the value of the relative minigame already at the time of the original Wii Sports. We're talking about a casual and simplistic interpretation of English sport, with our character automatically moving around the field to intercept the ball, but at the same time an important and significant application to test the capabilities of the Wii Remote Plus, which has the task of translating our movements on the screen with a ratio of 1 to 1. Timing still represents a fundamental aspect of the experience, however approaching the game with the dynamics of seven years ago in mind can prove to be a serious mistake, to be paid for with some resounding defeat and an inevitable initial bewilderment. In fact, with the standard Wiimote it was enough to shake the controller for our character to receive the input equivalent to a complete swing, but things have changed and we absolutely cannot skimp on movements, nor take for granted the impact with the ball, which we can also spectacularly missing. Fortunately, three different training methods come in handy: ~Rough Rings~, in which you have to pass the ball through a series of rings that appear in the opponent's half of the field, with progressively more complex trajectories; ~Botte da Moles~, in which the goal is to hit the moles with our forehands and our backhands, learning to manage the directionality and power of the shots; and finally ~Duck here, Duck here~, with a large duck that moves according to the area of the field we hit, which teaches us to send our opponents for a walk during exchanges. The funny thing, perfectly noticeable in online matches, is that all Wii Sports nostalgics are having the same problem in dealing with the Wii Sports Club controls. Our impression is that some movements are a bit complicated to perform without the game detecting the ~swing~, primarily the change of position, and this can often make the difference between victory and defeat. Welcome to the club As already reported in the announcement of the game, the Wii Sports Club structure does not leave the (very limited) groove traced by the original version as regards single-player play, with the level of experience that rises as we bring home victories and the degree of challenge that rises accordingly in single matches against the CPU. It is a serious lack, even more so considering all the time that has passed, and it manifests Nintendo's will not to give the product a greater specific value, justifying this choice on the basis of a systematic underestimation of what the blessed casual gamers may or may not appreciate. The novelties therefore all lie in the possibility of select a geographical ~club~ (also divided into sub-categories, see for example northern Italy, southern Italy, central Italy and the islands) and organize online challenges against people on our friends list, members of a specific club or all without distinction. Which then ~everyone~ is a big word, since the multiplayer of the game is region locked and we Europeans can at most aspire to give the Australians a lesson in style. Well, we have said that beyond the controls via Wi Remote Plus, more precise and in many ways ~different~ than those of Wii Sports, the online sector is in fact the only novelty introduced by this new edition of the casual sport for excellence. And how does it work? Mostly fine, but the speech is not that simple and there are some ears to pull. There is always the question of the past many years, of the fact that online was already implementable on Wii and of what we assume could be the net code of such an application, certainly not comparable to that of any shooter, given that the two consoles, even thousands of kilometers apart, only have to communicate the position of the players and the ball on the pitch, as well as the strength and trajectory of the shots that are made. Here, despite such a simple task on paper, there are times when tennis literally becomes unplayable due to the lag. It's not the majority of cases, let's be clear, let's say one or two games out of ten, but when it happens it's a big problem, because exiting early implies a penalty in the score and latency management translates into a real festival of the slow motion, i.e. the animation frames adapt to the data transmission speed and it seems to live an infinite replay. It is clear that for a title like this nothing less than absolute perfection would frankly be acceptable, even when we play with a person who connects to the Internet using a 14.4 Kbs modem, so we think a quick update to optimize everything is in order ; and maybe even add a pinch of variety, given that online tennis matches are limited to quick sessions consisting of a single game. Score for Tennis: 7 And then oh well, there's bowling The situation in bowling is different than in tennis. We're talking about a ~caciarone~ sport that is played live with friends while making a big mess, and which was therefore almost perfect in its original interpretation in Wii Sports. Let's be clear: perfect for messing around and having fun, but decidedly not very elaborate in its dynamics, which apparently have hardly benefited from the transition to the Wii Remote Plus. Shooting the ball on the track by rotating the wrist in various ways certainly produces a different effect , but it was the same seven years ago, and just like seven years ago it is possible to understand how the game interprets our ~typical~ input, adjust the trajectory accordingly (with the same commands) and (almost) always strike. Here too there are minigames for training, in this case ~Stella dello Spare~, ~Launcio con Slancio~ and ~Tris di Lanci~, useful for mastering the fundamental techniques, but online things take on a slightly disappointing nuance for way of the speech made at the beginning: it is one thing to play live bowling with friends, another is to challenge three other people remotely and wait for them to make their move. There is certainly more variety than tennis, thanks to the three different selectable modes (~10 Pins~, which is played in four; ~100 Pins~, which is a challenge between two; ~Obstacles on the track~, this one too challenge for two with precisely the obstacles that appear on the path of the ball), but unless you are crazy about this sport the new version will hardly convince you. Clearly the speech of the lag does not apply here, since it is always and in any case a matter of turn-based games. Finally, a few words on the technical sector and the surrounding elements. Graphics have never been one of the strengths of the Wii Sports experience and the same goes for Wii Sports Club: the game runs at 1080p and sixty frames per second, sure, but beyond that it's hard to find substantial differences from the original. There are some new stages, but in general it would have been possible to do much better than this while respecting the Mii style, for example by working on what surrounds the characters. Even the sound accompaniment, even with its moments, does not match the catchiness of the tunes of the first edition, but the question can be categorized as simple nostalgia. However, what we didn't really miss was an ~old-gen~ communication system, which not only excludes voice chat a priori (but the microphoneor the GamePad, what's he doing there?) but limits verbal interaction with the other players to three predetermined phrases, which we can personalize by hand with a few drawings by tinkering a bit. No, the male genital organs are irreparably blocked here too, and the message approval procedure takes about an hour. We are not. Vote for Bowling: 6 The advent of golf Released in conjunction with the latest Nintendo Direct, golf is automatically downloaded to Wii Sports Club and offers the same free 24-hour license for those who want to try it, evaluating the definitive purchase for 9.99 euros or choosing a timed ticket, as already seen for tennis and bowling. If in form this discipline appears very similar to the one present in the original Wii Sports, in essence the changes made by the developers are profound, starting with the role of the GamePad. The Wii U controller must in fact be positioned on the ground, as shown during the first trailers of the Nintendo console, ideally in the place where the ball should be while we are standing, Wii Plus in hand, to swing. At first, the gimmick appears futile and completely ancillary, as well as fairly dangerous for those with children at home who could involuntarily (or voluntarily!) step on the GamePad during a game. However, a few minutes are enough to realize the value of this novelty, which introduces multiple facets to the experience and therefore asks us not only to look at the TV screen while we play, but also to pay attention to the impact modalities. In fact, the ball, the end of the club and an indicator useful for understanding the direction of movement are displayed on the screen integrated into the controller, which we can correct by accurately adjusting the grip on the Wii Plus thanks to a rotation of the wrist. The device accurately detects any variation in this sense, and this leads to the second novelty of this discipline of Wii Sports Club: the difficulty. Anyone who thinks they can make ~basic~ swings, like in the original Wii Sports, is very wrong and will have bitter disappointments, given that the system adopted in this case requires great attention during the launch, beyond the traditional adjustments for the direction of the shot and the selection of the iron which must be carried out once again by acting on the directional cross. The greater complexity of the experience unfortunately translates into online matches full of waiting, with opponents who often and willingly take a long time to be able to make their move and results that in the early stages rarely reflect the commitment made and the investment in terms of playing time. Much better to fall back on local multiplayer, even if the rule of a learning curve that is anything but calibrated for casual users also applies, and which could represent a big problem in the ~customs clearance~ of this sport among the general public. The offer includes the traditional training methods to improve accuracy: ~Putt 10 e lode~ revolves precisely around the maneuver of the putt, ~Bingolfista~ sees us throw the ball on the bingo panels to score the highest possible score by completing the lines, while ~Center the target~ asks us to hit a giant target positioned on the water, in the shortest possible time. Also for golf the speech of an extremely limited and cumbersome communication system between players is valid, which is based on a few default exclamations or on drawings which however must be approved via Miiverse. However, what disappoints is the limited offer in terms of courses and holes, which apparently refers to an NES classic never released outside Japan, Famicom Golf: U.S. Course, but takes no account of the scenarios seen in Wii Sports Resort. Rating for Golf: 6.5 Punches and blows The latest pack of minigames for Wii Sports Club includes baseball and boxing, both of which are highly anticipated since they are reinterpretations of experiences that were already valid in origin. Boxing, in particular, in the first Wii Sports worked quite well with the Wii-mote and Nunchuk, especially as regards the execution of dodges, and undoubtedly offered a good level of physical activity for those wishing to keep fit and burn a few calories with the Nintendo console. Try your hand at an hour of quick dodges and quick jabs and then tell us how you are the next day, if you don't believe us. Unfortunately, boxing represents the lowest point, qualitatively speaking, of the Wii Sports Club offer. Although the minigame requires two Wii Remote Plus to be used with dignity, it does not support the Nunchuk as a second control", "date": "2014-07-04", "grade": "6.5"}
