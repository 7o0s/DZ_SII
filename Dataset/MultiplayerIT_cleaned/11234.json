{"name": "FIFA Street 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-street-3_a.html", "text": "Created in 2005 by the Canadian division of Electronic Arts, the FIFA Street series has done nothing more than translate into a video game the situations that were increasingly the protagonists of television commercials for shoes or sportswear. In fact, in these commercials, famous footballers were seen for once wearing the role of ~street player~, engaging in spectacular clashes (topped off with dribbles to the extent possible) with a series of opponents, within urban scenarios. And it was precisely this type of location that formed the backdrop to the games in the video game, with teams of four players competing for glory rather than a championship, moving on a simplified game system compared to simulations such as FIFA Soccer or PES, but equipped from spectacular actions in which the individual can really make a difference. The series landed on mobile phones almost immediately, thanks to its strong ~casual~ connotation, and produced two fairly good episodes, in which what was seen on consoles was faithfully reproduced. With FIFA Street 3, things change radically. It is not well known why, in fact, the developers of EA Mobile wanted to abandon (temporarily?) street football matches in favor of an even more ~casual~ product, made up of a collection of six different minigames in which the the protagonist must try his hand at finding the spare parts he needs to fix his broken down car, and thus reach the city where the real matches are held. We will therefore find ourselves controlling this character, always with the ball and chain, within a fairly vast scenario populated by players who organize the challenges. Just get close to one of them to access a minigame, in which you have to score a certain score to earn a bronze, silver or gold pair (only the latter, however, entitles you to a spare part for the 'car...). The tests we will have to face are very different: in one case we will find ourselves doing a sort of target practice, with an assistant who will pass us the ball and we who will have to kick it against a wall, trying to hit murals to collect points. In another case, we'll have to use the ball in a real bowling alley, where bins act as pins and the shot will have to be ~curved~ to overcome various obstacles. We will also be able to use our shots for apparently absurd purposes, such as cleaning a camper from dirt, and try our hand at dribbling sessions in which the commands are typical of rhythm games. In short, there will be trials, and every time we set a record we will soon find ourselves having to defend it against other players, using a simple interface to check the messages on our mobile phone. The game's graphics make extensive use of typically Electronic Arts-style sprites, with an almost photorealistic appearance, featuring a discrete set of animations for the number of actions but with movements that are anything but fluid. The characters are numerous, quite diversified, and move within a rather simple and bare scenario, which however extends very wide and boasts more than one moving object. The use of colors is good, and the general sensation is that of a well packaged product, which finds the usual MIDI musical accompaniment in the sound sector, which does not disturb the action but does not make it more engaging either. PRO A good number of minigames Discreet graphics Sometimes precise control system... AGAINST ...sometimes not Those waiting for a new FIFA Street will be disappointed Sound thin, as usual", "date": "2008-08-29", "grade": "S.V."}
