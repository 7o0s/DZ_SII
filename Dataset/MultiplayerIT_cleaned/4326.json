Never? Bad, because doing it is more fun than it might seem. The basic objective of Super Inefficient Golf by the Italian studio 34BigThings, evidently a post Redout divertissement, is the classic one: to put the ball in the hole within a certain number of shots, for all the eighteen holes that make up the game. The problem is that, as you will have understood, there are no clubs here, but mines. The ~Inefficient~ of the title refers precisely to the lack of orthodoxy of the shooting system, which however immediately reveals its explosive potential. Basically before each shot you have to place mines of four colors on the surface of the ball. Up to four mines of each color can be placed. The potholes become increasingly complex and surreal By making them explode, a certain force is imparted to the ball, determined by the number of exploded mines and their direction (obviously the ball is pushed in the opposite direction to the explosion); if desired, it is possible to combine mines of several colors to give a greater initial push. Despite the apparent complexity, everything works perfectly, thanks above all to the accurate physics simulation engine the game is equipped with. What makes Super Inefficient Golf particularly engaging is the possibility of blowing up the mines in the order of color you want, when you want, thus giving rise to daring experiments in terms of impossible shots. Let's give an example: let's say we want to make a shot by stopping the ball in flight in a precise point, perhaps above the hole. How to do? Just place a certain number of push mines, to give the direction, and place others in the exact opposite point of the ball, the latter to be detonated to slow it down. Similarly, do we want to make the ball change direction in flight? Simple: we place mines in the point perpendicular to the direction of the shot and make them explode at the right moment. Of course, the gameplay is not as linear as it might seem and the beauty is just understanding how to place the mines and, above all, when to detonate them to make the desired shot. It should also be considered that the mines are physically attached to the ball and therefore actually affect its rotation, both on the ground and in flight. In some cases, therefore, results are obtained that we do not hesitate to define as disastrous, with the ball ending up in unthinkable places. Paradoxically however, this is also the beauty of the game and it is precisely the most absurd situations that are the most amusing. Two additional mechanics intervene to help the player: the slowing down of time and the possibility of making the ball make small jumps on the ground. Slowing down time is to find the right moment to detonate mines when the ball is in flight. Theoretically, it can also be done at normal speed, but sometimes the rotation of the ball has a truly dizzying speed and being precise would be almost impossible. The hops, on the other hand, are used to try not to make the ball change direction in case it has mines attached, or to overcome small obstacles. In flight As we said, in total Super Inefficient Golf is made up of eighteen holes of increasing complexity, spread over a single, large setting. They are not very many and they end soon, although it must be said that perfecting them takes much longer than simply reaching the conclusion of the game, especially if you want to climb the global online rankings Ahem, hello friend ball! The first holes have a very simple morphology, but from the third onwards things start to get complicated, up to those strange and surreal mazes of platforms, fans, collapsible walls and so on that are the last holes. It is in these that another small defect of the game emerges, namely a certain confusion, which remains until their morphology has been learned to perfection. The overview of each hole, visible at the beginning and recallable at any time, helps, but the very nature of the gameplay and the few viewing options can lead to a certain disorientation. In short, a free camera would have been useful. Obviously this is a problem that disappears with experience, but at first it is very noticeable. From a graphic point of view, Super Inefficient Golf is a pleasant title, despite being stylistically anonymous. Everything is well packaged and the chosen color palette is pleasant. Sure, there's nothing to cry out for a miracle, but you couldn't expect much more from a product sold for a handful of euros.", "date": "2018-03-28", "grade": "7.5"}
