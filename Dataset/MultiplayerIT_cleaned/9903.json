Since trying to emulate the deeds of our favorite pedantic darlings is certainly not the best given the lean South African figure, why not try, pad in hand, trying to repeat the success of the national Edward in the Scottish highlands with the new edition of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11? Hyper-realistic graphics, particle effects, and immoderate polygonal counts can only sugarcoat the pill of the observation that, thanks to the magic of the Remote + Motion Plus combo, the prize for best golf simulation goes to the Nintendo Wii, in spite of the next gen and the 1080p. To try to improve an already excellent simulation feeling, but a losing force game compared to the Wii one, Electronic Arts has included a couple of new features that amplify the illusion of actually being on the green, but comfortably seated in the living room of our house. More real than real The first of these is the Focus System, which is a sort of consumable extra aid, which is activated every time we hit the ball over one hundred percent of the maximum power. The facilities are different, for example it is possible to apply a ball in flight effect, have a preview of the shot or a greater accuracy of the shot. Very cleverly, Electronic Arts has made sure that the Focus bar runs out quickly (to recharge it, simply don't use it), so you need to know how to choose carefully when to use it. This new addition does not mortify the gameplay by lowering the difficulty level, on the contrary it adds a pinch of uncertainty and extra strategy since you never know how good the next shot will be, and running out of Focus on the most difficult shot, with the wind blowing turns suddenly and with a nice bunker in the middle, it's certainly not the best. Obviously the inclusion of Focus cannot be seen as a choice from a simulation point of view, the inclusion of True Aim instead goes in this direction. Quite simply, without prejudice to the control method that remains assigned to the analog sticks, true aim practically removes all those standard visual aids of every golf game and leaves us on the green at the mercy of our eyes and our sensations. The camera is placed over the shoulders, the circle that indicates precisely where the ball will land disappears, giving way to simple indicators that indicate the point of impact in principle, the same thing for spin shots that are performed without the aid of a second aiming reticle. All of this adds to the difficulty level dramatically, and the opening bars can be downright frustrating if taken lightly, but never has immediacy been sacrificed so gleefully on the altar of realism. Luckily for us, both Focus and True Aim are abundantly explained in long tutorial sessions, both of these new features are not mandatory, but all those who really want to play simulatively must undoubtedly abandon the convenience of aids and take up the difficult path of real check. Playstation 3 trophies The game rewards the player with 24 ~visible~ and 2 secret trophies. Apart from the obvious you get all the other trophies they are quite simple to obtain as they relate to simple progression in the game, both offline and online, except for a couple more demanding ones that invite us to use both True Aim and Focus. use vs. Europe Speaking instead of what the game offers in terms of content, we are faced with roughly the same menu as last year, but with the notable addition of the Ryder Cup, or the United States against Europe tournament. Skipping the classic game modes and the eight mini-games available, the title gives us the opportunity to try a career in seventeen locations, five of which are brand new, part of the 2010 circuit and one completely invented called Highlands. The career, prince mode of the game is quite similar to that of the past year, the only notable difference is that the experience points earned through the various tournaments and challenges can be reused whenever you want, to try to vary our player's progression if inefficient choices have been made. Also completely new is the unprecedented online Team Play mode, from four to a maximum of 24 players, complete with indicators that show us the shots of the other players in real time. The Ryder Cup is instead the most important content novelty of the game. The old and new continents compete in Celtic Manor's Twenty Ten Club, up toa maximum of 4 players on the same console, with the possibility of playing alone to impersonate the other teammates as well. Interesting (or strange depending on whether you are a purist golfer) is the possibility of placing the same athlete in both the American and European teams, just to remedy the skimpy roster available, with ~only~ about 25 available athletes. From a technical point of view, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 marks some small improvements compared to the previous iteration, making everything even more photorealistic and beautiful to look at. At first sight what strikes, or rather what emerges with greater force than all the rest, is the grass of the green that moves in accordance with the wind, the same thing goes for the athletes' clothes. It is certainly not something more to tear your clothes off but the effort made by Electronic Arts to make the scene more alive and less still is certainly appreciable. As usual, the lighting that changes in real time during the day and more generally all the atmospheric effects are excellent.", "date": "2010-07-14", "grade": "8.5"}
