Which is why they exist, the musou: they are an outlet for players looking for action titles without too many pretensions. Over time, however, the genre, represented above all by the titles developed by Omega Force, has evolved into something increasingly sophisticated, especially since musou have begun to come out under important licenses such as those of Nintendo, which enjoy more careful supervision and passionate about anime tie-ins, which sell thanks to the title. All this speech serves to anticipate a statement so trivial that it seems to have become a slogan, but we can't help it because...~ this is not the usual musou ~. Indeed, after playing it for several hours, we can tell you that the latest Omega Force effort is much more Fire Emblem than Dynasty Warriors in practically every respect. It's a complicated matter, but keep reading our review of Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes if you want to know more. Three Hopes and not Three Houses Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, Shez and Claude in a combined attack In case you still have doubts about the narrative of Three Hopes, we tell you right away: it is an alternate reality to the one you met in Fire Emblem: Three Houses and, even if the first lines may seem similar, there are important differences that change the story almost immediately. Starting with the fact that the protagonist is a mercenary - or a mercenary, you can choose the gender - named Shez while Byleth, who was our counterpart in the Intelligent Systems RPG, is the Ashen Scourge, practically an antagonist. Within a couple of tutorial missions, Three Hopes throws us into the conflict for the Fdlan: the choice of the house we will support - Dimitri's Blue Lions, Claude's Golden Deer or Edelgard's Black Eagles - will profoundly change the narrative, the dialogues and the characters that we will recruit and we will be able to control in battle. In short, to get an overview, you will have to complete the game more than once, also because there are moments in which your decisions can make a difference, unlocking new missions or subplots, or determining the life or death of certain personages. The narrative is significantly different to Three Houses, and there are some gimmicks that might appear unusual to say the least, but unlike the previous Fire Emblem Warriors, which crossed characters from multiple Fire Emblems into a nonsensical story for the sheer sake of tickle the appetites of the fans, Three Hopes maintains an identity of its own and an appreciable coherence of the whole, giving voice and character to all the fighters, Shez included. Don't expect who knows what script, though. The dialogues tend to be verbose, especially the supporting ones which serve to deepen the characterization of the many characters: in this sense, those who have already played Three Houses will not discover anything really new about them, so this aspect could appear a bit repetitive , not to mention that it tends to slow down the pace of gameplay, while being necessary to improve performance on the battlefield. Which, all in all, makes sense, because Three Hopes is not a pure action. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, Hubert is still one of the best wizards The new Omega Force title, in fact, has an enormously layered RPG component that draws heavily on the dynamics of Fire Emblem as a series and Three Houses as an inspirational title. So the possibility of exploring the camps in the third person returns to talk to the various characters and access an immeasurable amount of services: from the blacksmith who upgrades and identifies weapons to the emporium where you can buy ingredients and equipment, passing through the cook who improves relationships among the diners, the diary that records history and kinematics, the manager who rewards us for the deeds accomplished simply by playing, and so on. The first hours are a continuous discovery of features that intersect each other: just like in Three Houses, in Three Hopes too we have a limited amount of time and effort that we will have to spend in the right way, deciding, for example, whether to invest it in training of the characters left behind with the levels and their classes, or in the expeditions that will help us to get to know our battlemates better. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, micromanaging units on the map is key Most of whichFurthermore, this functionality is enhanced by spending the materials found in missions or by other means. Each of them has a kind of talent tree that we will be able to progressively unlock, expanding the range of services offered and improving the combat performance of the various characters: it is an aspect that goes almost unnoticed in the first hours of the game, but the title Omega Force, especially at higher difficulty levels, it requires major micromanagement of all these resources and dynamics. Just open the profile of a random character to realize how complex the RPG component is: it's made up of stats, parameters, weapon skills, unique abilities, passives that we can learn and exchange, synergies and more. The class system induces the player to experiment with multiple combinations to improve each individual character and, fortunately, the aforementioned training functionality helps a lot in this sense, because it allows you to develop the fighters without necessarily having to repeat the missions. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, in the camp you will find the blacksmith, the cook and other services Just like Three Houses, Fire Emblem: Three Hopes also challenges us to build the perfect army. The different natures and propensities of the individual characters suggest the path they should take, but nothing prevents us from changing our minds and trying a new approach: by improving a class you learn skills that can be useful for another, or that can reinforce the weak point of a specific character. In this respect, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes did not disappoint us. Indeed, it surprised us. The strategic RPG component is very important and well structured, especially if you have a smattering of the Intelligent Systems game that inspires it. Perhaps the variety of systems may seem excessive, but the resources that mark their use help to outline the game, offering a moment of reflection and calm between one battle and another. Too much lame strategy? Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, sharing a meal will increase your support level Although influenced by the more strategic aspects of Fire Emblem, Three Hopes remains a musou in the combat system and its framework respects the canons of the genre, albeit with the necessary differences. After the initial missions that teach us how to play, we enter the real campaign which is essentially divided into chapters, represented by the territories of the Fdlan that our house is conquering. To complete a chapter you have to get to the main mission, first completing the adjacent ones on the map, and completing these preliminary missions will unlock surrounding functions and activities: for example, by conquering a territory we will unlock extra missions or dialogues with characters who will reward us with materials or equipment. Sometimes these detours require the completion of secondary objectives, so in some cases we will find ourselves repeating the missions to unlock each playable content. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, Edelgard fights wielding a huge axe It is an interesting system because it recalls the progression of some Fire Emblems of the past and promotes replayability and the search for the best strategies in the most complicated missions. In fact, once you enter the battle, Three Hopes becomes a complete musou, with the usual distribution of keys that allow you to launch combos of strong or weak attacks, hook up to enemies, control the other playable characters and so on. The first hours of the game, however, are keen to remind us that Three Hopes is first and foremost Fire Emblem and overwhelm us with tutorials that explain the many mechanics that enrich the gameplay in captions. The impression, however, is that they are a bit too many. Each character, for example, can equip up to two extra attack skills, associated with the controller's face buttons. The skills in question consume the durability of the weapon, and therefore here is another parameter to take into account, and they differ based on different characteristics such as the associated natural element - which can have different effects on enemies - or the area of action, the impact power, the speed of execution and so on. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, in this game Byleth is an antagonist known as the Ashen Scourge Three Hopes is centered around the iconic Fire Emblem weapon triangle, namely: swords > axes > spears > swords, but in this relationship it grafts all the variations introduced by the latest games in the series, and therefore magical tomes, brass knuckles, archers, flying units, even the Sigils that distinguish certain characters, giving them an edge during gyou fight them. In the first missions, the vast majority of these mechanics may seem superfluous and it is enough to stick to a minimum common sense to conquer the forts and go on the map up to the fight with the miniboss of the moment. Consider that Three Hopes also takes some bosses from Three Houses, such as the demonic beasts, which require concerted action by all the characters to break through their defenses: if at the lowest difficulties it is not so necessary to respect the ratios of power between arms, to the highest ones is absolutely imperative. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, the story is inspired by Three Houses but is all new The game, in fact, encourages the micromanagement of resources and units on the map. By pausing the game, we can check the position of allies and enemies and direct characters we are not personally controlling towards certain objectives. The system is intuitive, and it soon becomes second nature to give orders to our team or switch between characters in the blink of an eye, especially since it is possible to set some units as Assistants: in practice, two characters will become one, conferring bonuses and advantages with each other, based on the synergies and the degree of support achieved. In advanced missions, the map must be studied carefully, because there are always more obstacles and enemies to manage in a certain order, and sometimes even in a short time, otherwise Game Over will result. Three Hopes, moreover, also imports the different game modes from Three Houses, and in the Classic one, the defeated characters lose their lives forever and cannot participate in subsequent missions. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, special attacks are always spectacular In short, as you may have understood, the strategic component is almost overwhelming, but it is certainly the best aspect of a musou that manages to restore the feeling of the turn-based tactical RPG that inspires it. The combat system in and of itself, however, isn't among the best Omega Force has developed. The camera is particularly inaccurate and in the chaos of battle it often happens that collisions don't work as they should and that our characters find themselves hitting the air without good visual or audio feedback that gives the impression that they are hitting the target. Put simply, in some cases it seems to attack the air, rather than the enemy that we have passed with an animation that is too fast and that continues to take damage from behind us because the camera does not frame him even if he is hooked and suffers our shots. Musou are often very chaotic video games, but Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is sometimes even too chaotic, despite Omega Force choosing more sober effects so as not to weigh down the graphics engine. While not always maintaining the stable 30 frames, Three Hopes never slows down like Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity did, which was a title graphically better, but also marred by known problems of fluidity. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, Claude is a very good archer but you can also change his class Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is a bit bare to look at, but the compromise in question prevents the frequent occurrence of slowdowns - inevitable, but much rarer than in the past - and above all guarantees a very pleasant experience in portable mode. We played mainly like this and we did not encounter any problems, although we advise you to play with Switch in the Dock anyway to have a clearer and more diluted view of the many elements on the screen. Finally, a final note deserves the soundtrack, which incorporates the excellent songs of Three Hopes, often rearranges them and sometimes even surpasses them in epic and solemnity.", "date": "2022-06-21", "grade": "8.0"}
