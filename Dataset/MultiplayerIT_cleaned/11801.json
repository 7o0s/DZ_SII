{"name": "Race Driver: Create &amp; Race - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/race-driver-create-amp-race-recensione.html", "text": "Run Race Driver: Create & Race offers 32 original tracks on which to compete with 24 licensed cars. The races are organized in championships, to be played each time with a different car. At the beginning of the tournaments, a brief description will give you an overview of the track and some suggestions on the car you are about to drive. Each car in fact behaves in a significantly different way from the others. In addition to the difference in traction that will force you to deal with understeer and oversteer, the other parameters also come into play. Some cars will have very long braking distances, others will have less torque or acceleration. All this might seem obvious but we would like to clarify it because these are not press release features, each machine really reacts differently. Still with regard to driving, the damage system should also be mentioned. Every time you hit a wall, in addition to some shrapnel flying in the air (actually the vehicle does not suffer visible damage), some icons will flash on the bottom screen to indicate which part of the car you have damaged. Impact after impact the icons will turn yellow and then dangerously red. However, it's not just you who are on the track. You will race against seven other opponents, which we will discuss in detail later. For now, let's just point out that the game reports incorrect behavior both against other cars and for cuts on the track. Repeatedly hitting opponents, playing from the bank or completely cutting a curve, could result in a penalty flag. Continuing to commit improprieties you will run into the black flag with an obligatory stop in the pits. Create The programmers put something, you can put something. Codemaster to start has put a graphics engine really not bad. Perhaps even more could be done, but on the DS there are few driving games that can boast as graphically and fluidly as Race Driver: Create & Race. The scenarios are undoubtedly quite bare, the machines are sketchy with few polygons even if perfectly recognizable, but all this guarantees a truly impeccable fluidity of play. The most significant flaw should be noted in the visibility of the horizon. The framing is very low, the visuals are always grey, and the curves are barely seen. To take the measurements you will need to know the track and rely on the second screen with the track map which will come in handy on more than one occasion. The sound effects don't stand up to the rest, even if nothing is missing. There are the different rumbles of the cars (although not too convincing), the noises of crashes and braking, and a curious stereo surround effect that will come to life when your opponents buzz around you. Finally, the programmers have put an excellent track editor, where you can indulge your imagination. You can either draw the path using the stylus (straight lines and 90 curves) or use the pieces made available by the tool, which will allow you to create more articulated and varied paths. In addition to the road itself, you can also take care of the outline, such as inserting stands, woods and parking lots. Once you create your track you can race it with your friends near and far. The game supports all types of multiplayer games. Single-cartridge, multi-card, and online. As for the internet game you can decide to play with friends, or with strangers by means of research, and if you find worthy opponents or that you have enjoyed with you can also mark them as rivals and play them in the future. The problem with all of this is that we haven't been able to start even one online match. Evidently the game hasn't had the sales response the developers hoped for and deserved. To compete The Codemaster title really offers plenty of material to keep the player on the DS screens. In addition to the first tournament named ~World Tour~, there is an additional one to unlock (~Pro Tour~) with more aggressive enemies. But there is also a mode called with little imagination ~Simulation~. Inside you will find in addition to the free run and the time trial, the ~Challenge~ mode, which is nothing more than a series of objectives to be completed successfully. Based on your performance you will earn from one to three stars. For example, the first challenges consist of accelerating and braking in a stretch of road according to certain conditions, and completing a series of curves by slipping through all the doors. Whichever mode you are playing, by winning you will get credits, money to spend on the shop and which will satisfy both your narcissistic and creative veins. You will be able to buy decorations for the eveningsctures, or new pieces for the track editor, not to mention more championships and challenges ready to unlock. If for now we have spoken with decidedly satisfied tones about the game, we have to reduce the enthusiasm once we have gone into detail on the AI of the enemies and some choices in terms of calibration. Starting from a general evaluation we can say that the title is rather elementary to play and that it takes little time to master. Race Driver is a thousand miles away from the simulations seen on even not too recent home systems, without however becoming boring or flat. The game places itself halfway between arcade and simulation without fully realizing either of its characters. This also happens due to the artificial intelligence of the opponents, which seems to use more tricks than it would be legal to do. At first glance the cars seem to behave adequately, sometimes even engaging in some duels with each other, deepening the evaluation, however, you will notice how often the CPU takes some curves in a way that you could not do, or you will see them darting alongside you after you have kept behind for a few seconds with bumper shots. These tricks are certainly devised to make the game more exciting, but they are of little use if, when you don't make huge mistakes, you manage to keep everyone behind with little difficulty. Comment Race Driver: Create & Race is a title that deserves attention. If what you are looking for is a racing game that is varied, rich in modes and carefully made, don't be afraid to give the Codemaster product a chance. However, the game is penalized by some errors of evaluation, perhaps resulting from the portable nature of the project. Perhaps thinking of a game that must be immediate, that must not be too expensive, and that must go well in every situation, the developers have given too much leeway to the player, who can afford to make his way through the championships without too much difficulty, even grace to the fact that he can restart a race whenever he wants without any penalties. It is these oversights that prevent the game from getting higher ratings. However, once these premises have been accepted, which for players looking for something tough could be disabling, all that remains is to enjoy the results of Codemaster. Pros Lots of tracks and modes Cured in almost every aspect Fluid graphic engine Cons AI and game difficulty tending to simple The curves are not very distinguishable There is the online mode but it is as if it weren't there Race Driver: Create & Race is available for Nintendo DS. Behind this name that somewhat recalls products such as ~Gira la moda~ is actually a rather articulated driving title, with many game modes and the editor to create your own tracks. Codemaster has ventured on the Nintendo DS with a game designed specifically for the two-screen console. No conversions, no recycling, little savings and a great desire to do. To tone things down a bit, we anticipate that the game is not without flaws, even if the effort of the programmers is palpable from the first screen of the game.", "date": "2007-11-23", "grade": null}
