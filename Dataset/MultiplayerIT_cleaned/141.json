{"name": "Asphalt 3: Street Rules", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/asphalt-3-street-rules.html", "text": "The locations, scattered across the globe and divided into categories of difficulty, offer four possible competition models: ~Race~ in which you must place yourself within the top three, ~Beat'em all~ in which there is a pre-set number of opponents to to destroy, ~Cop chase~ sees you in pursuit of the race leader to be thrown off the road while saving the other competitors and finally ~Duel~, a plot of bets on overtaking. The authors have taken to heart the faithful reproduction of the cities around the world where your criminal enterprises take place, the peculiar elements of each location are not limited to the backgrounds but often influence the action itself, for example in San Francisco you will find the characteristic tram and you will have to be careful not to run into it head-on or you will have the worst! While the backdrops are designed ad hoc, the trackside graphics are represented in a vectorial manner and I expect that those phones equipped with 3D API for Java will take advantage of this. You will have little time to focus on the locations given the frenzy of the action, to distract you the policemen and TV with the helicopter will intervene if you combine it really big (you will notice it from the writing WANTED in the upper right corner of the screen which fills up), if you then skid the steering wheel you will find checkpoints at every turn, and only the nitro, which with its accelerating thrust plays a key role in winning, will be able to take you out of the way. The nitro can be recharged faster by collecting the symbol in pre-established points of the circuit and with their good offices getting rid of the other cars becomes easier both by damming them and by ramming them sideways. Everything is, so it seems, to win the first tender, given that the acquired rights are not lost from then on you can only earn in extra components, new cars available and beautiful girls in the passenger seat, the only factor that will detract from you Big bills is a possible and probable arrest by the long arm of the law. Connecting rod maniacs will find the possibility of customizing their car by replacing every piece, even the crankshaft or the ECU and the air filters, without forgetting the purely aesthetic changes (even the eye wants its part!). And since this is not an ordinary racing title, the choice of the busty and scantily dressed girl sitting next to you will also have an influence on the race by keeping the police at bay or giving that little extra sprint you were missing. PRO A flood of car and motorbike models to dream about You will customize down to the last screw You can unlock all sorts of race types, circuits, parts and beautiful women AGAINST It trudges on less powerful phones Control system a bit unnatural", "date": "2007-01-28", "grade": "S.V."}
