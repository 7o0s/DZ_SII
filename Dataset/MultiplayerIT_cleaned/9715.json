Despite not having a very original structure, its mixture of RPG elements with turn-based strategy elements, along the lines of Heroes of Might and Magic V, has managed to refresh a genre that seemed faded to most. After the first autonomous expansion, Armored Princess, which convinced everyone for the quantity and quality of the additional content, the time has come to get your hands on Crossworlds, the second addon. With Crossworlds, Katauri Interactive has opted for a very radical change of gameplay philosophy, despite the fact that the contents are similar to what has been seen in the past. The core of the package are two mini-campaigns which, apparently, act as appendices to previous episodes, given that they reproduce the protagonists. The truth is that both were designed for seasoned King's Bounty players, those who are now not attracted by frills and are looking for more challenging adventures. Champion of the arena The first mini-campaign, Champion of the Arena, strips away all the trappings of the original game and focuses on the tactical and spectacular aspects. By trappings, we mean there are no fights with minor enemies and there are no huge maps to explore. The idea is to put the player against eight gigantic bosses in an arena, in order to involve him in challenging battles that require a certain tactical acumen to be won. It is obvious that such an approach will especially appeal to those who already know the game well in its various facets and know how to get the most out of the troops. The player starts with a certain amount of resources, apparently very generous, with which to create an army or buy very powerful items. After making the necessary purchases, he can enter the arena to try to beat the boss on duty, generally very big and hard to defeat. The fighting mechanics are those well known by King's Bounty fans, but even they won't have an easy time against the super opponents, who all offer a different challenge and must be faced with intelligence (don't expect to be able to beat them by charging head on). If you win, you get huge rewards that allow you to prepare to face the next enemy. To complicate the situation, there are characters to talk to for bonuses or extra resources. Defender of the Crown The Cinemaware classic has little to do with it. The second mini-campaign of Crossworlds puts you in the role of the heroine of Armored Princess, Princess Amelie, who must achieve the title of Defender of the Crown by fighting. Also in this case the campaign is designed for more experienced players, given that all the game elements have been compacted (including the plot) and that the difficulty is set to very high values. There is no arena, but the fighting goes on non-stop and the threats are constant. There is everything that was in the first two King's Bounty and it is advisable to play the Armored Princess campaign first (included in Crossworlds, even if improved for the occasion), of which Defender of the Crown is the epilogue, to accumulate enough experience to be able to deal with this. However, despite the commitment required by the challenge, the satisfactions are not lacking and we let ourselves be carried away by the clashes, always very balanced, without effort and without ever being sorry for their repetition. More news As mentioned, Crossworlds also features an enhanced version of the Armored Princess campaign, Orcs on the March. In case you haven't played it before, now is the right time to do so, as new units, new missions and new abilities have been added. The graphics themselves have undergone some changes (don't expect who knows what though). In reality, those who have already played the original have no reason to throw themselves back into the same adventure, even if the most ardent fans will find the extra material interesting. Another notable addition is that of the editor, which will please all those who want to give shape to the adventures that stand out in their heads. It is a complete and fairly simple to use tool, of which it is impossible to give all the details. As far as the technical part is concerned, Crossworlds does not differ from its predecessors and, indeed, recycles most of its elements. It couldn't have been otherwise, also because the focus of the product is more on the gameplay than on the audio-visual virtues. However, there is no shortage of the usual nice special effects during the fights and quality accompanying music.", "date": "2010-10-21", "grade": "8.0"}
