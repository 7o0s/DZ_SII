{"name": "Saints Row: The Third", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/saints-row-the-third-la-recensione-per-switch.html", "text": "It was the now distant 2011 when Volition launched Saints Row: The Third on the market, the third iteration of its flagship franchise: that Saints Row which was so successful in America and which had been able to carve out a slice of the market even in Old World. Born as a ~caciarona~ response to GTA San Andreas in 2006, the series reaches its definitive (im) maturation with the third chapter, juggling between uninspired gameplay and a sense of taste underfoot. Especially if seen through the eyes of now quite a few years later. Probably the need for this porting to Switch was not really felt but let's take stock of the situation and understand if it is really worth returning to Stilwater or if instead it is the case to let the Saints name rot forever. A story that doesn't exist The narrative premise of Saints Row: The Third is the least interesting and original one can expect. Starting from the absurd assumption that the gang is now so famous that they have sold their brand for clothing lines, films and various merchandising, we find ourselves losing everything during a robbery that goes decidedly wrong. Following this event we will be forced to start from scratch, earning our respect and reputation again in a new city run by a number of other criminal gangs. From here a campaign about fifty missions long unfolds, which for a good half does not give a single interesting moment. Net of a turning point that gives new life to the clashes, the narrative of the game remains a beautiful and good pretext, totally superfluous and forgettable. The discourse is different as regards the design choices of a world profoundly distant from the respectability we live in today: despite the ironic vein of the title, and given our total distance from the idea of petty moralism, we are still talking about a title that mixes ignorance and misogyny, seasoned with a nice pinch of racism to a level that reaches impossible peaks even for the worst of Italian comedies, which annually muddy our cinemas. Between ~horseback~ missions of sadomasochistic slaves, little angels armed with huge sex toys and jokes full of puns, you will hardly be able not to get tired after a few hours if you have passed puberty worthily. And this is the worst moment of Saints Row: not being able to dose a strong irony that could give hilarity, but which ends up filling and turning up one's nose, due to a total directorial incapacity in amalgamating the different situations . The botched gameplay At the time of its release, Saints Row could even still manage to convince the less savvy, thanks to a crazy amount of content, able to accompany players between activities ranging from insurance fraud to property buying and selling; going through the theft of cars or the destruction of as many elements of the scenario as possible. Each of these elements contributes to building an interesting title for all lovers of the most classic open worlds, still unable to understand the drifts undertaken by Rockstar with GTA IV and, above all, the first Red Dead Redemption. A set of activities with sub-zero intellectual demand, which require nothing but the completion of simple objectives that are always clear and visible, on a map that certainly does not shine in terms of quality. What remains today is exactly the same lackluster design and a complete lack of desire for innovation. Let it be clear that these elements do not eliminate the fun that playing Saints Row can generate, but it must be clear what you are getting into. Considering that even its nature as a shooter, already not excellent at the time, is experiencing premature aging today, you will understand well how the feeling of being in your hands a fifteen year old title, as opposed to its actual eight, is absolutely more tangible than the instincts that lead us to laugh at the sadness of the game's irony. To make the fortune of the title, only a coop mode takes care of it which turns everything into the fair of the couple's breakdown, which reaches the maximum of madness in the ~Gross~ mode, the equivalent of the Hordes dear to many other titles of the last decade. Porting to Switch From a technical point of view it is impossible to think of being faced with a captivating title. The Third was the least interesting one could already expect at the time of its release: a title saved only by some sporadic clever ideas and an exaggerated amount of content. The city of the game is characterized by little character, surrounded by a series of elements that never stand out: first of all the interiors that defining anonymous would be a euphoriamysm. Where the models and animations of the main characters must be evaluated as good for the historical period of the game's release, the same cannot be said for all the other supporting characters and for general models and textures, including means of transport which, if not other, they are totally customizable as is the case for weapons. The frame rate appears fairly stable and the licensed soundtrack makes a dirty impression, net of an audio sample bordering on sufficiency. To make the situation worse, aliasing takes care of it as well as the glossy effect that different dock versions of the various titles that have arrived in these two years know.", "date": "2019-05-10", "grade": "6.5"}
