{"name": "NWN: Shadows of Undrentide - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nwn-shadows-of-undrentide-recensione.html", "text": "Our story begins here... Our adventure will start in a quiet snowy village, Hilltop. We are currently living as apprentices to an expert wizard, a dwarf named Drogan, who has been helping us all this time to improve our skills to one day become adventurers. And it seems that we will soon have the opportunity to become one, since right at the beginning, after getting to know our ~classmates~, Drogan's house will be attacked by a group of emissaries who will seriously injure our mentor and they will steal four powerful artifacts in his custody. Needless to say, the task of recovering them and bringing them back (if we wish...) to their rightful owner will be shouldered by our strong shoulders... Although it doesn't shine with originality and indeed, at times, it recalls the official NWN campaign, the story will soon manage to detach itself and evolve in an interesting way, thanks above all to the very well done and articulated dialogues, and the sensation of a more lively environment, to which our traveling companion also contributes, who will often insert himself into our discussions, adding of humor that is always welcome and even starting some discussions about specific topics or situations. The tools of the trade To positively reinforce the richness of the expansion, a series of innovations have been added in the game technical department, in the guise of five new prestige classes such as: Arcane Archer, capable of shooting lethal darts and hitting his target from unimaginable distances; Assassin, who specializes in lethal surprise attacks; Blackguard, defined by some as the antipaladin, able to summon evil minions and make use of necromantic magic; Shadowdancer, the one who commands the shadows, able to hide in them even in broad daylight and to disappear in the middle of a fight and infallible in reflexes; finally Harper Scout, a figure that recalls in part a bard and in part a ranger, a spy capable of adapting to multiple situations. I note that the use of these prestige classes is not restricted to SoU only, but you can also freely use them in the official NWN campaign or any other module you decide to play. To accompany the new ~professions~ for our characters, a large number of new talents have been included which help to further customize the characters, there are generic and specialist ones for certain classes, such as the bard who can have at his disposal a increased number of bardic songs per day and of longer duration; the monk, who will be able to launch an additional attack as long as he finds himself with enemies at a useful distance for an unarmed attack (functioning similar to stalking, of which the improved version will also be present in this expansion). There are also new skills that make it possible to create traps, haggle for better prices during trade, or the ability to dodge any attacks of opportunity that come our way. Spellcasters, whether arcane or divine in nature, will also be happy to know that more than fifty new spells have been included, ready for you to experiment with; wizards will be able to choose between two new familiars, Pseudodragon and Faerie Dragon, while rangers and druids will have the option of having the Dire Rat as an animal companion. But of course the new creatures will not only be of the friendly type, in fact you will also find the infamous Basilisks, the Formians and many others to block your way, for a total of sixteen new creatures. To complete our armament we take care of the new weapons that work similar to grenades, which will allow us to launch explosive or acid vials as a sort of long-range weapon. Along the way The SoU campaign positively surprised me, I must admit, after an initial impression that was not exactly happy, the different situations I came across, seasoned with very well written dialogues (and present to a large extent), allowed the plot to capture my attention. The moral and ethical choices that we will find ourselves facing throughout the story have contributed, together with other particular possibilities in the resolution of missions, and some dialogues or other specific situations, to making similarities with Planescape Torment possible that I didn't think could be minimally conceivable during a game session with Neverwinter Nights. Naturally I would not want my words to be misunderstood or distorted, we are certainly not on the same level as Torment, but I was very pleased to see that I was able to carry out, via dialogo, sudden actions based on some character attributes such as dexterity (those who remember or have ever tried to Torment a character with a high dexterity value will know well how we could notice npc trying to pickpocket us and catch them on the fact at the right moment, or even kill with a quick move, those who tried to raise the alarm, following the discovery of our presence, breaking their neck...), or the ability to lie, to bargain diplomatically or to intimidate, giving the player the opportunity to change his alignment without being forced to kill someone as he was forced to do in nwn to become, if desired, evil. In SoU there will be much more subtle methods to do it, but above all we will have the ability to change the same character or conception of life of our character, with the different roads at hand that can lead from legal to chaotic or vice versa ... Finally who cares about being a paladin, without renouncing to get rich shamelessly ~breaking his ethics without showing it~, well he will have to review his plans if he wants to remain a paladin, because for example trying to enter privately owned houses and locked, your alignment will descend towards chaotic; as well as looting sarcophagi in an old abandoned temple, or lying to someone or inventing non-existent stories, be it for a good or bad cause, it doesn't matter, but above all these various possibilities (I was even able as a bard to fascinate, thanks to the my musical talents, a group of scoundrels who had taken a woman hostage... in this way it was then very easy to give everyone the coup de grace... without endangering my life and that of the hostage) , will give rise to several typical RPG ideas that were sorely missed in nwn. For comparison, I would say that SoU starts at the same level as the Charwood area in NWN (the best made and characterized in my humble opinion) and slowly improves more and more in quality, after a peak in the very late stages of the game. In short, the expansion is enriched by various details that may be interesting or indifferent to newbies, as intriguing to the most assiduous role players; certainly the care that has been taken in creating role-playing bifurcations can only be appreciated and provide the player with the right tools to diversify and impersonate his adventure at will (under certain limitations of course, after all the plot is there for that). Among the possibilities offered to the player, obviously there is the faculty of being able to respond always, or almost, in order to interpret one's role naturally; despite this, we will have to know how to (and above all want to) create this role by ourselves, and go looking for situations for them, the possibility exists, just be motivated to exploit them adequately, often and willingly they will be precisely with the exploration and resolution of missions that the best opportunities for role-playing will present themselves, waiting for these to present themselves to us is not the right approach with which to start playing this title. Along the way The thing I appreciated the most was that feeling of ~mastery~ of the facts; we will set the pace for history, we will dictate the most important choices, and history, which guides us, will limit itself to this role, it will suggest the road to us, without however preventing us from making detours, not drastic but still relevant, it being understood that we will have to be ready to assume any consequences, eliminating the annoying problem of the heroic benefactor at any cost, this time we will also have the opportunity to bring out the greedy or simply chaotic side that is in us ... For example, I began my adventure as an evil neutral ranger, and during the adventure my alignment went back up to pure neutrality, and then following a couple of my personal choices and encounters that occurred throughout history, I sank as being chaotic evil, the auspicious opportunity to become a blackguard. Also from the point of view of the fights, it seems to me that a good job of balancing has been done, apart from some extreme situations that could require a few loading too many, especially if you have chosen that of the magician as your career, given that among the adventure companions in your provision does not include a pure front-line warrior, although now we will have the possibility to access their inventory and to prepare their level advancement by directing it towards one of their two favorite classes. Fortunately you will find itto finish the campaign around the thirteenth level, therefore without uber characters and stratospheric equipment required to be able to overcome the classic semi-impossible enemies; in SoU your tactical skills will count more than anything else. But while we've brought them up, let's dwell for a moment on our fellow adventurers, certainly among the most original ever seen in games of this genre: we have a thief-cleric dwarf, a sorcerer-barbarian half-orc and a kobold (yes you read it right) bard (you read it right for the second time), which as they have been inserted in the context, still manage to be plausible. They are extremely well characterized, and in many cases will be able to pleasantly surprise you, certain ~colloquial exchanges~ are truly hilarious, especially as it is easy to imagine, in case you have taken the koboldo with you. During the exploration, there were also some pleasant non-combat aspects, such as some well-thought-out riddles, traps or puzzles of various kinds, which require the use of a minimum of gray matter; nothing impossible of course, but a breath of fresh air that helps to give this expansion that sense of particularity and personality that never hurts. The scripting phase of the game was extremely well taken care of, in fact it will not be rare to be able to find, on the basis of various factors determined by the abilities of our character, footprints on the ground as traces to follow, in which naturally the rangers, druids and the barbarians are the masters being specialized in this area, but also the other classes with a little luck and some necessary skills can adapt. We will then be able to see enemies jump out of some crates, or use camouflage skills, or lure us into some trap, perhaps against barricades of crates with archers behind them (easily overcome in any case). In short, touches of class that add style to this expansion. Finally, still with regard to the chests, there will no longer be a thousand scattered around the most unthinkable places and containing treasures ranging from a gold coin to the most powerful object in the game; there will be trunks in the most normal places, such as treasuries, armories or bedrooms, where indeed we will be able to find plenty of money, weapons or objects of various kinds, but we will no longer need to destroy every single trunk or crate that will happen within range, which was becoming nothing short of frustrating in NWN. New graphic and sound horizons but not of code From a graphic point of view, obviously the engine remains the same, with its strengths and weaknesses, but the setting has undergone some excellent additions, such as the three new scenarios that will soon be appreciated after the monotony of those used in nwn . There will be a beautiful snowy scenery, always one of my favorites since IceWind Dale, from there we will end up arriving in a sunny desert and rocky expanse, and then end up with beautiful ancient ruins that will enrich the dungeons we will come across along the path. The new creatures and new VFX for spells are top notch, as is the voice acting of dialogue and sound effects, although musically there have been no notable additions, even for most of the time you will be forced into the old nwn theme music. I remind you that the game toolsets will be updated to contain all the new graphical scenarios, new game creatures etc, so for those who love to create modules, this expansion will be able to enrich their creations with new material. One of the defects to be attributed to this expansion, however, is certainly the presence of some of the usual, tedious and frustrating bugs that escape the sometimes attentive eyes, sometimes a little less, of those who try the game during its various stages of development, to eliminate some possibly presence. These bugs are absolutely not serious enough to prevent the completion of the story, but there are still a couple of quests that are impossible to solve, since after having done what is requested the action will not be recognized as carried out correctly and returning to whoever entrusted it to us it won't allow us to dismiss the mission as a success. Other strange episodes like enemies able to attack me (and hurt me) from behind walls, or enemies that ~floated~ in the air or talents that didn't work as expected certainly didn't please me, but these are borderline cases after all, and that will surely be fixed with patch 1.31.
