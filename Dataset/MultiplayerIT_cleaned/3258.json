{"name": "The Blind Prophet", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-blind-prophet-recensione.html", "text": "The Kickstarter panorama merges with the aesthetics of comics to give life to The Blind Prophet, whose review you read, a small but intriguing point-and-click video game by the French studio Ars Goetia. In a platform that has now become the scene of the most varied campaigns, including the not particularly necessary but incredibly successful one announced for The Wonderful 101, emerging and getting noticed is not such a simple feat. It can be said that Ars Goetia succeeded by a hair's breadth, slightly exceeding the target of 10 thousand euros required for development and giving life to a stylistically sophisticated experience, undoubtedly strong in a clearly recognizable imprint that owes much to artists of the caliber of Frank Miller and Mike Mignola: the choice of an expressive language such as comics, particular but not unusual (think of Borderlands or Void Bastards), gives a video game authority and uniqueness. The Blind Prophet focuses everything on this aspect: it gives it an understandable importance which, however, seems to have magnetized the efforts of the developers, leading the project to then show its side when it comes to story and gameplay. The Genesis of an Apostle The Blind Prophet offers a mature look at the point-and-click genre, thanks to a story that has its roots in both demonic temptation and the corruptibility of human beings, willing to give in to these enticements for reasons that can range from the deepest anguish to simple thirst for power. However, it does so without offering a clear discernment between good and evil, or rather, we recognize the cruel and deviant nature of what is happening but we are powerless spectators in the face of a divine justice that responds to violence with even greater violence - effectively making it very the boundary between the two conceptions is more blurred. The protagonist of our story is the Apostle Bartholomeus, one of the twelve warriors of God who, in an interval between two centuries and fifty years, is awakened and sent to a specific place on Earth to purge it of all forms of demonic corruption, eradicating the evil at the root with sword blows. After saving a girl from an attempted sexual assault in the gloomy and decadent city of Rotbork, Bartholomeus begins a hunt that will lead him to a very different outcome from those to which he has become accustomed in two thousand years as a divine avenger. If there is one thing that Ars Goetia proves to have very clear, it is the conception of how a thriving inhabited center in its own way can have fallen under demonic corruption: twenty years before the arrival of Bartholomeus, Rotbork went through a very harsh recession, the causes of which, however, are of an almost supernatural nature. Suddenly, the sea that surrounds it was emptied of any fish and for a city that has made the fish trade its main source of livelihood, it was a very hard blow, from which the inhabitants did not have the strength to recover. without work, men have fallen victim to a depression that has made them more susceptible to the lure of demons, finding in them some a refuge from their own despair and some instead an excuse to justify a violence that was already part of them. Overall, the context is quite interesting but on the practical side it offers little introspection by reducing Rotbork to a rotten town, metaphorically and otherwise, without however an environmental narrative that helps to fully convey the reasons why it finds itself reduced to this state. Wonderful to visit in its decline, it is however a place whose artistic rendering fails to convey the story behind it. On the other hand, the characterization of Bartholomeus is very appreciable: a divine herald who uses the blade by virtue of words, where the voice of God is no longer enough to redeem those who are now lost. An entity with a millenary experience, devoted to his mission, equally endowed with a biting sarcasm and a dutiful insensitivity to situations. The human supporting character, Vic, is not in depth in the same way but works well as Bartholomeus' sidekick, helping to create funny interludes which, despite everything, do not clash in the dark context of the narrative. Overall, however, even the Apostle has several shadows on which we would have liked to shed more light. The story itself is rather linear, yet characters or situations are introduced here and there which then end up in a stalemate, leaving us with a bitter taste and a feeling of incompleteness. This aspect can also be found in the active phases of the game. Point, click and solve The gameplay of The Blind Prophet is the most unequivocal there can be: the game continues on tracks that leave no room for digressions or brainy reflections as could happen in a Monkey Island. Any problem corresponds to an almost immediate solution, useful objects gather in the action area (when not in the screen itself where it stops) and have no use outside of there. The certainty of not having to wander around Rotbrok looking for inspiration, combined with the fact that very often the game doesn't let you leave the area before solving a puzzle, on the one hand it saves you unnecessary rounds; on the other, however, it makes it clear that just click on any interaction present to find the right one. In short, it is appreciable overall but occasionally out of place, pigeonholing the experience into a rigorous point, click and solve. The only exception here are the occasional more challenging puzzles, often even timed, where making the synapses work is necessary so as not to have to find repeating the same scene several times without getting to the bottom of it. In this sense, The Blind Prophet puts in place some appreciable obstacles that were worth exploiting more often. On the contrary, we find ourselves colliding with repetitive and repeated puzzles - if they can be defined as such - which seem to be subservient to the need to tell without too long interruptions. However, there are situations in which some of these are not properly explained, or their resolution is made difficult by an unclear structure that leaves the solution to chance and frustration. Or, the fluidity is broken by the fact that despite having intuited a solution, it is not possible to apply it until one has tried to interact (and failed) with the obstacle in front of one. An incomplete interactive comic We have already said it, the artistic style is without the slightest doubt the workhorse of The Blind Prophet: even in their static nature, the cartoons that punctuate the films are evocative to look at and when it comes to the city of Rotbrok as a whole, Ars Goetia's efforts to put together a setting that is visually appealing in its repulsiveness are evident. We are dealing with a finished and finished interactive comic, whose sources of inspiration are among the most authoritative in circulation: it is a pity that pages seem to be missing here and there and we are not referring to some sporadic narrative hole, but to the structure of the game in itself. The Blind Prophet features a total of six demons but an Apostle, at each coming, can face three to five and no more. A genuinely tantalizing prospect, which left room and expectation for a very welcome replay value if only it were been possible. Although the game actually allows you to face only four of the six demons available, they are always the same with each new game: the narrative scenario does not change, even in spite of the very few choices we can make. One character in particular seems to know Bartholomeus but ends up disappearing into thin air for no reason, one event in particular does not find its conclusion or in any case remains there, suspended: eventualities that suggest the team's willingness to insert more game elements , as can be seen from the further objectives of the Kickstarter campaign, unfortunately held back by the lack of funds. Ars Goetia is a team made up of only three people, it is unthinkable to attribute some shortcomings to them as one would do in cases where the game was developed with greater resources and funds, however there are aspects that should have been considered. The same absence of the Italian localization we do not feel like considering it a malus, simply because it was the intention of the developers but it could not materialize due to the lack of funds. Nevertheless, it could have at least been avoided to leave the illusion that the game would have had different paths.", "date": "2020-02-09", "grade": "6.8"}
