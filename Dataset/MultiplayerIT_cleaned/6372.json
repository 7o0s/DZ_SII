By now, in fact, the infamous enemy shifts had become unsustainable: as they followed one another, the game's missions had become increasingly long and full of opponents - as it should be, after all - and what seemed to us from the very beginning an annoying problem had turned into a real drama. A pity, because Code Name S.T.E.A.M., although not free from defects, positively convinced us. That's why, after downloading the patch, we went back to playing it and completed it for you. It's time to sum up... Code Name S.T.E.A.M. is the decidedly successful new experiment from Intelligent Systems Invaders For those who missed our hands-on a few weeks ago, let's recap: Code Name S.T.E.A.M. is the latest effort by Intelligent Systems, a subsidiary of Nintendo particularly versed in the development of strategic video games. The authors of Fire Emblem and Advance Wars do not disappoint this time either, especially in terms of setting: the game is set in the last century, but the world is different from how we know it, starting with the fact that some of the most famous live there characters of literature and folklore. Our protagonist, in fact, is Henry Flaming - protagonist of the war novel The Red Sign of Courage by Stephen Crane - and his adventure companions include personalities of the caliber of the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz or Tiger Lily from Peter Pan. Together they form the Strike Team Eliminating the Alien Menace, a team formed by Abraham Lincoln to stop an alien invasion. Does it seem absurd to you? Well, Intelligent Systems has managed to mix the cards, setting up an adventure as absurd as it is compelling, which takes players around our world, and beyond, between improbable twists, half-hearted rescues and patriotism American style. We liked the story, original and hilarious, even if the cartoonish interlude sequences could have told it in a slightly less confusing way. Code Name S.T.E.A.M. as you may have guessed, it deviates almost completely from the previous intellectual properties of the Japanese developer, and has very little Japanese. The character design, inspired by the immortal style of Jack Kirby with a pinch of Bruce Timm, recalls that of the Silver Age of American comics, and the cel shading used makes it perfectly thanks to the dark and sharp contours of the polygonal models and the care placed in the minimal details, between onomatopoeias and kinetic lines. Accompanied by an apt soundtrack, Code Name S.T.E.A.M. offers something decidedly new to the eyes of Nintendo 3DS owners. Too bad, therefore, that the same effort has not been made in the fluctuating design of the maps and enemies, a little too generic and trivial for such an original context: fortunately, the protagonists differ greatly from each other, and if the script had explored the personalities better, perhaps adding a few more jokes here and there, would have been just the icing on the cake. The 3D effect The shot over the shoulder of the controlled character offers a remarkable game of depth, taking advantage of the many obstacles and the view to put his hand on stereoscopy. In reality, the 3D effect adds very little to the gameplay, but it is valuable and we advise you to activate it. Gears of War Intelligent Systems took a big risk with Code Name S.T.E.A.M., straying from the safe paths of Japanese character design and strategic gameplay to experiment with something new and different. The game is a strategic one, yes, but at the same time it isn't: perhaps calling it a strategic third-person shooter would make more sense, given that the player controls the characters as if they were those of a third-person action game, aiming manually at enemies and by pressing a simple button to shoot in real time. The strategic component, if anything, is all in the steam that feeds the actions and movements of the S.T.E.A.M. agents. Each shift in the grid, each attack, each special ability consumes a certain amount of steam, and when it runs out of steam you can't do anything. During his turn, the player can among other things switch characters at will, alternating their actions and their movements to better deal with enemies. Steam can be used in many ways, and for example it can also be stored to execute a counterattack in real time when we will be targets during thethe enemy's turn. In this regard, we might as well underline immediately that the patch we were talking about in the introduction actually reduced the duration of enemy turns, up to halving it: the problem persists a bit, because in the more advanced missions there are so many enemies and the maps they are particularly complex, so we still wait for the opponents to move and act, perhaps hidden by the scenario while the camera limits itself to framing the empty space in front of our character. A technically understandable choice, given that the player must be able to plan his moves in advance, but something more could have been done. Code Name STEAM, among other things, is a decidedly difficult title, especially if you want to collect all the medals and coins hidden in the levels which, unfortunately, certainly don't shine for their design: the currencies in question allow you to unlock new weapons and skills, but often force you to risk your skin and expose yourself more than necessary, forcing the player to act much more strategically than usual and to choose the right team to tackle certain missions. The various characters, in fact, differ in weapons and abilities: some can heal, others can destroy certain elements of the scenario, and at the beginning of each mission only four can be chosen. Ironic but predictable, therefore, that the four Fire Emblem heroes unlockable via amiibo are the most banal of the lot. The Code Name S.T.E.A.M. it takes about twenty hours to complete, even if the player's skill affects a lot; Intelligent Systems, among other things, has well thought of implementing a nice multiplayer mode locally or via the Internet that allows you to face friends and strangers in three different types of game, namely Clean Sweep, Gold Rush and Battle A.B.E. Unfortunately it was not easy to find other players to try them thoroughly, but what little we have seen has left us with the taste of a sop developed just for, pleasant if only for the possibility of accumulating money to then spend in single player mode. Perhaps it would have been better to spend more time refining the sharper corners of what, however, is the excellent start of a new, very interesting series.", "date": "2015-05-01", "grade": "8.0"}
