We are talking about the creator of the unforgettable Suikoden series, who left Konami just before the third episode came out to found first Blue Moon Studio and then Rabbit & Bear Studio. Murayama is developing his new game after submitting it on Kickstarter and reaching the goal in just three hours. One of the stretch goals - overcome within a few weeks - also involved the development of a subsidiary title: entrusted to NatsumeAtari, the game would have served as a taste of the world of Eiyuden Chronicle, waiting for the main course, scheduled for 2023. In our review of Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising we will tell you if this appetizer turned out well, so read on. Rebuilding New Nevaeh Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising, Garou can charge his attacks The first thing you need to understand is that Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising is not and does not want to be a major game. It is a small title developed on a low budget to thank the fans and introduce them to the world of Eiyuden Chronicle and its characters. By scaling this operation, we realize that NatsumeAtari's work, in some ways, offers even more than it should have. The other thing worth noting is that Rising is not a real RPG, but a mix of genres that recalls Suikoden - in essence, the cornerstone in Murayama's career - only in some aspects and in particular in the progression of a community, called New Nevaeh, which acts as the nerve center of the whole experience. The story of Rising revolves around this town, a crossroads of merchants and explorers like the young protagonist of the game, C.J. It will be her that we will impersonate at the beginning of the adventure, but within a few hours we will also take control of Garou, an anthropomorphic kangaroo armed with a gigantic sword, and Isha, the interim mayor who is also a powerful sorceress. The narrative of Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising relies on extremely stereotyped protagonists, but the plot, which at first appears banal, becomes more interesting than expected after a few hours. It's just a pity that it is diluted by a flood of secondary missions, embellished with pleasant dialogues thanks to the flowing Italian localization and carefree atmospheres. The absolute protagonist is in fact the city of New Nevaeh, which we will rebuild little by little and see it flourish before our eyes. In fact, most of the missions serve to enlarge the community, adding new visitors, merchants and services that will come in handy in the following hours. In this sense, Rising is structured in an intelligent and balanced way: something new is continually unlocked and the city changes its appearance as a result, gratifying the player even from a more visual point of view. Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising, a boss fight The reconstruction of the city is intertwined with the progression in the gameplay. In fact, the new features cover the most GDR part of the NatsumeAtari title, encroaching on the field of metroidvania. New tools allow you to overcome previously insurmountable obstacles or to recover materials that will allow us to build new tools, in a satisfactory loop. This mechanism is also reflected in the combat system: by improving weapons and armor we will learn new techniques and maneuvers that will make the clashes a little more varied and exciting. The combat system is in fact only half successful. The implementation of an ~accessible~ mode that allows players less accustomed to action dynamics to get by in the clashes using just a couple of keys is appreciable, but the first few hours of the game are all too essential. Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising, the protagonists in a scene Unlike the future Hundred Heroes, in fact, Rising does not employ a turn-based combat system. The action is real-time and the horizontal/vertical scrolling structure is reminiscent of 2D titles such as Castlevania, Ori and Metroid. Once the entire trio of protagonists has been recruited, the player, who controls only one at a time, can exchange them at any time; by performing the exchange at the right time in the middle of a combo - which becomes automatic, by selecting the appropriate option - the entering characters inflict much more damage. Mastering this mechanic is essential especially when facing the toughest enemies or the bosses at the end of the labyrinths, usually protected by an armor which, represented by an indicator, must first be barreled down.weapons and armor, the characters acquire new abilities such as double jumps, dodging, charged attacks and so on, but, despite a certain variety of maneuvers, the combat system is still marred by approximate hitboxes, predictable patterns and too recycled enemies . An unconvincing loop Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising, Isha attacks from afar and can float The problem lies in the fact that the stale combat system weighs down the very strong repetitiveness of the gameplay. As we have said, Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising takes place entirely in the city of New Nevaeh and its surroundings, and this means that there are few explorable areas, as well as attributable to biomes that are anything but original: forests, caves, ancient ruins, snow-capped mountains and the whole repertoire of fantasy clichs. The cascade of secondary missions - often necessary to progress in the main campaign and therefore not exactly optional - forces backtracking too insistently. If it is true that with a minimum of foresight you can solve clusters of missions in a single session, the fact remains that you have to go back to the same maps over and over again in search of resources or particular enemies to defeat, and then return to the city to report. Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising, the scenarios are very colorful and full of details A fast travel system - bound to checkpoints in dungeons, but free within the confines of New Nevaeh - lightens the load of this loop somewhat, but in the long run the comings and goings become tiring and only serve to artificially prolong the duration of the game. In fact, the campaign is completed in about fifteen hours, which are still quite generous for this kind of production and it takes a few more to unlock each upgrade or content. Perfecting the save does not seem to serve to improve the future experience in Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, given that, apparently, we will only be able to import the names we have given to the protagonists' weapons and the dishes cooked in the inn.From this point of view, we must admit that Rising only partially satiates our appetite for Eiyuden Chronicle. In the game we came across a multitude of characters that we will surely see again in Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, but it was just a taste and nothing more: they are distinguished by a slightly more marked characterization and a lot of attention in the creation of the sprites. A feast for the eyes, not for the ears Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising, C.J. can leap in mid-air The other slightly more delicate question concerns the technical sector of Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising. The scenarios are very detailed, embellished with details, lighting and animations. NatsumeAtari employs a huge variety of bright and vivid colors, but if exploring this corner of the world of Eiyuden Chronicle is a real pleasure for the eyes - a little less for the ears, since the tunes are not exactly memorable - it is equally clear that the same effort was not made in the creation of the 2D sprites which, yes, are well-kept in pixel art, but not enough in the animations, often woody and awkward. Hundred Heroes should be much more refined and defined in this respect, as the few teasers published so far suggest, but it is a pity that Rising has not given us a taste of Eiyuden Chronicle in this sense too.", "date": "2022-05-11", "grade": "7.0"}
