{"name": "Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yu-gi-oh-gx-tag-force-recensione.html", "text": "One card to rule them all and in the dark bind them. The story behind the story mode of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force will probably never win any literature awards, but it still serves as the perfect excuse to give the game a rough structure. The events tell of the first day of the academy of the protagonist (an absolutely anonymous student, external to the cast of protagonists of the series), assigned to the dormitory of the Slifer Rossi due to the bad score obtained in the entrance test, the boy however - as in the more classic film American teenager - has potential and will prove it on the field by beating his classmates one after the other. The story mode is structured in days (complete with lesson times and all the rest), at the beginning of the game the school principal will briefly illustrate what the new student's obligations will be and what the aims of the academy will be, suggesting that he convey all their efforts towards the great year-end tournament which will serve to sanction who is the true and undisputed king of duels. After the brief meeting with the highest office of the academy, the protagonist will be given the opportunity to wander within the island where the school is located: however, the movement will not be free, the island will be represented in all its extension and the various reachable destinations will be indicated by a series of dots (and any icons representing the key characters, if present in that area). Once you have established your destination, you will find yourself exploring a small three-dimensional area in which you will be able to interact with the people present, mainly by speaking or challenging the students to a duel. In some particular areas of the island it will also be possible to buy decks of cards (in the same way as if you went to the newsstand) to be discarded in the hope of finding the perfect and definitive weapon. Every day at the stroke of 8:30 the player will be transported to the schoolroom to follow an important lesson on everything that gravitates around the world of Dual Monster cards, the lesson will work on par with an extended tutorial: given the vastness of the uses of the cards it is useful for the player to thoroughly learn all the possibilities that these can offer if he wants to emerge victorious from the various duels that will be proposed to him. At the end of the lesson the student will be free to go back to wandering around the island without stopping, talking to as many people as possible in order to find a feeling with some people, a feeling that will be absolutely necessary in which the Tag Battle sessions will be proposed , i.e. combat in pairs 2Vs.2. Conversations, to tell the truth, do not shine in their own light and are probably one of the least cared for aspects of the game, there will be two types of typical behaviors: the first is that of the key characters, figures present in the TV series such as Jaden, Chazz o Syrus, to which you will have the opportunity to ask something about four fixed topics (hobbies, academy, duels and rumors) and which will lead to skimpy answers that will exemplify the question's approval in a few words; the second type of conversation is instead the one with the secondary characters, absolutely accessory students who will limit themselves to guttural pseudo-sounds in response to questions. Parallel to the story mode, unfortunately Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force has very little to offer: a battle mode (which is none other than the story mode stripped of everything except the fights), a wireless multiplayer that will require two players with as many cartridges and finally the ability to access the game site to download exclusive content (special cards). Elemental hero bubbleman i choose you! The real backbone of the whole game is obviously represented by the duel phase, which can be faced both in 1vs1 and 2vs2 battles in tag mode. The duel is absolutely not bound to particular events of the game: due to the way the adventure is structured, thanks to the fact that the internal clock stops while fighting, a player could also take the psp and continue to duel with all the students at your fingertips without making even a day go by. In reality, given the complexity of using the Dual Monsters, it will be preferable to follow the lesson/tuturial program to understand how to move between the cards in your deck. And speaking precisely of the latter, the main subdivision of the cards is according to their function: magic cards, monster cards and trap cards, as well as being differentiated by color, also underline their diversity in the way (and when) in which they can be used in battle. The duel field will be represented by a grid of 2x5 rectangles (per player), where the first row can andbe occupied by monster cards in attack or defense position (for this purpose it is essential to understand the function of each card, to establish their positioning. A handy text box will however explain in detail the different effects of the card), while the second will be dedicated to the support of the cards in the first row or to the simple positioning of trap cards covered and which can be activated during the opponent's turn. Although at first glance the Dual Monster may seem more complex than the rules of any live role-playing game, the comfortable graphical interface combined with a wise choice of cards could be the perfect way to have fun during duels. Given the amount of cards in the game, the composition of the deck will be of absolute importance: although the deck can contain up to 80 cards, it will be preferable to choose a number that is close to 40, calibrating it perfectly between monster cards of each level ( the higher levels will be usable only by ~sacrificing~ cards from the lower levels), quite versatile trap cards and especially magic cards capable of getting the player out of any predicament. Also in this case Konami has been able to manage the deck management system in a more than excellent way, allowing you to arrange the cards according to some parameters such as type, power, etc. so that the player doesn't waste hours chasing the perfect deck. For the avoidance of doubt, it must be said that creating a good deck will be a job that will take up a lot of playing time and will require a good knowledge of the cards. The duel will put the two (or four) players against each other, each with 8000 life points which, once reached 0, will decree their defeat. Using the standard settings dictated by the game, the fight will be very boring in the long run, with a whole series of dead times and animations to forget, but with a little skill it will still be possible to modify the options so that the fights flow in a very fast, without getting lost in unnecessary frills and steps. Elemental hero bubbleman i choose you! Graphically Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force does not impress but probably finds its most suitable shape in the superdeformed dimension. The settings are colored and studied as if they were a gigantic work of pixel art, the characters are represented with a small body (the only differences between students are represented by the color of the uniform) and the big head, useful for identifying them in a single glance look at the identity. Completely opposite are the bad cel-shaded animations of the characters during the duels, a graphic choice for which there are no plausible reasons. On the other hand, the whole sound sector is bad, not so much for the quality of the musical tunes present in the game as for the excessive monotony and repetitiveness of the songs that are too often boring due to the length of the meetings. Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force cannot be defined as a bad game, but rather it is a good starting point. If Konami were able to broaden the gaming experience outside of the story mode, if they were able to support it with a solid story (perhaps in collaboration with the author of the comic/cartoon, who knows...) and above all if they perfected the structure of duels, then all fans of the series could be faced with a must buy. However, given the particular nature of the game, relegated mainly to lovers of the series and in the second instance to PSP owners, the game is probably worth the candle only for super enthusiasts. Pros: Definitely long lasting. Many cards present, infinite customization of the deck. Completely in Italian. Cons: In addition to the duels there is little meat in the fire. In the long run it can become tiring and monotonous. If the task of making a popular cartoon about a card game is complex, that of making a video game based on a cartoon about a card game is probably even more so. Yu-Gi-Oh, this is the name of the cartoon (and manga) born from the mind of Kazuki Takahashi, tells of a group of kids who fight with cards in a game called ~Dual Monster~. During the episodes, the stakes rise more and more for the protagonists, driven to use the Dual Monster cards in their own variant called ~Game of Shadows~ in which their own lives are in danger. The series had a vast success in Japan, America and more recently in Europe among the boys who, decks of cards in hand, began to play this game which rests its foundations on the concept that regulates the ~rock, paper and scissor~ of the oriental tradition. However, Konami did not let itself be intimidatedre from the alleged complexity of the game and decided that the PSP was the perfect console to contain all 2,400 existing cards in the spin-off of the series: Yu-Gi-Oh!
