However, this time there are no joysticks to break, but a comfortable touch control system which, moreover, only in some cases puts the number of touches in the foreground and focuses more on precision, timing and widely tested mechanics, such as those in the slingshot style that made the Angry Birds series famous. Gameplay Big Time Sports, the soccer minigame. It takes just a few minutes to frame the gameplay of Big Time Sports: once the application has started, available exclusively for Apple Arcade subscribers, you can choose whether to face the experience alone or opt for a local competitive multiplayer style ~pass and play~, thus giving life to a challenge from another era. Literally. In reality, even the single player hides an evident competitive substrate, given the presence of a global leaderboard with which to deal with at the end of each attempt. The idea should be to encourage us to do better every time, shuffling the cards so that the games are different from each other but maintaining the basic structure. Goal achieved? Not exactly. Big Time Sports, the cycling minigame. There are nine disciplines available, even if for some the functioning is similar. Basketball, football, golf and ice hockey, for example, use the same sling shot asking us to hit the target as many times as possible within a time limit, in a context that is however crowded with various obstacles that make the more complicated things. Running and cycling, on the other hand, make use of precision touches, to be carried out by interacting with the screen at the right moment and thus creating the cue necessary to ~accelerate~ and cross the finish line quickly. Finally, weight lifting, diving and trampoline jumping focus on different solutions, but in all cases there is a clear and evident problem of repetitiveness of the action. Structure and technique Ultimately, the problems of Big Time Sports lie in its excessive superficiality, in being a simple and limited casual rather than a real arcade sports, lacking a proper structure and forced to rest solely on the foundations of an impromptu competition with the ranking or with a friend. Stylistically a good job has been done, there is no doubt that visually the game is colorful and recognizable, but even there it takes little to realize the fact that, beyond some intuitions, the developers have not worked who knows how much to put together the graphics and sound of this title, both essential.", "date": "2021-03-04", "grade": "5.0"}
