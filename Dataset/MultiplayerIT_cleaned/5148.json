Certainly if the progenitor and predecessor had not existed, it would have no reason to exist, therefore we provide you with a brief summary in this introduction. Super Mario Maker, released on Wii U in September 2015, represented for many the realization of a dream: a precise and functional Super Mario Bros. editor, complete and with the possibility of sharing your creations online. Stages that could then be commented on, admired and played by the community, as well as classified both by Nintendo and by the users themselves. We will soon analyze the details common to the two productions (and not only those), but the most ambiguous and questionable feature of this pocket edition should be specified right away: Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS, this is the full title, does not allow upload your internships online. It allows them to be exchanged and played offline, a useful component that will certainly be exploited in Japan, but which without any doubt, especially in the West, cannot be compared to the diffusion guaranteed by the online service. Having said that, let's go in order: is it still worth it? So many levels to compose and disassemble, but without being able to upload them online does it really make sense? One hundred internships at Nintendo Given the limit from which it was decided to start, it was necessary to find something that could partially balance the absence of online sharing. And so Nintendo, especially the former EAD 4 team, has focused more on the offline, a weak point of the previous edition: a weak point in that case that is superficial and subordinate to the main modes, but which would have been extremely heavy if inherited from this one Nintendo 3DS edition. Thus the developers have well thought of increasing and strengthening their offer, in this case parallel and integrated with that of the editor: in fact, to unlock all the elements to be used with the latter, it is no longer necessary to use it for a long time (as happened in the past ), but you must complete the internships entered by Nintendo. Very numerous internships, about one hundred levels scattered in about twenty worlds: we are no longer precise because it matters very little, and we will immediately explain why. Although based on a high quality level design, these paths tend to be atypical rather than harmonious, to ingenuity rather than balance, in a nutshell they are consciously, deliberately different from those that characterize the traditional plumber's adventures. And precisely for this reason they are perfect for Super Mario Maker, so curious and well made that we hope they will be re-proposed - different but with similar intentions - in the next iteration. The concept of ~world~ lacks any ideal other than mere unification, so no common settings, no different soundtracks, no nothing: the developers have created a series of stages, lined up and divided into worlds, without either any progression in terms of setting, or units thematically. The difficulty curve itself is much flatter than in traditional games, starting at a higher level and increasing more slowly. There is no element in these stages alien to the editor, they are levels that, with patience and skill, users could have created too: so much so that, once completed 100%, every single path can be modified, altered and shaped via editor. Let's say 100% not by chance, because the most interesting part of these atypical internships perhaps lies precisely in the two secondary objectives, which - in the best cases - overturn both the approach and the interpretation of the level. It may happen that you have to get to the finish line without using pipes, killing all the goombas or, even more strangely, without pressing left on the d-pad. Insights and lessons These levels made in Nintendo, in addition to being appreciable in themselves, are further commendable because they introduce the player - here, we recall, also the level designer - to the exceptional nature of the individual skins. We haven't talked about it previously, but the editor allows, through the same grid and (more or less) the same objects, the use of four different engines: that of Super Mario Bros., that of Super Mario Bros. 3, that of Super Mario World and the more recent one of New Super Mario Bros. The visual differences do exist, but the most important thing is that each skin offers different power-ups and, above all, different types of interaction: playing the Nintendo stages you understand well the 'exclusivity of each episode. Super Mario World, for example, is the one with the most suitable control system for creating puzzles (possibility of throwing objects up, adding trampolines and so on), while New Super Mario Bros., equipped with polygons and wall jumping, is the one most prone to acrobatic spectacularity. Overall it is a pragmatic way of learning, decidedly more intriguing than the lessons, which in any case in Super Mario Maker 3DS prove to be pleasant and efficient: the squabbles of the pigeon Yamamura with the assistant do not stand out for their acumen (although not boring), but his indications and advice, coming from the wise minds of EAD, are really interesting. Also because theory is continually alternated with practice, the concepts gradually become more complex and compelling, and everything is optional, a feature that cannot be taken for granted given the implicit pedantry of Super Mario Maker on Wii U (in which, before unlocking all the objects of the editor, it was necessary to spend some days). The 3D effect The style adopted is in line with that of the first episode, therefore pleasant both in the chromatic choices and in the interface. The rendering of the old chapters remains more fluid and clear than in the originals - of course - and the small, imperceptible tweaks made both in the control system and in the appearance of the various Super Mario Bros. are always appreciable. Here on Nintendo 3DS it is more limited just the skin originated from the last episode, New Super Mario Bros., far too dirty and messy compared to Wii U: after all, the Nintendo 3DS hardware is several years old, and the screen is no longer up to the task. Not even 3D was exploited in any way, which in this situation perhaps would not have added much, but which still seems destined, at least in the Nintendo house, to a rapid and silent decline. Online Editors And finally we come to what should be the core of Super Mario Maker, or the editor. As initially anticipated, everything works very well, just like on Wii U: the stages are displayed through a semi-transparent grid that allows you to outline the path, as well as instinctively split it into various sections. The composition of the level, especially thanks to the touch screen, takes place in a fluent way: you take an element and place it on the screen, you can test the path at any time, and it is also possible to view Mario's trail so as to meticulously calculate the moves. Compared to the predecessor on Wii U, the objects added with the updates have been integrated from the beginning, therefore red coins, ~lifebuoys~ that bounce, and above all the checkpoint flag, the most contested absence of the first, original version. The most serious lack of this edition for Nintendo 3DS is represented by the ~Custom Mario~, or the little plumber - in the Super Mario Bros. skin - however capable of breaking blocks, usually associated with the many amiibo clothes, also unfortunately absent . A limitation, and here we enter the less successful area of the game, which compromises the use of many stages created on Wii U. It is true that the online mode does not allow you to share the levels created, but it still allows you to play those created with the 'original Super Mario Maker: however even from this point of view the experience is limited in many respects. Let's start from the most venial lack, or rather from the absence of the heaviest internships, an understandable choice given the now dated hardware of the Nintendo laptop. Let's continue with the one already mentioned, that is the elimination of the paths that require the presence of Custom Mario (and therefore of the amiibo), a choice that is really difficult to understand: perhaps there are some difficulties in terms of programming that we find it hard to imagine, as simple users however we can only be disappointed. Individual details aside, however, it is the general approach that leaves us perplexed: having completely abandoned the variety exhibited on Wii U, here it is possible to search for stages only through the difficulty level filter. You cannot rate other people's levels, nor examine other works by the same author; consequently, as you may have understood, it is also not allowed to ~follow~ someone, nor to search for a particular internship through the codes. The online is therefore not only deprived of the loading of the paths, but also of all the variables to which Super Mario Maker had become accustomed.", "date": "2016-11-30", "grade": "7.8"}
