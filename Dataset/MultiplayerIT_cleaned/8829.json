The first two chapters were definitely good games, even if not perfect. It is with a certain surprise that we learned of the release of the third chapter, also because it wasn't much talked about before the almost surprise publication close to the Christmas holidays. The first thing that catches your eye as soon as you start the game is that there is no career mode at all. The player is given the choice of nine unrelated modes, each divided into multiple races. Each victory corresponds to the unlocking of a new race and some extras, including new cars, in the same mode. That's all. The most natural choice to start playing is to participate in some races on a circuit, in order to test the control system, the sensation of speed and how the graphics engine handles collisions between the bodies with an engine still attached, very important in every Flatout that you respect. We just have to get on board one of the vehicles available immediately, distinguished by four characteristics (speed, handling, acceleration and resistance) as well as aesthetics, and choose one of the pilots. For the record, we must tell you that the latter have a purely cosmetic function and do not change the driving experience one iota. Moreover, they have three-dimensional models that defining ugly is paying them a compliment, so we can say without fear of contradiction that the developers could easily avoid inserting them by saving some resources. If you think we were too bad at judging them, read on. There is something for everyone. Finally behind the wheel Driving games are judged by the sensations they give while behind the wheel, not by the surrounding elements. From this point of view Flatout 3 is a disaster on all fronts. We had stayed at our newly started race. The engines roar, the wheels smoke and off we go! So to speak, given that after a nanosecond an opponent came upon us and we ended up flat. careless. Back on track we resume the race and... another accident. The pilot models are horrendous What a brilliant start. Since we are in good faith and it was the first race, we thought of a problem of our inexperience. Naive. Flatout 3 is pure, unmotivated chaos. A mix of slippery controls, poor legibility of the scenario and artificial intelligence at the lowest levels imaginable creates an overall experience that is frustrating and unplayable. How would you describe a successful race in which we had about thirty accidents? Simply the cars of the CPU seem to be driven by serial killers who do everything to hit us or hit their cronies. At the beginning it can also be fun to see continuous Call of Duty explosions and plates flying everywhere, but when you decide to get serious, then big problems arise and you begin to understand that you have gone too far. Is it possible that every car that tries to overtake us has to hit us? Is it possible that accidents made at laughable speed still make you lose control of the car? Is it possible that it is not humanly possible to finish a single race without someone hitting us? The most emblematic case is the speed race, one of the nine modes we were talking about earlier, which always starts with some mushroom cloud on the track. The competing vehicles are extremely fragile and explode like firecrackers as soon as they hit an obstacle. The result is that speed is seen very little, as you live with the constant fear of ending up against a low wall and seeing the vehicle turn into an artificial fire. Echoes of Flatout However, having brought order to the chaos, it is also possible to conduct a complete race. Unfortunately, other not insignificant problems soon emerge. For example, the lack of a career mode dictates that you always finish first to unlock subsequent races. All other positions are practically useless, including the second or third. The trouble is that even in the very first tracks, given the problems illustrated above, winning isn't easy. Thus, there is the risk of having to repeat a single track countless times before being able to see the light, with the frustration reaching the extreme limit when you lose on the last lap due to an unavoidable crash caused by the CPU (the most frequent example is that of an unexpected opposing car that crashes into us at high speed, causing us to go off the road). In short, what remains of the old chapters in Flatout 3? Practically nothing, one might say. The first two chapters did offer some spectacular crashes, but they were playsbile and well balanced, yes they had an arcade driving system, but it was precise and not slimy and wobbly like that of the third chapter. Yes, they had fewer modalities, but there was always a long career and, above all, no random competitions had been added just to make up the number as happened in this case. For example, the possibility of driving a big foot is not bad, but the selectable vehicles are so delicate that the difficulty is not so much hitting the barrels before the opponents (one of the objectives of the mode), as being able to get to the end without being completely destroyed. Multiplayer and graphics At this point we would gladly tell you about the multiplayer mode, but rather than tell you that it is chronically lacking in options we cannot, as we have not managed to play a single game online in more than two weeks of trying. The reason? CCV: Chronic shortage of gamers. We even tried hosting, but after an hour alone counting the vertebrae of a mouse's back, we gave up. Let's talk instead of the technical aspects that... don't shine (strange huh?!?). Although it is a game released exclusively on PC, no wonders are seen. The car models are rather bland and the tracks are not very rich in elements. The most pleasant scenarios to look at are the city ones, but one never cries out for a miracle and, above all, there is very little that is memorable. To go beyond the sufficiency is only the damage system to the cars, which however pales in comparison to that of the old Flatouts, not to mention sacred monsters such as the various racing titles of Codemasters or the Burnouts of Criterion. In short, even from a technical point of view Flatout 3 is not worth the ticket price.", "date": "2012-01-04", "grade": "4.0"}
