{"name": "Greak: Memories of Azur", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/greak-memories-of-azur-recensione-avventura-fiabesca.html", "text": "An old proverb says that unity is strength: of course, it depends on who joins, but that's almost always the case. Even in video games of course: from The Lost Vikings to the most recent Trine, there are many titles that have made cooperation between multiple heroes their cornerstone. The review of Greak: Memories of Azur, from this point of view, can only remember how the formula still works very well, even when a single player controls the protagonists. In fact, the cooperative is not necessarily needed locally or online and in fact Greak: Memories of Azur was conceived by Team17 as a solo adventure. And it's one of those you'll remember in the future too, by virtue of several features that make it a little gem. Plot: three brothers, one mission The story of Greak: Memories of Azur is as captivating as its locations The fairytale narrative of Greak: Memories of Azur was intuitive from the announcement trailer, and is repeatedly reaffirmed by anime-style movies that intersperse, but without any contrast or annoyance, the game sessions. The plot is therefore a fundamental component of the title developed by Navegante Entertainment although, it must be emphasized, it does not shine in terms of originality. The continent that also hosts the lands of Azur was once prosperous, peaceful, full of life: but then the plague came out, a disease that corrodes everything and everyone. With it also came the enemies of the peaceful Courine, or the Urlag. The balance of the world is now definitively compromised: with the Urlags advancing and conquering ever new territories, the Courines have no choice but to abandon their lands and seek their fortune elsewhere. The events of their people are intertwined with the particular mission of three brothers, Greak (who also gives its name to the game itself), Adara and Raydel. Separated by some vicissitudes of war, the three brothers must first find each other, then help the group of survivors to abandon Azur thanks to a brilliant invention: a giant airship. The first three hours of the game are dedicated to the recovery of the two brothers lost by Greak, then everyone proceeds together in completing their own story. Greak: Memories of Azur, two of the three brothers in action Naturally, as we proceed, many secrets relating to the world of Azur and the Courine people are revealed: however, the management of the narrative elements is not always well balanced. In some moments many things are said (even too many) about peoples, lands and history; in others it seems that it is essential to find certain objects and collectibles to piece together what has been left unfinished. However, all this guarantees the progressive exploration of a credible, fairy-tale and well-characterized world, like the characters who inhabit it. Gameplay: the many souls of the Courine Multiple genres meet in the gameplay of Greak: Memories of Azur Formally Greak: Memories of Azur is presented as a horizontally scrolling single player title: too simplistic a definition, which does not take into account the presence of various styles of play in the gameplay, which always work in synergy. In fact, from this point of view, the production tries to be many things together: an action game, because you often fight; a metroidvania, because you have to go back to many environments you have already seen, where some points were previously inaccessible; an RPG, because all in all the characters learn new combat moves, manage an inventory, and so on; a platformer, because there are many sessions full of platforms; and finally a puzzle game with environmental puzzles, some of which are very well thought out. All these elements coexist at the same time: and this, together with the narration and the artistic direction, should satisfy all the players a little; however, it must be taken into account that the level of difficulty is not particularly difficult but neither is it excessively simplified. You have to save often, because you die, and when that happens you also lose all the progress made up to that moment, including dialogues with NPCs. This means that you should think twice before handing Greak: Memories of Azur to a child, as they could easily become stuck after a few minutes, especially if they are unable to read on-screen directions, sometimes direct, sometimes hidden in dialogues of the characters present. In this regard, it is worth remembering that all the texts on the screen are in Italian, and that living beings (with the exception of the narrative voice, which uses English) do not speak except through balloons. The importance of team play Greak: Memories of Azur, you can swim, but at your own peril Although designed for a single playero, Greak: Memories of Azur is a constant reminder of the importance of teamwork. In fact, without learning well what each individual member of Greak's family can do, you won't go too far. Apart from the protagonist, who is good in any situation because he is very versatile, from the middle of the title onwards you will need the fundamental and indispensable support of his sister Adara and the elder Raydel to advance. At some point environmental puzzles will require them to be used simultaneously, as will boss encounters (which are as complex as they are rewarding). If Greak is sword-skilled, quick, and able to perform wall-jumping, the other two brothers aren't doing badly. The younger sister, Adara, is endowed with oracle powers - telekinetic. He can levitate for a few seconds in the air, horizontally or vertically, and fire energy projectiles. Raydel, on the other hand, is the veteran, the soldier of the situation: so not only is he perfect for hand-to-hand combat, but he can use the shield available to stop rays and dangers from certain environments. Each character is linked to a key on the directional cross of the DualSense, but it is also possible to ask the closest one to join you (R2) or you could move the whole party together by holding down L2 during the movement. The problem is that this works well if the distances are short and free of obstacles: already in the case of jumping between platforms it is commonplace to lose someone along the way. Greak: Memories of Azur, beware of enemy attacks! Very annoying is also the mechanic that imposes the game over following the death of any member of the group, even one that you were not controlling at that particular moment. In fact, it may happen that the player chooses to leave Adara aside, to explore the dungeon or the surrounding environment a little with the more versatile Greak; but if the enemies regenerate (and they do, often even without a precise logic) they can attack Adara, who will defend herself with the control of the not always performing artificial intelligence. Without going too much into specifics, because there are so many situations that we could mention, the team game of Greak: Memories of Azur is also its main problem: it almost always works, but it still requires particular attention, and when it discovers the flank it makes the frustrating adventure.", "date": "2021-08-13", "grade": "8.2"}
