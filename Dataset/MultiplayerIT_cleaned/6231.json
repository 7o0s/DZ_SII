A very good event, moreover, from the point of view of a Japanese fair which in those days still had a concrete weight, and which it is hoped will return this year to attract the interest of the top players given the record number of participants and the intend to use the entire facility of the Makuhari Messe. But let's go back to the much discussed reboot, which was presented with a trailer and the presence on stage of the key components of Ninja Theory, to seal a pact which, in the intentions of the contractors, should have led the Osaka house to win back the western public with a Dante all new. The operation was quite successful, despite the initial controversy and skepticism, but did it really meet the publisher's expectations? Or is a return to the classic Devil May Cry in the air, the series that culminated in 2008 with the fourth, excellent chapter? It may be that the Special Edition that we are about to review represents in some ways a survey aimed at enthusiasts, but we will have to wait a bit to find out the results. Let's therefore focus on what is offered by this new remaster, which beyond the cosmetic improvements (1080p and the same sixty frames per second of the original version, but in the face of the remake of many assets) also presents some filings to the gameplay, the now appreciated Turbo mode, an extra level of difficulty and the possibility to play the campaign not only as Nero and Dante, but also under the command of Vergil or the duo composed of Lady and Trish. Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition is a good way to try your hand at the latest classic episode of the series A refresher is needed The first minutes spent with Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition literally take you back in time, to a typically Japanese narrative while Nero, with headphones around his neck and demonic arm hidden by a fictitious bandage, runs towards the cathedral where he will be able to attend mass sung by the beautiful Kyrie (surrounded by Assassins! Ah, no, we were wrong). However, something unexpected happens during the ceremony: Dante drops from the ceiling and shoots the priest, triggering a furious fight with the guards and with Nero himself, who launches an attack on the unknown assassin (to him). The events then take a particular turn while remaining in the path traced by Capcom for the series, between hidden truths and terrible demons to defeat; but clearly the plot is not the strong point of the game, but rather the excellent combat system, which in the pre-Bayonetta period represented the absolute excellence for the third person action game genre. Well, playing on the normal level of difficulty, one is left a little taken aback: softened by years of much more permissive approaches and challenges that have not been received, the game over in Devil May Cry 4 arises as a concrete and frequent eventuality, especially during clashes with bosses; at least until you regain familiarity with certain mechanisms and with the dodge system, far from infallible and therefore a harbinger of a further layer of complexity. Once the first upgrades have been purchased and the alternation between weapons is understood, fortunately things begin to turn around, even if the rough edges of an exploration remain, dotted with sometimes boring backtracking and not always clear environmental puzzles. The news As always happens for remastered editions, the value of Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition changes according to the user: those who didn't play the original version in 2008 will find themselves faced with a solid, fascinating, challenging and even fairly rich product of content; while those who already know the game will have to limit themselves to reliving situations they have already seen, both in the standard campaign and using the new characters. Beyond the animated introductions and different endings, in fact, the sequence of events remains practically the same, whether you play with Nero and Dante or choose to opt for the pair of damsels, Lady and Trish, or for the very powerful Vergil. A solution that is not beautiful to look at, which leads to the cutting of many short cutscenes as an expedient to justify the different protagonist, but which makes sense when you go to deepen your knowledge with the ~new entries~. We are talking about very different approaches to gameplay: Lady has three freely selectable firearms (pair of pistols, shotgun or a devastating missile launcher complete with bayonet), which allow her to inflict damage also and above all from a distance, while Trish employs battle the lethal Sparda, with lightning-fast and lethal movements. As for Vergil, he can not only summon spiritual blades for attacks from afar, but also and above all use three distinct fighting styles, each with its own upgrades and combos, holding the legendary Yamato sword, two Force Edge blades and the Beowulf combat set, with reinforced gloves and boots that allow you to deliver devastating blows. At the end of the fair Nailed to sixty frames per second at 1080p, with all effects maxed out and loading that on PC seem to be much faster than the console versions, Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition boasts a decent ~remastering~ work, in particular as regards the characters, the effects (several things have been added under that profile) and the textures. Unfortunately, the necessary attention has not always been paid to the latter, and so we end up witnessing sequences in which decidedly poorly defined plots are framed in the foreground. It is also noted, especially in the cutscenes, a clear detachment between the improved polygonal models and the background. Wanting to delve into the performance issue in the Windows environment, the sensation is of being faced with a not very well optimized product, in the sense that the original Devil May Cry 4 reached higher frame rates on medium-low range configurations, a plus that Special Edition seems frankly unable to deliver. The strength of this edition therefore lies in a still very strong charm, in the solid gameplay (which can be made pepperier thanks to the Turbo mode) and in the extra contents, which guarantee at least two more completions of the campaign and real alternatives on the front. of the approach to combat. Thinking in terms of work, assets and opportunities, however, the final price of this remaster appears slightly high (and let's spread a pitiful veil on the packs that can be purchased to obtain the super version characters).", "date": "2015-07-03", "grade": "7.6"}
