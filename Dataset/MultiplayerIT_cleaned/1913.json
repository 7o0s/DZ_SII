{"name": "The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-elder-scrolls-morrowind.html", "text": "Welcome to the Morrowind universe Huge. There are no adjectives that better describe the work done, once again, by the developers of the American software house. From the first approach with the title, the character creation menu, the player is faced with an incredible variety and completeness of customization, which ranges from the classic RPG parameters, such as race and skill, up to others at first glance harmless, like the zodiac sign, but which acquire a precise confirmation in the evolution of our virtual alter-ego. Furthermore, for less experienced players, around twenty predefined classes have been created, as well as a sort of short questionnaire which, after having asked us a series of questions, will create the most suitable character for us. Once in the actual game, the player is provided with a small trace on how to continue the adventure, leaving him however completely free to follow the path he prefers, whether it is linked to a side tending more towards good or evil. There are many careers that you can undertake, just as there are many guilds you can join, which will have a decisive influence on the continuation of your adventure, commissioning you different missions according to your aptitudes. On closer inspection, this adds a massive replayability component to the title, enticing the player to restart the adventure with a different character, undertaking different paths that will lead him to a different evolution in the world of Morrowind. However, there are some elements that do not fully convince, one above all the combat system, which has practically not undergone any evolutions compared to the first two episodes of the series, presenting an overly simplistic structure that limits the player to pressing furiously on the button used for the attack for the entire duration of the fight, consequently limiting the feeling of involvement. To make matters even worse, a mediocre implementation of the artificial intelligence routines is added, with enemies who throw themselves at you as soon as you enter their field of vision without the slightest tactical organization, not even able to open doors and often stranding themselves behind the obstacles. On the other hand, the work done in the adaptation phase of the control system was excellent. Fundamental element, given the genre of game, is so good as to almost forget the combination mouse / keyboard used in the PC version, above all by virtue of a perfect calibration of the sensitivity of the analog stick and the effective exploitation of the high number of buttons placed available from the generous Xbox pad. A feast for the eyes As for the purely technical discourse, it is safe to bet that Morrowind will be talked about for a long time to come. The graphics sector, in fact, is certainly one of the strengths of the Bethesda title, presenting a detail which, although slightly inferior to the PC version (the lower resolution inevitably weighs, and the horizon is closer), is still able to leave the player breathless on more than one occasion. The developers have put a lot of resources into trying to recreate a world that is as believable as possible and the result is amazing. During your wanderings in the world of Morrowind you will find yourself admiring cities composed of buildings embellished with sumptuous textures, you will be amazed as you cross the evocative beautifully modeled landscapes, among other things subject to dynamically variable weather conditions, all embellished by some spine-chilling graphical effects (water in particular is done beautifully). Too bad only for a somewhat inconstant frame rate, sometimes in difficulty even in guaranteeing 30 FPS, especially within cities or in the presence of more complex structures, and for the rather woody and approximate animations of the various NPCs you will meet along your I walk. These elements, however, fail to scratch an overall impression that can only be enthusiastic. Less convincing, but still of a good standard, is the work done as regards the sound, partly penalized by a certain monotony in the musical themes, although well made, and in the effects. The latter are rather disappointing especially as regards the verses of the various creatures that you will be able to meet on your way. On the other hand, the variety and characterization of the voices that animate the numerous dialogues of the game, not localized in Italian, however, are more than good. Purists of the original do not sand they will make a problem of it, but it may be that those who do not speak English properly will be frightened by a completely native-speaker experience and it would be a shame. COMMENT Morrowind is the worthy third chapter of a saga that has now entered the history of video games. Technically impressive, especially as regards the graphics sector, it will not fail to fascinate and captivate the player with its fantastic atmospheres. Once the inevitable initial disorientation has been overcome, due above all to the enormous freedom granted and the vastness of the explorable area, particularly difficult elements especially for novice players with the genre, parting with the Bethesda title will become increasingly difficult. A highly recommended game therefore, able to give hours and hours of engaging fun, such as we have not seen, unfortunately, for a long time now. Pros: Graphically majestic Huge Well-adapted control system Cons: Outdated combat system Improveable artificial intelligence Repetitive musical accompaniment Too bad for the lack of localization in Italian It was back in 1993 when The Elder Scrolls: Arena, the first chapter of a saga destined to enter the Olympus of RPGs, made its appearance on PC screens. At first glance very similar to Ultima Underworld, both shared a first person view, rather unusual for the times, in reality it was endowed with a freedom and a vastness that the Origin title, frankly, dreamed of. Given the enormous success with audiences and critics, in 1996 the inevitable sequel peeped out, The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall, which, bugs aside, succeeded in the difficult task of offering an even more complete gaming experience, improving and enriching a structure that already appeared almost perfect. Despite the good success of this second episode as well, for many years Bethesda seemed to have forgotten about one of its most profitable franchises, until recently, in which the announcement of a third chapter hit the gaming market like an earthquake; third chapter which, among other things, would also have marked the debut of the saga on consoles, choosing as a destination, in addition to the inevitable PC, also the crusader box of mother Microsoft. Now, after 6 long years of waiting for the second chapter, The Elder Scroll: Morrowind has finally arrived among us, but I guarantee you that it was really worth the wait.", "date": "2002-11-25", "grade": null}
