The events take place in three distinct maps of the world of Tamriel, Wayrest, Falkreath and Bravil, revolve around your hero who is hired by Uther Nere, a man thirsting for revenge, and gives you the task of infiltrating the Dark Brotherhood to track down the Hearer Mother Night. The narrative structure follows the formula used in the base game: for each scene or small interlude in which you choose which path to follow and get to know the various characters, there is a match that, in case of victory, rewards you with new cards and any game titles. Each map includes two chapters each of which is divided into missions: it is possible to purchase everything in a single package for 19.99 euros or, if you only want one map, you can have it for 7.99 euros or through the coins earned in game at the price of 1,000 gold pieces each. As we already announced in the review phase of the base game, by purchasing the maps for real money you will receive the Doom Wolf mount for The Elder Scrolls Online: just go to the story mode menu for The Fall of the Dark Brotherhood and click on the ~Get code for The Elder Scrolls Online~. Contrary to the witty edge of the adventures of the main rival Hearthstone, The Fall of the Dark Brotherhood maintains the dramatic and heroic tones that characterized the Story mode of the base game. Furthermore, without revealing anything, a crossroads structure contributes to increasing its longevity in which you have the opportunity to avoid some clashes and choose others instead; however, in order to obtain all the cards, you will find yourself having to redo the adventure necessarily making a different choice. Let's go into detail trying to understand if this new story mode is limited to being an excuse to take cards or if the challenge against artificial intelligence offers clashes that are worth the ~price of the ticket~. The Fall of the Dark Brotherhood adds 40 cards and a new addition to the story mode Versatile battlefield The Elder Scrolls: Legends - Fall of the Dark Brotherhood (it's officially the expansion for a card game with the longest title) has two difficulty levels, Normal and Master: to access the second one you need to complete at least one map on Normal difficulty . Just before facing a fight we have the possibility to choose one of our previously built decks, or we can access the editor to make one on the spot, but there are also game sections in which we need to use a deck proposed by artificial intelligence. In addition, each clash has a playing field with customized rules depending on the situation and, if it is normally divided into two zones, the one on the left with no rules and the one on the right where the minions take the cover ability, in this adventure, just to give a few examples, you will find yourself fighting against the Torturer who inflicts damage on the minions in any zone you play them while, trying to obtain information at the tavern, both you and your opponent will have the support card Broken Bottles which inflicts damage on a random enemy at the start of the turn. To add depth to the gameplay and increase the difficulty of the adventure, which is already quite a challenge even at Normal level, the development team didn't just change the rules of the playing field or add support cards but, in some clashes, has added special victory or defeat conditions: in the prisons of Falkreath, to cite one of the funniest clashes, your aim is to kill a prisoner (basically a 0/3 servant) and then defeat the real opponent really represented by Prison Guards, but in the area where your target is it is not possible to summon creatures (so a deck that uses a lot of movement between lanes will have to be made) and also there is room for at most two of them. As we said, the level of difficulty of the clashes is not trivial at all, especially for those who do not have many cards to compose the decks, however at the Normal level you will be able to overcome most of the clashes with an aggressive deck. Quite another story is the Maestro mode in which the artificial intelligence has much stronger decks and almost always the right cards at the right time. For some fights you will really need a lot of tests. The prize forthe overcoming of the Normal mode, as mentioned, are the new cards, while for the Master mode there are titles to be won to put on display and powders, or rather crystals, to be able to build other cards. The arsenal for new decks Looking at the news regarding the actual cards, let's start by saying that two new skills have been added, Transform and Kill. For now these mechanics are present in a few cards but surely, in the future, with those of a possible next expansion, we will see them again. A creature with Turn becomes another creature but retains any damage taken, items, and stat changes. An example is the Little Girl who for 4 mana is a 0/2 who, at the beginning of the player's turn who summoned her, becomes a 5/5 vampire with the drain ability. The Kill ability replaces the old wording ~attacks and destroys~ but the effect is enhanced: it now activates when the creature with this characteristic destroys an enemy minion both in combat and thanks to objects or actions that cause damage to be inflicted. Each color in the game also gets a Unique Legendary: Garnag, a 5-mana 4/5 Orc with Breakthrough that while in play limits players' maximum mana to 7, is red's (there are many orc decks that are used ). Speaker Terenus, for blue, is a 10-mana 6/6 that puts a random action into your hand each time you play one. For yellow comes The Black Dragon which for 4 mana is 5/5 and immune to Deathtouch and, moreover, has Slaying: the opponent removes the copies of the slain creature that are still in the deck. Astrid, for green, is a 3-mana Nord 2/3 with Deathtouch, and as long as she's in play, causes all creatures with Deathtouch to get Kill: Put a Fulfilled Contract (an action card at cost 0 which gives one mana). For purple, Cicero the Betrayer is added, a 6-mana 1/6 card with Deathtouch that, when it kills, draws two cards and can attack allied creatures. Finally, the legendary neutral is Mother Night, a support card that costs 2 mana and that has unlimited Activations giving the opponent a 0/1 Target with Guard every time it activates, also, when 20 enemy creatures are destroyed, the opponent takes 20 damage, the active player gains 20 life, and draws up to 10 cards. The work done by the illustrators is confirmed to be of a very good level also for the cards of The Elder Scrolls: Legends The fall of the Dark Brotherhood; in particular, the drawing of Cicero the Traitor and his jester outfit brought back our memories of the Jester's Hat from the Magic: The Gathering Ice Age set. The graphical interface has undergone a useful improvement and the information messages, especially useful for new players, are displayed in a clearer and less invasive way. The audio sector continues on the wave of the basic expansion with a really good Italian dubbing, even if we feel we have to make a small note on the music that has not undergone the addition of any important audio track.", "date": "2017-04-18", "grade": "8.0"}
