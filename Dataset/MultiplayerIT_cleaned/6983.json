{"name": "SMITE", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/135398-smite-per-tutti-gli-dei.html", "text": "That of MOBAs is certainly the market that has had the most success in recent years, the result not so much of particular technical virtuosity or game design, but rather of a formula that has never been so (apparently) simple, solid and effective. First of all, they are titles able to offer virtually infinite hours of play thanks to the ability to combine individual skills with team strategies, relying on a play structure that is more accessible than one might think, topped off by the presence of dozens of different heroes, each distinguished by specific characteristics and abilities. They are also free to play and highly enjoyable even on modest PCs, expanding the potential audience to almost all PC gamers. After the appearance of the progenitor Defense of the Ancients, the boom coincided with the emergence of only two titles which over the years have brought together almost all the players, giving life to communities as numerous as they are solid and prosperous of new recruits. We are obviously talking about League of Legends and DOTA 2 (not counting the upcoming Heroes of the Storm), around which gravitate an impressive number of lesser-known productions that try in every way to share a slice of the cake. In reality, however, there seems to be very little left to share, but if there is a title that has managed to stand out, that is certainly Smite, the latest effort by Hi-Rez Studios capable of introducing interesting variations to the genre by focusing everything on the third-party view person and on a roster of heroes with guaranteed charisma. We thoroughly tested Smite, a very interesting third wheel between the giants League of Legends and DOTA 2 Third person moba After a substantial beta phase, last March Smite was finally released in its final version, now counting a fleet of 56 heroes, each equipped with a basic attack, the canonical four active or passive skills, and one or more skins to unlock as the game progresses to stand out from the crowd. Each of the characters refers to as many divinities taken from the most famous and suggestive religions, with the skills inspired by the powers narrated by tradition. For example we find Anubis and Ra for the Egyptians, Athena and Zeus for the Greeks, Thor and Odin for the Norse, but there are also Chinese, Hindu, Roman and Mayan deities, with the concrete possibility that new ones will be added in the near future . Keeping the stylistic features of the genre firmly in place, Smite, in its main mode called Conquest, offers the usual formula with two teams of 5 players each who challenge each other in order to destroy the opposing base, juggling lines constantly crossed by brawler minions controlled by the 'artificial intelligence. However, not everything remains faithful to tradition. Once the enemy lines have been eroded and the towers have been knocked down, we find a Phoenix to guard the enemy fortress, while in place of the Nexus a Minotaur or a Titan as big as ferocious, which once attacked will not hesitate to return tremendous broadsides by increasing the tension in the final moments of each match. Another change concerns the jungle, revisited and simplified in the forms with the intention of making it easier to navigate with the camera placed over your shoulder. Lacking the classic isometric view, it would have been much more difficult to move through intricate roads and bushes in search of enemies to kill to earn extra money and useful buffs. The latter, together with the towers and minions play a very important role in the economy of the match, in general more simplified than seen in other titles: gold and experience points are earned by being in the vicinity of enemies during death, including minions, with only a small percentage extra in the event of a last hit, allowing even roles such as support to earn money quite quickly to reinvest in the purchase of equipment at their base. A further facilitation comes from the possibility of leaving the task of dealing with purchases in the store to the artificial intelligence, an option that we advise you to deactivate once you become familiar with the control system and the game dynamics. Some roles, such as AD Carry, base their effectiveness precisely on the equipment chosen by the player and automated management would certainly remove a good chunk of depth from the strategic component of the title. Divine battles Once you have chosen your hero among the dozens available, with the ultimate goal of being able to create synergies between skills and plan effective team strategies, it's time to tread the battlefield. As mentioned, the basic attack and skills respect the canons of MOBAs, but in this case it is precisely the third person viewto give a new flavor to the work of the Hi-Rez Sudios guys. The camera placed behind the hero and the control system in perfect third person shooter style require the use of the mouse to direct the view and the classic WASD to move around the map. This immediately leads to a very important first consequence: to hit the enemies, in fact, it is necessary to aim, with the concrete possibility that our shots, at least at the beginning, will go disastrously empty. In LoL and DOTA 2, except for specific attacks that can miss the target if launched at the wrong time, once we click on an opponent, regardless of how we are positioned, our virtual alter ego turns in the right direction and starts the attack . In Smite, on the other hand, a certain amount of mouse and keyboard skill is required to aim quickly, move to avoid enemy shots and use skills at the right moment. In general, the fights will be more chaotic, especially due to the many minions on the screen, but also more satisfying. We will also be much more vulnerable to ganks due to the many blind spots due to the close-up camera: this requires more accurate use of the mini-map and opens up the possibility of developing more or less complex strategies to overwhelm your opponents with surprise attacks. The pace of each match is similar to that of DOTAlike, with the only difference that the initial stages are faster and more adrenaline-pumping due to the very poor defenses of the Gods, who tend to die rather easily. In addition to the Conqust mode, there are 3 vs 3 matches on a single line, Siege on two lines, and the Arena, where two teams of 5 players each compete against each other inside an amphitheater by decreasing the opponent's points for each kill made. The ability to move freely and the presence of only one line of minions makes the games extremely lively and chaotic, with ten heroes casting spells and Ultimates at each other in a confined space in a whirlwind of explosions and spells that is sometimes frustrating, but certainly fun . The Assault mode is also very interesting, where the deities are randomly assigned to the players of the two sides who will compete in a map with a single line. Recall is also disabled, so you will only return to base to respawn without the ability to make purchases in between. A solid infrastructure The great merit of the Hi-Rez Studios guys is to have worked on the creation of an online infrastructure that tries to minimize in any way all the flaws and shortcomings shown by its more famous colleagues. In fact, to have access to ranked matches and begin the climb towards the most important leagues, it is not enough to have exceeded level 30 with your account, but you must also have reached Mastery levels with different heroes, as well as having played a certain number of games without ~ragequit~ and reports. In the event of multiple reports of incorrect behavior by other players, inappropriate language or trolling, a permanent ban is finally possible. To avoid excessive imbalances in PVP, there is also a testing period for the new characters in which they can only be used in unranked matches in order to allow the developers to make any corrections to the parameters based on the results obtained by the users. In regards to the economic model, Smite is similar to League of Legends, with two currencies to use: Gems and Dai's Favor. The former are obtained by converting real money, while the latter by completing matches, with an extra profit for the first win of the day. New characters, skins and other customizations such as icons, voice packs, bizarre-looking wards and various types of boosts can be purchased in the shop. In general, everything seems to us rather balanced and ~transparent~, so as to allow anyone to enjoy the title freely without spending a euro since the purchases do not in any way affect the performance of the players on the battlefield. Technically the title offers the side to somewhat woody animations, but otherwise it defends itself well thanks to the quality of the effects and the excellent detail of the game map guaranteed by the Unreal Engine. So is Smite a game for everyone? Frankly, our advice remains to try it, whether you are a veteran looking for new combat mechanics that are certainly less tactical and more related to reflexes with the mouse and keyboard, or whether you are a novice at their first experience with a MOBA, given the full-bodied tutorial made of guided games and video very detailed explanatory. Let's be clear, DOTA 2 and League of Legends remain firmly in command thanks to a more tactical and deep experience, but Smite could be a perfect alternative for those looking for a quieter community or a passing title before making the leap to shores more complex, populated and satisfying.", "date": "2014-07-28", "grade": "8.3"}
