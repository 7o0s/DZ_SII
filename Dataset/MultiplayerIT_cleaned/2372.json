{"name": "007: The World Is Not Enough", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/007-the-world-is-not-enough_a.html", "text": "Tie-in Syndrome As often happens when you want to convert a film into a video game, you give more importance to the license obtained than to the actual game, videogame history teaches us this, starting from games inspired by Japanese cartoons such as Dragon Ball, Hokuto No Ken, Gundam and Debiruman, ending up with conversions from famous movies like Men In Black, Mask Of Zorro, The Mask, Ghostbusters and so on. Perhaps those few survivors of the massacre were Batman Returns (for Super Nintendo, the Megadrive version was awful), Batman The Movie (1989, Ocean for Amiga and C64, who remembers it) and, in recent years, the Capcom licensed two-dimensional fighting games Marvel and the wave of games, starring Spiderman, produced by Activision. Old time graphics and sound Graphically, no one expected a masterpiece, the Game Boy Color certainly can't have that color palette that makes Game Boy Advance so attractive, it won't have all those stereo channels and the ability to manage many digitized voices but surely more could have been done than what we have before our eyes: rough sprites and with a very low number of animations, ill-defined and flat backdrops, even if the colors used were undoubtedly chosen with a minimum of knowledge of chromatic combinations. However, the most annoying thing is the lack of graphic variety: the enemy sprites are very few and most of the backdrops of the same level tend to look too much alike. To those who accuse me of being too critical, I suggest you take a look at Perfect Dark and Metal Gear, obviously always in the Game Boy Color versions. Old time graphics and sound From an acoustic point of view, we have not too inspired music, highly tested sound effects but, in fact, always valid and some timid hint of vocal digitization, which never hurts on Nintendo's 8-bit laptop. Playability and longevity After having ascertained that technically speaking The World Is Not Enough is anything but irresistible, let's try to see if at least there is plenty of fun and a longevity worthy of spending a fortune on the stylus. Honestly, the game is not very short, so the longevity factor is decidedly satisfactory and a nice little trip by train may not be enough to easily solve the problem. On the other hand, the really boring game structure, a poor artificial intelligence of the enemies (some of which are stupidly too resistant or eager to follow you up to capacity, leaving you no time to fight back) and, just to be clear, the little adrenaline that 007: The World Is Not Enough manages to convey, it doesn't help much the fate of a title which, as mentioned earlier, has had little attention from the developer 2nd Productions, perhaps because it is certain that it has in its hands a license with a certain impact on the mass audience. Stay at home Agent 007.... Sorry to say, but the latest production of Electronic Arts is unlikely to leave its mark in videogame production for Game Boy Color, dotted with a huge number of masterpieces worthy of the nomination. Technically mediocre and scarcely playable, the tie-in dedicated to the film The World Is Not Enough is addressed only to the (big) fans of the famous film series and to those who are ready to close their eyes and ears for a game that with more attention ( first of all to the A.I. and to the concept), it would have been decidedly excellent. A mediocre game, ultimately. 007......in your pocket! In addition to Star Wars, one of the most popular film sagas of all time is the one where a clever, cold and (a little too much) womanizer spy continually manages to thwart the plans of the bad guy on duty, who threatens to bring death on a global scale or to subjugate the world to his feet. I still remember the first films of the series in which the well-known English spy 007 (Bond, James Bond) was played by Timothy Dalton and Sean Connery, up to the decidedly convincing (de gustibus non disputandum est) Pierce Brosnan, who for some years is now identified as James Bond. Electronic Arts, holder of the rights to famous films of the saga such as Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough, certainly could not miss the wonderful opportunity to churn out tie-ins with a barrage of their own goose that lays golden eggs (sports franchises obviously part) and in addition to a first-person shooter for Playstation 2 (inspired by the first film mentioned above) and a decidedly unconventional racing game for PSone, The World Is Not Enough is insteadenclosed in a Game Boy Color cartridge, hoping to win over the many 007 fans, owners of the famous Nintendo laptop.
