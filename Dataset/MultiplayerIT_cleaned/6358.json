Not that we needed a reminder, but a sign of the passing of time is also to note that almost twenty years have passed since the first Metal Slug and the freshness of the two-dimensional genre - we reiterate it - never wanes. It is precisely the sacred monster of SNK that the Belgians are inspired by, fishing in a media cauldron that ranges from video games to cinema to jazz music, with a comic novel tract that paints a rather bizarre picture. Guns, Gore & Cannoli is a two-dimensional shooter in the purest sense of the term and as such it is not ashamed to continuously send enemies and dangers onto the screen that hinder the passage: bosses and small levers to be operated dilute an often frenetic action, trying to close with the gameplay the watertight compartments entrusted to the narration of the product. Healthy 2D action and lots of splattered devastation for an old-fashioned shooter, but it doesn't last too long! Cannoli? Coincidentally, Vinnie arrives in town right in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, backed by a gun and a job for a mob boss to get done. The rhythm that alternates events with playful phases is intelligent, managing to transport from area to area while having fun and spraying the right strategy in pushing the player to manage the paraphernalia in the most suitable way for the situation. There are many tools of war that you will find in your progress but you will hardly use any before the second half. We are necessarily talking about the standard difficulty level, which takes its to engage in certain junctures in the final but the situations in which you will have to really exploit the arsenal are quite sporadic. Considering a decidedly low longevity - our first playthrough lasted just over three hours - it's a shame to note how the care taken in providing weapons is in vain for a good part of the adventure. But the Belgians wanted to make a light shooter and they succeeded with great dignity: the gameplay structure is based on the correct management of the available bullets and relative reload times, with a large part of the playful weight entrusted to the skill in employing the least number of cocoons possible by aiming at the head instead of the body of enemies. In this case, however, the impossibility of controlling the angle of the shot often makes it very hard to hit the crucial points, with a consequent - but very limited - sense of frustration deriving from the lack of ballistic crossing between the jump and the shot in a straight line. Nothing depressing, maybe they will insert it calmly in the after-sales phase. Shoot and learn Crazy Monkey lives up to its name by delivering a title that inserts a handful of plots, characters, supporting actors and light but stimulating environments into the chaos on the screen, with sketches that seem to come from a demented fusion between The Godfather and The Walking Dead, all accompanied from a jazzy piano in the background that goes perfectly with the splatter action on the pitch. Guns, Gore & Cannoli does not insert anything new: the set of elements convinces in its entirety, avoiding attributing the success of the project to some flash of game design. Of course, the bosses are not as epic as the SNK masterpiece which inspired the game and some platforming banality brings down the bar of ~trial & error~ satisfaction, but all in all the character design well dilutes a re-proposition of the enemies that in the long run it can be not as boring as already acquired in the patterns and therefore more easily digestible, resulting in an advancement that finds the only real obstacle in the actual number of enemies at the same time. Considering a lack of replayability unless you want to try your hand at increasing difficulties and the presence of local multiplayer for up to four players, we can lightly confirm how much Vinnie Cannoli's adventure is designed for a console user and therefore to be played with pad. Ah, maybe don't wait to find collectibles that force you to retrace your steps, there aren't any: progress cuts out entire sections that are no longer explorable in the current session, so if for some reason you are fond of a certain scheme you can replay it as much as you want just by going back to the menu and selecting it from the list.", "date": "2015-05-06", "grade": "7.5"}
