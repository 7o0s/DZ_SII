So here, after the last and very happy parenthesis with Rabbids Go Home (which hopefully does not remain an isolated case), now our ~heroes~ are back on the familiar ground of party games, with a title focused on time travel ...aboard a washing machine. A clean spatiotemporal Consistent with the mood of the franchise, this Raving Rabbids: Travel in Time is also presented in the most demented way possible: the basic idea is that the bunnies have discovered a washing machine capable of traveling through time, and that they want to exploit it to reach various historical epochs and distort some crucial events typical of the reference period. From a videogame point of view, all this translates into over 25 mini-games set between prehistory and the very distant future, passing through the age of Rome, the Middle Ages, Far West America and so on, each linked in a more or less marked to some historical or mythological fact: playing the Ubisoft product, it is therefore discovered that the rabbids caused the Titanic disaster by distracting the captain from navigation, they stole Excalibur from King Arthur, they unintentionally caused the economic crash of 1929 and more , in a succession of comic situations and really funny cutscenes and which in fact constitute one of the added values of the title compared to the thick competition of more or less similar party games. In reality, the Ubisoft developers' take on the genre is at least original and worthy of applause, and is expressed primarily in what is in all respects an interactive menu from which to select the various contents offered by the package. Immediately after the opening credits, you find yourself in the lobby of a museum, free to move your rabbit on the screen at will and direct it towards the five thematic rooms in which the minigames are housed, in turn characterized by a style appropriate to the activities that they host: therefore in the hall dedicated to flight games we will move by flying on a small plane, in the one reserved for shooters we will only use the pointer of the Remote to interact, and so on. The nice thing is that each room offers a series of small entertainments with which to pass the time between one minigame and another, or real sub-sections as happens in the main hall: from here it is in fact possible to reach the cloakroom for change the rabbids' clothes, produce some delirious choral songs in full rhythm game style, access a reduced version of Just Dance or even just go around taking advantage of some hilarious interactions of the protagonists with the various elements of the scenario. In short, especially in a multiplayer session with three other friends, it is easy to get lost in several minutes of insane fun without even having approached the first minigame yet, and this is an undoubted merit of the Ubisoft product. Let's party Paradoxically, Raving Rabbids: Travel in Time excels as regards the outline of the various minigames, but suffers a bit in the quantity and quality of the same, not always up to the situation. Mind you, the numbers are still quite substantial, but still lower than those of other exponents of the sector: the feeling is that the developers have preferred to focus on the strong characterization of the individual stages, to the detriment of their total. That said, there is plenty of irons in the fire to satisfy the appetites of any group of people willing to spend a few carefree hours with the Wii: the mini-games are divided into five categories (action, shooter, flight, racing and specific for Motion Plus) who competently rattle off all the knowledge of party gaming, offering a generally more than good variety of situations. However, some minigames suffer from an inadequate control system, and still others present themselves with concepts so absurd that they are not very easy to understand in the first few bars, a certainly not positive aspect for a title that aims at outright immediacy. Again, the loads are a bit too long, the Motion Plus support is relegated to a couple of not too exciting sections, and there is no trace of support for the Balance Board, which would have been nice if only as a complement to the conventional minigames. However, when Raving Rabbids: Travel in Time works, it does it great, guaranteeing a fun factor enhanced by the irresistible sympathy of the protagonists: thetitle also allows you to connect via Wi-Fi and play online, a welcome feature but undoubtedly not very comparable to local multiplayer, given that human interactions are an integral part of the experience of any party game. Finally, from a technical point of view, the game fully respects the tradition of the series, offering a pretty and colorful cosmetics and a sound whose high notes - it is appropriate to say it - are represented by the omnipresent shrill screams of the rabbids.", "date": "2010-12-06", "grade": "7.7"}
