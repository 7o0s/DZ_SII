{"name": "Free2Play tripla A", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/107465-tom-clancys-ghost-recon-online-free2play-tripla-a.html", "text": "A few months ago we talked about how Blacklight: Retribution was able to offer triple A title content despite being a free2play game, that is accessible for free but with paid content. Today it is Ubisoft's Ghost Recon Online that tries to raise the bar by proposing a series of features never seen before in a title of its kind, especially at a technical level. As tradition dictates, the game was first launched in beta, to then be open to all in a version considered definitive. In reality, in the free2play genre there are never definitive versions and the titles are continuously updated to keep users interested in the game and perhaps convince them to buy something for a fee. From this point of view, Ghost Recon Online does not break tradition and at launch it only has a handful of maps, with others certainly in development. Even the purchasable content is not complete, since some fields of the integrated shop are rather empty (such as boosts or helmets) and it is evident that new trinkets will be added soon. As usual there are two coins: one that can be accumulated by playing, leveling up or overcoming the various daily challenges, and the other that can be acquired by credit card. All items, except some that can only be purchased with real money (for now only the multiplier of experience points and game money), have two different prices, one for each type of currency. The game currency price is always higher than the real money price. Among the purchasable items there is no shortage of various weapons, different for each of the classes, bulletproof vests better than the standard ones, grenades, but also special equipment which we will discuss shortly and grafts to improve the equipment without changing it. In short, up to here there is nothing different from a thousand other free2play. Now we just have to get into the game. Classes The first fundamental choice to make is that of the class. There are three of them: Assault, the cannon fodder always on the front line, excellent for medium and short-range shooting; the Recon, or the lord of surprise attacks and precision weapons; and the Specialist, equipped with the best technologies to support the team. Unfortunately, during the first three weeks of the game there were some unpleasantness that made certain games particularly painful, i.e. the players clearly favored the Recon over the other classes. The contests, full of snipers, have always ended in stalemate with battles only fought from long range and with the other classes disadvantaged by the presence of so many invisible enemies. Fortunately, the situation has improved slightly over the days, even if the temptation to focus only on the sniper rifle to collect easy points is still far too widespread (many players have also protested on the game's official forum, asking that the matchmaking automatically imposes a cap on Recons per squad). In short, said in more technical jargon, many maps are battles between campers, despite the effort made by the developers to mitigate the phenomenon, such as the immediate identification of who has made a killing and a scanner, called Oracle, which from time to time reveals the position of the players. Land of conquest Starting from these first considerations, let's see how the gameplay works. Ghost Recon Online is a third-person tactical shooter that puts the usual elite soldier at the controls. For now, two modes have been implemented, Assault and Conquest, both of which require you to capture control points, but while in Assault one team defends and the other attacks, in Conquest both teams compete for points on the map and must defend and attack at the same time. There are four maps launched with the game: Chertanovo LZ, a Conquest map with an urban setting; Shearwater 51, an Assault map set on an oil rig; Korolyov Towers, an Assault map set in buildings under construction; and finally Markov Station, a Conquest map set in a subway station. The game mechanics are a mix between a pure tactical shooter and a more traditional one. Don't expect the rigor of the old Counter Strike, but neither the speed of an Unreal Tournament or a Quake 3. Let's say that the game is designed for everyone and has a whole series of features that allow even the poorest player to score a few points, so as not to displease anyone. Basically, a cover system is used that is very reminiscent of any Gears of War, a mechanic that translates into the player having to advance very slowly, passing betweento cover and the other, in order to avoid the shots of the enemies in position and not to find themselves in the open because of some scripted animation that takes away control of the character, albeit for brief moments. Direct clashes are rare and are decided, rather than by the skill of the players, by other factors: the most important of which is the equipment. A well-equipped high-level soldier is harder to take down than a first-level one with basic equipment, both for damage caused by weapons, but also for damage absorbed by their armored vests. This translates into an urgent need to have the best equipment, so you can compete with others. This is where the free2play mechanics come into play: all the equipment can be purchased with the game currency, but the accumulation of the same is very slow, therefore, to hurry up and not always find yourself in the dust, the temptation to spend real money comes naturally and grows steadily. Nothing wrong, somehow they'll have to try to make money on it. The price to pay Paradoxically, the gratuity of free2play always has a price in terms of game mechanics. As we have already said, Ghost Recon Online does everything possible not to leave players behind, even the poorest ones, also awarding points for indecent performance. But it's not just this. A lot of design elements seem to be made to favor mediocre players. For example, every possibility of applying one's skill to the game is frustrated by small expedients that force the action to always be slowed down. The run & gun techniques have been rendered almost totally useless, which wouldn't even be a bad thing in a tactical shooter, if however the campers hadn't been favored in every possible and imaginable way. A series of gadgets have also been included that really allow anyone to do some kills, such as a barrier that makes you invincible for a few seconds, an almost total invisibility that allows you to get behind an enemy safely or a shield that allows unstoppable charges . Sure, each of these ~powers~ has a counter-move, but you aren't always in a position to execute it. For example, a charge can be stopped with a well-placed grenade, provided you are ready to throw one at the right point in the very short time available (often fractions of a second). Above all, grenades must be had, since they are expensive and you can carry very few with you. It is genuinely frustrating to see the capture of a control point vanish because the enemy team entered the area protected by an impassable barrier that allowed them to make an undisturbed massacre, just as it is frustrating to see a well-conducted action by any another trinket that gives no escape. Mechanics to review Another significant problem, which the developers must try to fix quickly, is the already reported excessive number of Recons in the maps. Now, is it ever possible that in teams of eight players six or, sometimes, seven members are snipers? When this happens, not too rarely, the games become frustrating for the other classes. Either because you die continuously against enemies who strike from unbridgeable distances or because often there is no attack and no defense, but only people who shoot at each other standing motionless behind cover for whole minutes. Thus it happens that some captures occur due to players who are only interested in accumulating points with various headshots without caring in the least about what the purpose of the game should be. The prevalence of Recon also brings another problem, which is actually more due to the attitude of the players in general than the game itself. It is assumed that Ghost Recon Online is a tactical shooter, i.e. that it favors team play over individual actions. Surely it was thought so, but in servers, despite the possibility of creating Fireteams and some advantages for those who act in concert with others, there is a great disinterest in collaborating. It may be that free2play really attracts anyone, as demonstrated by Team Fortress 2, but there is no doubt that many of the excellent features of the Ubisoft title are nullified by user behavior. Perhaps for future updates, it would be appropriate to think of higher penalties for individualists and more substantial bonuses for those who play as a team. Only in this way will Ghost Recon Online be able to give its best.", "date": "2012-08-29", "grade": "6.4"}
