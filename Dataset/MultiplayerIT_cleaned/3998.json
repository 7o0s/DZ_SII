In a riot of dunks, alley-oops and hard tackles, and in defiance of the most elementary laws of physics, NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 sends football fans back to wedges in the center of the field for a two-way ball with a very different flavor than the usual ones NBA 2K titles. As someone will recall, the release of this new chapter was postponed at the last moment, from the spring period to the autumn window, precisely by virtue of the new collaboration agreement signed between the American developers and the subsidiary label of Take Two, made official on last July. Will Saber Interactive have succeeded in improving the potential of the previous episode? Let's find out in our review. Arcade gameplay to the nth degree Exactly as we wrote in the review of the first chapter, setting foot on the fields of NBA Playgrounds could not fail to bring back memories of the countless game sessions spent on great arcade classics such as NBA Jam and NBA Street. With NBA 2K Playgrounds 2, Saber Interactive has done nothing but extend the amount of content offered to players, providing ten new playgrounds on which to perform and a starting roster doubled, now made up of 300 basketball players belonging to various eras. Legends include players who have shaped the history of the game, the likes of ~His Airness~, Oscar Robertson, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Magic Jonhson, alongside the various LBJs, Curry, Harden and Durant who ignite the contemporary crowds. We also point out the presence of new special moves and various cosmetic customizations for your team members. As those who have been able to put their hand to the previous chapter will remember, Playgrounds is a game without many frills, but in spite of appearances it requires you to apply yourself to master all the possible attack options properly, especially if you want to try to set up alley-oop combined, or maybe ringing feints and counter-feints and then performing a fadeaway shot in retreat. This is even more true for those who - like myself - have by now settled game times and shooting and tackling mechanics of an NBA 2K19 or previous iterations. It takes a moment to get your bearings, but once you've taken the measurements, the show is guaranteed. The management of stamina takes care of adding further spice to each game, especially during the delusional defensive phases. And then there are the already known random power-ups that can be activated several times during the match, such as the dunk points multiplier or the ice fixed on one's basket to prevent opponents from scoring for three possessions. If exploited properly, these factors can lead to real reversals in the score, often leaving the result in the balance until the final moments. But on the pitches of NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 you can also play dirty, literally slap your marker in the offensive phase, or vice versa, make fun of the opponent by treacherously pushing him from behind to steal the ball from him without much compliments. No, no referee will bother to whistle a nice flagrant here, you can rest assured. Even during dunks it is possible to intervene just enough to prevent the opponent from violating the basket, to then conquer the rebound with agility and quickly restart on the break. Among the selectable game modes it is now possible to lean towards the complete season, which plans to qualify for the playoffs and reach the NBA Finals with great fanfare. Alternatively, it is possible to opt for the fun contest of the three-point shot, where the regularity in managing the shot becomes crucial to bring home the victory. Thanks to the presence of four difficulty levels, which can be selected during offline battles, the level of challenge is certainly not lacking, but the most competitive can still throw themselves headlong into the frenetic 1-on-1 online matches. Alternatively, it is possible to opt for the equally fun co-op mode alongside a friend. The other winning point of NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 undoubtedly concerns the nice caricatured reproduction of the champions brought onto the field, which is supported by a simple but very colorful graphic frame and by music well contextualized with the NBA basketball environments, albeit a little too repetitive. An Achilles heel called microtransactions If the NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 review stopped here, the vote at the bottom of the piece would certainly beor higher. Unfortunately, the introduction of microtransactions ends up debasing the nature of the product. On the other hand, in recent years 2K has continued to go down the road of monetization, in spite of the strong discontent generated in the most passionate community, so the choice does not surprise us. Nonetheless, in an arcade context like the one being brought back to life by Saber Interactive, it is clear that buying packs of players for real money appears to be a less than optimal solution, especially if this approach negatively affects tempo required to access all players on the roster through normal game progression. In short, unlike what happened in NBA Playgrounds, where player stickers could only be obtained by accumulating experience points and increasing one's personal level, this time one must necessarily come to terms with a reality that is diametrically polar opposite. NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 therefore offers two different types of currency. On the one hand, the Baller Bucks, who cannot be forfeited by participating in both offline and online gaming competitions; on the other hand, the Golden Bucks, which derive only a minimal percentage from the results obtained on the field and are mostly linked to the purchase of packages in exchange for hard cash. In essence, the criterion embraced by Saber is the same used for some time in the other titles related to the NBA 2K brand. Leaving aside the age-old criticisms on the presence of microtransactions in a product not offered in free-to-play format for a moment, in this specific case their presence causes an unpleasant imbalance in the game balance. Just consider that you need at least 5000 Baller Bucks to take home a gold package with the most famous players. Figure that, to be obtained, requires to win several games. If we add to this that the presence of duplicates - already frequent in the early stages - tends to become more and more assiduous with the expansion of the roster, trying to gain the most famous players in a reasonable time is definitely out of the question. Here then is that the simplest viaticum, in the eyes of the less circumspect user (or the less patient one) will be precisely to invest real money to immediately access all the stickers currently made available by the developers.", "date": "2018-10-22", "grade": "7.0"}
