{"name": "Sniper Ghost Warrior", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/96598-sniper-ghost-warrior-cecchini-fantasmi.html", "text": "Despite the certainly not exciting reviews, Sniper Ghost Warrior for PC and Xbox 360 has managed to carve out its own space within the vast and varied world of military-style first-person shooters, due to its unique style and the type of character played for most of the campaign, that is, a sharpshooter. It should therefore come as no surprise if the PlayStation 3 version, released a few months after that of the other two platforms mentioned, also managed, according to the estimates presented by the distributor Namco Bandai, to remain for some time in the top ten best-selling games of the April- May 2011. Even maintaining, for the second consecutive week since its launch, its position in the standings as confirmed even by GfK, the fourth market research company in the world. Specifically, these results will probably have been influenced by the many additions made by the developers specifically for this edition, starting with the implementation already in the code of those elements that had previously been released in the form of patches to fix some gameplay bugs, in addition to the addition of unpublished content such as two new sniper rifles, the M200 Intervention and the L96 model, currently used by the British army's sniper units. Then of three new missions for the single player, aesthetic improvements, new maps and new multiplayer mode, and the hardcore mode to play without graphical interfaces and make the gaming experience more and more complex. But let's go into detail. Coup d'etat The game developed by City Interactive tells of a coup that took place in Latin America carried out by the despotic General Vasquez. His army of mercenaries has taken control of the command posts and the population is in chaos. As Delta Force Sergeant Tyler Wells the player is tasked with joining forces with a commando and infiltrating enemy territory. This is broadly the initial incipit of a shooter which, unlike most games in the genre, usually focused on assault bases, focuses on a mix of stealth actions and reasoned shootings. And precisely for these reasons it is not a game for everyone: those looking for an FPS full of action and dynamism, we say it right away, would do well to look elsewhere. The main campaign is divided into various acts and missions, almost all related to pure sniping: the traditional shooter sections present in the PC/Xbox 360 editions, in fact, which had been inserted by the developers just to break up the slow pace of the main stages, editor's memoirs here appear to have been if not entirely eliminated at least heavily reduced in number, and replaced by film clips. To be clear, if in the past the player could play multiple roles in certain missions and therefore experience the different points of view of the same firsthand, now we almost always have the single one of Wells, with the other phases experienced only through cut scenes. The approach to each assignment, and to the objective of the level, however remains in all cases quite free and full of variations, because the user can act and behave as he sees fit. The important thing is not to get caught. To do this, take into consideration a bar located at the bottom of the screen which serves to indicate whether the nearby enemy is totally unaware of the presence of the character. If this indicator fills up it means that the opponents are alert or even, when full, that they have sighted the danger. In the silent jungle Patience, strategy, in these cases are in Sniper: Ghost Warrior the fundamental element of a gameplay in which one must act only and exclusively after having carried out a careful analysis of the game map and having found the best point from where to stationing and killing more or less undisturbed, the putschists. But not only. Other factors that should not be underestimated are the direction of the wind, the type of rifle adopted, the movement or distance of the target, the location of the soldiers in the area and the state of stress of the character. The latter is monitored by a special indicator that appears when you look into the viewfinder of the sniper rifle: it monitors the heartbeats of the character, and the more they are accelerated, the greater the risk that the shot will then be inaccurate. To help yourself in these situations, you can concentrate by holding down a special key in order to slow down the swaying of the weapon. A bit like in Call of Duty or Battlefield. Once fired, if the shot is particularly accurate, a scripted sequence starts in which the trajectory of the bullet is followed by the game camera until it reachesbody of the target, usually the victim's head, which opens on impact in a realistic stream of blood that shoots into the air. If, on the other hand, you make a mistake or alarm your enemies, it's better to try to escape and find a safe shelter. Because if it is true that the coup plotters often have behaviors that we would dare to define as random at an artificial intelligence level (sometimes the mercenaries react following a certain logic, others behave like the most idiotic of idiots), it is equally true that when they decide they have to out of the threat, they become infallible snipers and equipped with an almost bionic eye capable of identifying the enemy anywhere. If you are injured, you can still try to regenerate the health bar through the use of the classic medikits usually scattered here and there throughout the playing area. Playstation 3 trophies Sniper: Ghost Warrior offers 32 Trophies divided as follows: 14 Bronze, 12 Silver, 5 Gold and 1 Platinum. To obtain them you have to divide yourself between the off and online game and the various modes, for example, in the case of the campaign, completing the various acts or individual missions, perhaps satisfying some specific requests such as in the level ~The hunt for the last~, where to get the silver must be completed without firing more than ten shots. Online and graphics Sniper: Ghost Warrior also provides the user with a section dedicated to online gaming, available on average for up to twelve players. It limits itself to offering a few options and from a certain point of view, given the nature of the product which does not include frenetic shootings, perhaps it is for the best. Aside from leaderboards that display on-the-go stats like number of consecutive kills or killpoints acquired, there are four modes ranging from the traditional Solo or Team Deathmatch, to Capture the Flag to the original V.I.P. The latter works like this: a player is labeled as such, becoming the living target of the other participants in the challenge. When the ~branded~ user is killed, his killer inherits the title of V.I.P. and earn bonus points. We conclude by taking a look at the technical sector of the game. As far as the visual part is concerned, the title shows its ups and downs, even if there is a fair general improvement in the aesthetics of the environments and characters in this PlayStation 3 edition. Nothing striking, however, let's face it right away. At first glance, the Chrome engine 4 performs its task quite well, offering the user external environments that are chromatically alive and full of luxuriant vegetation that alternate with more urban ones, or that act as a middle ground between the two types of areas, with ruins and enemy outposts integrated with the surrounding nature. But on closer analysis, unfortunately, some smudges can be noticed in the close-ups of some elements, such as plants, for example, which appear quite flat, or some objects that lack detailed textures, such as in the interiors of some buildings which, among 'other, they are quite bare. These shortcomings therefore do not justify the frame rate drops evident in the most chaotic moments of the game, nor the occasional interpenetration of the characters with some scenic elements. The polygonal modeling of supporting actors and enemies is also quite crude, whose animations do not seem as loose and natural as they should. As for the audio part, the sound effects are good, discreet dubbing in English and the music that makes up a rather cinematic soundtrack is decidedly effective.", "date": "2011-12-14", "grade": "7.3"}
