{"name": "MLB The Show 2022", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mlb-the-show-2022-recensione.html", "text": "Within the Sony catalog, the MLB The Show series plays a very particular role. First of all, it is the only sports simulation (together with Gran Turismo, if we want to consider it a sports game) in an offer focused almost exclusively on cinematic productions. Even more unique is the fact that the game is available for all consoles - an exceptional thing, given how jealous Sony has always been of the intellectual properties of PlayStation Studios. Despite this, Sony San Diego's latest effort is available not only for Xbox One / Series X | S, but from this year also on Nintendo Switch. But modern times (and not only) are fluid and even the Japanese giant had to surrender to the evidence that a sports simulation on (very expensive) official license cannot thrive if confined to a single platform, however rich it may be. prosperous and dominant as PlayStation. On the other hand, it is not even ~fair~ that a baseball lover cannot access the only licensed game available on the market because it is exclusive to the PlayStation ecosystem. To test this renewed opening, for the review of MLB The Show 22 we tested the game on Xbox Series X and One, so as to see how one of the best sportsmen behave on the square in the green lawn of the neighbor. Continuity MLB The Show 2022 Without too many preambles, let's get straight to the point: Sony San Diego with MLB The Show 2022 has moved in the wake of continuity. The need to come out again on PS4 and Xbox One, two now very old consoles, this year also accompanied by Nintendo Switch, puts a limit on the possibilities of evolution of the series. The American studio, moreover, in the space of two years has transformed itself from being an internal division of PlayStation focused on a single platform (PS4) to managing a multi-platform AAA production that must proceed in parallel on 5 consoles simultaneously. A nice change, also from an internal organizational point of view, which has certainly curbed the desire to introduce major upheavals in the game engine. The other limit, from our point of view, is given by the very nature of baseball, a sport without great physical contact and with many breaks in between. A discipline that, moreover, on television makes extensive use of technology and graphics to tell the game and show in detail the strengths and weaknesses of a hitter or the trajectories of a pitch. Shohei Ohtani, the cover man of MLB The Show 2022 In other words, baseball is a sport that seems to be much closer to perfect synthesis than the various FIFA, Madden or NBA 2K, simulations where a more accurate physics of the collisions between the bodies, a more realistic management of the ball's trajectory and rebounds and a greater variety in the movements of the athletes could still distort the feeling on the virtual playing field. Sony San Diego, therefore, unless a total rewrite of the game engine that takes advantage of all the computing power of the new consoles, can only proceed with a chisel, also because it basically offers one of the most profound experiences available on the market. Choices A pitcher from MLB The Show 2022 As soon as you turn on MLB The Show 2022 you will be faced with a truly impressive amount of choices, honestly a bit overwhelming for those who are not familiar with the dynamics of sport or the previous versions of the sports simulation. For all the others, however, it is a real godsend. In fact, every fundamental of baseball can be performed in 2 or 3 different ways depending on your preferences, your ability or the period in which you started playing video games. There is the method that ~only~ requires you to press a key with the right timing or the one that will push you to simulate the movement with the analog levers. You can try to receive a ball by observing the trajectory of the serve or with a handy cursor that helps you understand where it will arrive. The same goes for the pitcher: you can directly indicate where the throw will end (hoping that the pitcher will execute the command in the best way) or you can try to execute the shot directly, with more uncertain results, but greater control over the situation. MLB The Show 2022 batting has been improved From this point of view, there are few steps forward and only purists will be able to notice a greater precision of the impacts of the baseball bat or a greater variety of animations and movements, mainly linked to the characterization of the most famous athletes who tread North American diamonds. As mentioned, the only limit to this approach is the way in which these choices are proposed, i.e. through static menus throughwhich it is possible to try the various control systems without being explained the advantages and disadvantages of one choice over another or being helped to understand how to improve. And not just through experience and experimentation. Mode Shohei Ohtani at MLB The Show 2022 The core of MLB The Show 22 has remained pretty much the same, adding or refining the modes featured last year and adding a 2 or 3 player co-op mode for friendlies or a limited Diamond Dynasty. As for the March to October mode, a sort of simplified and simplified Franchise, the biggest news is that you can go beyond the single season, with an entire off-season of trades and free agency signings that will occupy the months that between one year and the next. The historic Franchise mode, on the other hand, allows you to go into detail about all those simplified processes of March to October and to meticulously control the management of both the team and the entire franchise. Unfortunately the mode is still marred by a somewhat forgiving CPU, too prone to swap its stars for a counterpart that isn't up to par. MLB The Show 22's main career mode, Road to the Show, hasn't changed much from the past. True, it's nice to see legends of the caliber of Ken Griffey Jr. and Joe Mauer comment on our exploits, but maybe it's a little too little. For the rest it is the usual story of a player who passes in a short time from being a zero to reaching hero status, through training, but also thanks to the equipment of new and more performing objects. A spectacular home run from MLB The Show 2022 Too bad, moreover, you can't try to emulate the cover man Shohei Ohtani, a phenomenon capable of batting and throwing at the highest levels, because the regulation is not updated and our athlete cannot return to serve after being replaced as pitcher. Diamond Dynasty is, however, the ultimate Team of MLB The Show 22, or a mix between a management and a trading card game, with which to assemble your own dream team. This year you can use your team in miniature leagues against the computer with matches of only 3 innings, a good way to get credits with which to grow your team faster. Overall, therefore, a series of small improvements, unable, however, to distort the judgment on the game. Technical excellence MLB The Show 2022 is spectacular We want to reiterate it: the lack of weight news does not mean that MLB The Show 2022 is not an excellent game. It is perhaps the most complete sports simulation on the market, with a level of fidelity, especially compared to what can be seen on television, that is truly astonishing. Everything, from the stadiums to the choirs, passing through the reproduction of the main athletes, their movements and their trademark moves, is reproduced to perfection and an inattentive eye could find it difficult to distinguish the real from the virtual, especially if played in 4K on Xbox Series X or PS5. Here the animations look more precise, the details are sharper, the lighting more realistic and the stadiums more alive. Stadiums have improved in MLB The Show 2022 The commentary, another element that is always well cared for in American sports simulations, has been renewed. The two main voices are now ESPN's Jon Sciambi and Chris Singleton, much more punctual than the historian Matt Vasgersian in describing what happens on the diamond. As often happens when there is such a turnover, a little variety in the pre-recorded phrases is soon noticed: it will take a few editions to enrich the game database without having to kidnap the commentators for so many months in intense dubbing sessions.", "date": "2022-04-22", "grade": "7.5"}
