It must be said that the work carried out by the developer outside of this successful franchise then oscillated between mediocre and discreet, without ever equaling the results of its spearhead: let's see, therefore, if this new action RPG will be able to reverse such a trend... Devious Dungeons doesn't invent anything new, but it convinces and entertains all round Slaughter pixels Without wanting to pursue originality at all costs, Devious Dungeon does not invent anything new, starting from well-known premises to anyone who has at least a few years of videogame career behind them: the hero of the moment is therefore instructed by the king to free the dungeons of castle from the monsters that infest them, a plan to be implemented by exploiting game mechanics taken from platformers and RPGs. Simple virtual commands allow you to carry out the basic moves available, i.e. moving left and right, jumping and attacking with the equipped white weapon: it goes without saying that such a meager control system is inevitably combined with a gameplay that is anything but complex, but which still manages to involve for a vast series of elements well packaged by the developers. To begin with, Devious Dungeon offers small but constant notes of variety that keep the user's attention alive and that stimulate you to continue in the adventure, whether it is the new type of enemy you have just encountered, the raising of the level with relative boost stats or buying a new piece of equipment. These and other aspects are particularly welcome if we consider how the basic play structure of the Ravenous Games product is fundamentally repetitive: after all, it is always a question of exploring the various levels by killing monsters and breaking crates and containers in search of coins and precious gems, with the main objective of finding the key that opens the portal to the next stage. In this sense, the developers were good at working on the details, making the fights fun (especially thanks to enemies with very different attack patterns), the platform phases pleasant and peppering everything with missions to complete to get cash rewards and secrets to discover in each scenario. In addition to this, Devious Dungeon is also a pretty-looking mobile game, which like many of its colleagues in recent times, chooses the path of pixel art: characters, menus and elements of the scenario are therefore deliberately rough to give the game a 8-bit action game, leaving some concessions to modernity only for what concerns animations, use of colors and visual effects. Even in this area, however, Ravenous Games proved to be a team attentive to detail, as evidenced by the fact that the change of equipment directly affects the appearance of the protagonist. Returning to the more strictly playful sphere, Devious Dungeon turns out to be a rather serious action RPG, in spite of appearances: the foundations of the genre are well present and recognizable, but above all the title certainly does not pull back its leg when it comes to the level of challenge. The on-screen hero has a certain number of vital points available which drop profusely with each contact with the enemies, and which can only be restored through potions which are very rarely found in some chests or for a fee thanks to the priest who - together with the merchant - it is found at a checkpoint every three levels of the game. It is therefore easy to die while exploring the dungeons, an eventuality that Devious Dungeon does not make too penalizing in any case: gold and equipment are in fact kept, and you start again from the king's room from which you can choose the control point from which to start again. Again, Ravenous Games has not overlooked anything, equipping its product with randomly generated levels that clear away the risk of repetitiveness in the event of frequent deaths. In short, Devious Dungeon is an action RPG expertly crafted in all its components, which last but not least offers an excellent number of stages (a good sixty-three, including boss fights) in relation to its paltry selling price.", "date": "2014-03-21", "grade": "8.6"}
