{"name": "Captain Spirit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/captain-spirit-la-recensione-201521.html", "text": "Going back to work on a series loved by your fans is always dangerous, especially if that series is Life is Strange, where the real heart of the entire production is not so much the gameplay or the playful approach itself, but the narration and the feelings it connected. Emotions are a powerful tool, they remain etched in memory, like the adventures of Chloe Price and Max Caulfield: they can represent a double-edged sword. The Awesome Adventure of Captain Spirit has a specific purpose: to convince all fans of the first Life is Strange and Life is Strange: Before The Storm, that there is room for a narrative that leaves aside Chloe, Max and Rachel to focus on other characters. And so Dontnod has decided to reshuffle all its cards, proposing new protagonists, a new city, and perhaps even new centers of emotion. The exploits of Captain Spirit have left us with more doubts than answers, but they have also teased our attention with very valid ideas. Superhero gameplay: from big powers small responsibilities Three years have passed since the events of Life is Strange: we are in the seemingly tiny town of Beaver Creek, Oregon. Chris is ten years old, lives alone with his father, and like all good kids his age daydreams. Surely you too will remember that particular period of your life, the transition from elementary to middle school, your best friend, a borrowed book with more pictures than words, and toys scattered around your bedroom. It is the first point Dontnod wants to insist on by proposing something alternative to what was seen in Life is Strange: a different perspective, that of late childhood. Chris imagines he is a superhero, Captain Spirit, who, like any self-respecting hero, possesses a superpower: to dominate matter through a curious relationship between body and mind. For example turning on the TV without a remote control, moving objects, making things disappear, and of course flying. But a few minutes of play are enough to remember how every shot in the series always reserves a bitter smile, a melancholy note: Chris is genuinely happy for the simple fact of existing and being able to play, or for the imminent arrival of Santa Claus. This does not mean that he deeply misses his mother, who recently passed away: the developers have confirmed this, it can be understood practically immediately from small inputs scattered around the house, and therefore the protagonists underline it several times. The Awesome Adventure of Captain Spirit is a taste of Life is Strange 2, even if it is not clear in hindsight what kind: it is not clear how it will be connected to the first episode arriving this September. Its duration is small, comparable to that of the bonus chapter of Before The Storm (Goodbye): an hour of play, at most an hour and a half going slowly and exploring every nook and cranny of the small house, enough and more to complete the game. adventure. A practical notebook, in perfect ~Max's diary~ style, reminds us of our goals, which require a minimum of exploration of the surrounding environment. Few but incisive dialogues, a couple of secondary characters, but who will probably prove to be influential in Life is Strange 2. There aren't many things to see: Chris's room, the living room, the snowy garden, the house on the 'tree, and we've already finished; it is the gameplay that fortunately reserves some small surprises compared to the past, with the necessary limitations of the case. Since the child believes he is a superhero, from time to time the normal actions to be performed will be accompanied by a bonus option: the power of Captain Spirit. Let's take a practical example: do you have to throw spoiled food in the trash? Chris's ~power~ can simply teleport him through space. It doesn't really happen naturally: it's all in the child's head, it's functional to identify ourselves with his point of view, but it brings with it its beautiful emotional impact. He really believes he's fighting the bad guys and saving the world, when in reality the real enemies are his father's sense of loss and impending depression. Faithful to the past, perhaps even too much With The Awesome Adventure of Captain Spirit, Dontnod has shown itself capable of some small precautions: the possibility of answering our interlocutors has been added even if they are in another room (why had no one thought of it before?), and to skip not too long but annoying cutscenes, for example the short cutscenes between one room and another. Nothing too significant, and no real innovation: Captain Spirit is for now a smooth transition between Life is Strange and Life is Strange 2, a product faithful to itsorigins, maybe too much. Even the engine and the graphic rendering have remained the same, fortunately like the incredible care for the artistic sector. Unfortunately, keeping aside the ending of the short episode about which we tell you absolutely nothing, everything else is extremely familiar. A well-packaged, well-finished product, intense from an emotional point of view, but which at the moment fails to shine: it does not do so because its greatest enemy, paradoxically, is Life is Strange. Before the Storm didn't need to innovate that much: it had well-known protagonists among its weapons on which it could explore many aspects, remaining in the perspective of an effective context. Captain Spirit and Chris probably need to get going, assuming they are the protagonists of Life is Strange 2. The characters have their own identity, the themes deserve to be explored, and yet it is impossible not to intuit again, upside down, what was Chloe's relationship with her father in Chris with his mother. This does not mean that Life is Strange 2 cannot immediately take off positively from next September, showing us new gameplay mechanics (at least something similar to Max's power), more original themes, and retaining all the positive aspects that we know well. Our greatest fear is that it simply turns out to be a ~more of the same~ of the first series.", "date": "2018-06-25", "grade": "7.0"}
