{"name": "Resident Evil 2: The Ghost Survivors", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-2-the-ghost-survivors-recensione.html", "text": "Resident Evil 2: The Ghost Survivor undoubtedly stands as a very pleasant way to support the post-launch phase of the Capcom remake: we are talking about a DLC that comes in the form of an extra mode, downloadable for free on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One , which is added to the contents of the game and is immediately accessible even for those who have not yet completed the campaign (but we do not recommend doing so: you would ruin several surprises). On paper, the package includes three non-canonical and alternative stories that take place in parallel with the adventure lived by Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, with different protagonists: Robert Kendo, owner of the gun shop who experiences the tragedy of his little girl who turned into a zombie but find the strength to react; Katherine Warren, daughter of the mayor of Raccoon City, who must escape from the clutches of the police chief to avoid a bad end; and Ghost, one of the mercenaries in the service of the Umbrella Corporation, whose goal is to access the NEST to recover the G-Virus. structure and characters Let's clarify one point right away: those who thought that The Ghost Survivors offered content in line with the mechanics of the Resident Evil 2 campaign will unfortunately be disappointed. In fact, what the developers have created are just variations of The 4th Survivor mode, therefore survival to be completed in a hurry, literally, completing a different path and counting on little ammunition and resources. In this case it is possible to opt for two different levels of difficulty, the standard one and the ~training~ one, quite trivial, which allows you to frame the routes and the threats present well, memorizing the things to do and taking advantage of a much more generous endowment normal, as well as opponents who go down with just a couple of headshots. The normal degree of challenge, on the other hand, is rather demanding, both because you have to save on bullets and the zombies don't want to know about dying (again), and because some new types of enemies are valued, in this case the poisonous undead (which, once hit, they release a toxic cloud from which they can only recover by eating the leaves of a blue plant), the creepy ~pale~ hybrids and zombies wearing military armor. According to indications from Capcom, the ~On the run~ mission, starring Katherine Warren, is the simplest of the lot: in this alternative story, the girl manages to kill Chief Irons and tries to escape from her home, but finds along the way several padlocks and must therefore look for the relative keys in order to be able to open them. Making her life more difficult will be the aforementioned pale monsters, undead dogs and traditional zombies galore, but the final reveal presents an interesting prize for completing the level. ~Life goes on~, which puts us in the role of Robert Kendo, is instead characterized by an intermediate degree of difficulty: the protagonist takes up a shotgun and must make his way through hordes of zombies and their poisonous variants to reach a safe area and take advantage of a ride to escape the city, leaving behind the past and his many regrets. In this case he will also find the huge monsters of the sewers waiting for him and the constant threat of intoxication, which slows down the movements and makes the character cough suddenly, perhaps while he is about to hit a rapidly approaching enemy. The most difficult mission of the three is the one with the Ghost soldier, equipped with more refined equipment but with medium-high level enemies along the way, including the unstoppable Mister X. During some moments it actually seems to relive the Hunk sequences in the already mentioned mode The 4th Survivor. Spoiler: There's also a surprise Capcom has always presented The Ghost Survivor as a mode made up of three different missions, precisely those starring Robert Kendo, Katherine Warren and Ghost, but completing them all (even on the easy level) unlocks a fourth secret mission, ~Under siege~, in which we play the role of sheriff Daniel Cortini, the one who ends up killed in the introductory sequence of Resident Evil 2. Having escaped death in this case, the agent is equipped with a pistol with infinite ammunition and his goal is not to follow a path, but resist the attack of a hundred zombies remaining within the service area, in a sort of really challenging horde mode. Gameplay and technical realization As you may have understood, none of the protagonists of The Ghost Survivors are asked to solve puzzles or activate switches: the gameplay of this mode consists solely of covering the respective tragsitti in the shortest possible time, in the context of a real speedrun that is naturally timed by the system, challenging us every time to do better. The completion times range on average from ten to fifteen minutes, therefore we are talking about fairly short missions but which will give you a hard time, especially at the beginning, when you still do not have a clear understanding of the characteristics of the route and the threats present, some of which avoid with some expedient so as not to waste precious ammunition. In fact, inside the locations there are no objects to collect, except those found in the backpacks that some zombies carry on their shoulders and at the few distributors scattered around the scenario, who ask you to choose only one content among three alternatives. The end result is therefore an adrenaline-pumping mix of challenge, tactics and skill, interesting for some narrative revelations (although not canonical, as mentioned) but comparable to the unlockable extra modes that we already knew. An excellent job has been done on the technical implementation front: although the locations selected for the routes are the same as those seen in the Resident Evil 2 campaign, there are some interesting variants regarding the enemies (the aforementioned poisonous zombies, pale hybrids and the undead with police armor), while the polygonal models of the protagonists boast good animations and an excellent level of detail.", "date": "2019-02-18", "grade": "7.5"}
