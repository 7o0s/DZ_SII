One of these is Pinball FX2, a Zen Studios effort that we have had the opportunity to talk about several times over the months. Since the release of the game, the development team has in fact released regular updates to the list of available pinball machines, also undertaking valuable collaborations for the use of licenses such as those related to Marvel superheroes, Star Wars and more. With the advent of virtual reality, it was inevitable that the guys at Zen Studios saw it as a natural evolution of their videogame pinball machine, thus setting to work to create Pinball FX2 VR. The game has now arrived for the most common viewers on the market, obviously including PlayStation VR: we wore the latter to write this review of Pinball FX2 VR. Zen Studios' pinball machines land in virtual reality with Pinball FX2 VR: the result is more than good From Mars to zombies The question that inevitably arises before playing Pinball FX2 VR concerns the purchases made previously. From this point of view we have to give you bad news, since the tables already bought on the normal version of Pinball FX2 (and of Zen Pinball 2 on the PlayStation platform) are not valid even within Pinball FX2 VR. It is therefore necessary to buy everything again to play, starting with the basic pinball package which is sold together with the game for 14.99. The initial equipment includes the three pinball machines Mars, Secrets of the Deep and Epic Quest: all appreciable, with our preference for the one set on the red planet. As an aid to those who want more pinball machines to enjoy in virtual reality, the Season One expansion is already available, sold for 24.99 euros to get the CastleStorm, Wild West Rampage, Paranormal, BioLab and Earth Defense tables. Five pinball machines, all very nice to play in virtual reality and therefore a recommended purchase. However, it must be said that the total cost can therefore reach 40 euros, exceeding them if you also want to buy the pinball machine dedicated to The Walking Dead. After having already accompanied us on the normal table for Pinball FX2, Clementine and Lee from the Telltale Games adventure also appear on virtual reality, together with their zombies. At least for now, this is the first and only table for Pinball FX2 VR created under license: given and considering the aforementioned thickness of the other pinball machines available for normal play, we hope that new ones can arrive under license, perhaps following the same model at separate packages. Returning to the price, it must be considered that buying tables that you already own elsewhere is not something that could go down well with everyone, also because at least for The Walking Dead the price has practically doubled: from 2.99 euros to 5.99 euros . After having shed some light on the offer of Pinball FX2 VR, let's move on to see how the pinball experience in virtual reality is on balance. Playstation 4 trophies Trophy hunters can also get to work in Pinball FX2 VR, although there are no platinum-type ones inside. Of the 9 trophies in the base game, 6 are in fact bronze, 1 silver and 2 gold: all of them are naturally linked to the three pinball machines that make up the starting package. The additional content offers another 12 trophies, all of them of the bronze type and of course also related to the elements of the tables included in the Season One and The Walking Dead package. Game room After putting on your headset to start Pinball FX2 VR, the game takes us to a kind of futuristic apartment. Inside the latter appear three pinball machines, an area dedicated to scores and a fascinating panoramic window. The tables present can be selected from among those available through a television screen placed in the same area, where you can only ~move~ to jump from one pinball machine to another. Moving on to the gaming experience, we won't be here to describe what a pinball machine is, but the sensations of finding the table and its buttons a few centimeters from our nose. If, as we said at the beginning, real pinball machines still retain their charm intact, having one in front of you in virtual reality is certainly a step that brings the gaming experience even closer to the real one, exploiting for this purpose the quality to which Zen Studios us has got used to it. Each table features a series of animations, linked to its setting: Mars, for example, takes us to the red planet together with various robots and an aura of mystery, while The Walking Dead pfeatures original art and voice actors from the first season made by Telltale Games. Once we have started playing with a table, the surrounding environment is completely distorted, also in this case linking its elements to the pinball machine setting. Following the example of Mars we find ourselves with our pinball machine in the middle of the red rocks of the planet, while with The Walking Dead there is even a zombie to keep us company. On the other side of the table appears Clementine, the protagonist of the Telltale Games adventure who continues to disturb the creature while we continue with our game. Speaking of animations, it must be considered that the side ones could already be distracting in the normal version of Pinball FX2, let alone how much they can do in the VR one. Flying planes and dragons, explosions, spitting plants and other elements are constantly at work around us, so it becomes easy to get carried away by a simple glance to be enchanted and thus miss some important shot inside the pinball machine, or worse drop the ball. Fortunately, apart from some rare and bearable exceptions, the animations never invade the pinball's field of vision, thus leaving us free to continue playing without losing concentration. From a graphic point of view, the tables show attention to detail both inside and out, i.e. both in the realization of the elements that make up the pinball machine and in the surrounding part we have already talked about. However, on PlayStation VR (with PlayStation 4 Pro) the lower resolution compared to a 1080p screen sometimes prevented us from capturing the minor details of some pinball machines, also making it difficult to read the texts on their screens. A small note also regarding tiredness: playing pinball forces you to keep your head pointed downwards, with the consequent additional impact of the weight of the viewer on the cervical muscles. For various reasons, it can therefore happen that you feel tired, both with your eyesight and with your neck: in this case, we obviously advise you to take a break.", "date": "2016-12-18", "grade": "7.5"}
