{"name": "Biohazard: Rebirth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/biohazard-rebirth.html", "text": "The plot was essentially summed up in the player's impersonation of the agents of the S.T.A.R.S. group, precisely the Alpha team, in search of the Bravo team mates missing after a mysterious helicopter crash. During this research, the Alpha team was forced to take refuge in an old, apparently abandoned manor house, in which almost the entire game would have been set... but the plot of Biohazard is now too well known to talk about it anymore. Well, you won't believe it, but Biohazard: Rebirth is nothing more than a reissue of the masterpiece released for PSX 6 years ago. This is because, thanks to a skilful commercial move, Nintendo has acquired the exclusive rights to the Biohazard saga from episode 0 to 4 spin-offs excluded, but unfortunately only 0 and 4 will be unpublished, the remaining 1, 2 , 3 and Code Veronica ~only~ ports of the originals. This should not be misleading, Biohazard is not a simple version of the PSX game (God forbid!), but the only one of the aforementioned that has been destined for a complete remake, so much so that it differs, according to the developers, by a good 70% from the original. Capcom has managed, through an excellent use of advertising media, to arouse an expectation that hasn't occurred for years for a game of the same genre. It hasn't been a week since the day of the announcement of the development, that there hadn't been releases of photos or videos / tech demos to demonstrate the work of the developers and, even now that Biohazard is in stores, the releases of informative material continue to demonstrate how much the product is important. The game is taken care of right from the package, which contains, in addition to the 2 mini-DVDs of the game, the manual and a black memory card that can be personalized with some stickers. Once the package has been unwrapped and the first mini-DVD has been inserted, one can only be amazed and anyone who has played the first chapter on Playstation (both in the classic version and the Director's Cut), will be able to notice the changes starting from the introduction . The latter from the FMV with actors has passed to a film in computer graphics of stratospheric level, so as not to perceive any loss of quality. Before entering the house we are asked how we want to proceed through a riddle that recites an enigma such as: do you want to climb a steep but very rewarding mountain or do you prefer a simpler but less intense climb? ... basically a ~different~ way to ask if you want to play in an original way or with a reduced degree of difficulty. This was made necessary by the fact that Biohazard is the most challenging chapter of the saga and in many points it could seem too frustrating for players, especially if they come from the experiences of Biohazard 3: Nemesis or Code Veronica. The suggestion I can give you is to choose the highest difficulty level so you don't miss out on anything the game has to offer. After this step we will still be able to decide which of the two agents of S.T.A.R.S. impersonate: Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield, both with divergent stories on some fronts in order to increase replay value, a classic move in the RE saga and already present in Alone in The Dark. Once you cross the threshold of the imposing manor, the first impression is that the control system has remained substantially unchanged, except for the fact that it is now possible to use the analog stick for movements, but unfortunately this does not bring substantial improvements. However, there are new actions of a defensive nature and unpublished ~inventions of style~ (for example now if you shoot the rocket launcher downwards the protagonist covers his face) but nothing substantial. This together with the inventory represents the greatest flaw of the saga, and is what is left of the original game. By this I don't mean that we are facing a whole new adventure, but a new gaming experience. The house is the same and the differences are almost only in the new adaptation / repositioning of the rooms and in different shots, the enemies are always the same and the puzzles are largely similar. This might lead one to think that the 70% declared by Capcom is attributable to moving the house's ornaments ... but the experience is totally different, more engaging than it has ever been, even more frightening. To be able to create this new sensation, the writers have modified the dialogues of the original and partly also the plot, removing that second-rate film taste that permeated the PSX version to give it greater drama and characterization. This is also thanks to a dubbing finally herea quality that can be as dramatic and gloomy as the title needs, while not reaching the level of excellence due to some style falls. The entries are entirely in English in order to be understandable even to users who are not comfortable with the ideograms (texts and reports remain in Japanese). Before moving on to the technical part, I just wanted to say a few words about longevity. I've probably gotten scarcer over the years, but I found this game really challenging. In fact, it took me about 13 hours to finish the game the first time with Jill, while on PSX it took me 7 hours. Compared to the original, numerous extras are also available that do nothing but prolong the gaming experience. As for the graphics, the style is always that of the PSX, characterized by polygonal models in pre-rendered environments but what models and environments! The models of the characters and zombies are the best I've ever seen, with polygons covered with photorealistic textures, fluid and precise even if complex animations. The backdrops then represent the state of the art, being even more beautiful and complex than those of Onimusha 2 Jap, with countless dynamic elements and so many details. The colors are dark enough and the new external locations are of a devastating visual impact (it happens several times in the game that secondary locations of the psx version become of primary importance here). But that's not all; The real revolution for Biohazard are the dynamic lights and with them the projected shadows which alone are sufficient to make the gaming experience much more engaging. The sound is excellent, even if it is limited to a resampling of the old episode and personally I found the soundtrack completely unobtrusive, but not without character. The effects and speech are instead masterful, excellent for a production of this caliber and finally with a dubbing worthy of the name. Naturally, Biohazard: Rebirth also suffers from some flaws, first of which perhaps is the excessive difficulty which risks making it unattractive to the inexperienced player. The most fussy might notice the slight aliasing on the polygonal models, and the bad collision management: several times there are problems of interpenetration with the seabed and with the dead zombies (in practice, once you lie down you pass through ..), for not talk about how the characters go up and down the stairs However, these are small moles that in no way manage to limit the merits, which are many, of this game. In conclusion, I can only advise all GameCube Jap owners to purchase Biohazard: Rebirth, both to those who have never played the original and to those who spent sleepless nights with the PSX version 6 years ago. The last clarification is that, as I had already written, the game is localized in Japanese throughout the writing but the dialogues are in English. It would therefore be advisable to wait for a more understandable version to fully enjoy the story, hoping that censorship does not hit the western version. Pros: The only survival horror verse.and it's SCARY. Top notch graphics on consoles. Dynamic lighting. Cons: Sometimes frustrating due to the too much difficulty. Interpenetration between models and backdrops. Still remains a remake Back in the days It was 1996 when terror struck the world of video games for the first time: Biohazard. Not that it was really the first case of a game with a horror setting, indeed, productions of the caliber of Alone in the Dark, D, Phantasmagoria (terrifying) and others already existed, but Biohazard was different. The Capcom title had a new game methodology on its side that soon became famous and copied, survival horror. In practice, the player found himself in frightening situations and places, with very few weapons available, little possibility of saving his skin and above all many enemies. All this was seasoned with easy-to-solve puzzles, most of the time illogical, and with a plot and screenplay worthy of the best trashy b-movies of the 80s (Troma style). This cocktail has managed to conquer so much space and success that it deserves a genre of its own with countless episodes, spin-offs and facets, from pure action (see House of the dead) to psychological horror (see Silent Hill), but the true masterpiece is always the progenitor of the Capcom saga, the only one capable of truly being a survival and not a simple shooter/splatter (splatterhouse docet) with some puzzles.", "date": "2002-04-27", "grade": null}
