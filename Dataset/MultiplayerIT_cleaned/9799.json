{"name": "Double Dragon in salsa fantasy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/80647-knights-rush-double-dragon-in-salsa-fantasy.html", "text": "The era of the legendary scrolling fighting games, which in the 80s and 90s represented the ne plus ultra for any video game user, is reborn in Apple's portable devices thanks to real pearls available in the App Store. The ~experienced~ players, those who still have in mind the two hundred lire to insert in the dusty cabinets of the suburban arcades, will remember with affection and nostalgia masterpieces such as Double Dragon, in which with an illusory sense of depth two-dimensional enemies were beaten using two sprites colorful, moved more by our imagination than by simple animations managed with the 8-way stick. Knight's Rush, produced by Chillingo, however, is the spiritual sequel to the good Knight Onrush, a title attributable to the ~tower defense~ series; however, unlike the prequel in this incarnation, the hack & slash drift has definitely taken over, giving a deep, long-lasting and damningly challenging title. Interdimensional hammering In Knight's Rush, skipping unnecessary preambles, you will find yourself immersed almost immediately in a fantasy world, where through some interdimensional portals it will be possible to move through space and time, crossing increasingly gloomy, dangerous and action-packed settings. The protagonists of the adventurous journey will be three heroes, classic stereotypes of the genre, who represent the usual warrior balanced in every parameter, the powerful colossus equipped with a big hammer and immense physical strength and finally an agile green elf, with two light blades but able to stand out very long jumps while avoiding many enemies at the same time. While not differing much in the animations, the three characters, all selectable from the beginning in the ~base~ world of the portals, represent three different approaches to the battle, thus giving the title tactical depth right from the start. The structure of the gameplay is, as already mentioned, that of the classic Double Dragon-style scrolling fighting game: the hero of the moment, maneuvered using the left virtual stick, can move in 8 directions and will have one type of basic attack available (different from depending on the selected character) as well as a varied number of special attacks that can be upgraded as the levels progress. In the crates scattered along the way it will then be possible to find various power ups, such as explosives or freezing spells, of great help especially for the most agitated phases or to face the imposing end-of-level bosses. In practice however, we will often find ourselves repeatedly pressing the basic attack button in melee, hoping to resolve the thorniest situations in this way: this solution, which can go well in the first two game worlds, will prove to be decidedly ineffective starting from the third , showing what is the true depth of the title. Every monster, trap or weapon encountered must in fact be faced with the right tactics, under penalty of losing precious vital fluid; the variety of enemies and physical obstacles, mostly destructible, that you will encounter wandering through the seven worlds is truly impressive, there are at least 30 different types of opponents (including knights, wizards, elves, skeletons, etc.) in addition to about fifteen types of traps and devices of defense scattered throughout the levels, all characterized in a perfect way. However, safeguarding health is something truly fundamental in Knight's Rush, due to the harmful consequences caused by death during the course of a level: in fact, being defeated will not cause a classic game over but neither will the simple respawn from the closest control point, but it will force the player to restart the game stage in progress from the beginning, instantly losing all the experience points and upgrades earned! The balancing system from this point of view actually makes you turn up your nose, because if during the normal levels it is not very difficult to accumulate experience points, thanks to the high number of enemies and objects that can be faced, on the contrary during a fight against a boss at the end of the stage dying even once means having to face the monster all over again with only the basic equipment, greatly complicating the positive outcome of the battle. This serious shortcoming is capable of making a title almost frustrating that in reality could easily be played smoothly even if, considering that a widespread opinion among insiders concerns the too much ease of modern video games, for someone it could perhaps represent a virtue. Once the main story is finished, it will then be possible to face the worlds again in infinite and super infinite, more complex, for the sole purpose of accumulating as many points as possible. The deadlift greater than Knight's Rush has with its predecessor, but also with many of the App Store titles currently on sale, it concerns the technical sector of the highest level: on the test iPhone 4 the magnificent level design, with support for the Retina Display, returned a colorful setting, detailed and absolutely fluid even in the most chaotic situations, a real feast for the eyes. The music plays their role in accompanying the battle very well, while the cries and sound effects of the enemies are often repetitive and not very appropriate, while not affecting the fun of the game in the slightest. Given the difficulty in finishing the title, linked as mentioned not so much to the actual gameplay as to the unfortunate choice to cancel the upgrades with each death, a cooperative multiplayer mode via bluetooth or wifi would have been appreciated, which is instead absent; while not yet supporting Game Center, the application also has the fairly common Crystal lenses.
