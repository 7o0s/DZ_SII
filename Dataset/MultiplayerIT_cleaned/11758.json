{"name": "SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Tactical Strike - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/socom-us-navy-seals-tactical-strike-recensione.html", "text": "The ~variations on the theme~ are nothing new in the videogame field, after all when a character is successful we try to exploit his popularity in every way, even making him the protagonist of various spin-offs that have little to do with the starting intentions . In the case of SOCOM, however, the story is different: we are faced with a very successful series, branded Sony, which characterized the period of maturity of the PlayStation 2 and pushed the pedal of online gaming in unsuspecting times. The transition to PSP was inevitable, with two really well done episodes but which didn't introduce particular novelties and limited themselves to reproducing, indeed in the best possible way, what was seen on PS2. Thanks to the recent restyling and the consequent boost in sales, the Portable PlayStation is preparing for the arrival of a new wave of titles of great thickness; and apparently there is also room for experiments, as demonstrated by this Tactical Strike. Goal of salvation Despite the strategic approach, SOCOM: Tactical Strike retains a classic setting as regards the missions, divided by objectives to be achieved before taking the team to the extraction point. Unfortunately, however, the age-old problem of the saves remains: just like in the other PSP episodes, we will not have the possibility to save the progress at any moment, but we will have to wait to reach the checkpoints from which to start again in case of game over. In the portable field, this is a limit of no small importance, but the developers persist in keeping it unchanged... Something old, something new... The launch screen and menu interface of the new SOCOM for PSP do not suggest the change of course made by the developers, but everything becomes clear while grappling with the inevitable introductory tutorial. After selecting our team of four specialists from those available (one for each nation, in theory, with the characters speaking a different language depending on the country they belong to - and Italy is not missing), we will be able to move the soldiers not by commanding them directly, but using a cursor and a control system designed specifically for Tactical Strike: the backbone R selects the Alpha or Bravo pair, while the backbone L allows us to use a single character. The Circle button is responsible for movement: once pressed, a cursor appears on the screen that we can move with the analog stick and which provides us with a ~preview~ of the position that the soldiers will assume once at their destination, then press the button again for men to obey the order. Similarly, the X button is in charge of the attack: just frame a target by placing it in the center of the view, then press X to order the team to fire. The Square button is used to access the inventory of individual soldiers, where we can find medical kits but also grenades of various types or the sniper rifle, to shoot down very distant enemies. Finally, the Triangle button has the function of canceling the order just given. However, the actions that can be performed are multiplied by holding down the Circle, X and Square buttons: it therefore becomes possible to decide whether to move stealthily or normally, whether to shoot a single target or keep an eye on an entire quadrant, whether to break into a building silently or making a lot of noise, etc. etc. Lethal Weapon As in all episodes of the series, also in Tactical Strike we will have a huge arsenal at our disposal and we will be able to decide which weapons to assign to each of our four soldiers. The accompanying information is interesting, but unfortunately they don't give an idea of how each weapon will actually behave in action: we'll have to try it first hand. To improve the situation, however, we will be able to access an upgrade system that allows us to make team members more resistant, more experienced and more accurate in shooting, by spending the points earned on missions. The obstacles of the heart After a few minutes of play, the mechanics of SOCOM: Tactical Strike appear clear: the outdoor locations are dotted with objects (whether they are crates, walls or vehicles) behind which you have to take cover at the end of each movement, in order to face any clashes in the best of ways. Arranging the two pairs of soldiers in an intelligent way, perhaps in distant positions, allows us to have at least a favorable firing range to make our machine gun bursts hit. Conversely, keeping the characters all close together can result in a stalemate, which will require risky movement without cover to resolve. And it is precisely in this type of situation that the game shows one of its most serious limitations, namely the poor AI: whenor there is no cover, our soldiers are extremely vulnerable to enemy attacks, unable to fight back quickly and effectively and to move to avoid being hit. So attacking head-on translates into a lottery that can be won a few times in the course of a game. When we find ourselves inside buildings, then, it is the movement system that shows its worst: the cursor, in fact, must move on the screen like any member of the team and depends on the team's view. This makes moving out of a room extremely difficult (there are walls blocking the view), so you end up going ~in stages~ and have to do it for both couples. In risky situations, this flaw takes on enormous proportions and makes us effectively incapable of defending ourselves when our soldiers are exposed and we need to act quickly to prevent them from being hit. Technical realization Tactical Strike boasts excellent graphics, thanks above all to an engine that manages to effectively manage the various characters and the scenario, without missing a beat. SOCOM on PSP is much smoother than it is on PS2, and sports a large number of on-screen elements (few of which are actually interactable) that help create a convincing and plausible setting, which is lost only in some junctures but whose charm is affected by an uninspired and repetitive use of colors. The sound sector, as mentioned, is enriched by the presence of a large amount of speech while both the effects and the music are somewhat in the background, however average for the series. The game is completely localized in Italian, both in the texts and in the dialogues, and it is a work done with some care. The multiplayer mode allows us to access games for up to four players, and it is an addition of a certain value as it significantly increases the longevity of the product. Comment SOCOM: Tactical Strike introduces a completely new gameplay for the series and full of interesting ideas, which deserve further study in other contexts. Unfortunately, change is often the harbinger of non-negligible problems, and this game is no exception: the characters fail to behave intelligently when they find themselves victims of ambushes or in any case when they are not placed in the best possible way near a firefight , and this leads us to always proceed very cautiously and in small steps, slowing down the pace of the action. The movement system does not help, it is often cumbersome and too limited for all those situations in which rapid intervention is needed. Technically excellent and equipped with a multiplayer mode of sure interest, Tactical Strike is proposed as a valid alternative to the classic SOCOM, albeit with the obvious defects that the change of course has brought with it. Pros: Technically excellent Good longevity It can be very engaging ... Cons: ... despite some obvious limitations Inconvenient rescue system Cumbersome in emergency situations", "date": "2007-12-07", "grade": null}
