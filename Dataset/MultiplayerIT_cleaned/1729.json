Eighteen years of glorious digital history canceled for budgetary reasons (deleting such a prestigious and well-known, ~saleable~ name will probably prove to be a misstep on the part of EA): it is right to briefly retrace its history. Westwood Studios got its start in the mid-1980s developing RPGs and sports multi-event for Epyx, SSI, and Infocom, including California Games. The consecration comes in 91 with Eye of the Beholder, a beautiful three-dimensional RPG in the wake of Dungeon Master, and in 92 with the timely sequel. In the same year they released Lands of Lore, a real 3D role-playing game while in 94 they inaugurated the series of adventures set in the world of Kirandia. Del 98 is one of the most beautiful and courageous adventures of all time (even with its limitations): Blade Runner, inspired by Philip Dick and Ridley Scott. ...continues on next page The crisis of the seventh year Seven years have passed since the world public first got to know the Command & Conquer saga: it was 1996 when the Westwoods decided to apply the revolutionary game design of their Dune 2 to a title set in the future devastated by a war between two factions imaginary, Nod and Gdi. It was the Westwood boys' way of leaving their signature in the short history of the video game: global success came immediately and amply repaid a very successful mix of playability, irony, immediacy and spectacularity. Over the years sequels and spin-offs followed, first of all the two Red Alerts which moved the conflict into a parallel and fantastic cold war fought by the Soviets and the Americans with psi weapons and atomic airships. After the disappointing experiment of Renegade, here we are with this Generals announced since its first public appearances as the revolution that would have upset the strategist vein in real time. Much-needed revolution: if in fact the Westwood series founded and canonized the RTS genre, at the same time it didn't know how to renew itself over the years, limiting itself to offering some marginal improvements which, however, did not affect the basic game design. And after seven years the mechanics of accumulation of resources, of ~build troops and hurl them at the enemy base~ looks more worn out than ever. On the shoulders of Generals therefore a heavy legacy: to ferry the C&C saga into the future and bring many dollars into EA's coffers. Shock number one Electronic Arts indeed. The first thrill comes from reading the manual: ~developed by EA Pacific on an original Westwood Studios idea~. The real (video) game, by now, is what revolves around the video game: the financial maneuvers, the acquisitions, the balance sheets, the copies sold. At least judging by the interest that such arguments arouse on half-internet forums. The fact is that the battlefield leaves more corpses than a Quake fragfest: among these the glorious Westwood studios canceled due to financial needs and anonymously merged into the Californian division of the increasingly gigantic EA. The fear is that once the helm of the series has changed hands, we will end up with something different in our hands and not the usual C&C (and this may not be entirely negative, Ed.). The Westwood Story /2 ... But Westwood will undoubtedly go down in history for his contributions to real-time strategy, a genre he practically invented: after decades spent on turn-based strategy, American developers had the brilliant idea of enlivening everything by giving the player continuous control and in real time of their own troops and fundraisers. With Dune 2, following a mediocre Virgin adventure a few years earlier, they implemented their intuition in the world created by Frank Herbert. In 1996 they inaugurated the Command & Conquer saga and a few years later the spin-off Red Alert. Between one sequel and another, the last few years mark a slight but unstoppable decline: misfires, botched titles, tired and stuffy sequels tarnish Westwood's fame: Nox, Renegade and Earth and Beyond not only will not go down in history but not even in the box office. The rest is history. Honor and glory at Westwood Studios! Shock number two Once the game is installed, fear becomes a certainty. But let's go in order. Generals is set in the immediate future, so immediate that it's already there. Forget the futuristic Gdi or Nod: the forces in the field are the much more recognizable USA, China and ELG (Global Liberation Army) imaginary organizationfundamentalist Islamist terrorist. Forget imaginative and borderline surreal vehicles and troops: this time you will have to deal with much heavier Stealth fighters, Comanche helicopters, Tomahawk missiles, Scuds, hijackers, kamikazes, anthrax, nuclear warheads and anything else the big market can offer of the information-entertainment of this world now immersed in a permanent war. Forget the filmed interludes, a true trademark of the award-winning C&C company: if you were fond of those ironic, botched interludes, worthy of the worst Ed Wood ... well, get over it: in Generals the missions are introduced only by short films made with the same engine of the game that illustrate the situation on the ground, the position of the troops and so on. The choices made, in some ways courageous, however, end up removing a lot of personality from the title, significantly affecting the player's involvement: the narrative development itself is extremely labile, frayed, practically absent: the link between one mission and another is in fact absent as well as absent is some particular character to ~get attached to~ or whose personality stands out in the anonymous mass of toy soldiers. There is almost no ~story~ in which the player can immerse himself: as - sadly - in reality there is only a progressive escalation of increasingly complex armaments and increasingly difficult missions but no narration that gives a sense or a reason to the choices of the generals. General, these five stars... As tradition you will be able to choose any of the three warring factions, each with its particular missions. The variety of deployments is remarkable and one will rarely have the sensation of ~cloned~ units from one faction to another: if on the one hand the overwhelming US power is overwhelming from the point of view of brute force, on the other hand it is considerably expensive; the Chinese with their hackers and spies allow for a more reflective approach; finally, the Elg is perhaps the most original: being a terrorist organization it certainly cannot count on bombers or weapons factories but will have to turn to traffickers or resort to angry crowds, hijackers or bomb trucks, forcing (macabrely) the player to develop unique and original strategies. The player is called upon to impersonate an anonymous and invisible General who leads his army to victory: the powers of the Generals are the main innovation introduced in the gameplay of this new C&C. Similar to the heroes of Warcraft III or the divine powers of Age of Mythology, the commands of the Generals allow you to perform particular actions (such as ordering a carpet bombing of A-10, the automatic improvement of your troops, a biological attack and so on) by spending the precious experience points earned in the course of the action. Italian generals Generals is totally localized in Italian, text and audio, and very well too. Certainly the dubbings of the armies lack a bit of personality being equal to each other, or in any case very similar, and hearing Americans, Chinese and Islamic terrorists address you with the same voice: but it is probably a (marginal) limit also of the original version of the game. ...these five tears But certainly the most innovative element of Generals is the massive introduction of 3D in a series that had made bitmap graphics its flag. After seven years spent building two-dimensional bases and moving tanks in isometric pseudo-3d, the player will have an entire three-dimensional battlefield under his control, from the ground to the most insignificant appearance in the middle of a Middle Eastern market. Although all this has a cost (see hardware box) it must be admitted that C&C: Generals can boast one of the best graphics on the square as regards the coveted strategic games. Middle Eastern villages, Chinese cities, the Swiss Alps or Asian deserts are reproduced in a sumptuous and pleasing way for the eye. With a simple movement of the mouse you can rotate or zoom the view as you like until you appreciate the single texture of the single vehicle. Difficult not to fall in love with it or at least be impressed by the spectacular machine set in motion by Generals. The scenographic element is undoubtedly the aspect most taken care of by the EA designers and the player will have no difficulty in getting involved: black screen, at the bottom appears a white writing that updates us on the place and the situation (Black Hawk Down style) and then the 'hell: hundreds of characters and vehicles immersed in a realistic and extremely detailed environment, explosions, excited cries of our troops asking us what to do, bombardmentsre flying overhead and our base surrounded. War hardware Generals won't be an expected title like Doom 3 but the same will make you think that ~it's time to update your computer~: from a hardware point of view it's a bloody expensive title, maybe even too much and a few tweaks to the code wouldn't hurt. With the so-called minimum requirements (PIII 800 and GeForce 2) you will hardly go above minimum details and resolution (800x600). To get smoothly to higher details and resolutions equip yourself with at least 1.5 Ghz and GeForce 3. At least 128 Mb of ram conclude the paraphernalia (double for multiplayer) and all set up for directX 8.1. Medals to the General But as always there is also the other side of the coin. First of all, the maximum extension of the view is too limited: even at the greatest distance you are always too close to the ground, preventing a clear overview of the situation, thus affecting the playful experience undermined in its fluidity and immediacy. Too much time scrolling the map, zooming out or rotating the viewpoint - in all that time we've already lost too many units. The other negative aspect, if one may say so, is that, in the end, the new graphics do not bring any substantial improvement or simple difference to the traditional gameplay made in Westwood: in this riot of polygons and particle explosions the player is not called to any intellectual effort that deviates from what the previous titles (and zillions of clones) had accustomed him. This time there is no Tiberium to collect but crates of money and raw materials that ~sprout~ in special supply areas: beyond the appearance there is very little difference from the spice or tiberium field. After the initial five minutes of bewilderment due to the new sparkling 3D look, the time to take the measurements of the new and starched dress, the routines to which seven years of C&C have accustomed us are reactivated in the gaming brain: it builds a command station, then barracks, then factory, amass troops, attack the enemy. Of course, a mission will rarely be limited to these basic elements: on the contrary, we must recognize the commitment that Generals puts into offering variety to the player: from defending fleeing allies, organizing an attack, destroying a dam or protecting a train, there will always be something particular to do. However, nothing that makes us cry out for a stroke of genius: indeed, from the point of view of playability and variety, Red Alert 2 remains unbeaten. The powers of the Generals thicken the tactical element a bit but the AI, while doing its job very well, is nothing particularly difficult. Also avoid the Normal level, such only in the minds of the developers, since its extreme ease would end the game after a few hours. Apparently longevity would seem to be the real Achilles heel: seven missions per faction seem too little. But considering that the armies are three, very different from each other, and the last missions are usually challenging, we don't feel like rejecting it from this point of view. Furthermore, Generals is a title that focuses heavily on multiplayer (to which we will dedicate a separate special) and unofficial maps are already sprouting like mushrooms, thanks also to the handy editor included in the game. The internet community will be able to keep the game alive long after the campaigns and non-exciting skirmishes against the computer are over. Not to mention the highly predictable expansions that Electronic Arts will throw on the market in a few months (after all, the absence of Russia and naval units cannot be explained otherwise). Objectives achieved? In conclusion, Generals is a difficult title to interpret: an excellent game which however lacks the objective of the masterpiece, above all due to an underlying indecision, its inability to choose a path and follow it to the end. Remain faithful to the C&C tradition or give a completely new, more realistic steering? Generals abandons the classic charisma, irony and style of C&C for more current, ~serious~ and dramatic scenarios - the whole scenographic system aims at this (starting from the spectacular 3D graphics) - but fails to do it to the end and above all it maintains a gameplay traced verbatim from a series that has long needed more radical innovations. Certainly there is some news but, as mentioned, from the point of view of playability, invention, the commitment required of the player Red Alert 2 remains ahead. Do not expect revolutions below the surface, much less a demanding title or with enormous strategic depth. However, it remains a recommended title for its immediacy and spectacularity", "date": "2003-03-10", "grade": null}
