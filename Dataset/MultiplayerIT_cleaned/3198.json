Several arrive every year, and clearly only those that can guarantee an economic return: the software houses don't do charity, and this is a truth. Another truth: not all of these productions manage to aspire to little more than mere sufficiency. Finally, sometimes we get to face hybrid cases: hybrids like My Hero One's Justice 2. Which is not to be thrown away, it is not to be praised, and let's be honest: it wasn't even that necessary, considering that the predecessor arrived on the market just in the winter of 2018. Not even the time to carry too far the plot of the manga and the anime from which to start, in short: the prestigious and appreciated My Hero Academia. Let's analyze the situation better, however: and you will understand why for fans it could still be an excellent opportunity to return to the company of Izuku Midoriya, All Might and company. Storyline and Single Player The narration of My Hero One's Justice 2 picks up exactly where its predecessor left off about a year and a few months ago; you can find some more details in the excellent review of My Hero One's Justice by Christian Colli. The same, identical ways of telling the story also return: manga tables accompanied by stills from the anime, with the narrative voice in Japanese and the texts on the screen in Italian. The latter are appreciated and almost obligatory, given the very high number of fans that My Hero Academia also boasts in our country. The plot begins with the clash between All Might and All For One and the recovery of Bakugo, with all the responsibilities that take over the life of the young Deku (by Izuku Midoriya, the protagonist in short). After the battle between good and bad, the Hero Association realizes that it is better to keep the pupils under their protection, and they transfer the entire 1-A class of Yuei High to the boarding school. From here on, chapter by chapter, the player can experience their adventures (and especially their clashes). A very original idea is the one that allows you to replay the individual episodes of the Single Player mode by changing the perspective each time: from the protagonist of the actual story to the supporting or secondary characters, thus deepening various aspects and side events of a single unfolding of the events. Clearly the underlying mechanism is rather open: with the excuse of ~offering more~ in reality the production tries to exploit the original material of the starting anime as much as possible, which otherwise would run out much more quickly. It is worth mentioning that My Hero Academia is an ongoing manga/anime, and that the previous video game in the series was released by Bandai Namco just over a year ago. Playstation 4 trophies My Hero One's Justice 2 has many prestigious Trophies on PlayStation 4, including the coveted Platinum Trophy. Beyond the completion of the story mode, you will have to spend a lot of time in Missions and Arcade, more than you probably want. However, at least as far as we have seen, no special skills seem to be necessary: it's all a matter of patience and dedication. Game mode The main story and the single player adventure represent almost all that My Hero One's Justice 2 has to offer. But there are other game modes, organized (for once) in a main menu as clean and rationally managed as stylistically inviting. A lineup of items will make you understand right away what you can ask (and what you can't ask) of the production once again created by the Byking developers. At the end of the list you will also find a precious gallery dedicated to images, audio tracks and even the dubbing voices of the individual heroes and enemies of the series. For example, the Mission Mode: a sort of small strategic game managed on boards, which recall an absolutely non-existent role-playing component from afar. It is nothing more than clashes and discounts and clashes between all the characters on the roster (there are many, fortunately) in the various game settings present, with the excuse of unlocking bonus accessories to equip, or coins to spend to buy more . All with a vague ~level up~ that should make the learning curve more interesting, without succeeding. There is also local multiplayer and not even online, both under the label of Versus Mode. The multi-purpose compartmenter locally is actually interesting, because it doesn't just allow you to challenge your friend in the classic 1 VS 1 mode that you might think. If desired, it is possible to challenge the CPU, but still playing in two: the first user controls the real hero, the second the support characters that the latter can call after loading the respective team bars. On one condition: the support can never inflict the coup de grace on the enemy. The online multiplayer sector is fundamental, which allows you to challenge players from all over the world. Unfortunately, Italians are currently in short supply (and it is normal, given that the launch date is today). To make matters worse, as we will see, a completely disproportionate combat system takes care of it, which favors only a part of the heroes present in the game, and specifically certain ranged attacks of the latter. Gameplay and fights Just like its predecessor, My Hero One's Justice 2 also embraces the gameplay of arena fighters: two challengers in a more or less restricted, more or less detailed, more or less destructible environment. The aim is obviously to beat up the enemy until his health bar is empty. Camera handling has been improved compared to the first installment of the franchise, but not as much as we would have liked; furthermore, the zoom on the heroes does not always seem to have clear ideas, now approaching for no reason, now moving too far away. No striking news even for the combat system itself, still managed between simple attacks, dodges and Quirks, that is, the special moves supplied to the heroes of My Hero Academia. The clashes are often resolved in a race for the most effective and powerful Quirks, some of which are able to ignore any type of enemy defense, thus allowing a devastating sequence of shots to be chained together. The overall balance really leaves something to be desired, with a disproportion between the heroes that immediately catches the eye right from the tutorial (seeing is believing). It was these flaws that were not lacking even in the first My Hero One's Justice, to be picky. On the good side there are the cel shading graphics that are simply perfect for the style of the anime, an all in all decent technical sector and the spectacular nature of the special moves. Performing Plus Ultra techniques is truly a feast for the eyes, whatever combo it is. These are non-negligible aspects, and the attention to their details makes perfect sense: My Hero One's Justice 2 is mainly a title linked to the fanservice, a tie-in that is also simply justified by the desire of fans to have more, more and more My hero academia.", "date": "2020-03-13", "grade": "6.5"}
