Speaking of video games, there are many titles that lack the sense of discovery despite being theoretically set in the immensity of the cosmos, while a good war is not denied to anyone. Star Conflict is already channeled from the title in the wake of the most classic space shooters. Someone looking at the pictures might want to mention EVE Online. Better not to, because despite some elements in common, here the breadth of the title of CCP is almost completely missing, much more complete in every direction. Let's say that the goal of Star Conflict is to be a good free-to-play space MMO with lots of fights and items for you to buy. Nothing too demanding as a whole, clear disengagement even looking at the narrative side, poor and superficial enough to be useless. It doesn't matter, because the promises made by the developers were different and those have been kept, that is to offer a title full of PvP and PvE fights with the wide possibility of customizing your own spaceship, a node in which the side enters the field in an overbearing way economic, which we will discuss later. Space trails The first games of Star Conflict are a real show. It is difficult not to notice the beauty of the maps, which stands out all the more when we are faced with a title with free access. It's a pleasure just to watch the gigantic space stations surrounded by asteroids and planets with brilliant colors, which come to life when the fights start, with laser shots that shoot everywhere and explosions that break the poetry of the cosmic silence. The player-driven spaceships are also very beautiful and, despite the customization possibilities, they enjoy an excellent level of detail, magnified when they explode when hit by missiles and lasers. In short, the many sectors (we are talking about dozens) of which Star Conflict is made up all offer, more or less, something that is worth visiting even just to admire them. Of course, don't look for realism in it, because there really isn't any here. Obviously such beauty would be of little use if the various elements from which the scenarios are made did not have their own playful function. For example, in gameplay it is common practice to use asteroids to stop missiles or to fool queued enemies, while the bases themselves are formed in such a way as to offer various approaches to the hot spots of the maps of the various modes. Too bad only for the aforementioned lack of a narrative side worthy of the name that makes each operation an end in itself and decontextualized. In the end it all boils down to a wild race to accumulate resources to have the most beautiful spaceship of the others. A kind of competition of beauty and physical prowess of the vehicles, which translates into the usual gold rush, i.e. the raiding of the nearest ruins. Will the space fights of Star Conflict have managed to hit the mark? We are always there Speaking of the actual game mechanics, we can only note their absolute lack of a minimum of originality. We understand that it is a free product and we also understand that it is not easy to innovate a genre like this, but in certain moments Star Conflict looks like a War Thunder set in space. We have not mentioned Gaijin's most famous title by chance, since the two seem to share a large part of the physical model, and the behavior of the Star Conflict spaceships is very similar to that of the War Thunder planes. However, like any self-respecting free-to-play, even in Star Conflict the credit card is the most relevant mechanic of all. In the early hours, you don't notice much difference between paying and non-paying players, because everyone can get enough money playing to build a good ship. However, the process gradually becomes slower, up to the higher levels, when it becomes difficult to keep up with paid players. Of course, it is always possible to accumulate resources, but the hours of play expand dramatically, causing a discreet repetitive factor to take over in the action. Repetitiveness that translates into a sense of discouragement and a lack of motivation to stay and return to the game, given that the only glue is the personalization of your vehicle. Basically, after several hours, one realizes that either one pays, or one remains at stake, where stake is to be understood as the need to play quadruple the hours of others in order to have enough resources that allow one to purchase indispensable bonuses, such as chance to repair the spaceship and get back into actionimmediately in PvE.", "date": "2014-11-16", "grade": "7.0"}
