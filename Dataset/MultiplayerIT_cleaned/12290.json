{"name": "Time Crisis Mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/time-crisis-mobile.html", "text": "Of the many ~impossible conversions~ we've gotten to play on mobile phones, Time Crisis Mobile is undoubtedly one of the most absurd on paper. How can a product that based its entire reason for existing on the use of the mythical infrared gun, manage to make sense on the keyboard of a mobile phone? Well, incredibly, the result is not only convincing, but also very entertaining and valid. The concept on which the programmers have based this edition of the famous Namco brand is decidedly simple; the screen is in fact divided by a 3x3 grid which forms 9 equal squares, each of which is associated with a cell phone key. The result is that pressing one of the various keys is equivalent to shooting inside the square associated with it, thus filling any enemy in front of you with bullets. The 0 key, on the other hand, is used to alternate the firing phases with those of ~cover~ in which to take cover behind objects to avoid being hit and to reload the weapon. In reality there is also an alternative control method, which uses a cursor to move freely on the screen, but the result is so demeaning as to make it completely useless. On the contrary, the main solution, as we have said, constitutes an effective meeting point between the original experience and the real capabilities of a mobile phone. We forgot to talk about the story of the main mode, even if in reality it is so trivial that it could be done without it; in practice, in the role of a special agent we must infiltrate a terrorist base by eliminating hundreds of enemies until we reach the final boss. That's all. Fortunately, the graphic component is not as trivial as the plot, and indeed can show off a complex 3D graphics engine capable of rendering rather detailed settings and well-recognizable characters moved by convincing animations; the price to pay is unfortunately a low frame rate, but all in all acceptable given the nature of the game. On the other hand, the sound is bad, with annoying songs like few others and completely absent sound effects. The overall duration of the adventure is good, while there is no multiplayer mode, but perhaps that would have been too much to ask...
