In fact, in a chaos of flatness, the Grasshopper Manufacture productions stand out clearly, winking at the gamers of the old guard with quotes, sequences full of madness and damned ~hardcore~ situations. In the case of Lollipop Chainsaw, think about what good old Suda51 came up with: an attractive San Romero High School cheerleader, Juliet Starling, who comes from a family of zombie hunters and never goes around without her trusty chainsaw. he finds himself on his eighteenth birthday facing an invasion of the undead. In fact, it seems that most of the students of the school have been transformed into the living dead, and it was also Nick, Juliet's boyfriend, who was bitten while waiting for her to go to class. Among the girl's innumerable resources there is also the knowledge of some particular rituals, and so Nick is ~saved~ from the infection but reduced to a talking head like those seen in the ~Futurama~ series. The irresistible hero / mascot combination already appreciated in Shadows of the Damned is therefore recreated, which gives life to a series of truly hilarious gags, thanks above all to the voice actors, respectively Tara Strong and Michael Rosenbaum (yes, the actor who played Lex Luthor in ~Smallville~...). It would have been extraordinary to see the game localized in Italian also in the dialogues, but we realize that a cast with counter-flaws was needed to hold the comparison with the original audio, so we are happy to settle for the subtitles. Hooking Nick's head to her belt, as if it were a fashion accessory, Juliet discovers that the invasion is the work of Swan, a former classmate of hers, who has decided to take revenge for the wrongs he suffered at school by opening a portal to a corrupted reality and dark, whose influence is capable of turning ordinary people into gruesome creatures. Zed is dead, baby, he's dead Lollipop Chainsaw's story mode develops through five ~thematic~ chapters (plus the final boss fight), which culminate in the confrontation with the ~lords of darkness~ evoked by Swan. Each of these adversaries is associated with a different musical genre: Zed, armed with a club, is a fan of punk-rock and will attack us using huge amplified speakers; Vikke, with her huge axe, is the king of viking-metal and controls lightning from her flying vessel; Josey, keytar on his shoulder, loves funk and electronic weapons; Mariska, capable of confusing us thanks to hallucinogenic mushrooms, is devoted to 70s psychedelia; Lewis, a hard rock enthusiast, will try to hit us with a machine-gun guitar as he whizzes by on his powerful motorcycle. In short, music is a constant in the game and accompanies our actions in an effective and fun way, thanks also to the contribution of interesting alternative artists (see Jimmy Urine of Mindless Self Indulgence), which completes the picture of an unconventional audio sector, highly enjoyable . In terms of gameplay, the experience offered is that of a typical third-person action game (can we call it a ~scrolling beat'em up~?) in which we have to make our way through hordes of zombies using a myriad of unlockable combos, as we collect coins, at some convenient ~shops~ scattered around the locations. From this point of view, the experience is very close to that offered by No More Heroes, as it is characterized by an excellent sensation of impact, which enhances our shots and makes it fun to beat your hands at any time, but at the same time it is spoiled by big problems with the management of the view and by an ~old gen~ conception of the scenario, only minimally interactable. From a graphic point of view, there is a step backwards compared to the ~precision~ of Shadows of the Damned, although even there the scenarios lacked interactivity. The application of a sort of dithering creates a pleasant ~comic effect~ and some solutions are really fantastic (the stages based on retrogaming, for example, which mention Pac-Man and Rolling Thunder), but in general there is little care for the outline: the protagonist is very well drawn and animated, but the same cannot be said of the students she finds herself rescuing along the way, and in the end we inevitably move between ups and downs. Xbox 360 goals Apart from the 100 gamer points that are assigned to you if you complete the story mode by obtaining the ~good~ ending, the Objectives present in Lollipop Chainsaw are quite numerous (fifty) and to obtain them all it will be necessary to dissect the game in all its facets. Not just defeating bosses and completing ilevels therefore, but also obtaining all the power-ups, objects, collectibles and so on, as well as bringing the zombie elimination counter to levels that are difficult to reach. The girl with the lollipop As mentioned above, Juliet is armed with a powerful chainsaw and can eliminate enemies using an ever-growing repertoire of moves. However, the undead infest the entire area of San Romero High School and generally do not succumb to two pats, so you will have to literally tear them apart for them to disappear from the scene. The control system sees us attacking with pom-poms by pressing the X button, hitting high with the chainsaw using the Y button, sawing off the enemies' legs with the A button and finally resorting to the B button to carry out an effective evasive maneuver or jump. Unfortunately it is not possible to change the controls and at first it will be hard to get used to the fact that you don't jump by pressing the A button, but the combinations of shots are numerous and highly spectacular, and the fact that the zombies do not give up, always giving us a hard time and putting us in difficulty, it helps to create a good level of challenge. Too bad that the relative abundance of lollipops (which fully restore Juliet's energy) makes it quite easy, especially for the most savvy gamers, to conclude the adventure within five or six hours. Let's also say that the work done by the developers on the combos could have been more incisive, in the sense that very often, to quickly end the fights, we find ourselves performing a flying kick on the zombies so as to stun them and then simply sink them with a single blow of the chainsaw to decapitate them. However, the more complex combinations prove to be important in excited situations, in melees and during boss fights, therefore we can speak of a half-reached goal. There are also many variations on the theme, especially in the area of quick time events, as well as extra modules that transform the cheerleader's chainsaw into a cannon or a sort of powerful scooter. In the first case, however, it is absolutely necessary to deactivate the automatic aim, which really creates great disasters and always ends up framing targets other than those in front of us.", "date": "2012-06-16", "grade": "7.7"}
