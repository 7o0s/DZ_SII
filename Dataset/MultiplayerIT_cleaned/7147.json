{"name": "Uno spavento a caso", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/131323-daylight-uno-spavento-a-caso.html", "text": "Announced last year and released slightly later than the original plans, the Zombie Studios project has finally seen the light... if we can speak of light, considering the context. The Daylight experience starts with at least a couple of great ideas. First of all, the smartphone, which the protagonist of the game uses to navigate the constant darkness of the settings and to orient herself thanks to the map that appears on the screen of the device. The mysterious voice that guides us also comes from the telephone, so it is a solution that solves various narrative needs in one go, making the situation we are in plausible, that of fugitives in a hostile and gloomy environment, which seems inhabited by spirits. Secondly, the procedural nature of the game, powered by the powerful Unreal Engine 4. What does that mean exactly? That every game with Daylight is different from the other, and not only for the position of the ~enemies~ within the locations, but precisely for the conformation of the scenarios. There is no guide that can tell you what to do and where to go, because the story that is written is different from time to time, net of a common thread which is that of the objects with which we have to interact and the areas of the map that we have to reach to access the ~next stage~. Daylight puts some interesting ideas on the table, full of potential that remains untapped Alone in the dark If Zombie Studios' goal was to make a ~random chair jump generator~, we can safely say that it has been achieved. In Daylight, fear is the order of the day, perhaps emphasized by use in the dark and with a good pair of headphones. Did something move in front of us or was it just an impression? Did that drawer open by itself or was someone there? What the hell is the noise rumbling behind us? Situations of this kind are expertly dosed throughout the adventure, which is made even more engaging by the use of the first-person view and by the gimmicks we mentioned at the beginning. The controls are kept to a minimum (although the developers deserve an earful for not modifying the interface of the PC version adapting it to the use of the Xbox 360 controller - but don't worry, the device is perfectly supported), as well as the interaction with what surrounds us is limited, except for the aforementioned objects and certain mechanisms, highlighted when we turn on one of the lightsticks that are around. If you've tried Outlast, to take a recent example, know that Daylight is basically the same type of survival horror. This means that in the game it is not possible to face possible threats but only to escape from them, with two exceptions that are placed at the antipodes: when we use a flare, given that the fire seems not to be appreciated by the ~witches~ who sometimes chase us in corridors; and when we collect one of the ~keys~ which are used to open a passage to the next area, which prevent us from holding other objects with the left hand in the meantime, thus making us completely vulnerable. The Ring Painted like this, Daylight would appear to be a decidedly hardcore and in many ways original experience. In reality, the degree of challenge of the game is not high, and unfortunately realizing it substantially reduces the load of tension that it is capable of transmitting. When the protagonist's smartphone throws a tantrum and a witch appears behind us, in fact, just move quickly (or turn on a flare, as already mentioned) to stay alive and continue exploring. It is rather the exploratory phase itself that creates some headaches, because it is necessary to pay attention to each room and each wall to find the clues that allow us to make the portals appear and subsequently to cross them; with the risk of doing a lot of backtracking where things don't go as planned. All these elements contribute to the composition of a structure that is ultimately very simple, which lacks the necessary facets for the experience to gain depth and meaning. Things that, to reiterate the comparison, are present in abundance in Outlast. In short, the feeling is that Daylight presents itself as a solid starting point for projects that are still to come; a product that guarantees situations that are always different but whose bite diminishes after the first round, which moreover is completed in just a couple of hours (abundant or less depending on your luck in coming across the clues). The expectations towards the Unreal Engine are also disregarded, in this specific casecool: there's little in the darkness of the environments (from the initial building chambers to the dungeons, ending in the woods) that makes you cry for a miracle, and the amount of graphical adjustments present on PC (which also include advanced ambient occlusion technology on NVIDIA cards, as well as a slider for visual distance) do not seem to influence a technical sector that perhaps would have needed different contexts to stand out. Nothing to say on the other hand about the sound, functional to the action and well recited in the dialogues (in English).", "date": "2014-05-02", "grade": "6.3"}
