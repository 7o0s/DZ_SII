{"name": "Echelon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/echelon.html", "text": "The craziest plane in the world. I'm sure many of you know the Cowboy Beebop animated series, after all, according to some, the by-products of the hacker culture of the last decade (basically us) are all equally passionate about Japanese video games, RPGs and anime. Well, the aircraft that you will find yourself piloting in this unusual ~simulation~ look just like the single-seat fighters with the bizarre mecha-design of the animated series that I just mentioned. In other words, we will have small, extremely manoeuvrable aircraft equipped with multiple jet engines, capable of remaining suspended in the air thanks to simple upward thrust. Starting from this assumption, it must be admitted that Buka's graphics have taken more than a few ~poetic~ licenses in modeling the various jets, which turn out to be the pure antithesis of the concept of aerodynamics... Mind you, not all ~planes~ are simple fighters for dogfighting, and there is no shortage of bombers of a certain size, but even observing the latter, one would not expect that with such a shape they could take flight What a physique! The physical model of the game certainly does not aspire to the perfect imitation of reality, but it is curious to note how some aspects of it have been reproduced quite faithfully (inertia, gravity, angular momentum of the forces), while others seem to have been ignored, just to simplify the things. For example, it is absolutely impossible to ~stall~ with your vehicle and you do not feel the slightest difference even driving it at maximum speed, upside down and a few meters from the ground! In short, one has the feeling of piloting a Tie Fighter in deep space, which is not likely, although it makes life a lot easier for the pilot. Having said that, it is impossible to deny that the gameplay resulting from this game setting is extraordinarily fun, with frantic aerial confrontations and chases through narrow canyon gorges, as we desperately fight to maintain the plane's attitude, despite the wingtips that touch the walls. If the programmers were really inspired by the amazing maneuvers of Spike and his Swordfish (rather than Tom Cruise and his Tomcat), then there is nothing to complain, the goal has been achieved. What a physique! In this regard, the approach that the programmers wanted to give to dogfights should be underlined. Those who know a minimum of modern military aviation will know that current instruments are capable of identifying an enemy miles and miles away. At that point, in the vast majority of cases, the ~duels~ are resolved with a missile launched by whoever sees the opponent first and with a tiny and distant explosion from the latter. In a video game, where adrenaline is everything, this would be extremely boring and in fact even the most famous simulations of the past (think of F22 Air Dominance Fighter) have tried to tip the balance in favor of close-range combat. In the case of Echelon, the use of missiles has been reduced to a minimum: it is possible to stow a considerable quantity of air-to-ground rockets, useful in ground attack missions, but practically useless in situations of aerial confrontation, in which case it is indispensable that the missile is homing and it is really rare to have a manageable vehicle capable of carrying more than two. From this it can be deduced that almost all confrontations with enemy planes are resolved thanks to the machine guns, it does not matter if with simple, explosive or energy projectiles. Give it to the alien AI! The game, set on the planet Rockada IV, sees the advent of the classic invasion of xenophobic aliens, which of course in the single player mode will be controlled by the CPU. I must confess that, not being a ~real~ dogfighting expert, I had some difficulty in evaluating the goodness of some maneuvers of the enemies which, frankly, left me somewhat dumbfounded. Consequently, as a yardstick I simply considered the level of challenge that this behavior was able to guarantee. Now, there is no real difficulty selection for the solo campaign, while it is possible to configure the abilities of the bots in a sort of skirmish mode. Well the ~novice~ level (which I suspect is the default one of the campaign) puts us in front of opponents that are already challenging enough for a beginner, but it is not uncommon to see them engage in suicidal actions that I honestly don't know how not to define absurd. Give it to the alien AI! For example one of theThe enemy's most refined tactics is to come at you at maximum speed, shooting wildly and ending up ramming you, causing both planes to suddenly explode... The ~advance~ level on the contrary is certainly more complex, but also more plausible . Enemies don't follow a linear trajectory and don't rush at you, but dart around the screen trying to outrun you, making daring dives and nose-ups towards the ground to outrun your missiles and trick you into following them, risking crashing. In conclusion, you may be disappointed by the AI playing the single-player campaign, while in the Arena Deathmatch you will find enemies absolutely up to the task and consequentlymore fun! A disappointing graphics Needless to mince words, the graphics of this title seem at least a couple of years old. Even activating all the available effects, the textures remain faded (especially those of the ground) and the level of detail stands at low levels due to the drastically low number of polygons used. After all, the hardware specifications speak for themselves; to run Echelon decently, a 266 Mhz P2 with a 3D card is sufficient, which will make the happiness of those who have a slightly dated PC but does not allow even the most widespread hardware to be exploited properly, let alone the latest one generation! In order to appreciate the game you will therefore have to forcibly fly over the elementary geometries of the planes and buildings, not to mention the chronic monotony of the landscape and the usual, annoying and very heavy ~fog~ that hides (not even so well) the bad clipping of the engine. and totally anonymous sound. Even on the audio front, no one seems to have lost sleep over preparing something appreciable. The musical themes are absolutely not up to the current standard, to the point that often the tracks (at times unpleasant and out of place) start in a completely unexpected way after minutes of silence, or ~detaching~ clearly from the previous ones. As for the effects, they are so repetitive as to be almost annoying, especially the radio voice of the speaker, who always repeats the same futile messages (there are 3 of them) which, however, being rather out of line, certainly do not contribute to creating atmosphere. Luckily after a while you don't notice anymore... Let's sum up Echelon belongs to a genre that hasn't had many novelties on the shelves lately and consequently it is inevitable that it has ended up attracting the attention of all cloche enthusiasts, left to their own devices for all these months (remember that in the USA the game has already sold several tens of thousands of copies). My opinion is that this game may be worth buying only once its obvious technical imperfections have been considered and that it is neither a complete flight simulation, nor vice versa a trivial ~spatial~ game in which with just a few keys it is possible to master the aircraft. Let's sum up This could discourage the hopeful buyer, but I assure you that under its hard shell Echelon hides a decidedly tasty pulp, with a single-player campaign perhaps not very original, but still well done, and the Deathmatch Arena mode capable of keeping you glued to the joystick for hours, such is the fun it can provide. Which is just the prelude to an excellent multiplayer experience, since the title supports up to 48 users connected via the internet. But be careful, because to date I don't know that there are game servers here in Italy and the only way could be to connect to the American ones. How many simulations came out between here and a year ago? Few, very few, and speaking of flight simulations, the last noteworthy one that comes to mind was Falcon 4.0, a qualitatively exceptional product which however represented the testament of a genre that seems to have lost the attention of gamers ( or that of the developers, you decide). The present Echelon is proposed to the public not as a ~classic~ simulation, but as the right middle ground capable of satisfying both the most skilled aces of the skies and the beardless pilots accustomed to more goliardically arcade titles. The point is whether the fruit of this umpteenth mix of different genres is actually a valid product. Let's find out.", "date": "2001-12-28", "grade": null}
