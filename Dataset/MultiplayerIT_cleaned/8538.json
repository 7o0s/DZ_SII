{"name": "Dalla parte degli zombie", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/102979-brainsss-dalla-parte-degli-zombie.html", "text": "The origin of the indestructible marriage between the undead and videogame players is almost lost in the mists of time; over the various generations of skilled hardware developers have been able to grasp this passion by bringing to light true masterpieces of entertainment but, above all, gratuitous violence and hectoliters of blood. The presence of zombies, which in these productions usually had the role of those to be quartered/massacred, also had the undoubted merit of making even the most heinous of killings seem politically correct, as always carried out in the name of the ~salvation of humanity~. ~. However, the point of view of the fetid creatures, remaining at least on a purely videogame level, has never been fully analyzed in depth; imagining the reason for this choice is certainly not difficult, given that at first glance it does not seem particularly fun to impersonate putrefied bodies that move slowly in search of human flesh. After so many years of sacrifices and oblivion, Brainsss tries to restore dignity to these poor self-propelled corpses, prompting the player to try to make the human race extinct. Encircle the human! In Brainsss the ultimate goal is therefore to infest and ~convert~ as many healthy people as possible in order to strengthen one's army of undead. The only method to obtain such a result is that, according to custom, to attack and bite humans, thus transmitting the ~zombiefying~ virus. The setting chosen for the game approach is that of a real-time strategy game, starting right from the top-down perspective view set by default; unlike the classic RTS, however, there are no resources to accumulate to create troops. In fact, the expansion of one's horde depends entirely on the tactical choices made during the action: the zombies, guided by the skillful ~tap~ of the player, try to grab the civilians scattered around the game map, chasing them on foot. Obviously human beings are generally faster than their dangerous assailants, which is why it is certainly not enough to send the troops of the underworld in reckless pursuit; the best tactic to be able to grab the fugitives is therefore that of encirclement. Each game level is made up of several and quite varied structures, connected by streets and alleys; thanks to the particular level design it will certainly not be difficult to surround a building and thus block the streets, trapping humans. The zombies, once selected, can be divided into two or more groups (compatibly with their initial number), to try to cover as much territory as possible; every minute or so they have an additional power at their disposal, anger, useful for increasing their speed, strength and resistance. The more advanced internships obviously offer a greater challenge than the first ones (which are basically tutorials), due to the inevitable resistance that even men will try to oppose to the invasion: civilians, for example, will tend to regroup and will be helped by some brave policemen, armed and very dangerous. In this case, before starting the definitive encirclement maneuvers, it is good to increase your group of zombies, looking for the most isolated (as well as unwary) individuals hidden in many parts of the map; to kill the policemen while saving the ~non-life~ it is instead necessary to attack them from behind, without being discovered. The final score is given by the achievement of the level objectives but above all by the shortest time taken to obtain them; then there is an internal shop in which it is possible to buy upgrades both with in-game currency and with real money, thus continuing in the not very sporty groove of microtransactions that lead to ~cheating~. The major criticalities of Brainsss are unfortunately found in the ~two-finger~ control system, cumbersome to control at least initially, and in the risk of ending the games in the most complete confusion of ~all against all~, setting aside tactical reasoning and limiting thus all to an aggression of ~quantity~ without criterion. The technical aspect certainly doesn't shine for beauty or richness of details; However, the whole game is pervaded by a very humorous atmosphere, also thanks to the nice background music and the cartoon-style graphics, with the characters just sketched out. The levels available initially are not very many, but already in these hours free updates are about to be released that can greatly increase longevity.", "date": "2012-05-14", "grade": "6.5"}
