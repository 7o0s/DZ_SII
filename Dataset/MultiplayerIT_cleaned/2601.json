{"name": "American McGee's Alice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/american-mcgees-alice.html", "text": "Introduction ~I conceived Alice as a combination of many game ideas, ideas that I set out to use to create a fantasy world in which the usual rules and laws of physics did not apply and in which to set the actions of a new Alice.~ ~I'm aware that I got something good from Alice's story,~ - McGee recalls - ~and the first thing I did was write the text and design the documents and then start working on the idea~. During the production of the Alice game, a number of freelance artists were hired and brought their own input to the project. Alice slowly began to take on a specific look of her own, due to every single member of the creative team. Says McGee: ~The entire creative process to produce the game has been both personally and professionally satisfying. I've tried to create a universe and then a whole set of characters, interactions and plot points that I wanted to be part of of Alice's game. Within this framework, I gave the designers free rein, telling them that they could really do what they wanted with this product. The result is a production that is the result of intense collaboration.~ One of the most amazing things about the evolution of the Alice game is that I wake up almost every morning with a new idea, enthuses McGee. ~This thing is like magic - I've never seen an idea that lends itself to being turned into a computer game so completely. The world of 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' falls perfectly within the context of an intriguing and inviting computer game. We can twist reality at will, we can create fantastic roles that no one has ever seen before, and still be within the confines of the Wonderland universe. This has been an astounding experience. And it is from this enthusiasm and with these goals that American McGee's Alice was born, and landed on our computer monitors. Now let's see what this project has actually produced and let's analyze the game well. Alice is essentially a ~Tomb Raider~ game that relies on the valid graphics engine of Quake III Arena, making full use of it and proposing numerous light effects calculated in real time and settings that exploit particle games and the like. As in the Eidos game, we will have to command our character through third-person management to do our utmost to jump on platforms, overcome precipices and eliminate every enemy that appears in front of us, all while we will be immersed in a dream world in which ~everything is moves~; in fact, as we already announced during the preview, the ~Wonderland~ is immersed in a truly unique dynamism and it is rare to find yourself in front of a landscape in which you cannot appreciate the blossoming of a flower or the movement of some complex mechanism. The setting is therefore one of the strong points of this title, and it is one of the reasons that pushes the player to continue in the proposed adventure in order to find out what incredible scheme will be proposed, and I must admit that on rare occasions one is disappointed by this that awaits us. The ~Wonderland~ that is proposed to us by the game is however ~slightly~ different from the one to which our mother has accustomed us with her nocturnal fairy tales or Disney with her cartoons... Our Alice, traumatized after the house fire and the loss of the family, has somewhat reworked his conception of the ~world beyond the looking glass~ making it a dark-punk place where the Cheshire Cat has tattoos and an earring and the White Rabbit has two possessed eyes, and is this distorted and gloomy place that we will have to guide our protagonist in order to allow her to regain the lost serenity ... During the game we will collect valuable information (which I obviously avoid telling you! ^_^ ) on why the ~Wonderland~ has changed and on the state of mind and the psychological problems that afflict poor Alice, and we will have as our ultimate goal the salvation of both this world and our psyche. In order to overcome the obstacles that pervade the various levels of the game, we will be able to rely on a fierce Alice with an armament that we could define as a cross between Inspector Gadget's kit and Jack the Ripper's inventory. In fact, our ~poor~ girl will begin the adventure armed with a lethal cutlass which she will use meticulously to decapitate and saw her enemies in two, and will see her offensive capacity increase by using increasingly devastating weapons including aA deck of sharp cards, an electrified stick and a ~puppet~ that will function as a bomb and flame thrower. Each weapon will have two fire modes (usually for close range / distance) and some will hide real surprises, such as the dice which, every time they are thrown, allow the summoning of a small demon from another size, a creature that will change according to the number obtained on the faces of the dice... faces that if they turn out to be equal to 666 will summon a frightening monster on the ~Wonderland~ that will raze everything to the ground, including Alice (I, after hours of trying, the demon I haven't seen it...I hope you are luckier! ^_^ ) To help Alice in her journey there will also be some power-ups that will transform our protagonist into an aberration making her similar to a demon or a monstrous insect and temporarily granting her force, speed, or dazzling abilities. The evolution of the game is set through a skilful plot that will gradually introduce us to all the classic characters of the book in their new aspects and with their renewed personalities and which will reserve us many surprises about what is happening. To guide us during our journey will be the Cheshire Cat who will not miss an opportunity to give us some advice, and who we will be able to call to our side by simply pressing a button. But is all that glitters gold in Alice? We'd like to answer yes, but even in this good product there are a couple of ~problems~ that we will now list and explain. First, but not least, is given by the difficulty of the game: for heaven's sake, a difficult game is always better than one that is too simple and that you can finish in a few hours, but in Alice the difficulty does not lie so much in the puzzles to solve (however few) or in the enemies to beat, but in the fact that a minimal mistake while walking on the scenario is enough to see yourself dead. In fact, it is quite frustrating, in some parts of the game, to repeat the same scene over and over again because you jumped a little too much to the right of the ravine or a little too much under the waterfall... It should be noted, however, that with wise use of the fast save and fast load button these problems are overcome brilliantly, but a less intense use of saving and loading would have been desirable in the face of a better calibrated difficulty of some situations. Another small point of demerit of Alice lies in some programming errors that see us, even if in a very rare way, trapped in the environment that surrounds us without having the possibility of ~uncracking~ forcing us to reload the last saved position. Musically speaking, Alice is really pleasant just to listen to. There are numerous pieces of music that skilfully underline the situations in which we find ourselves. We remind you that the soundtrack of Alice was created by Chris Vrenna (former member of Nine Inch Nails) and that the second CD of the game will contain audio tracks that can be listened to (in the CDs I have viewed they were not present but they swore to me that there will be ). The audio channels are well managed and even with simple stereo the position of origin of the sounds is well reproduced. Alice must die Let us now say a few words about Alice's enemies; in the preview phase it was said that their AI was limited to a ~find-the-enemy-and-download-the-arsenal~ but after spending a good few hours of playing we can give a slightly better evaluation to their behavior. The spirit of initiative of our antagonists and their tactics always remain at low levels but as we progress in the game we notice some improvements: when some ~monsters~ are injured they try to flee or regroup and certain ~end-of-level monsters~ are really difficult and only with a well-defined tactic you can get the better of it. As far as the puzzles in the game are concerned, we note that they are very few and quick and easy to solve, and there are no ~choice~ possibilities that are given during the adventure; in fact, we will not have the ~right to speak~ about what happens but we will only be called to continue the plot that is proposed to us without being able to change its progress in any way. The inclusion of at least some sort of crossroads would have been desirable and would certainly have made the game longer. In conclusion, we can evaluate this title positively by indicating its strengths in the graphics and sound and also by indicating its value in its longevity: in fact, the game requires (if played on an average difficulty level) quite a few hours to be concluded, even if, like all games of the genre, a vOnce it's finished you don't have the urge to play it all over again, at least not right away. As a point of demerit we can indicate the one given by the lack of a multiplayer game mode, which would certainly have given added value to the product and the graphic defects mentioned above.

Before starting to talk about the game, I want to bring you some excerpts from some interviews made to Mr. McGee in order to make you understand in which atmosphere and with what objectives the development of this product was tackled, so let's start with some information: ~When Mr. McGee moved from EA's Maxis Division (located in Walnut Creek, California) to the company's headquarters in Redwood City he brought with him the seeds of an idea regarding the development of new computer games, according to him, innovative, unique and fascinating, just like the bizarre, eccentric and colorful world created by the author Lewis Caroll in his books ~Alice in Wonderland~ and ~Through the Looking Glass~. The idea for the game, born during company change period, was perfected during a trip to the California coast between San Francisco and Los Angeles on Highway 1. As McGee explains ~it was a collection of different game ideas that flowed perfectly into the story and the universe of the Wonderland~. ~I've always liked children's fiction, especially its darker side,~ notes McGee, ~the sort of thing you find in Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Anderson fairy tales, but not the sanitized versions of the stories.~ popular today, but in the stories as they were originally written.~", "date": "2001-04-23", "grade": null}
