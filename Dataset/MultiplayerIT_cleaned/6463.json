{"name": "Il cecchino definitivo?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/147251-sniper-elite-iii-ultimate-edition-il-cecchino-definitivo.html", "text": "When we found ourselves reviewing Sniper Elite III last June, we undoubtedly appreciated the progress made by Rebellion for its flagship franchise, which has become less linear in its mechanics and even more profound from a tactical and stealth action point of view . At the same time, however, the game reiterated some of its historical shortcomings, in particular the lack of ability to be effective in traditional third-person shooter situations and a fluctuating artificial intelligence of enemies. Not even a year later, somewhat surprisingly, here is the debut of an Ultimate Edition that collects, in a single solution, the contents of the original edition and the DLCs, in this case the three missions of the extra campaign Save Churchill and six packs containing additional weapons. All at a relatively accessible price, which undoubtedly makes the opportunity tempting for those who, for one reason or another, had postponed the purchase of the game and can now grab it together with the extras and with a substantial discount. Back to Africa The skilled sniper Karl Fishburne, who has always been the protagonist of the Sniper Elite series, is engaged this time in the African campaign of the Second World War, determined to thwart the plans of the German army, based in this case on the development of a new weapon. The story mode of the game is reproposed as it is in the Ultimate Edition, with eight missions of variable duration, characterized by a tactical gameplay that in no case rewards frontal clashes, but rather urges you to study the scenario, identify enemies on the patrol with the binoculars and ~tag them~; then proceed to eliminate them as silently as possible, perhaps reaching behind them with the dagger, using the silenced pistol or activating mechanisms that produce the noise necessary to mask the shots from our sniper rifle. The mechanisms that regulate aiming from a distance, and which represent the most recognizable part of the Rebellion franchise, once again give us a solid mix of accessibility and realism, adding extra elements to consider (for example the wind) when choosing a difficulty level higher than intermediate. If the character has enough breath, you can also use the ~focus~, holding your breath to obtain a shot of astonishing precision, then leaving the spectacular kill cams to highlight the dramatic effects of the bullets on the body of the enemies, between bones that shatter and internal organs that go to pulp. One of the innovations introduced by Sniper Elite III lies in the extension of this aspect to vehicles, which have sensitive points to be hit to cause their breakdown or complete destruction. Sniper Elite III Ultimate Edition turns out to be a bit poor as the ~definitive edition~ Additional content The idea of a sort of GOTY Edition for Sniper Elite III would not have been bad at all, in the presence of additional content worthy of the name, capable of actually enriching the offer. Unfortunately, the three missions of the Save Churchill extra campaign are distinguished by a general lack of substance, given that the first two, in particular, can be completed in a matter of minutes and leave only a feeling of already seen, whereas the third mission adds a pinch of spice with the final showdown but nothing that hasn't already been extensively explored during the original story mode. The sensation, especially at first, is of a worsening of the difficulty due to the presence of electric motors and generators in hard-to-reach areas, which only leaves room for two possible approaches: a slow and cautious approach to the objectives or a series of head-on collisions . The same style characterizes the second part of the mini-campaign, especially towards the conclusion, with several enemy soldiers advancing and a tank providing them with assistance (eliminating us with a single shot, in case of interception) to mark the stages of an epilogue which must be tackled with a pinch of tactical intelligence, avoiding exposing yourself too much. The third and final mission, as already mentioned, is the most multifaceted and long-lasting, with various areas to explore in search of relatively challenging opponents and bosses. In general, however, the DLCs fall short of expectations and substantially diminish the value of the Ultimate Edition in the eyes of those who have already dealt with Sniper Elite III. Better to possibly focus on the multiplayer modes, which in the meantime have seen the release of six free maps and alternate rather interesting situations, such as the fun cooperative for four players, the survival (also to be played in co-op) and then the battcompetitive-based games for up to twelve participants. In the hope that the feedback for the new edition will be such as not to miss online users willing to challenge each other. Playstation 4 trophies For the release of Sniper Elite III Ultimate Edition, the developers have basically revived the Trophies of the original version and added some achievements for the extra missions of the Save Churchill campaign. Most of them are obtained simply by completing levels, but there is no shortage of alternative objectives, which involve for example eliminating certain opponents in a certain way. Technically speaking There have not been substantial improvements regarding the graphics of Sniper Elite III, which on PlayStation 4 runs at 1080p and 30 frames per second (not locked, which means that in some shots you will notice an increase in fluidity), although some drop during DLC missions. The polygonal models are of good quality and the kill cams are truly spectacular in their crudeness, but for the scenarios we limited ourselves to doing the homework, inserting a lot of hateful invisible walls, neglecting interaction and variety. The same flatness that afflicts the locations of the main campaign is found in ~Save Churchill~, together with some polygonal penetration problems and some glitches concerning the interaction between characters: try to kill an enemy going down a ladder with the dagger and you will see the good Karl perform the blow in mid-air, suspended in the air. Nothing dramatic, but we are quite far from the best that has been seen on next-gen platforms in the last year. Finally, the lack of a complete localization for the three extra missions, in which dialogues in Italian and English are alternated, is inexplicable. A pity, because Roberto Draghetti's interpretation in the original story mode had to be preserved and relaunched in the DLC.", "date": "2015-03-24", "grade": "7.2"}
