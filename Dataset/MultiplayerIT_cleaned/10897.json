In fact, on our Nintendo laptops we find ourselves chasing, far from metaphorically, the object of our desires to which we will have to prove our involvement by engaging in frenetic races and acrobatic jumps along an urban route full of obstacles and dangers, until we reach the final goal: the arms of the beloved. But is it worth all this effort? What if we risk never getting there? But will Felix eventually meet Felicity? Only if you are very patient. In order for everyone to live happily ever after, with the two delighted protagonists of the game, it is in fact necessary to put our skills as acrobatic players to the test, as well as our patience. The game begins with choosing which of the two characters to play in the story mode. The first step is to attend a brief (but not too much) introduction to the story, in which we are asked to put ourselves in the shoes of a rather depressed Felix or Felicity due to their difficulty in meeting their soul mate. But one non-rainy day Felix meets, collides with Felicity and so... we start running. Our coveted sweetheart, our sudden love at first sight is in fact particularly demanding and requires us, as a demonstration of our interest, to surprise him by reaching the place of the first appointment, obviously in a hurry. At this point we find ourselves facing the first six schemes of the first level of the game which we discover to be an unusual and frenetic platform with horizontal or vertical scrolling, depending on the framework. Through a skilful and timely use of the stylus and the push-button panel we will in fact have to cross the level of chance, drawing lines on the screen that will serve us as if they were a sort of impromptu paths to be used as shortcuts and avoiding or making pedestrians jump like skittles who, annoyed, will anything to get in our way. Obviously in the fastest possible way, before the painting engulfs us in the inexorable advance of the rain, which chases us. Game over, insert coins The game mechanics are extremely simple and it is more appropriate to define them as ~linear~, but Felix does not meet Felicity with equal simplicity. The game, which is certainly interesting and original and fits on the DS in a period in which two adjectives of this kind certainly highlight it, in fact proves to be far more demanding than a simple impromptu pastime. Although only apparently belonging to a category of titles aimed at a less self-confident audience, in fact, the product in question succeeds with a simple trick to whet the competitive vein of the more expert players. Those of the now almost disappeared coin-ops. Crossing the schemes, albeit brief, of Felix Meets Felicity is not easy unless you decide to overcome them without commitment. Which turns out to make little sense, being clearly a title based on the achievement and overcoming of records through the collection of points and coins located here and there almost everywhere. Coins that are not only used to complete the levels 100%, but above all to be able to guarantee the ~continue~ function which costs us the beauty of 30 doubloons. What does all this mean? That if we don't have them, and unfortunately we run out of our three ~lives~, we will find ourselves facing the ~game over~ and the need to start over. A not very attractive prospect, and which can easily lead to frustration for anyone expecting a title for immediate use: in fact, its complexity and difficulty condemn even the most skilled player to frustrating and continuous restarts. The ~point attack~ and ~time attack~ modes do not help which, although interesting, can only be unlocked after finishing the game in story mode. If you make it... Comment The Chase: Felix Meets Felicity is certainly an original title, while relying on well-known platform dynamics, but renewing them thanks to the dynamism granted by the skilful use of the DS stylus. Fresh, fun, it would certainly be a great product if it didn't suffer from the unfortunate choice of not having bailouts. The mere concession of a ~continue~ mode in the event of game over, through the collection of coins in the schemes, makes it accessible purely to an audience that loves the coin-op system, but certainly too frustrating instead for players less inclined to a necessary trial, error and restart from scratch mechanic of a game. Even the additional modes are inaccessible if you haven't completed the game, making it less attractive. To be recommended only to an audience that loves challenges of (great) patience.Pro Sunny, colourful, fun Well done graphics and sound Innovative and technically well done Against It has no saves Extra modes unlockable only by beating the game in ~story~", "date": "2009-02-03", "grade": null}
