{"name": "Fantasia senza limiti?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83361-create-fantasia-senza-limiti.html", "text": "Although we live in a videogame era in which productions characterized by realistic graphics and with quite sophisticated physics management engines emerge more and more often on the market, it is undeniable that there are still products that instead, focusing on other aspects such as playability, innovation or immediate fun, they manage to involve gamers on par or almost as the most popular titles in technical terms. The most concrete example of what we are saying could be found in titles such as LittleBigPlanet, the Sony game developed by Media Molecule that so fascinated millions of users around the world in 2008, thanks to its gameplay. Thanks to the possibility offered to players to create entire scenarios and situations practically from scratch, customizing practically every aspect of the game to their liking, the aforementioned product then gave rise to a series of more or less successful imitations. One of these, at least on paper, is Create, developed internally by Electronic Arts, a title that however tries to partially modify the typical scheme of the Sony masterpiece by adding some stylistic changes in terms of playability, as we will see shortly. But let's proceed in order. Once the game has started, a main screen appears showing more than a dozen floating islands with a beautiful blue sky in the background: these are the areas in which the player will have to and can indulge his imagination. At the beginning, however, only a couple will be available, the others will become accessible only after obtaining certain points. Each area has different characteristics, even if visiting them for the first time they simply present themselves as an empty space to be filled and decorated with the elements the player desires. The only limit is the imagination? In fact, the user has an infinite number of decorations at his disposal to use at will to personalize the chosen area. By selecting the aforementioned material from dozens of different colours, patterns and stickers, for example, it can dye walls or floors, or by taking trees, benches, locomotives, shops, roller coasters and so on and so forth from the archive, it can furnish the area. Finally, animating everything with dynamic elements. In Create almost everything can be modified at will and the only limit, perhaps it will be trivial to say, is the imagination of the players. In fact, there is no correct way to play, just as there is no wrong one. There is ~only~ the method, the equipment, the idea, the genius of the author. And it is from this concept that the intrinsic fun of the product comes: being able to derive pleasure from one's ability to make one's imagination bear fruit by creating something unique and personal. The rest comes by itself also thanks to an intuitive graphical interface and a limited set of commands which, if on the one hand offer little variety of choice, on the other, for this very reason they paradoxically facilitate the user's task. The product also offers support for PlayStation Move, which acts in some ways as an innovative mouse, functional and precise enough, at least for most of the more linear movements. Decorating an area becomes a necessity at a certain point as through this operation points are earned which are used to unlock new ornamental elements and scenarios. And to open a series of challenges that the developers have invented to add salt to the gameplay. In this case we will be faced with a series of scenarios with increasing difficulty. These are mostly puzzles in which it is required to plan and then have the game itself automatically execute a certain series of actions on elements previously positioned or selected by the player. Graphics and sound Everything is set at the gameplay level, so that the player makes an object take a certain path from point A to point B, arranging certain scenic elements so that they interact with each other and help in the enterprise. For example, a ramp can be positioned to allow a dune buggy to which a rocket must be previously connected to overcome an inscription or a ring suspended in space, depending on the disturbing element present (hill, ravine, wall) or use balloons to make a specific object fly past obstacles and then make them explode and thus release what they carry and which consequently goes to position itself where desired. Once you have chosen what to do and are sure of success, what we mentioned before begins: as in the game of dominoes, a sort of chain reaction will be created which will involve all the elements used and which will leave the engine itself which manages the physics of game the task of controlling collvisions and events, while the player will be a spectator observing whether his previous interventions have been corrected or not. That's all. This is damned fun even if in the long run it may seem boring and a little limited for some. From a graphic point of view, Create presents everything that is asked of such a title: colorful scenarios with a rather lively palette, a graphic style appropriate to the type of game and environments spacious enough to allow users to give vent to their creativity. On the other hand, the speech relating to the sound sector is different. In this case, Create unfortunately presents a soundtrack that is a bit too repetitive for our tastes, and even if it sometimes seems to succeed in its intent, that is, almost dreamlike in line with the setting of the game, in the long run it actually ends up tiring . In conclusion we can say without a doubt that the game is, even with all the limitations of the case, a very fun title to play. It is not in the least comparable in variety, progression and gameplay to that LittleBigPlanet masterpiece, yes, but that does not mean that it is a limited product or not to be enjoyed. On the contrary, given the simplicity of the contents and the style of play, it is suitable as and more than ever for casual users.", "date": "2010-12-28", "grade": null}
