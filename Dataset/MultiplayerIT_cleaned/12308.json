{"name": "Football Party", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/football-party.html", "text": "The idea behind the title in question is simple: to be inspired by the Wario Ware series of Nintendo, or the concept of minigames (or rather microgames) lasting a few seconds each, but adopting a completely different underlying theme. Yes, because each of the 32 tests present in Football Party is, as you can easily guess, inspired by football or by what revolves around the world of football. So, for example, we will have to do some dribbling with the head, or throw balls against the wall, but also wave at the stadium, score a goal, dodge defenders, choose the fastest queue to enter the stadium gates and so on. all obviously in a handful of moments. Just like in Wario Ware, also in this case there is a main mode, called ~story~, in which the mini-games are divided into groups of levels which require the collection of a certain number of points to be overcome. To complete the various levels fortunately 4 attempts are granted, or the possibility of repeating the tests in case you are not able to pass them on the first attempt. And in reality it is a very frequent situation, since the design of the Football Party minigames is, unfortunately, not without criticism. In a product of this type, it is essential that the purpose of the individual tests is immediately clear, and that the control system works perfectly to avoid errors independent of the player's skill or otherwise. Instead, the Gameloft production appears discontinuous from this point of view, with some situations not only not very immediate to understand, but also suffering from a gameplay that is not flawless, if not irritating in some cases. A problem, this, which in fact prevents you from being able to appreciate an obviously not particularly successful title. Even from a technical point of view, Football Party does not particularly shine, with a graphic style that is a little too poor; and ~poor~ is a concept of verse from the ~simplistic and stylized~ of the aforementioned Wario Ware, which really remains on another level. Insufficient sound, with annoying songs and too limited effects. PRO Interesting idea Some cute minigames... AGAINST But most aren't Technically dull Reviewable control system", "date": "2007-05-07", "grade": "S.V."}
