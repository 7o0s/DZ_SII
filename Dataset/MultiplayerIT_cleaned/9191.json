{"name": "Backbreaker: Vengeance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/90648-backbreaker-vengeance-chi-la-dura-la-vince.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360Football is a wonderful sport, where physical supremacy, tactics and spectacle combine to create the essence perfect of the American show. However, for European users it is difficult to digest, precisely because of it of its complex tactics. However, if we purge the established schemes, including peremptory teamwork, what remains? Our athlete, our oval ball and a goal to reach. Backbreaker: Vengeance shows up in digital delivery to satisfy this need, and transform it into three galvanizing, contextual mini-games. Interpret into purely arcade perspective this discipline has always been an insurmountable challenge, but 505 Games seems to have succeeded. Using the Euphoria physics engine, already seen in the previous Backbreaker, this reduced edition leaves entirely up to our physical resources the outcome of the game. The first mode puts us in the shoes of the attacker, this means that our goal is to reach the fateful touchdown. Easy? Not exactly, since in the various tests, which can be progressively unlocked, we will find an increasing number of unknowns among ours man and goal. It starts with opposing tacklers, to be avoided through combinations of the analog stick, but it continues with the obligation to remain in specific areas of the field, under penalty of instant elimination, obstacles to jump, bags to hit and special spots to reach to increase the score. Not only that, continuing in the levels we have to face special defenses, to be avoided with particular moves. Arrived at the destination, we can emphasize our triumph with exultation, in full Yankee spirit. The second mode reverses the roles, in how much we put ourselves in the shoes of the defender this time. We tough men In this case we have to land the opposing CPU, and its companions who they will try to stop us, with contact or diving, which are decidedly effective and which prove to be an excellent pretext for unleash the best of physics engine. The last mode, called Supremacy, elevates the spirit to the max of competition, knocking out three other players controlled by artificial intelligence on the field, in a race with no holds barred for who gets to the touchdown first. The last in the standings must change his role in tackler, against the remaining three, and this also applies to the human player. All modes are all about scores, whatever action comes rewarded with points, it is therefore easy to understand that it is not just a question of arriving unscathed at the goal, but of optimize our ride and let the show prevail. Intuition is remarkable, since to the player not the slightest knowledge of attack and defense patterns is required, and every obstacle is overcome by carrying out the respective move, which is always intuitive and easy to implement. The challenge always lies in the complexity greater than the paths, which require the frenetic execution of the various moves, putting the test reflexes, memory and some game vision. In Supremacy mode everything is soured by an intelligence really fierce artificial, which leaves no space and is willing to do anything to win, including improprieties. Xbox 360 goals 200 player points along 12 objectives. These are the credentials of Backbreaker: Vengeance, not a walk of health, as half of these require the completion of all the tests that make up the three modes. And some challenges are quite demanding. Hut hut! The importance of the physique An apparently extremely simple sector reveals, as the games go on, a complexity that it allows you to appreciate, and then exploit, every nuance capable of earning precious seconds. As already mentioned even the score proves to be very important, if not crucial, so much so that the search for spots is anything but secondary, rather than rushing straight to the goal. That's right. A sports title unexpectedly embraces the dynamics of a Geometry Wars shooter. Technically Backbreaker: Vengeance benefits from a job practically already done, we are talking about the graphics engine of the boxed edition, rightly used at its best for this digital release. The result they are very defined players, with realistic movements, who give their best in spectacular contacts. Everything that gravitates around cannot be defined as of the same level, see the audience in the stands, and the game it is a bit lacking in terms of presentation, but these are defects that can easily be overlooked. Both online and local play is supported, especially good for the born Supremacy mode clearly in a multiplayer perspective.", "date": "2011-07-06", "grade": "6.7"}
