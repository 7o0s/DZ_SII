The various types of races from which to draw the source of our entertainment are the following: Junkyard: a kind of team deathmatch, to put it as if we were dealing with a FPS. The team that first reaches a certain number of opponent eliminations, via ramming, machine guns and missiles, wins. Stunt show: in a map full of loops, ramps and any other object that can help produce spectacular evolutions, each stunt is evaluated with a score, to then reward the player who has obtained the most points within the established time limit . Keep the flag: again to put it as if we were in a shooter, this mode is very similar to the classic ~capture the flag~, with the difference that once the flag has been captured (represented by a huge smiley) the player must also pass through a certain number of checkpoints to give victory to your team. Hot Potato: A car is rigged with a bomb and the driver must attempt to pass it to someone else by ramming it, all within seconds. The score is attributed based on the survivals obtained, with a bonus for those who manage to be the last to pass the bomb to the vehicle that will explode. The player with the most points wins. Elimination race: very close to a classic race between cars, with the difference that at each lap the last one to reach the finish line literally explodes, leaving the race. Whoever becomes the only player on the track wins. Before starting the engines Then there are the normal race, about which besides the name there is practically nothing to say, and the free race, where the player can indulge himself as he prefers on the track of his choice. Moving on to the track editor, we are faced with a very easy to use tool, which will take a few minutes to learn, after which we can safely say that we are able to design an excellent track. All of what has been said up to now assumes a great value, as you have surely already thought, in online matches: thanks to a certainly satisfying number of game modes and the possibility of creating personalized tracks (which are downloaded automatically by users connected to the game of your host), this aspect is certainly the most stimulating of the game, in which to eventually launch after the single mode, which in itself still deserves attention from the player. In fact, in addition to the single events, there is the possibility of taking part in the Crashday Racing Team, climbing the rankings in a real career as an extreme motorist: everything takes place through three phases, starting from being simple beginners, inside of which we find the game modes mentioned above scattered, in which we will obviously see other drivers driven by the CPU as our antagonists. A plot also unfolds through the career mode, for which although it is nothing transcendental the effort is certainly appreciable. However, for those who are not satisfied with all this, the developers have also thought of some mini-games such as a trampoline where you can set long jump records with the car and another small mode freely taken from the film ~Speed~, where a bomb is mounted on our car before departure, to then explode if it drops below a certain speed, which is increased at each checkpoint passed. Come on gasse!!! Following the choice of mode, it is finally time to bring your racing car to the starting line and go wild at the wheel. Titles like Crashday have always done without realistic physics to the full advantage of adrenaline-pumping evolutions and spectacular crashes, therefore if someone were to be looking for unbridled realism in this game they will find the exact opposite, but since you have come to read the this review up to this point you will have understood it for quite some time. However, don't be too misled: Crashday's physics engine offers a solution that is quite close to reality in terms of the speed and reactions of the cars to actual collisions, although these do not destroy the vehicles as they would in the everyday life. It is also interesting to note that the beatings taken here and there by the medium chewe are driving will still have repercussions on it, damaging its component parts in a very visible way and sometimes creating problems in driving stability. What Moon-Byte and Replay have arrived at is therefore a product that combines a dominant part of the genre such as reduced damage and a slightly softened physics in general, also a slight touch of realism in the feeling with your car. In any case, during the configuration phase of the game it is possible to choose between three levels of damage (low, medium and high), through which to adjust the physics according to one's tastes: what guarantees maximum fun and spectacularity is certainly the low damage, given that the player's attention on any reckless maneuvers will be reduced and, therefore, to the full advantage of unbridled racing with apocalyptic accidents seasoned with various missiles and miniguns, in a very similar way to what was seen in titles such as the ATR era for the Amiga, obviously with a technical implementation suitable for today. But expressing the fun of Crashday through weapons alone would be simplistic, also because all in all these are only of two different types, while perhaps other nice tricks such as mines and the like could have been added: in any case, fortunately even the modes that do not include the physical annihilation of one's opponents guarantees an excellent level of fun, indeed the acrobatic show is probably the real fulcrum of the game, although this reduces the level of interaction with other players in multiplayer mode compared to ~armed~ races or even to simple normal running. Launching at 300Km/h on a ramp and then making aerial evolutions by fluttering for several seconds always has its charm, in short. As a fleet available to the player, we find a bit of everything, from sports cars with huge spoilers to the so-called ~Wrecker~, a sort of road bison especially useful in modes that involve the destruction of opponents. Going forward in the career mode it will be possible to increase the number of vehicles at our disposal, also purchasing various performance improvements, weapons and various embellishments, all thanks to the money earned by winning races and the respect points obtained, which will gradually be unlocked cars available for purchase. Moving on to the downside, the decision to offer each player a practically inexhaustible supply of nitro even in racing was probably a negative choice, regulated only by a simple ~cooldown~ but usable for the entire duration of the race, where it would have been better to leave one limited quantity to allow the driving skills of the players to emerge a little more. Secondly, the AI of the cars driven by the CPU proves to be competitive only initially, to then give way to the player once he has practiced with some acclimatization competitions, rarely giving him a hard time. the beating heart of Crashday is definitely the online game Technically speaking Crashday's graphics engine proves to be, right from the early stages, versatile and at the same time sufficiently attentive to various details and effects such as reflections and lens flare, which are very appreciable. Although the scalability is not high, the various degrees of selection of the graphic detail allow you to play satisfactorily even on computers that are not exactly of the latest generation, obviously compromising a bit with quality. On a 1.66 GHz Centrino Duo with 1 GB of RAM and an ATI X1600 playing at full detail, with anti-aliasing turned on at 4x, showed no signs of slowing down. Last but not least, Crashday offers an excellent range of shots to choose the one that best suits our driving style. As for the audio sector, the purely ~rocker~ soundtrack is very enjoyable, even if in some situations the latter could a little disturb any player not exactly predisposed to listening to this kind of music. For the rest, all effects are normal and finally the work done by the Italian guest star, DJ Ringo of Radio 105, who gave his voice to Craig, the president of the Crashday League in career mode, is satisfactory: the result is certainly good and apparently much better than the English version, which many have complained about Craig's voice. Final comment The beating heart of Crashday is certainly the online game, where thanks to the participation of other human drivers it is possible to obtain a much higher level of challenge than that of the single mode, also thanks to an AI not quite up to the situation.ion. The possibility of using the powerful editor makes it virtually infinite in terms of longevity, which however will be very little if you do not intend to play Crashday online, so in this case it will be better to evaluate other purchases. Having made this consideration, we can say that this game is certainly a good investment for fans of extreme racing and online gaming, especially bearing in mind that it is offered by the Italian distributor at the competitive price of 19.90. Probably the success won't be the same as Trackmania, but there are all the cards to play it equal and it is not said that the online community can decree the victory of Crashday by subverting the predictions.Pros Customization at the highest levels Very good graphics Panic evolutions Cons CPU AI often not up to par Some small questionable choices Accidents, what a passion Automotive simulations have always been divided into two main strands: those whose ultimate goal is realism, such as F1 games or rallies, and those in which all or almost all physical laws go down the drain to allow levels of action and of adrenaline while firing missiles and somersaulting at 300 km/h. This arcade setting has always had a considerable charm on all gamers, just think of titles from some time ago such as Destruction Derby together with other games such as ATR, Re-Volt and Micromachines, where despite the cars being miniature, the concept was almost the same: unbridled fun and the most varied game modes, combined with a healthy and genuine game with friends. After the fairly recent Trackmania, it is therefore the turn of Crashday, created by the German developers Moon-Byte and Replay Studios, who, as mentioned several times on these same pages, claim to have created the most complete racing game ever: reality or pride?
