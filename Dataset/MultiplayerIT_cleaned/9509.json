{"name": "Salto in alto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83978-naild-salto-in-alto.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360 Developed by the Polish Techland, the guys behind an important title like Call of Juarez, Nail'd puts us driving motorcycles or quads on courses with an ~exuberant~ design to say the least for a driving model entirely devoted to immediacy, light years away from any attempt to put a shred of simulation tension into polygons and textures. Nail'd is pure arcade, and in such an outrageous way that games like Pure or Motorstorm feel as complex and realistic as Race Driver or rFactor. Unfortunately, however, it is too much, so much so that the fun and ~depth~ have definitely been sacrificed on the altar of extreme ease of use. Driver Easy The game mechanics are simple: everything revolves around the use of the turbo, which is achieved by landing perfectly after mileage jumps, falling on opponents' heads or passing through doors or circles in the air. That's all, Nail'd offers nothing else, no aerial tricks, no alternative routes, apart from very short detours, nothing at all. All then with a very low challenge rate for most of the long, and rather monotonous, main mode. Not only that, the other competitors are not very interested in a substantial part of the main mode, given that although many precious seconds are lost in the vehicle's regeneration process, after having taken the wrong road or after an unconventional landing, one will inevitably arrive among the first three, practically eliminating the level of difficulty, and if this happens for at least fifteen to twenty races there is little to be happy about. To make this feeling of useless loss of seconds even more tangible are the invisible walls in the air that delimit the playing area. In practice many times, for no apparent reason, the game makes us respawn the vehicle, even if we are in the right trajectory to land. The same thing happens often and willingly even on the ground, with obstacles that block us for no apparent reason, and others that should do it and instead make us pass mysteriously. Turbo and that's it Then it is enough to pass the first circuits to realize that the brake is just a nuisance, and that the most driven parts are undoubtedly those in the air and not those on the ground. This does not mean that the track design is flat and trivial, far from it, the Polish guys have designed some really crazy circuits, adopting a simple strategy, taking everything that has been seen in similar games to an extreme, effectively eliminating the lessons of Newton, giving us dizzying climbs, fearful descents and kilometric jumps, during which we avoid obstacles such as planes, hot air balloons and wind turbines, or trucks and circular saws once landed. The level design is all based on tracks characterized by the sense of vertigo that the very high jumps cause, with motorbikes or quads whizzing by in a thousand tracks that sometimes defy the force of gravity, ending up near a WipeOut or a F-Zero just to be clear. From this point of view, Nail'd is a real roller coaster at immoderate speed, with which, however, it shares a certain ~passive~ setting given that, as previously written, once the wheels touch the ground everything becomes too driven and ~easy ~, just use the turbo at the right time to leave your opponents in the dust. Despite everything however, despite the numerous structural defects that afflict the game, it is undeniable that it is still quite fun, and manages to entertain more for the show that appears before our eyes than for the actual participation in it. The tracks are quite varied, you pass with ease from Greece to Arizona, passing through the Yosemite park, and the Andes, with rapids aimed at the seafront. While not overwhelming us with dozens of alternative modes, the few included are certainly pleasant and well thought out, such as the one that sees the turbo bar always full, or the one that rewards the player more for the turbos obtained than for the position at the end of the race. Nothing exceptional, but after numerous events all the same, a variation on the theme is certainly welcome. Xbox 360 goals Nail'd rewards the player with 49 achievements, almost all of which relate to simple progression through the game. The most interesting ones, but not necessarily the hardest to get right, concern how many kilometers were done in the air, how many turbos were gained, how many runners were crushed and much more. Impactful To then try to enliven the gameplay, Techland has inserted a customization section of the vehicle, in which it is possible, with the progression in the game, to unlock new parts such as exhausts, engine, tires and so on, giving the possibilityability to significantly change the performance of the motorcycle or quad being ridden, which however is somewhat lost given the excessive ease of the races. In closing the multiplayer: the game offer is taken weight from that of the single player with all that follows in terms of gameplay and variety, for up to twelve players on the screen, a sufficient number to unleash brawl on the track. Technically speaking, the work of the Polish guys is undoubtedly impactful, using a term very dear to those who work in marketing, but going beyond the wow! initially it is possible to see numerous critical points, which in any case do not penalize him too much. We have already spoken extensively about the level design, about its seamless bundling of ravines and other danger zones, what is most striking is certainly the very high sense of speed that the game produces, made even stronger when the turbo is activated, with the screen that goes black and white, and the handlebar that becomes very hard to maneuver, alas, however, not affecting the driving model as it should. However, all this speed has a price to pay, the detail of the textures is certainly not high, but above all an excessive veil of blur protects the game from any pop up and pop in problems, while instead the frame rate is almost always stable, with only some, sporadic, uncertainties. Then the soundtrack is exaggerated, with artists of the caliber of Slipknot and Queens of the Stone Age as a counterpoint to the aerial evolutions of our pilot. Small note of merit to be reported in closing, the game is sold for about 20 euros less on consoles than the average and 10 on PC.", "date": "2011-01-24", "grade": "6.0"}
