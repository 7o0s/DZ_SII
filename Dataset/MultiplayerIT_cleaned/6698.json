{"name": "L'America", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/141786-the-crew-lamerica-tra-realta-e-utopia.html", "text": "The Crew is a street racing game. And of track competitions. And of specialties very close to rallying, in all its nuances, from the most orthodox to the craziest raid degeneration. And of endurance races. And a sampling of short, schizoid tests of skill. It is a driver and courier simulator. And one of car tailings and running away for one's freedom or life. And of stunts. And to fight at the counter. Ubisoft's racing game is this and much more, an ambitious production, which is proposed as an encyclopaedic treatise on arcade driving in which the appeal, plus ticks minus, does not seem to lack any declination as proposed by Metropolis Street Racer in ahead, knowing how to put something of his own into it. And a heart as big as this, more precisely as big as the American Dream and its promise of freedom, a massive soul prone to social sharing, a role-playing education and a progressive disposition. All made by experienced people, who have worked on Test Drive Unlimited, V-Rally and Driver, and who chew the four wheels like chewing gum, demonstrating with facts that they know where to put their hands under the bonnet. People who, however, in some respects have decided to swerve towards questionable directions, not to mention that the instruments in certain situations seem to have really gotten out of hand, generating jams and some real hiccups as a result of which this enormous machine is unable to fully unleash his horses, crossing the finish line dented and scaled down. The moment of truth has arrived for The Crew, the racing MMO from Ubisoft. Our review When I grow up I want to make the Viper SRT-10 Coupe The Crew is a racing MMO. If desired, one could speak of an MMORPG, given that it borrows various concepts from role-playing games, such as class, quests and subquests, experience points, guild, PvP, instances and more and reinterprets them in an automotive key. Almost everything you do in the game gives XP, the accumulation of which is the basis of a growth process along 50 Levels. By leveling up you get Skill Points, through which you can improve in various departments (including acceleration, braking, steering, use of Pro-ToX) or obtain advantages of various kinds (such as a radar with which to find out what's nearby, a line that in the race indicates the recommended trajectory, XP boost and various and assorted discounts). And then the classes, specializations with specific characteristics and predispositions, embodied by the five car Specs that you can own: Tuning, Off-Road, Xtreme, Raid and Pista. Except for some limitations imposed by engineering common sense (or more probably by contracts with the relevant manufacturers...), each of the approximately forty licensed cars present (ranging from the Golf GTI to the Agera R, from the immortal Skyline GT-R to the Murcielago IP 640, from the M5 2011 to the LaFerrari) can be ~transformed~ into one of these Specs and also know a growth path, complete with Levels, on which the swarm of performance modifications depend that can be applied to improve attributes and vary their behavioral dynamics. In pure RPG style, the Level is also important for balancing purposes: trying certain missions or participating in certain PvP events with a machine that is not ~cultivated~ enough can amount to not having the slightest chance of making it. It must be said that the developers have been quite careful in calibrating the progression: apart from some discordant notes, the difficulty of the groups of main missions (i.e. those relating to the story) that are unlocked along the way is generally commensurate with what is probably the current Level of character and car. At times, attention has also been paid to specifically balancing the objectives of the mission in case you opt to play it in co-op, reviewing the success requirements accordingly. The discourse of other quest genres is different, through which The Crew aims to have more depth in a massive sense, such as the Faction Missions, with which to contribute to the prestige of one of the five sides to which one can affiliate (Eagles, Bears, Snakes, Crocodiles and Wolves), contributing to the fate of a territorial struggle which is summed up on a monthly basis, attributing special rewards to the winners. An apparatus clearly designed to offer reasons of interest in the medium and long term, therefore by its nature addressed to players who are already beautiful and leveled and regarding which it is understandable that the challenge rate may be prohibitive for those beginners who still want to try. The discussion ends with challenges, objectives and occasional events temporarily called, a type of incentive to keep upThe game that has almost become the norm in canonical online multiplayer, let alone those with an MMO slant. American spirit From less than ten seconds of a Jump Challenge to over two hours of a coast to coast. As we said at the beginning, The Crew basically offers every kind of test of skill and arcade competition that can come to mind. All against the background of a reproduction (obviously in scale) of the territory of the United States, in which one can move freely, if desired in its entirety, without uploads or other solutions of continuity, in a free-roaming structure of impressive size and with an exceptional landscape variety. It is difficult to think of an iconic place in North America and discover that it does not mark its presence. What is striking, however, is not only the monumental geo-topographic and technical effort at the basis of a reconstruction of this magnitude, but also the way in which it was taken as a starting point to offer a marked situational characterization. In other words: how they managed to make mission design setting. Limiting ourselves to just a few examples, so as not to spoil any surprises: you can find yourself chasing a fugitive on the Overseas Highway, the motorway in the middle of the sea that connects Florida to the Keys Islands made famous by True Lies and Dexter, forced to move by jumping from one bridge under construction to another as our target hurtles down the road next to it. Or having to wriggle out of the grip of the police in the maze of abandoned aircraft in the Air Force Cemetery in Tucson, to try to stand up to the opponents and at the same time to the very particular mess of surfaces among the marshes of the Everglades, to manage the hunt for prey among the huge excavators of the Coal State quarries or launching off a ski jump near Salt Lake City. Then, clearly, an ABC made up of races that start on the highway, in the countryside, between the gorges of a canyon or in the mountains and continue in the city, or vice versa, and others that exploit urban planning forcing you to cross parks, bridges, intricate neighborhoods and a palette of routes that goes far beyond the simple breakneck race between the squared and regular blocks of a downtown. The sublimation of a similar discourse comes with the more robust missions, which can well exceed the hour duration up to half past two of the coast to coast, a real journey during which it is possible to fully savor the nuances with which the different regions of America have been characterized, understanding their spirit, while engaging with an endless variety of driving contexts. Look, mom, no hands! Another aspect where the experience and expertise of the developers can be seen is the interface. The Crew is a huge title in terms of size, huge in possibilities, huge in amount of data, but which is managed in a splendidly streamlined, rational and comfortable way. Starting from the map of the United States, created in real time, to which different zoom levels can be applied, up to framing a single vehicle (which, if desired, can also be followed, to the delight of stalkers and Person of Interest enthusiasts) or through which you can immediately plunge into the game, at the point where you want (except for certain stakes, which we will see a little further below). An exhaustive series of filters then allows you to highlight the icons relating to the elements of interest, to identify them more easily, while clicking on them opens a drop-down menu with the actions that can be performed, getting straight to the point. Once in-game, things continue to be just as easy, thanks to a classic smartphone  la GTA that can be recalled on the fly through which to manage friends, radio stations and options, without practically stopping driving. Still from the mobile phone, it is possible to call up one's fleet on the fly, browse through it and instantly change cars without useless and morbid menu turns, loading and so on, or prepare some performance modifications. Things are equally brilliant as far as the game is concerned, with the possibility, once achieved, of tackling a mission alone or in company through a nimble integrated matchmaking system, or to try one of the numerous Challenges dotted around the environment and decide later whether to do it again or recall rankings and ghosts, without lifting your hands from the wheel for a moment. But in addition to the pots, the lids were also made: if you don't want to go through the standard procedure, which involves going back to the map of America and looking for a specific mission, you can access a very handy Mission Diary via smartphone, with which to instantly reach the desired one. Provided you have already visited the locationon relative. A condition thanks to which we have taken shelter from the possibility that many out of laziness actually circumvent the mammoth work done at an environmental level, ending up not even knowing what The Crew wants to be. And there is still no shortage of comforts, given that longer journeys can be mitigated by resorting to a network of airports and railway stations. An apparatus in which the Crews that give the game its name could not be overlooked, or the bands that can be formed with friends or occasional companions. Through the map you can keep an eye on your companions, reach them instantly or plot a route for the group, while in-game you can manage invitations, promote or expel members and recall their detailed statistics, all on the fly. Similar concepts apply to PvP, which allows you to administer various aspects of the game before detaching yourself from a real lobby. The picture is completed by a notification system similar to the fundamental Autolog by Criterion, with which you can possibly interact in an equally agile way, and a cascade of data, rankings and statistics, conveniently organized in the Drivehub. If you pull too much it will break As you know, The Crew is an arcade racing game. It doesn't have the crystalline quality of a Burnout and the balance and level of precision of a Project Gotham, to name two heavyweights in the category, but it is nonetheless characterized by a certain pleasantness and level of satisfaction, which has made us remembered Need for Speed Underground 2. However, even if it is possible to choose between three different control schemes (All Driving Aids, Sport and Hardcore) and act in detail on some advanced parameters to better meet your personal needs and maximize the level of gratification that can be squeezed out of the driving model, it cannot free itself from a certain ~slippery~ and at the same time heavy, somewhat artificial feeling. But the most critical aspect is collisions. You also pass that the accidents are aesthetically unsatisfying, either for the outdated sheet metal deformation algorithms, or for the wide deployment of debris and sparks, or for impacts that seem to have a correspondence with the masses and forces involved, to say the least imaginative , but when there is half the playability serious problems begin. A species are certain choices made upstream and if on the one hand they like the margins of permissiveness regarding the ~flattened~, as a result of which in some cases touching a vehicle laterally, especially against the flow, you still keep on running, from another one is the victim of excessively punitive decisions, such as when one collides with more innocuous elements of the scenario, in apparently undramatic circumstances. Added to this is a certain basic inconsistency, which becomes wild west in the case of CPU-controlled cars, which sometimes boast extremely suspicious ~recovery times~ from a knock. And the setting imprinted on various missions leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Introducing scripted elements such as a plane landing, the smoke screen generated by a roadside fire or an avalanche is absolutely understandable to better characterize certain contexts and at the same time introduce some special disturbing element, less so when you notice, attempt after attempt, which behaves in the same way as a generic vehicle, which purposely emerges into traffic. And even worse in the case of the opponents you are racing against, who in many cases tend to always follow the same road, curve after sudden curve, who suddenly actually have nothing. And it's a shame, because in other situations the developers show that they know how to program an overall valid artificial intelligence. Just take the coast to coast, where you can see it grappling with a large amount of variables, now in city traffic now on the hairpin bends of the Grand Canyon, now on a semi-desert straight road in New Mexico now on the most messed up highway outside New York, demonstrating that she knows how to behave quite well, also featuring smudges and errors that give her that welcome ~human~ feeling. Unfortunately, coast to coast is also the benchmark for another bad creative choice: a pronounced elastic effect. Often during a race one gets the impression that the drivers controlled by the CPU are closing a gap in a suspicious way, unduly catching up on us, or in an equally suspicious way, they tend to give it to us, when they have the advantage. Very good: during a crossing from Florida to California we surprised a couple of times the driver with whom we dueled for almost the entire duration of the journey literally stopped waiting for us.
