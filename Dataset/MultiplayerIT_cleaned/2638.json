It seems that EA has kicked the old slowdown problems, but despite everything the golfers, made in 2D, and their animations are still not as well updated as one would like to see; the fields on which the competitions take place are made with care, but do not have a texture full of details capable of giving an exciting sensation of realism. The sound effects of the game are very pleasant and you will also appropriately hear here and there the audience rumble for a good shot or the voice of Tiger Woods cheering or regretting. Definitely... PGA Tours 2001 is a good game, thanks also to the solid workmanship used in the creation of the game options that make this title long-lived especially in mulyiplayer mode; certainly in the future some graphic innovations will certainly be appreciated which will give an extra touch of realism to this already discreet simulation. Simulation or Arcade? The game immediately offers you the possibility to select one of the seven real golfers present, including Tiger Woods whose image also appears on the cover of the game packaging, and to compete on the various courses individually or against a friend. You can challenge each other up to a maximum of four players at the same time. Among the game modes we have the usual practice, match play and stroke. The control has not changed much from that of the previous version: with the arrow keys you decide the direction, while with the others you can hit the ball, see the distance on the track from the hole and change the club. An innovation made in this version is the introduction of Tiger Control which will influence the direction of the ball while it is in the air. This option in a game that looks like a rigid simulation almost seems to want to imprint it more on an arcade style. The bad news concerns the use of Tiger Control on the green: in fact, when you hit a hole, you won't be able to change the direction of the ball, which will suffer all the effects caused by both the force you applied to the shot and the slope of the green.", "date": "2001-01-29", "grade": null}
