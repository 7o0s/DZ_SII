Thus it happens that even well-made titles, overshadowed by the shadow of the colossus and perhaps with a smaller budget to spend on marketing, find themselves unjustly crushed and undervalued; in the case of Ferrari: The Race Experience then this situation reaches emblematic levels, the title in question being the latest exponent of a series that, while waiting for Gran Turismo 5, has been able to churn out three different episodes. Strict realism After the excellent debut with Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli and the positive confirmation of Supercar Challenge, the System 3 guys are back on track with a new title, once again dedicated to the Prancing Horse cars. And the famous (and, let's assume, expensive) license is this time really heavily exploited, thanks to the presence of 34 versions of cars selected from among the most charismatic and beautiful produced by the Modena-based company; the glorious cars will then be able to compete in strictly single-model races, held in 17 famous national and international circuits, obviously including the inevitable Monza, Imola and SPA. Ferrari: The Race Experience distances itself quite clearly from the concept of ~hybrid-simulation~, to coin a neologism, in which purely simulative elements are then associated with behaviors of the car more similar to an arcade (this is the case of Need for Speed Shift and of Grid for example, or of F1 2010 itself), focusing everything on the most extreme realism possible: thanks to the almost perfect reactions of the cars, able to respond in real time to any type of solicitation. However, to better understand the effective level of simulation achieved, it will suffice to mention some typical behaviors that cars will assume in particular critical conditions: braking time, for example, before tackling a bend, does not allow any margin of error, so much so that even a very few meters delay in braking lead to departure from the ideal driving line; moreover, accelerating or braking abruptly on curbs or dirt causes the vehicle to become unbalanced with the consequent need to recover it. With the aids disabled, more than the search for the perfect trajectory, it is the dosage of brake and accelerator that makes the difference between a valid lap and a picnic along the escape routes, but the examples in this sense could continue for a very long time. To partially mitigate the profound but sometimes frustrating gaming experience, there are the driving aids present, which can be set gradually, ranging from the classic power steering and ABS to the different levels of traction control, stability and IBS intelligent braking; even if set to maximum, driving always requires a fair amount of cleanliness and attention, certainly more tolerant than usual to small smears but not totally improbable for this. Playstation 3 trophies As evidence of the fact that Ferrari: The Race Experience is a complete title in all respects, despite its distribution only in digital version, 44 Trophies will be installed by the system, of which 33 are bronze, 7 silver, 3 gold and 1 platinum. Unlocking them all will not be an easy task at all: in fact, after removing the endurance trophies, such as the ~run for 2000 miles~ or ~unlock all cars~ silver medals, the rest of the goals will be linked to the victory of Trophies or GT career races, a feat initially certainly not easy. The golden trophies, in particular, foresee the victory in every Arcade race, the achievement of the maximum Career points in the GT category and, of course, also in the Classic one. The game will therefore make trophy hunters sweat the classic seven shirts, but in the end the level of preparation achieved will certainly be able to (almost) compete with that of a real pilot! Simulation paradox However, all this attention to detail instilled in the gameplay finds an inexplicable paradox in the lack of settings and tuning for the cars, if we exclude a discreet editor for the liveries: the settings, the degrees of inclination of the ailerons, the balance of the braking and all the main parameters that every motor enthusiast can't wait to customize are not in factyou introduce yourself. As partial justification for this choice, it should be noted that all the races see the same cars collide with each other, with the same preset settings, thus making these modifications less necessary; however, it remains a much appreciated feature on a game of this category, which he would not have minded having available. Compared to its predecessors, Ferrari: The Race Experience boasts a higher number of game modes, exclusively devoted to the single player: in fact, it is possible to choose the tutorial, in the form of a test carried out at Fiorano with the guidance of Tiff Needell, presenter of the program English TV Fifth Gear, the classic quick race, the time trial, the Arcade mode (which consists of participating in races with a time limit within which to finish at least third to unlock the next circuit) and the Trophy, made up of 34 useful mini-tournaments to unlock new tracks; it is also possible for the first time to embark on a real career, traveling around the world and accumulating titles and Challenge Cards with each victory. The career can be tackled by choosing between GT sports cars (intended for the track), GT road cars, i.e. for sale in dealerships, and the classic historic cars of the Prancing Horse; often the same model is available in both the road version and in the version tuned for the track, behaving differently when driving (the ordinary car is more ~docile~ but slower, the racing one is more performing and ~nervous~). Speaking of the Challenge Cards, there is a small novelty introduced for the first time in the series: these cards, which accumulate with each valid result obtained (including pole position and podium placements), are used to create the deck to be used in a nice mini-game against the CPU: basically, each card shows a Ferrari model, with all the main characteristics (marketing date, engine capacity, power, weight, maximum speed, current value); choosing a parameter, it is compared with the card of the CPU and, in case of better data (oldest, most powerful, least heavy or most valuable car) a point is assigned or removed until reaching 0 and thus giving up the entire deck to the opponent. Returning to the track, the behavior of the opposing AI, a weak point in the first episodes, has certainly improved on this occasion: the pilots are decidedly aggressive, so much so that often taken by the competitive enthusiasm they will make mistakes, even going so far as to defend the positions that count with healthy counters . The multiplayer mode, up to 16 players, does not present any significant innovations: you can host and participate in free or classified online competitions, without apparent problems with the netcode; at the time of writing, however, the servers are decidedly not crowded, a sign that the rich choice of offline tenders keeps European buyers busy for a long time. The Cavallino polished ... or almost Ferrari: The Race Experience runs thanks to the PS3 upscaling to 1080p resolution, however it is good to immediately curb any enthusiasm that pixel count fanatics may show. The graphic impact of the game is in fact absolutely fluctuating: if on the one hand the splendid weather effects (not dynamic, due to the brevity of the races) and environmental effects are very well done, the same thing cannot be said about the general aspect of slopes and surroundings. To the poorly defined textures, which at speed might not even be noticed, there are annoying framerate problems, frankly inexplicable, present even in conditions of perfect solitude (and therefore not in more agitated situations such as departure, which would have made at least one sense ). The cockpit view of the cars is quite disappointing: it is true that, due to weight requirements, the racing cars are usually bare inside, but in this case we really touch very low levels of detail, in particular for the fixed speedometer designed; however, the viewing angle is good, as is the possibility of looking sideways thanks to the back keys. The game also suffers from a noticeable pop up effect, with trees and various elements suddenly materializing on the horizon; however, this problem is mitigated in the event of rain, where visibility is inevitably reduced. The damages are present, even if only on an aesthetic level: set to the maximum, dents and dangling bumpers will not be spared, without however affecting the behavior of the car on the track in the least; the ~bank play~ to help you in the corners is always present but it shouldn't be abused too much, let alone cut the chicanes, under penalty of a variable number of penalty seconds. Finally, a particular commendation goes to the creation of the sound effects of the engines, spectacular,that to a Ferrari enthusiast will seem melodious notes rather than mechanical noises: for this reason, it is strongly recommended to disable the music during the races, inexplicably active by default.", "date": "2010-10-21", "grade": "7.9"}
