But then there was what is called ~a series of unfortunate events~: the original development team, Kaos Studios, closed its doors in 2011 and the work passed first to THQ Montreal and then to those of Crytek UK; in 2012 THQ itself went bankrupt and Crytek bought the rights to Homefront to make a sequel internally, also changing the vision of the game from a linear shooter to an open world; in 2014 Crytek had some financial problems and sold the franchise to Deep Silver, who entrusted the project to Dambuster Studios. From the announcement to the arrival in stores of Homefront: The Revolution, the developers, directors and the product structure itself have therefore changed several times: a chaos that has left only the narrative component intact, hinged on the scenario of an America invaded by KPA Korean Army, and the location of Philadelphia, where our revolution will begin. Homefront: The Revolution is a discreet title, often anonymous but capable of offering an intense challenge Against a wall In the game we take on the role of Ethan Brady, a member of the Revolution who operates precisely in the Philadelphia area. While we are together with some comrades, inside a position we thought safe, we are captured by a group of KPA soldiers, who kill our friends without too many words when they refuse to give them information and are about to do the same. same with us. At a certain point, however, Benjamin Walker bursts into the room, the charismatic leader of the rebels, who saves us in extremis but is wounded in the leg. Unable to move, he hands us a smartphone equipped with an advanced decryption system and sends us to free up a post from which to contact the top management of the organization to order a recovery operation. Unfortunately, the North Korean soldiers intercept and capture him before our return, leaving us alone and in a lot of trouble: suspected of being a spy, we are seized by a group of rebels and left in the care of Dana Moore, a girl who is anything but balanced, who spends his time torturing enemy soldiers to steal any useful information. Luckily we are taken away from his treatment just in time, rehabilitated and enrolled in the flagship team of the Rebellion, naturally with the priority task of finding Walker and freeing him: without his charisma the inhabitants of Philadelphia will hardly find the determination to rise up and attack the KPA . Burn the city The rebellion takes on a very well-defined role in Homefront: The Revolution, which goes hand in hand with the liberation of neighborhoods from North Korean control, following the ~Hearts and Minds~ achievement indicator. To make it rise, you have to turn on the radio, save people, sabotage systems and so on: when you reach 100%, citizens act en masse and reconquer the territory, transforming the scenario into a much less dangerous place to explore, albeit more disturbing to see , with the apparent order of totalitarian dictatorship replaced by burning armored cars, corpses in the streets and people carrying guns on the street. The complete liberation of the map is not mandatory and is part of the optional missions of a campaign that can be completed in less than fifteen hours if you go straight, but which easily reaches thirty hours when you dedicate yourself to the side quests and any missions on commission. Watch out: unlike other sandboxes, in Homefront: Revolution you have to complete the optional missions before accessing the last chapter, because after that you can't go back. The thing, however, is clarified by a notice. Returning precisely to the secondary quests, unfortunately the variety is missing: on the one hand there are those in which you simply need to eliminate a certain number of targets in a specific area of the map, on the other the missions we control a building that pass through platform sections where you 'it is necessary to identify the areas of access to roofs and windows. The cooperative multiplayer sector, for its part, allows you to compose a team of four players and participate together in punitive expeditions for the conquest of an area or the defense of a neighborhood from the onslaught of hostile troops. This thing is not new to me After a not exactly friendly first impact, mostly because we didn't expect the presence of such ruthless survival mechanics (but also because we start in fourth place and with little space for detailed tutorials), the gaming experience immediately reveals a couple of influencesvery evident: on the one hand the structure and atmospheres of inFAMOUS: Second Son, which we find in the aseptic environments of the neighborhoods under the control of the KPA and in the design of various assets, from vehicles to enemy soldiers, as well as in setting up a map whose areas change color depending on the influence or otherwise of the North Korean army; on the other hand, the survival approach of Dying Light, with the very extensive loot on corpses and objects, from which to draw the resources necessary to build explosives, firecrackers and electronic jammers on the fly, but also an unlimited running capacity and some concessions to a parkour which unfortunately doesn't always work as it should. Around the map there are also motorbikes, which we can use to quickly cover the distance that separates us from the next objective. Yes, as in The Following expansion, but with a substantial difference: on the bike, not only can we not run over hostile soldiers (doing so results in a ridiculous physical reaction), but we expose ourselves excessively to the attentions of the patrols patrolling the area, with the risk of alerting them. However, this is only one of the many contradictions present in the design of Homefront: The Revolution, which puts a lot of irons in the fire but in the end is unable to derive the desired benefits. To put it simply, the title of Dambuster Studios is an inFAMOUS: Second Son without the powers, a Dying Light without the zombies, spoiled by a chronic lack of personality which is also and above all reflected in the scenarios. Philadelphia itself does not boast immediately recognizable views, but even if there were, the game does not value them enough, instead alternating anonymous urban neighborhoods with peripheral areas devastated by bombing. The day / night cycle, faster than in the previously mentioned Dying Light, dynamically modifies the appearance of the landscapes, but here too there are contradictions: what is the use of using the bed to rest in shelters and making the hours go by, if then the Does the presence or absence of light change the cards on the table? Shoot, die, try again We have previously mentioned ruthless survival mechanics, and the reason is easy to say: Homefront: The Revolution puts in our hands a fairly rich arsenal but also tainted by important critical issues, above all the obligation to submit to certain limitations: you can be effective from close range, carrying a shotgun and light machine gun, or from medium to long range, preferring the assault rifle, but you can't have both. Converting weapons on the fly, which can be quickly transformed into something else (the first thing we do, not surprisingly, is change the default pistol to an SMG), is a very interesting idea, but one that in practice does not it is practically never used: the game avoids putting us in front of situations in which it would be appropriate to switch from one configuration to another, and so we always end up using the same tools. Moreover, why deprive yourself of the rocket launcher when enemy patrols are often accompanied by a powerful armored vehicle? And so here we find ourselves making practically forced choices. However, it is above all damage management that makes the experience a real challenge, in which it is stupid to face opponents head on or go around without a supply of medkits. A few bursts from a KPA soldier are enough to incur game over, and even maximizing the character's resistance does not produce substantial advantages in this sense. Finishing in the spotlight of enemy troops, however, produces a virtually infinite siege, from which it is possible to escape only by fleeing and hiding until the alarm goes back. A mechanic that from time to time becomes the protagonist, in the missions in which we have to go around incognito within the manned areas, freeing prisoners and, as mentioned, leading the common sentiment to trigger a rebellion. As for the artificial intelligence, it is basically what one would expect from a stealth game, but not from a shooter: the enemy units are short-sighted and deaf enough to avoid frustrating instantaneous localizations, but in full-blown fights they remain equally distracted, they manage the frontal offensive but without looking around. Nothing revolutionary The game uses the CryEngine, and it shows: the polygonal models of the characters boast an above-average level of detail, so it's a shame that their animations are so generic. Unfortunately it is not easy to characterize the graphic style of a product of this type in a strong and decisive way, and in fact Homefront: The Revolution often ends up being anonymous, with some glitches ofi too much (the black sea, in our specific case, but also the assisted pointing to be fixed) and a scaffolding that is based solely on the quality of the effects and performance, both daughters of the engine developed by Crytek. The rendering of the lights is good, as are the reflections on the puddles of water, but as already mentioned, the neighborhoods of Philadelphia are a bit too similar, the interactivity is poor and there is a rather evident recycling of materials. On the test configuration, however, the game runs at 1080p with all effects maxed out (with the exception of shadows) reaching almost sixty frames per second. It must also be said that the open world is not loaded transparently, but to move from one neighborhood to another you have to wait for a short loading (on SSD in the order of a few seconds). Remaining in the technical sphere, the direction often seemed lacking to us, losing the opportunity to render certain scenes more intensely: at first there are strong references to torture, which is entirely appropriate for a product of this kind, but then we it loses a bit in the maze of the contrast between violence and reasonableness, a discourse that has its own reason but is not thoroughly explored, remaining one of the many unfinished projects. The sound environment is poor and not very involving. There are even tragic sequences where the sounds of battle end up mysteriously canceled out and there is a great mess with the levels of dialogue; which is a pity, because some performances deserve: Marco ~Certezza~ Balzarotti in the role of the rebel doctor who would like to reason with his companions, an excellent interpreter for Jack Parrish (if you know the actor's name, let us know), especially in intensity of the finale, and Dana Moore's voice that moves between highs and lows: effective in direct dialogue, decidedly opaque in the role of narrator.", "date": "2016-05-17", "grade": "7.2"}
