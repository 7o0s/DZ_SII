It is in this scenario that Tom Clancy places the events covered in the campaign of this EndWar and with certain premises, yet another large-scale conflict could only unleash, a third world war that will involve the three superpowers of the planet: the United States, Russia and the newly formed United States of Europe (to the delight of pro-European political scientists) but curiously, despite the ~global~ adjective of the conflict, the scene does not seem to take into consideration the southern hemisphere of the globe and the Asian continent at all, an unusual decision given the growing importance of oriental nations, but it is obviously only a curious narrative choice that will not lead to any limitation in the enjoyment of the game. Before engaging in the first skirmishes we will be faced with these three great nations that coexist in a precarious and superficial balance that cannot hide an arms race that is so reminiscent of the time of the Cold War, it is obvious that this stalemate is destined to finish and the first skirmishes prelude to the great war that will see us as protagonists in the game will be an excellent expedient to present the player with the three nations available to facilitate the subsequent choice of which army to command throughout the campaign. What amazes from the first impact with the game is the care with which the narration of the events has been embroidered, each introduction to the missions is embellished with an accurate briefing accompanied by fake television services that give a further touch of realism to the context. I attack Ontario from Greenland Once this preamble has been passed and we have chosen which faction to bring into battle we will have at our disposal a world map with various ~hot spots~ marked which will be the places of battle which will become available from turn to turn with the related missions attached. We talk about maps and shifts just like in the case of the very famous board game Risiko, and this seems to have been the inspiration Ubisoft drew from for the battle scheme in EndWar: the progress of the clashes takes place precisely by following a shift circular where each side has the possibility to make its move which in the case of the player takes the form of the possibility of choosing the location in which to engage in battle among those currently unlocked. Each victory achieved will lead us to the conquest of the enemy territory with which we have just fought and the same will also happen for the clashes between the two forces commanded by the CPU which, obviously, are resolved automatically. All in function of our final objective which, always according to the tradition of the famous game with colored tanks, consists in conquering a certain number of territories. Obviously the missions will present diversified game modes ranging from the classic Elimination (where it will be sufficient to clean up the area from hostile forces) to other situations where we will be forced to attack or defend certain structures for a certain time, or other times our priority will be to conquer the greatest number of radio stations scattered around the map. The effect of our victories over the opponents is also diversified: if the conquest of a simple territory does not bring particular imbalances, the destruction of an enemy base will prevent the enemy from using his bonuses for three turns and even more serious will be the fall of the hostile capital, however a far from easy undertaking given that it will require at least three distinct battles to be able to win the strategic conquest. Another relevant aspect of this Ubisoft production is that of the experience accumulated by the troops who, if they survive the various missions, see their characteristics increase, making them increasingly effective in a second use on the battlefield, in this way if a battalion is close to capitulating it will be better to withdraw it in time from the clash rather than risk losing it forever. Each victory will also yield monetary gains that we could use to purchase upgrades and additional skills for men and vehicles whose strengths and weaknesses are based on the classic Chinese morra pattern. Who spoke? Let us now analyze what is the flagship of this production: the innovative control system. We never expected such an unusual approach to perform so well from the very first approach. The naturalness with which the game recognizes orders given via microphone is beyond allrosier expectation, you may happen to run into some imprecision of diction, yet the game will have a wide margin of recognition of the commands even in conditions of background noise. Communication couldn't be simpler: with the right trigger you have the possibility to ~talk~ to the game through basic sentences following the subject-verb-complement pattern and this, together with the fact that each battalion is marked with a number, makes it possible give any kind of order without any difficulty. The only limitation (if we want to talk about limitation) lies in the fact that in longer game sessions this efficient method tends to be replaced by the player by using the A key which has the function contextualized based on the framed object, so as to replace the vocal function also given the greater speed of execution. This happens due to the simple fact that the key numbers of each battalion are not represented on the minimap of the playing area (typical of every strategic one), so that the player is forced to frame the enemy unit every time and at this point it is easier resort to pressing a key. This is partially compensated for by the function of the mobile command center, a unit that allows a scan from above of the entire playing area including the information necessary to play, but which greatly reduces the impact of the entire command structure vowels, which could therefore remain in the background. Despite everything, however, resorting to the use of the voice is absolutely much more charismatic and fun and the satisfaction of seeing one's orders translated on the screen is priceless. Sunsets on a world in flames The atypicality of EndWar is also found in the technical sector: such attention to detail has hardly been seen in another strategic one. All the units have a valuable polygonal modeling, but what is most surprising is the meticulous rendering of the animations, often enhanced by shots worthy of a Hollywood direction and by a camera that always remains close to the action almost touching the point of view of individual troops, all for the benefit of the spectacular component. Also enjoyable is the skilful use of light sources that offer fantastic glimpses especially in the clashes fought at sunset with the fiery red sky and the sun's rays making their way between buildings and flying helicopters (do you remember the famous scene from Apocalypse Now? ) all accompanied by an action that is never lacking in effects and explosions, sometimes even of considerable size, such as when resorting to the defcom, the desperate use of nuclear weapons as a last resort. Also noteworthy is the excellent multiplayer component called Theater of War where there is the same map as the campaign, but this time it is a persistent world where each player can influence the outcome of the world battle (in all senses) together with everyone other users fighting for the same faction, seasoning EndWar with a massive online game component. Comment Tom Clancy's EndWar is good news that lays the solid foundations for a second life for real-time strategy games on consoles, leveraging on an idea like that of voice control. The mission of not making people regret the old mouse + keyboard pairing succeeded in an excellent way, at the cost, however, of a relative simplification of the interface which frankly seemed extremely inevitable to us. We are certainly dealing with one of the best exponents of this genre on consoles, which will surely please lovers of military tactics and orchestrated political fiction stories as only Tom Clancy can do. Also considering the first-rate technical sector, we find ourselves in the position of recommending this game to everyone, which has all the credentials to start a successful series of RTS. Provided that with small tricks voice control manages to become truly fundamental in the game economy.
