His armor is equipped with a deflector shield capable of withstanding a good number of blows and regenerating when not attacked, and the weapons supplied to his team range from the service machine gun to the sniper rifle, passing through rocket launcher, pulse rifles and grenades of various kinds. Corde's missions always begin with a jump from fifteen thousand feet: the critical altitude is reached, the air brakes and try not to enter the range of the anti-aircraft fire. If you land in one piece, you can focus on the objectives that are reported from time to time by the headquarters and eliminate all enemy soldiers in your path. A classic formula, which in Section 8 is repeated for each of the eight stages available in story mode and multiplayer. In the metallic shoes of Alex Corde, we will therefore find ourselves exploring more or less large scenarios, activating switches and fighting anyone who demonstrates hostile intentions. The launch from the army aircraft (which we must perform not only every time we start a mission, but also when we continue after a defeat) constitutes one of the two innovative elements of the game: we can decide where to land and manage the last phase of the launch as we believe, moving slightly on the map to find ourselves in the best position in relation to the enemy troops. The second novelty is represented by the management of support devices, intended both as radars and charging stations and as assault turrets and vehicles: as we eliminate our opponents, we earn credits which can then be spent to request the launch of a of these objects. The War of Armor Our character has two main and two secondary weapons (grenades, vibrating daggers, repair equipment), can run quickly (the ~boost~ activates after a few seconds) and has a jetpack that allows him to jump tens of meters as well as to ~soften~ any falls from above. The interface shows us at all times the number of ammunition left, the level of shields and any damage suffered by the armor, as well as the energy bar needed to run and jump. You are therefore strong with a good repertoire, there's no denying it, but you are far from invincible: deflector shields are easily destroyed by bursts of machine guns, so it is never wise to face enemies head on and without remaining in movement. Each of our weapons is equipped with a minimum zoom level and on certain occasions we can resort to a ~lock-on~ on the targets, especially useful when they jump trying to escape our attacks (they can do it too, yeah). Our endowment can be changed at the appropriate charging stations, but from the options it is possible to customize the ~classes~ to create the combination that best suits us. In singleplayer, the variants of enemies we are dealing with are not very many, but the differences between simple soldiers and commandos are immediately noticeable. Sometimes we will also find opponents equipped with enormous powered armor on our path, lethal in close combat (just end up in their grip to die) but also devastating from a distance. Our companions offer effective support, in the sense that they generally don't die and inflict quite a bit of damage to the opponents, but more often than not they get in our way and place themselves in our line of fire. Alone or in a group Eight stages are not many, unfortunately, and in fact we finished the story mode in just two game sessions on medium difficulty. The general impression is that Section 8 does nothing to get away from the ~already seen~ and from the habit of the FPS genre: the missions are very simple and repetitive, sometimes quite short, and the only interesting moments (for example when we drive a vehicle or power armor) are used little and badly. Online multiplayer allows up to forty players to challenge each other in eighteen maps, and there is certainly no shortage of modalities: some are based on the control of the territory, others on the escort, still others on the simple deathmatch. The management of extra devices during group matches takes on a much greater strategic value than in story mode, for example you can organize the anti-aircraft to prevent enemies from regenerating in certain points of the map - given that regeneration implies a launch from above : there is no need to land corpses already. We have notThere was a bit of lag during some phases, but in general the service seems to work well. If you have an Xbox Live gamertag, Section 8 will seamlessly interface with your account's scoring system, and you'll be able to manage your messages and friends list in the same way. Moving on to a quick technical analysis, unfortunately there isn't much to rejoice about: the Southpeak Games product stands out for the heaviness of the engine, slow and poorly optimized, together with a far from exciting cosmetics as regards the scenarios ( simple, ~aseptic~ and bare) and the visual effects (the explosions are awful). With an ATI Radeon 4870 we had to give up v-sync and some shadow detail to play smoothly at 1680 x 1050 dot resolution. The music is discreet, the effects quite ~pumped~ and present. Too bad for the dialogues only in English, since the textual translation into Italian on the right of the screen is very difficult to read during the action.", "date": "2009-10-23", "grade": "6.0"}
