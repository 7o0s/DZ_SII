Chris Darrill and Stormind Games (Italian team) continued to support their work, the first of a trilogy that will continue next year with the second chapter of the series, namely Remothered: Broken Porcelain. In the meantime, obviously, a port for Nintendo Switch could not be missing, given that up to now only the players of the Nintendo hybrid console had been left out. In fact, the title is currently available on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and now on Nintendo consoles. But what are the results achieved by the team conversion process? Not the best in recent history, unfortunately, and we tell it with a touch of regret. The conversion to Nintendo Switch The conversion of Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the specific and main subject of this article. We must therefore start from here, and raise the white flag: unfortunately we are not there. The work of Chris Darrill - the beautiful, disturbing and funny work of Chris Darrill, which has already received an 8.5 from two reviewers of Multiplayer.it, recently also with the review of Remothered: Tormented Fathers on PlayStation 4 - arrives on Nintendo Switch after an obviously problematic conversion. To tell the truth, it starts really well, suspended in a sort of hopeful illusion: the opening films present a remarkable detail for the Nintendo portable console, everything flows smoothly ... until it's time to really pick up the Joy-Con (or Pro Controller) and begin walking around Mr. Felton's property. And here things start to go wrong, mainly from the point of view of graphic rendering. Remothered: Tormented Fathers on Nintendo Switch is seen more or less as a PlayStation 2 title would be seen. The comparison might seem excessive, almost bad, but it is not like that: to tell you it is those who have already loved the video game, first on PC and then on PlayStation 4. The level of detail on the screen is at an all-time low, the backdrops blurred, faded, grainy, and the same can be said for the objects within reach of the protagonist. Even the lighting of the external environments, the surface of the few puddles, the setting of the sun among the trees, leave much to be desired. But the problems don't end there: stems of flowers that disappear if you get too close, interpenetrations (fortunately the latter are minimal), confusion of objects in the garden that fade into each other, distant surfaces that light up sporadically and for no reason. We could go on, but we won't. The situation does not improve once we finally enter the Felton villa, where the lighting shows obvious problems compared to the console and PC versions of the title. The suffused and gloomy atmosphere has become alienating: sometimes it is really difficult to distinguish objects across the room, let alone at the end of the corridor. As you can imagine, this makes it difficult not only to fully identify with the title, but also to act properly in the stealth phases, which represent its backbone. How to escape from Felton, place diversions, collect defensive objects, interact with very specific points of the environment, if almost everything is grainy and difficult to identify? You will have the demonstration in full evidence in the moments of transition between cinematics and actual gameplay. On consoles and PCs, the movies were a cut below the overall performance of the actual video game, qualitatively speaking. On Nintendo Switch, however, they are the most successful aspect: a fact that makes you think. All this does not improve in portable mode, but as always the small size of the screen makes certain defects, mainly visual, less perceptible and intrusive. The gameplay: the horror is safe Beyond the obvious conversion problems, poor graphic detail and a forgettable technical sector, there are at least two cards left to play on Switch that save the product from the abyss: the sound accompaniment and the story. The first masterfully renders the tense situation and the anguish of the protagonist Rosemary, and also proves to be important in terms of gameplay: it warns of the presence of enemies or potential changes in the game environment (perhaps a tool to be used as a diversion) . The narration, on the other hand, is another cornerstone of the approximately ten hours of play that will serve the buyer to fully explore everything that Remothered: Tormented Fathers has to offer, even on the Nintendo shores (they become about five for those who want to chorror until the end credits, not recommended choice). The unspeakable horror of the villa and the Feltons becomes more and more concrete, in a crescendo of events that will naturally need the subsequent chapters of the saga to fully understand them. No Nintendo Switch feature in particular seems to have been used, in what is evidently an attempt at conversion for its own sake, without note additions. There remains an audio in English accompanied by subtitles in Italian, which are not too legible in TV mode (but necessarily in portable mode the situation improves), and an Extra section that will make the happiness of those who want to really strip the title down to bottom. Too bad also for the lack of support for HD Rumble or an effective vibration system, which perhaps could have in turn supported (with tactile feedback) Rosemary's terrible adventure in the villa.", "date": "2019-09-06", "grade": "6.0"}
