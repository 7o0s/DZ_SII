{"name": "Yoshi's Crafted World: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yoshis-crafted-world-recensione.html", "text": "If Nintendo LABO were a platformer, it would be called Yoshi's Crafted World. Ebisu's creature for Nintendo Switch, born with a care impossible to summarize in a review, is so imbued with fabrics, cellulose and rubber that it is the perfect digitized representative of Kyoto's toy kits. The choice of Good Feel is clear but particular, as well as farsighted. Yoshi is almost an alien in the setting: a living, pulsating presence, but which exhausts its relationship with the player in the gameplay, leaving him delighted and enchanted by an artistic style that makes the dinosaur a creature out of context, walking around worlds where the he explosion of craftsmanship comes out of the screen and recalls the everyday, the real, moving away from fiction. The sensations experienced in traveling through the absolute maturity of Good Feel, a team capable of proposing an intelligent, full-bodied platform, never verbose in its horizontal development, sometimes brilliant in the vertical one, are strange yet splendid sensations. For the developers, Yoshi's Crafted World is a complete work that amazes and perfectly condenses ideas into a delightful playful package, bringing a typically Nintendian art of design out of Kyoto. By hand Once again the story is a pretext to push Yoshi out of his habitat, in search of gems to restore an artifact called the Sun of Wishes. This is how it begins, showing only the first portion of the game world map, as if not to weigh down the density of the experience, despite the fact that this is immediately wrapped in a stylistic veil that will make progress always light, cadenced, never tiring. The greatest strength of the title is its desire to keep fresh, always offering different points of view to the design of the levels, all particular, uniquely assembled and brilliant in their composition of platforms, flora and fauna. Trust us when we tell you that Yoshi's Crafted World is a product that overturns and reshuffles the player's expectations, leading him to ignore the typical concept of advancement associated with single player titles. Good Feel erases any precedents, laying the foundations for a software capable of whispering that what matters, in its worlds of paper and cardboard, is not drowning in difficulty or reaching the next level, but exploring while enjoying every artistic glimpse. This, at least, is what the game has continually transmitted to us: the worlds are numerous but short, made up of very few levels, each guided by a single idea of playful design and style that carries the development forward. It's a perfect formula, a recipe that works and excites without exhausting the player, continuously taken by the hand and led step by step, calmly, through a multitude of settings. Ebisu and his team have crafted scenarios that just ask to be admired, playful testimonies of all the care and skill that expert artists have used to create backdrops, creatures, buildings and more generally every scenic element. Especially in the second half, without even realizing it, you will return as dreamy little travellers, enchanted and fascinated by a blaze of spontaneity and naive authenticity that will make even those who read these lines smile and believe that those corners of our personality are relegated to a distant past. Eggs in the background None of this would work without oiled and crisp gameplay. The multiplanar egg launch mechanics convinces from start to finish and although the learning curve can sometimes hide small inaccuracies in viewfinder management, Good Feel manages to package a system that draws from tradition and carries the franchise forward with creativity . A fun logic, complementary to two-dimensional exploration, which provides nice hints for searching for objects in the background, necessary to complete dedicated quests. If we add to this the icing on the cake represented by the possibility of playing the internships in reverse in search of Poochy's puppies - with an annexed vision on the completely new ~shoulders~ level - the equation on the playful offer of the title is resolved. However you spin it, Yoshi's Crafted World returns a complete package, causing the player to replay a section multiple times to find all the hidden Laughing Suns as well as completing life and red coin challenges. It's backtracking, true, but that doesn't tire you by virtue of the team's skill in having designed levels that are perfectly balanced in their length. There's only one drawback, actually, hidden in the timed sections, a little heavy in the long run if you face it several times in a row, which however doesn't dirty the overall thought. The summary of the speech is perfectly applicable also to the infmultiplayer structure, which offers the possibility of playing for two on the sofa, enriching the offer with a further taste thanks to the mastery and expertise of detail with which the title is built. Playing with family or friends is the ideal summation of a design that encourages observation, creating a social fabric that entertains and brings together searching for objects here and there, as well as aiming, shooting eggs, wearing purchasable clothes and finding secrets and easter eggs . We conclude with a reassurance on longevity, really substantial if your goal is to finish the title in its entirety (and we are sure you will) and on the sound, composed of a perhaps not very high number of tracks, but each capable of transmitting positivity as well as that feeling so typical of the franchise and so capable of sticking in your head for days to come.", "date": "2019-03-27", "grade": "9.0"}
