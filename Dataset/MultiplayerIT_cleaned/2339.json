{"name": "Spiderman: Enter Electro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spiderman-enter-electro.html", "text": "Spiderman, you are spider-man. A year ago Activion released the hilarious Spiderman, an exceptional platformer with scrolling fighting game elements, which was, to say the least, enormously successful, so much so that the popular 3D platformer created by Neversoft also raged on the Dreamcast, Personal Computer and Nintendo 64, leaving to Vicarious Vicious the task (performed discreetly) of bringing Spidey to the Game Boy Advance. After so much clamor, the official sequel finally arrives, obviously in the Psone version (at least for now), will it be a worthy sequel or a parasite who tries to live off an income, thanks to an appealing title and a profitable legacy? Spider Instinct! As the owners of the prequel surely remember, Spiderman manages, after many vicissitudes, to put Doctor Octopus behind bars. For a while peace had peeped, but it was, apparently, the classic calm before the storm: learned of the creation of a device capable of giving enormous powers to its owner, Electro (whose real identity is Max Dillon, one of Peter Parker's bitterest enemies) assembles a band of deranged people to take it over. Obviously like Spider-Man, your task will be to bring the bad guys to justice and finally defeat the terrible Electro. Deja vu.... As soon as you finish the game's introduction, the options screen looks familiar.so much so that it appears to be identical to the prequel. After a few minutes, however, you realize how not only the game customization screen has remained practically unchanged from Activision's first Spiderman but also the graphics engine, the control system, the help given at the beginning of the game and much more. perhaps to repeat the blockbuster of the first chapter of the saga. Wanting to go against Giambattista Vico, we can assert, without fear of any mistake, that ~history does not always repeat itself~. Audiovisual production After the full motion video introduction, we get to the real game and the graphics engine (and not only that) is exactly the same as the prequel, so we will have backdrops whose technical realization varies from approximate to convincing, to quality sprites in the absolute average. If a year ago, one could speak of a job well done, the same cannot be absolutely reiterated now, also due to a camera that still throws tantrums and various drops in frame rates, absolutely unforgivable, especially considering that in the prequel they were banned . Nobody expected eons of times better visual accomplishment than the first Spiderman but we didn't expect, frankly, such a visual degradation with the handover from Neversoft to Vicarious Vicious (still responsible for the excellent cosmetics of Spiderman and Tony Hawk 2 on Game Boy Advance ). Negative notes also from an acoustic point of view, primarily for the music (fairly bland) while, as expected, the sound effects are the same as the game programmed by Neversoft, therefore quite effective. Audiovisual production Notes of merit for the vocal samples, present in large quantities: if the enemies still have a medium-low number of phrases, the vocal cords of Rino Romano (Spider-Man's voice actor), have really been put to the whips, giving a good number of sentences and jokes. But if the technical realization of the game produced by Activision definitely fails, we can at least hope that they are of a good standard ...... .........Playability and longevity With a lot of commands to learn, the prequel started the adventures of the beloved superhero, with a kind of tutorial, which remained identical (apart from the uncomfortable ~tutor~, this time The Beast of the Xmen); the game continues in a very similar way to the prequel, with enemies to be returned to the sender (between punches, kicks and cobweb shots), puzzles to solve and platforms to jump or cling to. .........Playability and longevity Unfortunately the unstable difficulty level (sometimes very simple, sometimes frustrating) doesn't help the player, as does the mobile camera, even more aberrant than the first episode (it was Spiderman's only tangible flaw). Painful conclusions At first glance, this Spiderman: Enter Electro looks like just a data disk from the first Spidey game. After about ten minutes, however, we understand how the game is instead worse than its illustrious predecessor: unchanged graphics, even worsened by slowdowns, not exciting music, game structure damaged by some decidedly not very fun sections and a camerara a little crazier than normal they bring down the more than good reputation that Vicarious Vicious had obtained with the latest productions. Perhaps it would have been enough to reconfirm Neversoft as the developer of this sequel and things would have gone better; as it is, it is recommended only to diehard fans of Spiderman and its predecessor, others await the arrival of Spiderman on Playstation 2. Pros: fun, especially at the beginning Spiderman!! Cons: mediocre technical realization zero originality playability badly calibrated crazy camera Spiderman, you are spider-man. Surely many adults like myself will recognize in the title of this introductory paragraph, part of the text of the theme song (initial and final) of the Spider-Man cartoon, better known as Spiderman, together with Batman and (only recently) the Xmen, among the most loved superheroes among American comics. For those few who have awakened from a hibernation that lasted over thirty years, let's say that Spider-Man is the alter ego of Peter Parker, a prodigal journalist for the Daily Bugle newspaper. Due to a tragic accident, he has become the legendary superhero (created by Stan Lee and Stev Dikto) who has been accompanying us for decades to the sound of animated series, comics and, next year, even a cinematic film. Obviously such an interesting subject could only inspire a lot of video games, from the time of the Commodore 64 to the new generation consoles, but the average quality of these tie-ins has always been quite low, with some exceptions such as the coin-op of the Sega from a decade ago based on System 32 motherboard and appearances in Capcom's two-dimensional fighting games (Marvel Super Heroes and Marvel Vs Capcom 2 among others).", "date": "2001-11-30", "grade": null}
