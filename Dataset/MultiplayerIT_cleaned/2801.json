Thinking back to how many series produced quality fruit in those years is a bit scary; Vanillaware managed to create its own precise, defined identity, made up of splendid moving artwork - at a time when making cel-shaded games was a business card - and merge them with more or less action role-playing game components. To George Kamitani, founder of Vanillaware, Switch must remind a little of those times: not that GrimGrimoire OnceMore is exclusive, mind you, it also comes out on PlayStation 4 and PS5, but it is evident how this type of product shines on the Nintendo laptop. Tirelessly fresh, highly playable, beautiful to look at in every situation, with lots of new features. Let's see in the GrimGrimoire OnceMore review how this new transposition of the classic Vanillaware is. GrimGrimoire OnceMore and Role Strategy The 2D beauty of GrimGrimoire OnceMore GrimGrimoire was a fine example of two-dimensional strategy, one of those confusing enough products, full of paradoxically frenetic but reasoned gameplay, with captivating and crazy characters. Few will remember GrimGrimoire for writing, and rightly so: it is the strategic heart that beats fast, its mix of tactics, hordes, continuous assaults, strategic choices in real time. Vanillaware was not tender, it did not have much mercy: GrimGrimoire is and remains a product for enthusiasts who know what they want from their pad, a title that forces them to understand what is happening and react accordingly. You could say that it is a typical feature of any real-time strategy, yes, but here we are in two dimensions: does it mean that the parallaxes and overlapping of units in the field are a problem, that having an analog stick to run here and there for the map it's another headache and then yes, it's Japanese, so it has some splendid antics of its own to digest and tend to love. If you have never picked up the original game, get ready for a journey of fantasy, magic and fairy tale in a distant tower, a storybook fantasy setting where our protagonist goes to learn the arts. On the fifth day, strange events will happen and, as it happens, we will find ourselves catapulted into an eternal loop in which everything starts over, allowing us to learn new skills and then, on the fifth day, we will be thrown back stronger than before. In between, obviously, strategic battles in which you can command elves, ghosts, fairies and artifacts, collect mana, recruit new units and find the best balance between heroic resistance to the waves and assaults carried out on the front line. Trust me, it works great: despite a genre never touched, Kamitani, the designer Kouichi Maenou and the team managed to deliver a whimsical, charismatic, niche product at the right point, deep and non-trivial, all traits that still pervade this modern re-proposition today. . Once again? The brilliant character design of GrimGrimoire OnceMore Vanillaware has made this new Lillet journey even more interesting, embellishing the journey with a decisive series of Quality-of-Life measures, some expected, some not. The technical impact is the one that strikes first: a renewed high definition graphic design, the widescreen format and in general a greater cleanliness as a result are almost obvious elements. The dubbing has been packaged again, resulting more decisive and captivating, even if we must spend a small note on the audio formats: the surround, inexplicably, has been castrated by an audio transmission that passes almost exclusively from the central channel, resulting in a bit caged, unable to express himself, sort of mono quality, let's hope they fix it. In addition to the so-called ~Great Magic~, powerful new spells to use in battle to overthrow it in our favor, Kamitani has rightly decided to implement a widely requested fast forward feature, one of those typically remastered features that diminishes the sense of frustration when he loses a fight of half an hour or more at the last minute. Another element included is manual saving in battle, as well as a Hard level made even more harsh. GrimGrimoire OnceMore in action In OnceMore, the role-playing park is enriched by end-of-battle objectives, which allow you to collect coins to spend to learnnew skills and upgrade our wizards. In general, in short, this version promises to accompany even the less experienced inside the strange tower, giving a less elitist and more democratic aura to a product that successfully entered niches in 2007, but remained there. Returning to the point of the first paragraph, the portable capacity of Switch amplifies the charm of GrimGrimoire and elevates it to a splendid Japanese strategy game to be played anywhere, without overdoing it, but also without missing a beat: the Vanillaware title is as beautiful today as it once was and that part Hogwarts, part Fable, part Odin Sphere atmosphere is unique and well worth your time.", "date": "2023-03-31", "grade": "8.5"}
