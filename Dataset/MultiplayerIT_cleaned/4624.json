An episode that, in fact, improved every possible and imaginable element of the original title, however losing that vein of innovation and originality that had characterized the debut of the franchise. However, the guys from Arkane Studios have not remained idle all this time: they first launched the popular Prey on the market and now it's the turn of The Death of the Outsider, a DLC-expansion that has the particular nature of be a standalone. In other words, it is not necessary to own or have installed one of the two titles in the series to be able to play it. Indeed, according to the words of the developer, this extra content is aimed primarily at those who do not know the saga in the slightest. In reality, we will return to this statement later, after having told you what this DLC is offering. The protagonists are Billie Lurk, a prominent character already seen in an expansion of the first Dishonored as well as a leading figure in the sequel, and Daud, the antagonist of the original title, the one who gave the crucial push to the events of the world created by Arkane Studios, killing the Empress Kaldwin in the incipit of the debut chapter. In reality, players will only be given the opportunity to guide Billie but the search for her ancient mentor represents the beginning of the adventure, whose focus soon shifts towards the recovery of an ancient dagger capable of creating, but above all killing , the outside. The ultimate goal, as also clearly highlighted by the title, is in fact to assassinate the dark-eyed entity to follow a fascinating theory. Everything that is bad in the provinces of Karnaca, Dunwall and the entire empire is caused by the subterfuges and machinations of this deity who just can't help but intervene in the lives of men by giving his special powers and assigning tasks capable of destabilizing governments. If the incipit is at least interesting especially for those who are already familiar with the game world, the problem of The Death of the Outsider is primarily linked to a narrative arc that remains extremely superficial and barely mentioned following chronologically what is told in the second Dishonored. It is full of useful tricks to never delve into the events, it lacks memorable characters, if we exclude the three mentioned (and we also feel like expressing some doubts about Daud) and it is extremely linear. In short, it lacks all that in-depth analysis seen in the two Dishonored that led the player to become passionate about a sea of secondary figures with whom one often had to confront oneself morally even in the complex decision to assassinate them or leave them alive to atone for their sins. There is little story during the missions and the only moments of storytelling are relegated to very short cutscenes that fill the loading seconds between one mission and the next. The usual, perfect stealth If from a narrative point of view we are therefore faced with a discrete result but without peaks, on the gameplay front we cannot help but refer to what was said in the reviews of the two main chapters. Dishonored is an exceptional first-person shooter where the stealth element is strongly encouraged and the taste and satisfaction experienced in remaining in the shadows, studying the environment and carrying out assassinations without being seen or, better still, exploiting the elements of the scenario, they are huge. If, on the one hand, therefore, even The Death of the Outsider follows the crucial elements of the series perfectly, offering that super-refined and refined gameplay, on the other, there is no doubt that we are faced with numerous simplifications. Billie has a completely new but decidedly restricted set of powers. A teleportation that is very reminiscent of the original Corvo's Blink with the only difference that the movement will not be instantaneous but will first require the positioning of the protagonist's silhouette; an ability that allows Billie to assume the physical features of any other character so that she can go unnoticed on patrols or be mistaken for someone else; a skill that allows you to transcend from materiality to be able to roam freely in the environment and observe enemies and special objects, so as to plan your own approach and escape tactics. In reality there are two more powers, let's say passive: Billie is able to understand the language of mice and receive valuable information on hidden access routes while in the second half of the game, she has access to an upgrade of the main weapon that allows her to unleash a special shot that literally sends enemies hit in melee flying through the air. There is no progression or upgrade of any kindor of these abilities and on a narrative level, this is justified by the fact that Billie has not actually been ~blessed~ by the Outsider, but the latter has ~only~ given her some artifacts that enhance her abilities. Another important consequence of this lack of direct connection with oblivion concerns the management of mana which is no longer definitively consumed as skills are used but more simply recharges automatically after a very few moments of inactivity. At the same time, the direct consequence between the chaos generated by one's actions and the degradation of Karnaca is completely skipped, making Billie's passage almost irrelevant for the evolution of the game world. Except of course a small choice at the time of the epilogue. If therefore a chronic lack of a sense of progression is perceived in function of all that we have already described, we must likewise point out that the gameplay still continues to work. Even Death of the Outsider is based on the usual assumption of offering the player gigantic extremely fascinating levels full of access and escape routes, filling them with guards and points of interaction and then leaving him total freedom of action. From this point of view, the lightening of the mechanics works perfectly: having eliminated the consumption of mana and any repercussions on the scenario, the player is much more stimulated to change his approach while running, continuously passing from the most ruthless action to the stealth more silent, according to the situation and his desire. What we have already said during our judgment on the two main Dishonored remains clear: the game tends to reward above all those who move with stealth and, from this point of view, the presence of three powers that do not offer any element of offense - excluding the teleportation that allows you to kill those who are in our point of arrival, however causing us damage - it should leave no doubt about the will of the developer also with regard to this DLC. A creative recycling And we come to the topic of longevity. Concretely, The Death of the Outsider is made up of five missions that will keep you busy, at most, for about ten hours if you dedicate yourselves to uncovering every little secret and completing every secondary element offered by this additional content: more realistically you will spend between six and the eight hours to see the epilogue. Even if those who have never played a Dishonored in their life will not experience the same feeling of deja vu, there is no doubt that with this DLC the developer has overemphasized the recycling activity. In fact, at least a couple of these missions will force us to explore the same scenario far and wide, Cyria Alta, while the penultimate quest will even lead us to face again a splendid level of the second chapter, the Royal Conservatory, albeit with the due differences related to the plot. If, therefore, it remains an obligation to underline the incredible architectural design of the levels that also make up this additional content, with the peak reached with the mission set in the bank of Karnaca, a certain tendency towards saving on the part of Arkane Studios transpires from the scenarios faced. More generally, this creeping feeling of never being faced with something really new or memorable, whether it's a scenario or a character to be followed and perhaps assassinated. And if on the one hand it can also be taken for granted since it is a DLC, at the same time we must always keep in mind the proclamations of the developer who on more than one occasion has underlined how Death of the Outsider was the ideal game for newbies to the saga. Well, we just don't feel like confirming this statement. Primarily because in our opinion it is not the best exponent of the saga and, secondly, because only those who fully know the narrative arc of Dishonored can notice and appreciate the many references scattered along the missions of this DLC and the numerous winks at situations in which we have found ourselves involved in the past. Before moving on to the technical aspect, it is necessary to say a few words about contracts, the only real new element introduced in this expansion. These are small side missions that must be carried out within the level and which can be collected on the black market, where Billie can buy ammunition, gadgets and the numerous bone amulets essential to offer additional bonuses and variations to the powers possessed. In some rare cases we found ourselves faced with quests that required alternative approaches to the main mission, more often it was insteadof very simple assassination or liberation missions that forced us to explore the length and breadth of the map. Also in this case we are not faced with anything revolutionary but it is undoubtedly a pleasant addition. Where The Death of the Outsider hits the mark perfectly is in the technical aspect. We all remember the chaos generated by Dishonored 2's shaky, to put it mildly, release on PC, and this forced the developer to work heavily on engine optimization. The result is that both the original game and this DLC are now perfectly playable even with not particularly performing PCs, allowing us to enjoy the high artistic value of the scenarios created with incredible skill by Arkane Studios.
