Improved year after year, as we specified in our recent preview, with this chapter the series has reached a peculiar turning point, for two main reasons: on the one hand we have the radical change in the technical regulation of the discipline, defined by insiders as the more ~important in the last 60 years~, on the other hand the well-established presence of next-gen consoles, which has prompted developers to create a completely new product and whose debut is expected in March next year. F1 2014 therefore represents the last chapter expressly designed for the so-called older generation (in fact it will not be released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) and, although future versions of the game are conceivable also for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 - considering the huge installed base of console - there is no doubt that the production is about to evolve under a new guise, necessary for the limits accrued by the tested Ego Engine. Waiting to know the details on this new version, completely shrouded in mystery and finally scheduled to accompany the start of the next world championship, we dived into the analysis of the definitive version of F1 2014 for PC; these are our impressions after many hours of driving. With F1 2014 an era closes while Codemasters prepares to open another Alternative energy The first detail that fans of the series will notice in this new chapter is the suppression of the so-called Tests for young drivers, which, as happened for the real competition, have been replaced by generic tests that the teams can hold on certain days of the year . The removal of free tests, for some years now, has been one of the most criticized and debated topics ever in Formula One circles, given that for insiders, many drivers - especially the young ones - for this reason do not are comfortable, for example, driving in the rain, thus catalysing the risk of serious accidents like the one that happened to the very unfortunate Jules Bianchi at Suzuka in Japan, although in this case other factors intervened. These generic tests, called ~Evaluation tests~ in the game, represented an opportunity for Codemasters to introduce a start-up test that can be recalled within the career menu, the purpose of which is to evaluate the player's driving skills and suggest, at the end of the session, the level of difficulty and other parameters able to personalize the experience. We remind you that Codemasters, in the official presentation release of the title, announced the introduction of the new ~very easy~ difficulty level, designed for casual players and for those who complained about the complexity of the title even by selecting the lowest level of challenge. However, do not think of a casual drift of production, since by eliminating all driving aids and setting an adequate level of difficulty, F1 2014 represents the classic solid - but not pure - simulation we are used to, despite some ~licenses~ which we will talk about later after you. It is simply a question of expanding the market share, making the product attractive also to F1 enthusiasts who are not exactly skilled virtual drivers. A choice not to be blamed, given the fierce competition for racing games in this fantastic autumn/winter 2014 season, the prohibitive cost of the official F1 license and, last but not least, a video game market which, despite the good results achieved by some software and hardware, is nonetheless feeling the pinch of the economic crisis. Having determined the skill level of the player, who can still ignore the advice of the evaluation test, he is projected into the main menu of the game, where it is possible to access the various modes and adjust numerous settings. The main mode, as per tradition, is represented by the long Career, which this year - at least in our review code - can be undertaken starting with any team, rather than being forced to select one of the more ~poor~ teams (such as Marussia or the Catheram), to then arouse the interest of the more and more prestigious ones obtaining good results on the track. Selected the stable, among other things associated with a further level of specific difficulty (the Mercedes-Benz, for example, representexempt the easy, the Williams the intermediate and the Lotus the difficult), we start as the second guide and access the usual pre-session menu in the classic Codemasters style: here we find the inevitable Career Center with the seasonal calendar and the relative statistics to your driver, the area dedicated to emails where managers, engineers and personal agents leave us various information, news, driver and constructor standings and, of course, the settings. The latter are very detailed and give the possibility to choose, for example, the level of participation, i.e. whether to face a long weekend with complete qualifications or perhaps a short one with immediate qualifications, the race distance (25%, 50% or 100% of laps actually foreseen) and the activation or otherwise of the so-called parc ferme. As far as the difficulty is concerned, beyond the parameters that influence the gameplay, which we will discuss in the next paragraph, the simulation settings allow you to adjust the flags (realistic, reduced or relating only to the cut of the curves), the assistance stop, the level of difficulty of the artificial intelligence - from amateur to legend - and the inevitable flashbacks, the distinctive brand of Codemasters products that has also taken hold in other driving titles, such as the two Forza series by Turn 10 and PlayGround Games . Once the Grand Prix has started, we find ourselves projected into the classic pre-race menu, where, inside the single-seater and in front of a monitor, by turning our head we can make choices relating to the set-up or tyres, speed up the qualifying time or dedicate ourselves to Research and Development sessions, which through specific tests on the track - such as maintaining the trajectory or a certain average speed - make it possible to obtain advantages for one's car over the course of the season. Everything is presented exactly as in past years, both from a stylistic and content point of view, and enthusiasts will immediately find themselves at ease. The 2014 season, now at sunset, was long and exciting, and in the title Codemasters we will find all the specificities that are still characterizing it: among the most interesting innovations there are obviously the rookie circuits of Spielberg (Austria) and the Russian one of Sochi, built around the park of the recent Winter Olympics, the fascinating night race in Bahrain - to celebrate 10 years in Formula One - and the return of the highly technical German Hockeneimring, absent from the 2012 calendar. Among other modes accessible from the menu main features are the classic personalized Grand Prix, the Championship Challenge which projects the player into 10 events where certain objectives can be achieved, the aforementioned Evaluation test, the multiplayer component (Lan, online and shared screen for two players) and the rich Banco di trial. In it it is possible to access the classic challenges of the Scenario mode, where you can relive 20 key events of the current season - organized into four groups of increasing difficulty - and the Counter-Time and Time Trial modes, in which you obviously challenge the stopwatch and compete against the inevitable ghosts. In short, as you may have guessed, this is the usual very rich, solid dish that will keep you busy for a long time, at least until the debut of the highly anticipated next-gen chapter scheduled for spring next year. Unfortunately, the captivating and fascinating Classic mode that embellished the 2013 chapter is missing, but the significant changes that have taken place in the technical regulation of the discipline have forced the developers to focus exclusively on the new cars. Burning acceleration As already amply specified, the innovations introduced in Formula One this year - not without controversy - were so sensitive as to be defined as ~epochal~ for the history of this sport, going to influence the heart, appearance, sound and above all the behavior of the cars. From this point of view, a commendable job has been done by the British developers, who, despite having kept the technical-content component of the work practically unchanged, have made the biggest changes precisely in terms of gameplay. The new turbo-electric V6s to replace the old naturally aspirated V8s, in fact, due to the monstrous maximum torque, the almost total absence of electronic aids (beyond the brake-by-wire technology on brake control) and the automation of the kinetic energy recovery system (the old KERS, renamed ERS-K), have made the new single-seaters incredibly nervous, with driving dynamics that are decidedly more complex than in the past, even in the game with the same virtual electronic aids implemented. Making comparisonsnt directly onto the track with F1 2013, the tendency of the new cars to oversteer and ~slap~ violently out of the corners is evident, forcing the player to constantly balance and recover the very fast and exuberant vehicle. Of course, we are not dealing with a pure simulation such as the mod dedicated to F1 downloadable for Assetto Corsa, supported by the valuable driving model shaped by Kunos Simulazioni, however the behavior of the cars keeps the player under constant pressure and guarantees hours and hours of healthy fun, both for the Sunday driver and the most intransigent enthusiast, thanks to the remarkable scalability. The vehicle damage system still leaves us perplexed, in which it is practically impossible to perceive the limits and breaking dynamics of elements such as the suspension and nose, influenced more by fate than by rigorous mathematical algorithms. Beyond this historical defect, however, there are various types of failures, an excellent tire wear system, the possibility of adjusting the mixture to provide more or less power to the car, pit stops, the DRS system and much more. ; elements that affect the solidity and completeness of the Codemasters work. The flagship of the production, once again, is the fabulous dynamic weather, capable of literally upsetting the outcome of a race and triggering the whirlwind of pit stops, as well as profoundly influencing the behavior of the cars and visibility. In the Malaysian Grand Prix of Sepang, for example, in the final laps we were caught red-handed by a very violent downpour after having ~sailed~ under a constant drizzle with intermediate tyres: unlike other riders, we decided to continue with the tires already fitted rather than equipping wet ones, a disastrous choice in terms of times and positions lost on the finish line, a symptom of the developers' excellent attention to detail. Naturally, the driving experience changes exponentially when playing with a joypad or a steering wheel: we carried out the various tests with a professional peripheral (the Thustmasters TX Ferrari 458 Italia Edition) and the result was decidedly appreciable, above all by eliminating ABS, power brakes, power steering and by setting the traction control to intermediate. Removing it completely, in fact, the driving model becomes extremely complex and to better tame your single-seater you need many hours of practice and a millimeter knowledge of the circuits. Excellent and aggressive, as always, the artificial intelligence, capable of surprising the player with textbook maneuvers and overtaking, as well as making the various competitions coherent and exciting. More of the same From a purely technical point of view, the work of Codemasters is practically a copy and paste of the previous version, where the versatile graphics engine Ego Engine, now evidently pushed to its limits - starting from the bases of the old generation of consoles - still offers a enjoyable and above all fluid visual experience. With our test configuration, F1 2014 is in fact nailed to 60 frames per second at Ultra level of detail and in 1080p, giving its best, as usual, during the pouring downpours, where the dynamic weather of Codemasters represents a absolute excellence in the world videogame panorama. Beyond the new cars and the new circuits, among which the one in Sochi should be mentioned for the attention to detail, we find ourselves before a product that is completely similar to the previous iteration: not all the textures are of good quality and leave a lot to be desired above all the models of the staff and the pilots, both from the point of view of the animations and for the aesthetic rendering, while the various architectural structures that surround the circuits are generally bare, net of some appreciable exceptions. The lighting system is excellent except in night races, while the reflections are a bit too accentuated on the liveries of the cars, whose polygonal models, although faithful reproductions of the real ones - well proportioned and full of details - are a couple of steps away behind the production values achieved in the most modern driving simulators. There is no doubt that on a technical level we expect a significant leap forward in the first next-gen chapter of the series, which fortunately will not be long in coming. The audio sector is also good, although the new turbo-electric engines do not have a properly pleasant or vigorous sound and can cause some problems when changing gear, especially when starting off. As we underlined in the preview, the new ones must certainly be commended", "date": "2014-10-15", "grade": "8.0"}
