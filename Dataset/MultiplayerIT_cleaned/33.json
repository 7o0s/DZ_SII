{"name": "Genji: Days of the Blade - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/genji-days-of-the-blade-recensione.html", "text": "Genji's name is not new for action adventure enthusiasts, his first appearance was in fact on PlayStation 2 with Dawn of Samurai, a title that has garnered some success, despite clashing with sacred monsters of the genre such as Onimusha, Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden. Born from the mind of Okamoto, a famous former Capcom producer, the title also showed excellent potential, and it was therefore natural to hypothesize a sequel, which we see materialized at the launch of PlayStation 3 with Days of the Blade. The result? Let's find out together. Not surprisingly, the game begins exactly after the end of the first chapter, with several sequences illustrating past events and those about to take place. The protagonist remains Yoshitsune, noble swordsman and defender of the Genji clan, who once again will find himself facing the rival Heishi clan who, although defeated in the first chapter, will make his return helped by mysterious demonic forces. This time there will be three supporting actors who will support Yoshitsune during the course of the adventure and, as in any good self-respecting action, each of them will be equipped with different skills, type of weapon and speed / strength in their possession. Another peculiar feature is the possibility, for everyone, to use a particular combination to overcome certain obstacles, Shizuka for example you can use your weapon as a sort of grappling hook to cling and overcome ditches or other, Benkei instead use your brute strength to destroy obstacles otherwise insurmountable. If in most of the scenarios it is possible to choose at any time which character to use, thanks to the four arrows on the digital pad, in some levels we will be ~forced~ to use only a subset of them, in such a way as to be able to explore them all. There will be the possibility of acquiring new weapons or enhancing your character's energy and mana, through the usual power ups scattered throughout the levels that will be highlighted by the protagonist's karma, which will emit an increasingly bright light in their proximity. The last two peculiarities of the combat system reside in being able to change weapons on the fly without interrupting the action and in some devastating combos that can be performed after filling the appropriate bar next to the character's energy: the action will pass on to a new level dimensional and the character will be able to perform a series of chained moves that will kill or leave the opponents with low energy. The adventure then unfolds through a series of levels focused mainly on fights, topped off with often difficult bosses and occasional puzzles, and all the problems of the game start from here. Their implementation is in fact often monotonous and frustrating, moreover it often happens that you don't understand in which direction to go for their resolution. Even the creation of the levels can be widely reviewed, often it is a matter of facing long corridors, killing enemies, visiting rooms and so on, without particular cues. The exact same goes for facing enemies, often it boils down to a continuous pressing of the keys without any strategy. Fortunately, to break a cycle that is certainly not exciting, we think about the clashes with the bosses, present in good numbers and often more tactical and spectacular, in some of these we also notice the presence of giant crabs, whose presence is justified by Okamoto's fears for these animals, as explained in our news. On the other hand, the graphic aspect is quite different, which even if in flashes makes the Sony title a good vision for the eyes, especially as regards the settings of some advanced levels, rich in polygons, well defined, colorful and certainly inspired by the artistic point of view. The animations of the main protagonists are also excellent, a little less those of the enemies, often not very dynamic and therefore passive for improvements. Nothing to complain about the sound sector either, with instrumental music that goes well with the action and with well-sampled and fairly varied sound effects. The problems of Days of the Blade therefore and unfortunately all reside in the gameplay, the game is not very fun, it offers mechanics already seen and revised in many other titles of the genre and a flat and monotonous level design, then the puzzles are certainly the icing on a cake not top notch. Comment Unfortunately, the latest iteration of Genji has only a part of the next gen technical sector, thanks to some very appreciable levels and bosses and to interesting ideas such as the possibility of using four different characters in almost every situation. Unfortunately, however, the game fails to offer a fresh and non-repetitive game mechanic, which also clasheswith other structural defects. Days of the Blade therefore remains a technically valid action and aimed above all at the most ardent fans of the genre, the others can also wait for more valid exponents. Pros Technically sound Often fun bosses to deal with Cons Uninspired level design Repetitive and sometimes frustrating action Hackneyed game mechanics", "date": "2007-03-13", "grade": null}
