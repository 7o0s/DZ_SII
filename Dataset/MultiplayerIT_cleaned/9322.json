That game was called Primal Rage and, no, Fights Among The Giants: Dinosaurs 3D has nothing to do with that fighting game. Others, on the other hand, will remember another mediocre beat'em up with dinosaurs, titled Warpath: Jurassic Park, inspired by the novel of the same name by the late Michael Chricton. They are perhaps the most striking examples of fighting games with dinosaurs as protagonists, but they are certainly not the only cases in which prehistoric lizards have burst into the world of video games as stars of the stage. The new Ubisoft title in the Combats among Giants series is set in the Jurassic era and takes on two responsibilities: to bring dinosaurs back into fashion as the absolute protagonists of a videogame title in which there are no soldiers trained to shoot them down like deer and to support the launch of the Nintendo 3DS with a game that can at least demonstrate the potential of the console. In both cases the result is, so to speak, already fossilized. Dino Fighter The premise of Fights Among the Giants: Dinosaurs 3D is disarmingly simple: there is a kind of demented plot in the background of the game, with a bad guy, the Archosaur, who is somehow endangering the era of dinosaurs. The player takes on the role of a dinosaur, chosen among the various ones available that make up the four main ~families~: Predators (T-Rex and similar), Hunters (including the nice Velociraptors), Assaulters (which include quadrupeds such as the Triceratops) and Defenders (Stegosaurus and company). Obviously there is not much that is realistic in this subdivision, which in reality only serves to distinguish the various creatures by fighting ability, in the sense that the Hunters are very fast but more inclined to get thrown out of the battlefield, while the Defenders they have completely opposite characteristics: very slow but solid as boulders. The choice of the dinosaur actually changes very little both in terms of gameplay and plot and to complete the game it will be necessary to finish the main ~campaign~ with each family, repeating the same battles against the same enemies in the same environments. In short, it is not an exciting premise, but it reflects the simplicity of the concept and of the game system, clearly aimed at the little ones. The development involves two distinct phases: one is exploratory, during which we will follow a pre-established path to explore a setting, collect objects and meet enemies; the other instead consists of the real fights against the Archosaur's minions who will interrupt our raids, needless to say that the only way to continue is to defeat them in a duel. The 3D effect Needless to say, the 3D effect of Fights Among Giants: Dinosaurs 3D is a mere visual frill and does not affect the gameplay in the slightest; on the other hand, however, it is also true that sometimes it gives some rather surprising shots, especially when the enemy is given the coup de grace, which for a moment seems to fall off the screen, or when exploring the more elaborate settings, perhaps while a volcanic fragment hits the ground behind us, raising a column of smoke that produces a very pleasant detached effect. No expense spared here, or almost Forget about combos and rotations of the stick, this is certainly not Super Street Fighter IV, despite the position of the three-quarter camera, during the fights, reminiscent of the optional one included in the Nintendo 3DS version of the Capcom game. Each battle is basically limited to requiring you to anticipate the enemy's attack to dodge it before it hits, thus allowing us to inflict more damage with our blow. Occasionally we will have a more damaging special attack and sometimes the environment around us will change, perhaps due to an earthquake, limiting the space and making it easier to perform a ~ring out~ but other than that the game is reduced really to press a key at the right time and dodge in the right direction by pressing left or right, since it is not even possible to move freely. Each victory rewards us with an object that can be equipped to improve our fighting skills, perhaps increasing power or defense, but this sort of management element of the gameplay certainly does not make the fights less apathetic and monotonous. Fortunately, the little paleontologist in us will be delighted to be faced with fairly faithful polygonal reproductions of the creatures that inhabited our planet millions of years ago. Almost all, at least, given that i~bad~ dinosaurs exhibit anything but realistic spikes and spines, probably added to emphasize their belonging to the forces of evil. The settings are also well done and the 3D effect, while not particularly exciting, makes some shots decidedly more spectacular, increasing their depth. For the rest, Fights Among the Giants: Dinosaurs 3D does not present any noteworthy extras that could lengthen its longevity or encourage you to play it after completion: the unlockable customization options are few and modest, alternative colors and little else, and there is no the minimum multiplayer feature.", "date": "2011-04-27", "grade": "4.0"}
