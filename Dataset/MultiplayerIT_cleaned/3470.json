{"name": "What the Golf?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/what-the-golf-recensione.html", "text": "As we will see in the course of the review, What the Golf? it starts from the sport that gives it its title to transform it into something completely different. Since the world of video games was born, developers have actively pursued two great ways of understanding the medium: as a tool for simulating reality or as a means of overcoming it by offering otherwise impossible experiences. If we want, a similar dichotomy is also present in cinema, born with the films of the Lumires and Mlis, but let's not get too far away from our small playable title for now only through the Apple Arcade subscription (coming soon on PC, then on Nintendo Switch ) Game mechanics In terms of game mechanics What the Golf? it is of an almost disarming simplicity. All that is required of the player is to give strength and direction to the shots. However, it is the side dish that makes the whole experience a magnificent madness. Triband's work is the game of golf reinterpreted in a Dadaist key, in which the goal is not necessarily to pot a ball in as few shots as possible, but to enjoy what we can define as a kaleidoscope of associated absurdities to each other spontaneously. After the first hole, the ball transforms and becomes any object in the scenario. Thus the player finds himself throwing houses, animals, cars, the hole itself, the golfer and so on in an unpredictable whirlwind of situations, which become the focus of the gameplay. Golf as a sport emerges marginalized, almost ignored. Basically it's just a pretext to create visual puns and to delight the player with the countless surprises offered by the courses. After a few minutes you start wondering what will be the object thrown into the next hole and what particularities the new path will have. It should be noted that to keep the pleasure of discovery unchanged from start to finish, the pace of play has been made decidedly fast: each hole can be finished in a matter of seconds and the next one is accessed from a hub area in which one must continue to throw the ball towards the unlocked courses. Even in the latter, there is no shortage of surprises, given that soon what appears to be formed only by a series of corridors becomes a real small campaign in its own right, complete with crossroads and bosses. Gameplay The developers have taken enormous liberties in the design of the holes. They are usually viewed from above, but there are also side-views, with the latter being the excuse for adding extra mechanics, such as the ability to hang the ball to swing it, or otherwise impossible scenarios, such as the one inspired by the Portal series. But there's much more: some levels even turn into a kind of first-person shooter, others become obstacle courses, others still competitions of skill to avoid being thrown off the course. There is no shortage of references to other video games, with levels inspired by Superhot, others by Guitar Hero, still others by Katamari Damacy. The tones of What the Golf? they are always light-hearted, in a certain sense irreverent, as if the gameplay invites the player not to take seriously what appears on the screen, giving it the right weight. After all, it's a golf game designed for golf haters, as the official description states... n total, the Triband title ends in five hours, considering the time needed to finish all the holes, plus the time to overcome all the challenges (they are unlocked after the conclusion of a hole), plus some extras. In reality, for completionists who want to enjoy it 100%, the game time is further extended, but let's say that they make a story in themselves.", "date": "2019-09-29", "grade": "8.5"}
