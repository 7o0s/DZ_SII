Arma Mobile Ops presents itself as a decidedly better studied project, the result of a more advanced conception of the mobile market and greater familiarity with the touch screen control system, as well as a surprising familiarity with the most current dynamics of the free-to- play with micro-transactions. Beyond the military setting there isn't much of the old Arma in this mobile reinterpretation, which appears as a spin-off in its own right with a lot of (trivial) story to follow mission by mission with a fictional setting that does not it has a lot to do with the simulative rigor of the PC original. That's a good thing, though, especially considering it's a fundamentally different game, as Mobile Ops is a real-time strategy game in its own right. We therefore find ourselves controlling an army engaged in a mission within a foreign territory in which a local leader of the armed forces has decided to take control of the country and our goal is obviously to restore order with the bad guys. It is a free-to-play and this, also given the stratification of the typical RTS structure, paves the way for a whole system of micro-transactions linked to the various aspects of base management, which however are not too pressing . Essentially, every single construction and expansion for every unit and building requires a certain amount of fuel and resources, elements that are conquered in battle and constantly collected by the base structures themselves but which can also be purchased through real money, which obviously cuts greatly the inevitable expectations that we are otherwise forced to endure. Arma becomes mobile and strategic in one fell swoop: a successful experiment for Bohemia Interactive Mobile strategy Arma Mobile Ops is divided into two distinct sections: base management and battle action. The first is the one that takes the most time and which also includes the entire micro-transaction system. As per tradition, it is a question of constructing the various buildings suitable for the recruitment of troops, for training and specialization, for the collection and storage of resources and fuel and so on up to the more specialized and advanced structures such as communication systems and defensive weapons more sophisticated. In fact, it is also necessary to protect the base from external attacks that occur during multiplayer battles, one of the two basic options into which the combat phase is divided. Battles play out like a highly simplified version of the classic RTS: the player is required to choose where to deploy troops and they simply follow a path set by the artificial intelligence. Pathfinding is quite logical, focused on taking down the closest targets of greatest interest, but certainly greater interaction would certainly have benefited those looking for a more classic strategic structure. However, it is a good solution for the mobile environment, where the sessions are likely to be fast and require limited concentration on average, therefore it would be inappropriate to propose long and multifaceted missions, in which it is necessary to individually control the units in the field. The impression remains that the management component of the base is much more developed and profound than that properly linked to action on the field, but this is not necessarily a defect, just bear in mind that more than strategic skill in battle here perhaps counts resource management and looking after your base. Clearly the free-to-play structure opens the way to the usual wait-based mechanics to perform any build and upgrade action (waits that can obviously be eliminated by paying), so if you don't want to spend you have to consider a rather patient approach, especially at the more advanced levels. Finally, it should be noted that Arma: Mobile Ops requires a constant internet connection in order to function, which could be a problem for those who play on devices with only Wi-Fi connectivity.", "date": "2016-07-22", "grade": "7.8"}
