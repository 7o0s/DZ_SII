{"name": "AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/99320-asuras-wrath-ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3Anger, wrath, fury, feelings that we have all more or less touched and that it would be advisable to ~download~ as quickly as possible, perhaps without harming others. However, this cannot always happen in real life and here is a video game that developers can indulge themselves with. As in the case of Asura's Wrath, for which Capcom made use of the collaboration with CyberConnect2 (those of Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja, so to speak) in order to create an action over the top, extremely spectacular and based on fights against huge bosses and which involve exploiting the feeling of revenge of the main protagonist, General Asura, against those who were once the eight celestial guardians with him, and who then proclaimed themselves divinities determined to purify the world from the Gohma, impure creatures on the way to reach the Ultimate End. Retaliation because they betrayed Asura and kidnapped his daughter Mithra, a priestess able to catalyze the power of the Mantra (the energy of the Universe) and put it at the service of the divinities and the machines they use. Not delving further into the maze of the story, the developer has set up the game as if it were a cartoon series, divided into 19 Kandas, each of which is interrupted in the middle with a still image (and the name of the game in the form of a logo) for then start over as happens for example after an advertising interlude. At the end of each Kanda there is a preview of what will happen in the next one, another feature borrowed from the iconography of Japanese animation. MITHRAAAAAA!!!!! The gameplay is more connected to the story than you think, as the vicissitudes affecting the main protagonist allow access to more or less powerful skills, as well as free sections, running or flying. Asura has the classic jump, a quick attack (circle button) and a power one (triangle) that generates a shock wave capable of sending smaller enemies away or interrupting the attack of more powerful ones. However, the latter requires a certain amount of time to be used again, unless Asura, after several successful hits, enters 'delirium' mode, thanks to a special bar that must be activated with the L2 key. Finally, the square allows you to throw a series of projectiles that become automatic hookup in conjunction with the triangle button in the in-flight gameplay sections or in others provided by the developers. To govern Asura's fighting skills there are two further bars, that of energy, which needs no further explanation, and that of fury, which fills up as the blows are scored and which sanctions the end of the fight or the achievement of a key moment in the event that it is made up of several ~steps~. In fact, just press the R2 key to turn the events around and access what represents the backbone of the entire narrative system, the quick time event sequences thanks to which you must never lose your attention from what is happening on the screen . The most spectacular vicissitudes, the decisive blows, the most devastating combos, the most dangerous counterattacks, even the dialogues are accompanied by the pressure of specific keys within a certain period of time, in such a way as to turn the fight in one's favor and obtain an evaluation improve. In fact, at the end of each Kanda, a grade is obtained based on some parameters which include, for example, the time taken and the percentage of success of these particular sequences, a grade which then represents the main reason for replaying the Kanda and should not be underestimated when in which to unlock the true ending of the game, represented by the nineteenth Kanda, you must have completed at least 5 with an S rank (or you will need to have replayed 50 in total). Playstation 3 trophies Asura's Wrath features 45 trophies, 3 of which are gold and 7 are silver. The easier ones are obtained by completing all the Kandas, even at the highest difficulty level of the three available. Or again by shushing (with a punch) some main antagonists while speaking before the fight, getting a high average rating and so on. Some more hidden are related to exploration in moments of hilarity related to the game, when for example Asura and Augus are in the baths in the company of attractive girls. By completing the game the first time, and depending on your skill, you can unlock 40 to 60% of the available trophies. ASURAAAAAAAAAAA!!!! How are the results of this particular type of gameplay developed by Capcom and CyberConnect 2? Extremely spectacular, also FrBecause Asura's Wrath makes extensive use of epic moments to narrate the story of the main protagonist. His anger, the wickedness of his antagonists, the events themselves lead to combat against giant monsters, to destruction in line with those of the Super Saiyans, to revenge worthy of the best wrong received. Our readers are probably well aware of the fights against a divinity that grows bigger than the world itself, or against Augus, former master of Asura, who attacks him by unsheathing a sword that literally cuts the game scenario in two and causes an explosion on the other side of the planet where the fight takes place. Let's avoid giving other examples so as not to reveal too much about a game whose duration is limited to a few hours, but suffice it to say that at a certain point the main protagonist gets so angry that he releases rays that kill an entire fleet of ships at the service of bad guys on duty. Therefore, playing Asura's Wrath really seems to be in an interactive cartoon where one is always curious to know what will happen in the next episode and within which the quick time sequences are never boring and return a certain satisfaction and fun, thanks to the care taken by the developer in realizing them. In fact, the technical system completely fulfills its purpose and returns an excellent overall impact, either for the artistic style adopted, beautiful to look at and never predictable, or for the well-made soundtrack and for the dubbing, chosen between English and Japanese with Italian subtitles. If we go to see the graphic detail, however, there are several flaws: the textures are only average, the particle effects reduced to the bone and the flight sections much less beautiful to look at than the rest, with the aggravating circumstance of a dancer frame rate . Nothing to say instead for the generous polygonal mass which, together with the artistic level, manages to return the excellent impact mentioned above. Asura's Wrath is therefore a fun, enjoyable, peculiar title. Why then the ~only~ discreet vote you read at the bottom of the comment? Unfortunately, there are many reasons. The CyberConnect 2 game is completed in six hours and while it has several unlockable extras, including illustrations, fixed screens for cutscenes and new types of energy and fury bars (which prefer one or the other factor, or are not visible to increase the difficulty), these are largely obtained after the first ~round~ and do not represent a huge reason to replay the title, if not to unlock the trophies by platinum or 1000 points lovers. To make matters worse, the low level of challenge and the shallow depth of the combat system take care of it. Well yes, we have completed Asura's Wrath on a medium difficulty level without ever losing a life, a devastating element when combined with the duration of the game and if you think about the price at which it is sold. The fights themselves are extremely simplistic: there are no attack combinations and once you understand that the heavy one must be performed when the enemy is about to launch an unstoppable blow, in such a way as to stun him, it becomes almost an exercise in style to continue attacking until the filling the fury bar to then unleash in the classic quick time sequences mentioned several times. A real shame, because the game is completed with a certain satisfaction, and even starting it at the highest difficulty level, most of the aforementioned defects do not allow it to unleash its wings towards the gaming elite.", "date": "2012-02-21", "grade": "7.9"}
