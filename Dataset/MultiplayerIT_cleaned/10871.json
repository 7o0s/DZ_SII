{"name": "Lemmings Tribes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lemmings-tribes_a.html", "text": "Who really knows what ~lemmings~ are? These are small rodents that live in the Arctic tundra, extremely active (they don't hibernate), who dedicate themselves very hard to the mating season (their mating and reproduction speed is extraordinary) and to the search for food. One of the myths that has always accompanied them, completely unfounded, concerns their alleged aptitude for mass suicide, with hordes of lemmings throwing themselves down simultaneously from very high peaks. It is clearly the inspiration that allowed Psygnosis, back in 1991, to put together one of the most famous puzzle games in the history of video games, in which the player does not control any character directly but has a series of tools at his disposal to prevent the little creatures to make a bad end within each stage. Lemmings (which in the game have nothing to do with the animals of the same name), in fact, tend to follow a fixed and often dangerous trajectory, which sends them towards ravines, craters or traps of all kinds. To save them we will have to select them, one at a time, and assign them a different ability each time, trying to be able to reach the minimum objective to pass the level. This new production by Glu takes up the title of the second episode of the original series (ie Lemmings 2: The Tribes) to underline the presence of different tribes of lemmings to manage and save. In this case, we will be able to play with classic levels, set in space or in the Middle Ages. The type of setting will profoundly change our approach to matches, given that all the skills at our disposal will also change accordingly. To give a trivial example, in the classic levels we will be able to use lemmings as a ~stop~ to reverse the path of the others, make them explode like time bombs or equip them with parachutes so as not to die after jumping from a great height; in the space levels, however, we will be able to make him use weapons, jetpacks and other ~themed~ equipment. The control system provides for the presence of a pointer which on normal Java-compatible devices is controlled by pressing the d-pad, but which on phones equipped with a touchscreen responds to the stimuli of the stylus, making everything much more practical. By pressing the * and # keys we can scroll through the available skills (shown at the bottom of the screen), then press 5 once a lemming is selected to give it a power. Each setting is made up of a variable number of stages, and the total should be around fifty levels: a respectable number, also considering the excellent progression of difficulty. As per tradition for the series, the graphics of Lemmings Tribes are limited to being functional to the action, without looking for spectacularity or advanced technical solutions. The sprites of the little creatures have a fairly varied set of animations, given the numerous abilities that can be used, but the fluidity of the movements is definitely lacking. The stages are differentiated by the use of colors, just discreet, and by the arrangement of the graphic elements. The feeling of repetitiveness, however, is unfortunately just around the corner. Finally, the most annoying thing (in addition to the sound, which is mediocre as usual), is the feeling that everything is very heavy for your mobile phone to manage, even though in the end there is nothing particular to move on the screen.
