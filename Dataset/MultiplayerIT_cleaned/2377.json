{"name": "Ralph il lupo all'attacco", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ralph-il-lupo-allattacco.html", "text": "Tricks and bushes Ralph should be taken in the right spirit: don't underestimate the fact that it is a game with ~cartoony~ graphics which are highly suitable and extremely fun to watch (a bit like the hilarious Wacky Races, also by Infogrames) which will not fail to underline the situations bordering on the comical that our hero will have to undergo to reach his goal. Yes? Which? soon said: Being able to take a sheep stolen from Sam's flock with you to the end of the level... for each of the 16 levels that make up the game. But beware! The challenge will be immediately intriguing from the second level, since it's all designed so that your wheels have to blend a little and, often, something else will blend too. Oh yes, because there is no Nazi soldier or terrorist in white overalls that holds: the greatest threat ever is Sam! only one dog, but with champion hearing and vision, not to mention the speed with which he will knock you out as soon as he notices your presence! To sum up everything will be a huge cauldron of platforms and boulders to collapse, bushes in which to hide, lettuce and sheep's scent to attract the unsuspecting fluffy towards you, rockets to fly, etc etc all seasoned with humour, reflection, tactics and an ever-present pinch of cunning! (please twist your face into a condescending grin). Let's lick our mustaches! We are faced with a very valid game, which draws from a winning license the ideas necessary to entertain you for a long time, with sympathy and with a colorful world. The Italian language dubbing is also memorable, with a really amusing Duffy duck who will act as your guardian. A game that will relax your tired limbs at the end of the day, and will also make you think about one thing: being a cartoon isn't easy at all! An almost obligatory purchase for puzzle game lovers who don't take themselves too seriously. Straight ahead of you lie hours of wholesome entertainment! What cheese do you want? Pecorino cheese? Auuuu! What a nice interesting game we have on hand! Ralph, who will it be? He is none other than the Wile Coyote impersonator, whom we all know for his daring beep-beep chases, the famous blue roadrunner remember the famous Warner Bros. cartoons, the ones that have done so much and entertain people of 3 generations ? Here... immerse yourself in a barrel of ~cartoon paint~ and smear your face on the monitor: perhaps as if by magic you will find yourself alongside Ralph, whose passion unlike his coyote relative (they can be distinguished by the color of the nose, Ralph ce he has red) he cultivates an immeasurable passion for sheep, his favorite food. To have even just one, he is willing to devise any method to snatch it under the nose of what will become, for all those who want to help the wolf, the worst enemy of all time!
