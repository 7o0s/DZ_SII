The recipe looks like one that pops the pot. Unlocked items appear in these bottles at the start of the game How can many different game philosophies coexist together? In reality, the Motion Twins, a cooperative of developers with dozens of productions already active, most of which are for mobile systems or playable from the browser, the dish seems to have succeeded perfectly, so as to leave incredulous. It begins without too many preambles with a pile of cells that gives life to a dead body. We don't know why we find ourselves prisoners in a damp dungeon, we don't know why there's a guy who gives us advice on how to start playing and, more generally, we really don't know who we are. The only certainties are the rusty sword we hold and the possibility of immediately taking a secondary weapon, choosing between a wooden bow and a shield. Before delving into the dungeon let's briefly experience the simple control system, with a key for the primary weapon, one for the secondary weapon and one for the jump. In addition to these there is a key dedicated to interactions, which is used to open doors, buy items, activate some secrets and so on. When you find skill-related weapons, bombs, or temporary boosts, two more keys add to the group (we strongly recommend playing with a controller, although in reality, you can also play comfortably with the keyboard). The graphics are completely in pixel art and in some cases amaze for the detail, especially in the face of fluid and well-crafted animations. On more than one occasion it has reminded us of Slain's, not so much for the single objects, but for the overall style with a strongly gothic flavour. But the time has come to take action and understand what trouble we've gotten ourselves into and how to get out of it. We tried the roguevania Dead Cells: a big surprise for all fans of the genre First steps Taking the first steps through the dark corridors of the dungeon that hosts us, we immediately come across some enemies: an archer, a purple mutant who shoots bombs and a strange green creature that jumps on us, taking away a large amount of energy. After having eradicated them, we collect the loot they drop: gems, which can be spent in shops scattered around the game world, and a soul sphere. The graphics are done really well To understand what to do with the latter, and her cronies who are slaying monsters, we have to get to the end of the level, where in an intermission zone a strange character allows us to spend the collected spheres to unlock new equipment or upgrade what we already have. It is a fundamental mechanic of Dead Cells, which characterizes the entire gameplay. In fact, at the beginning you have few and scarce means, with weak weapons and limited extras that make it very tiring to advance through the levels. However, the release of new weapons and tools allows you to ~widen~, that is, to overcome otherwise very complicated situations with more agility. Yes, because first level aside, Dead Cells is damned difficult, even bastard in some situations. However let's rewind the tape and go back to our hero, who we left in the initial dungeon. As we explore the level a bit we discover that in addition to jumping we can also climb ledges. The roguelike nature of the map is evident from some small details, such as strangely placed dead ends or teleporters, which serve to retrace one's steps in case one has taken the wrong path or wants to explore the entire level before continuing, put too close together to have been designed by human hand. We also discover some metroidvania elements, i.e. piles of cells on the ground and electric sarcophagi, which will become usable when we have unlocked skills in the following levels. Outdoors Without too much effort we pass the first level, spend the accumulated soul spheres, heal ourselves and face the second level, which is a kind of desolate village to cross to get to the castle, our real goal (or visit the sewers, which are not lacking never). Here things get complicated: the enemies are more present and become tougher. Sometimes there are many enemies on the screen at the same time Others are added to those already encountered, such as a strange creature that if not killed chases us throughout the map by teleporting, infernal bats that are difficult to hit on the fly and a motionless and defenseless training puppet, who equips his friends with magical armor that makes them untouchable. This is where we die the first time, sadly returning to the starting dungeon, where we have to start the adventure again. Fortunately after each death all is not lost, since the unlocked equipment remains and, by spending soul spheres on some upgrades, we will later discover that we can also keep part of the money collected and be able to start with better weapons than the basic ones. The second lap in the dungeon is a great way to check how the procedural map generation works and discover new details, such as small runes placed on the floor or in the walls which, if destroyed or activated, give access to special items or open portals leading to secret levels where you have to pass difficult tests to get valuable bonuses. Without going too far, after a few attempts and a few more deaths, we overcome the first boss, not very difficult, unlocking the power to generate vines from the cells on the floor we were talking about earlier. We explore other environments such as the sewers, where the first really tough boss is found and where mephitic mushrooms and other putrid creatures make our life agonizing; or like the ramparts, where deep and deadly chasms bring out the platform nature of the game with greater force. At the end of the test we were amazed at how perfectly everything worked, despite the fact that the genre salad is evident. Conclusions Dead Cells is still in Early Access and there are months left to have the final version, which will include more levels, more items and new features, such as game statistics. However, unlike other titles that are launched incomplete on Steam, it is already in excellent shape, i.e. without major bugs and perfectly playable. The only problem is that the current eight levels end, leaving the missing ones with a very strong desire to play. From our side we can tell you that if you are a fan of the so-called roguevania, Dead Cells is likely to be the best exponent of the genre in recent years. We had some doubts about the random generation of the maps, but after playing for a few hours we can say that, although the random nature is evident, the environments are still fascinating, well characterized and above all varied, thanks to the use of some fixed elements around the which ones are built. In short, do yourself a favor and play it, because it's really worth it.", "date": "2017-05-28", "grade": null}
