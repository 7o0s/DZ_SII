{"name": "The Wreck", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-wreck-recensione-visual-novel.html", "text": "The glass of the car breaks again and again, and the contents of Junon's bag scatter in all directions throughout the car. The deer is always there waiting for her, to cause the fatal impact which, every time, leaves her breathless, her heartbeat slowing down, her vital functions reduced to a flicker. The Wreck doesn't go into subtlety and touches on very hard themes: the physical trauma of a road accident, and all that follows on a psychological level; divorce; sickness and the death of loved ones. The Pixel Hunt does it, as usual, with a grace all its own. We had greatly appreciated Bury Me, My Love, a text adventure that tells the story of the Syrian migrant Nour, in search of a better life with the remote help of her husband Majd. The team returns to tell the story of a woman, indeed, of four generations of women, grappling with family ties that sometimes threaten to strangle them, exposing the fragile material of which human life is made. But The Wreck also teaches that out of disaster can come rebirth, and that it's possible to invent a way to fill the holes in the fabric of life. We tell you about this extraordinary visual adventure in our review of The Wreck. Daughter of art Engine of the adventure is the hospitalization, in very serious conditions, of Marie, mother of the protagonist of The Wreck A sudden call from the emergency room of a French hospital brings Junon to the bedside of her mother, Marie Demange, a famous artist affected by the rupture of a brain aneurysm. For reasons unknown to Junon, her mother has designated her as solely responsible for the difficult medical decisions to be taken in the event that she is unconscious: this leads to friction with her half-sister, whom she affectionately nicknames ~Dididou~. , and together they wonder about the reason for this choice by Marie. As the story progresses, a strange event continues to occur: every time Junon drives her car to leave the hospital, a deer cuts her off and a dramatic car accident ensues. This leads to the emergence of past memories of Junon who, on the threshold of death, returns to the most important moments of her life to reflect on herself and on the people dear to her, in search of a terrible secret that holds up the entire narrative of The Wreck. The result is an exuberant narrative flow, with a considerable amount of texts on the screen and a truly valuable overall writing quality. Junon's stream of consciousness is overwhelming, and you can often follow various avenues into her thoughts by clicking on highlighted words within sentences; this will lead to various developments in the young woman's reasoning. The Wreck is a visual adventure, certainly, but the weight of the texts is considerable, even if it does not reach the considerable length of the Bury Me, My Love script; that the written word is central is understood immediately, given that the initial screen and the pause menu are made up of a writing software, and we are greeted by the words ~Welcome, writer!~. Coralie Maurin and Florent Maurin want to tell a story that focuses on the importance of the author as an inventor of a reality: the protagonist herself, Junon, is a screenwriter, and her story traces the salient moments of her life, those that 'have led - in good times and in bad - to discover that she can be the author of herself. Retracing her memories, Junon is guided by some keywords that the player can select on the screen In the five hours of duration of The Wreck (which has wide replayability margins, in order to explore other sides of the story and make other choices in Junon's paths of thought and dialogue, beyond the decisive choice present in the finale) the rhythm only loses its bite on rare occasions, and overall we appreciated The Pixel Hunt's invitation to linger in memory, retracing the most important memories of Junon's life several times: it is a very specific design choice, aimed at making us pay the utmost attention to even the smallest details, with mechanisms that reminded us of what Sam Barlow recently did with his Immortality. Explore memories Junon's stream of consciousness is enhanced by impeccable writing, capable of delving into the soul and stories of the protagonists of The Wreck Beyond the selection of thought and dialogue choices, the main gameplay mechanic of The Wreck is that of exploring the memories of Junon. By selecting the objects that fly inside her car in her recurring car accident - which will have a significant impact on the woman's affairs - we will be able to enter the pastof Junon and, guided by some keywords that appear on the screen, invite her to delve into particular aspects of her life, with regard, specifically, to her complex family relationships. Exactly as seen in Immortality, this process involves the need to retrace more and the scenes several times, slowing down the time where necessary to identify the writings to be selected. We were amazed by several directorial choices adopted by The Pixel Hunt, decidedly impactful, especially in the last memories that are retraced by Junon; even seemingly boring situations (on one occasion we find ourselves following a lobster on its sad journey from the ocean to the fish market) provide the assist for profound reflections on the meaning of life and the importance of our ties with others, but also on the danger that too large affections can represent for our mental well-being and for our balance. On some occasions, the images are used frame by frame, one after the other, in an emotional sequence that manages to tell the development of the feelings and stories of the various characters involved. Junon is a wounded but indomitable woman, and we were amazed by The Pixel Hunt's ability to outline a powerful character, outlining it through seemingly trivial events: the breaking of a simple cup, inserted in a particular context, takes on an explosive power , amplified - and not debased - by the need to relive the scenes more than once. The devil is in the details Junon is marked by a difficult past and an uncertain future: it is impossible not to love such a deeply human protagonist The Wreck is strong in a graphic style which, thanks to a skilful use of colors and cel shading, manages to be remembered, even without particular flashes on a technical level. The team didn't bank on realism; hence the choice to only partially animate the characters' lips, making them open when they speak and close only when they finish the sentence. The result is a sometimes alienating effect and, in our opinion, the best moments of The Wreck are those in which Junon is lost in thought, her lips closed or slightly parted, giving way to the excellent texts. Furthermore, there is not always adequate attention to the facial expressions of the characters, which we sometimes found inappropriate with respect to the context, but this is not something that detracted from our overall experience. In this regard, it is a pity that The Wreck does not has been provided with an Italian translation: those who do not know English will certainly not be able to enjoy the latest work of The Pixel Hunt, since, as previously specified, Junon and his supporting actors are an irrepressible source of dialogues and thoughts. The English-language dubbing is magnificent, which maintains faith in the French origin of the product (which, among other things, was co-financed by the Rgion le-de-France and the Center National du Cinma et de l'Image Anime) giving in Junon a distinctly recognizable accent.", "date": "2023-03-14", "grade": "8.5"}
