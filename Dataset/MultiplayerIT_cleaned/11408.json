{"name": "Coast Cruiser", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/coast-cruiser.html", "text": "The introduction of polygonal graphics in mobile gaming is a recent thing, linked more to high-end terminals, yet respectable results have already been achieved. In this case, there are development teams such as the German Fishlabs who are comfortable with this type of graphics and have created very powerful engines, capable not only of moving a good number of polygons, but also of doing so while maintaining fluidity so far quite rare to find in a mobile video game. Returning from the ~aquatic~ experience gained with Powerboat Challenge, they once again compete with the theme of racing but choose a more classic environment, that of the road and four wheels, with the particularity of an evocative scenario. Coast Cruiser, let's face it right away, is a very particular racing game. It gives us the possibility to adjust various parameters, such as the rotation of the screen (it is possible to play with the mobile phone placed sideways, therefore with the screen in 4:3), the presence or absence of audio and vibration, after which it throws us into 'only mode available, or a sequence of time attacks in which you have to center a certain time on each of the six tracks present to unlock them gradually. There are no real races, there are no opponents and one feels a bit lonely... but the thing should also be understood differently, if you like. Because the game's graphics are so advanced that they represent an experience in themselves, and you often lose a moment looking around, perhaps coming long in a curve and playing the lap. To place further emphasis on the aesthetics of the product, we have a high quality replay that starts at the end of each lap and shows us the car from different angles as it proceeds towards the finish line. It is clear that, once you get used to the graphics, you inevitably end up feeling the pinch of a very poor structure compared to the average of mobile racing games: six tracks are not a few, but having to travel them alone, it might as well have inserted some alternative mode , to add some thickness. Also, unfortunately the control system does not allow us to set the automatic acceleration. The result is that the playability goes down the drain with most terminals: unless you have a very soft and sensitive joystick, it is difficult to accelerate, steer and counter-steer without giving yourself a headache. A real pity, considering that driving a Coast Cruiser appears anything but contemptible, with good handling of the car and numerous episodes in which it is necessary to control the trajectory when cornering through numerous interventions. As mentioned, the game boasts a very high-level technical realization. Apart from the sound, which is really poor and of modest quality, we have well-made and detailed polygonal models, which move convincingly within scenarios rich in elements. Being a single location for all the tracks, it is clear that we cannot find a particular characterization for each one, unfortunately, but the results are still excellent. All the surrounding structures are well done, buildings included, and excellent light effects can be appreciated, especially inside the galleries. Finally, the fluidity is excellent: it remains at 15-20 fps, but for mobile gaming it is an excellent goal. PRO Extraordinary landscapes Smooth graphics Good guidance system...
