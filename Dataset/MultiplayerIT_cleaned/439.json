A glimpse of Casablanca. The latter and other controversial aspects of the gameplay are making Dreamfall a rather controversial title: there are those who consider it absolutely worthy of its illustrious predecessor if not even superior, defining it as a unique and unmissable interactive experience, and those who instead accuse it of having sacrificed too much for the ambition of presenting itself as an ~action-adventure~. On the other hand, no fan of graphic adventures will have remained extraneous to the controversies that preceded the release of this highly anticipated game (and, in case anyone is, we refer it to the introductory paragraph of our preview). Basically, we can confirm that Dreamfall preserves the distinctive features of the adventure, while leaving behind the classic ~point and click~ interface and giving up overly complex puzzles to make itself attractive to a wider audience. For the same reason and also with a nod to the console market, it opts for fully three-dimensional graphics and a more action-oriented approach to gameplay, introducing combat sequences and stealthy infiltration that will easily go sideways to the supporters of traditional adventures. Although the restyling operation of the genre cannot be said to be perfectly successful and the game is not free from defects, Dreamfall is a very well packaged product and it will be up to each of us to compare its value with that of the original The Longest Journey and establish up to to what extent it is an adventure, because the very definition of the latter depends largely on personal tastes. One thing is certain: adventure or not, this title will NEVER disappoint those who love to live and play beautiful stories told with art! Three worlds and three crossed destinies The first chapter of what will probably be The Longest Journey trilogy introduced us to one of the most successful heroines in the history of graphic adventures, April Ryan: this young art student from Stark (a world identifiable with our Earth projected several years in the future) unwillingly discovers the existence of a magical universe called Arcadia and populated by fantastic creatures. He also discovers that he has the ability to travel between these two parallel worlds, as well as the thankless task of restoring their delicate ~balance~. It is not essential to know the adventures of April to fully enjoy the story of Dreamfall, although the latter takes place ten years later and is inextricably linked to it, but fans of the original will have the opportunity to know what happened to their heroes and rediscover familiar places in a dazzling new three-dimensional guise! This time there are three parallel worlds and as many characters that we find ourselves interpreting. Our journey still starts from Stark, who is recovering from the Collapse, a devastating cataclysm that upset his life ten years earlier and following which the government imposed strict military control on everything and everyone. Lately there have been strange interferences that seem to compromise the regular functioning of the network, while unease and discontent are spreading. Zoe Castillo is a bioengineering student from Casablanca in the midst of an existential crisis: she has just abandoned her studies, her boyfriend and her faith in her future. After receiving a series of rather alarming help messages, he sets out in search of his ex, who mysteriously disappeared during a journalistic investigation, and a certain April Ryan. Before she knows it, she will find herself enmeshed in a terrible international conspiracy. Three worlds and three crossed destinies Not even Acradia has been in excellent condition since we left it: the city of Marcuria was invaded by the barbarian hordes of the Tyreni and subsequently liberated by the armies of the mysterious Azadi Empire, a matriarchal culture governed by a strong religious belief, which often borders in exaggerated fanaticism and in the conviction of having to convert all the ~infidels~ by any means. The warrior Kian Alvane is precisely an Azadi apostle: his mission is to spread the faith with the blade of the sword and root out any form of dissidence. In fact, not everyone has welcomed the Azadi as saviors and a group of rebels who have taken refuge in the lands of the North continues to fight for independence. Among these there is also our April Ryan: after giving everything to save the Balance, she finds herself emptied and disappointed, as well as imprisoned in a world that is not hers. To give her life meaning, she has decided to fight against the Azadi invasion but she is losing faith in herself and in others. As if all this is not enoughsse, in a third metaphysical world called Winter, lurks a dark evil that threatens to jeopardize the unsuspecting inhabitants of Stark and Arcadia again. During the adventure, the destinies of Zoe, Kian and April will cross repeatedly, they will offer us different perspectives on the same story and will change before our eyes: the journey that each of them will make will be physical but also spiritual, we will see them discuss their beliefs and values. we will meet old acquaintances of April but also welcome new entries The shots in the dialogues have a cinematic flavor. This level of psychological investigation is quite unusual for a game and is also shared by the secondary characters: each one boasts an individual personality and has a story to tell. We will meet old acquaintances of April but also welcome new entries. The complex fantasy and sci-fi universe developed by the genius of Ragnar Tornquist has a solid and plausible dimension, which seems to transcend the game and exist independently of it: the worlds of Stark, Arcadia and Winter pulsate with their own life and the player immerses himself in them with feeling that he is actually a passing traveler but can't help but grow fond of his protagonists. The interaction between the latter is one of the most irresistible ingredients of the adventure: the dialogues are masterfully written and directed, interactive, mature and ironic at the right point. They are much more fluid and less heavy than in TLJ, while fulfilling the difficult task of carrying the plot forward and letting the character and thoughts of the characters leak out in an absolutely natural way. During conversations, we will often be asked to make choices not only on the topics to be discussed but also on the attitude with which to address them (humble, aggressive, understanding, provocative...). There are no universally right or wrong dialogue options: the possible branches and the length of the conversations will depend on us but they will almost always have the same outcome, with the only difference that we will be able to get there as we like and possibly get a greater number of questions. information. This certainly contributes to giving the adventure a certain replayability, as well as further increasing the level of involvement. Muscles and brain As already mentioned, the gameplay of Dreamfall is a mix of elements typical of adventure and action titles, which alternately mark the pace of the game, always keeping it pressing and varied: the dialogues and the exploration of the rich 3D environments they are the masters but there is no shortage of logical puzzles and inventory-based puzzles, albeit elementary and a little obvious. In addition to the head, occasionally we will find ourselves using our hands or having to move stealthily to evade the surveillance of sentinel robots or enemy soldiers. As in the classic ~Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis~, some actions or conversations can lead to fights that involve a limited number of attacks and a parry, through a control system that is not exactly immediate and stimulating. In the stealth phases, we will have to avoid being identified by enemies, staying out of their field of vision, taking cover behind obstacles and making sure not to draw attention to us with sudden noises. In the event of an untimely death, we will be able to reload the most recent location or the last autosave. Although the action sequences are rather simplistic and could certainly have been developed better, they fit into the context with dignity and do not weigh down the game mechanics, contributing in some cases to making it even more exciting and dynamic. In any case, they don't make Dreamfall an ~action-adventure~ in the true sense of the term: beyond the somewhat slow controls, in fact, they shouldn't harm even the most thoughtful adventurers less accustomed to action, nor jeopardize a overall varied and pleasant gaming experience. Muscles and brain This result, however, was achieved by sacrificing the implementation of the puzzles, an essential component of any graphic adventure: although they are quite varied, they appear much less numerous and complex than those of TLJ and their rigid linearity will not pose any challenge for the adventurers most navigated. The level of interaction with the environment is quite good and not all the elements that can be examined on the screen are necessary for solving the game, but they add depth to the script. We will hardly have more than two or three items in inventory at a time and generally their use will be obvious from the beginning. Most of the puzzles require traveling back and forth in order to retrieve items or agturn more or less difficult obstacles, sometimes simple errands for other characters. On more than one occasion, we will have to improvise as hackers and break into security systems illegally to disable them, combining a series of symbols with each other, a routine that soon becomes repetitive. The puzzles as a whole are quite fun and well integrated, particularly suitable for newcomers to the genre, but those who prefer puzzle adventures, putting the plot in the background, would do better to look elsewhere. Depending on the player's experience, Dreamfall can last from ten to fifteen hours. Point and click? No thank you! The port of Marcuria in 3D. The transition to the third dimension hasn't penalized the universe of The Longest Journey in the slightest, on the contrary it has made its suggestive settings even more dynamic and enveloping: while not boasting an astronomical level of detail, they are a feast for the eyes and offer tasty details and vivid, full colors. They range from ultra-modern offices to crumbling old towers, from sterile laboratories to enchanted forests, from sophisticated means of transport to busy market squares and the originality of their design is surpassed only by the spectacular artistic direction. Also noteworthy are the textures that cover the objects and reproduce the reflective surfaces, the realistic atmospheric effects and the remarkable play of light and shadow. Intermission movies, all made with the in-game graphics engine, abound and are characterized by skilful cinematic shots. The character models are well built, although those of some supporting characters appear a little stingy with textures. In the close-ups, the incredibly expressive facial animations, the natural skin tones and the discreet lip-synch are striking, which however suffers from occasional delays compared to the speech. Only the rendering of the hair leaves a little to be desired. The options menu supports resolutions ranging from 640x480 to 1280x1024 and viewing in widescreen mode, complete with anti-aliasing. Despite a few minor bugs, Dreamfall's superb graphics are perhaps the best the modern adventure market has to offer. Dreamfall's superb graphics are perhaps the best the modern adventure market has to offer Point and click? No thank you! Zoe will change; of dress more times during the game. The need to interact with three-dimensional environments has imposed on Dreamfall a direct control system like that of third-person action titles, which offers a radically different gaming experience compared to its ~point and click~ ancestor. This is both good and bad for adventurers who have become accustomed to the same interface for years: it will give them the possibility to roam freely in the wonderful virtual world created by Funcom, enjoying it from different angles, but at the same time it will deprive them of the convenience of controlling every game action with just a click of the mouse. Here they will have to deal with the combined use of the latter for camera rotation and the keyboard for movement control. In the options menu it is still possible to reconfigure the control system, experimenting with other solutions: the most practical alternative is certainly represented by the gamepad, also in light of the fact that Dreamfall was developed as a product for consoles as well as PC, but who can't stand the idea of using the keyboard will in any case have a method available which provides for the exclusive use of the mouse, although not very immediate. The only technical problem to report is the sometimes difficult management of the shots in the action sequences that take place in narrow spaces. The search for the interactive areas takes place through the original ~focus field~, a beam of blue light that can be activated with the right mouse button, which rotates 360 around our character, highlighting the areas of interest on the screen and finally eradicating the threat of pixel hunting. Once a hot spot is activated, interaction with the latter is carried out via a context-sensitive menu, as simple as it is versatile: it recalls the one adopted by Broken Sword 3 and depicts the options available from time to time in the form of icons. At first glance, the use of the inventory may appear a bit cumbersome, but over time it proves to be sufficiently functional. As is customary in many adventures, we will also have a diary that will record our progress and all conversations. Dreamfall has a direct control system like that of third-person action titles Point and click? No thank you! We will use the most popular ones. different means of transportation in this adventure.
