The first concerns localization. As for the third chapter, there is no translation of the texts, or rather of the subtitles, into Italian. The voices are (fortunately) the original Japanese ones, translated with copious girths into English. As a result, those unfamiliar with the Albion idiom will understand nothing of Sega's puzzle game. It is not a particularly complex English, but since the series revolves entirely around very long films and abundant dialogues, a certain level of competence is required in order not to stop only at the fighting game sections of the game. Secondly, all the ~sinful~ parts cut away due to an excess of prudence from the third chapter have been reintroduced. There is no shortage of hostess clubs, massages and so on, and even the mini game ~Turn fashion for your favorite hostess~ is also part of the storyline of one of the characters. 25 years ago Not just a character as the real novelty of this fourth chapter is the presence of four heroes to play in the dozens of hours of gameplay that await us. Kazuma Kiryu is obviously part of the team, together with him are Shun Akiyama, a former homeless, former banker, now head of a small finance company that lends money without particular guarantees to the unfortunate people of Kamurocho, and for this reason disliked by the local families of the Yakuza , as for the police; Taiga Saejima, a member of the Sasai family and twenty-five years in prison for killing eighteen members of the Ueno Seiwa clan and Masayoshi Tanimura, a young policeman more comfortable with bribes than with arrests and for this reason called the parasite of Kamurocho. Instead of telling us the same story from different points of view, Sega preferred to stage a complex story in which each character in the game is a piece that fits perfectly, creating a huge fresco that began in 1985 and ends in 2010. As usual, the themes are the usual ones, strong and adult as per the tradition of the series, not at all diluted, as in the third episode, by comic lightening and lighter game phases. Obviously all this is present, perhaps in the form of side missions and strange characters who are around, but there is no large portion of the ~light~ game like that of the Okinawa orphanage. In Yakuza 4 we go straight to the point, the situation always seems to be about to fall, there is an air of impending tragedy, there is pathos and tension to spare, there is not a minimum of tiredness even in the initial stages, without prejudice to a ~Jurassic~ gameplay always the same. Precisely to mitigate this feeling of always playing the same game over the years, new characters have been inserted, with a dedicated storyline but above all with different fighting styles. Punches, kicks or grapples? Akiyama seems to be more versed in special moves with kicks, while Taiga, the gigantic Taiga, given his appearance as a huge wrestler is slower but definitely powerful. Masayoshi Tanimura, on the other hand, is the ~weakest~ of the group, but has an effective counter-move thanks to which he can strike undisturbed by his opponents. Although the control method is always the same, in fact entrusted to only two keys, the different specialization of the various protagonists is tangible, in short, it is not a far-fetched ploy to vary the action on a purely theoretical level. All this requires us to attack the opponents in a reasoned way using the peculiarities of the various alter egos in the right way, not simply limiting ourselves to a button mashing that rewards the player, but flattens a really well implemented combat system. Everything as expected: the dozens of random fights ~stop the action~, spacing our wanderings around the neighborhood, here it is possible to use both kicks and punches and weapons, firearms and others, as well as the objects that we find in road, which can be collected depending on their weight. From this point of view Taiga Saejima can take up a scooter and use it as a club, Masayoshi Tanimura cannot. So the experience points to spend to learn new attack, defense and special techniques are back, and the ~revelations~ are also back, i.e. photographing (or noting) particular situations around the city, from which to learn further special moves without affecting the treasure trove of experience points. And always on the side of expanding the gaming experience, the developers have included real mini-games that change from character to character. Akiyama for example, from brFormer entrepreneur who diversified his interests, must manage a hostess club, understand the needs of the paying public and therefore dress up the girls accordingly, from make-up to the parure to wear. Taiga Saejima on the other hand, when not grappling with the police patrols that force him to move stealthily between the roofs of the buildings, the sewers and the underground shopping malls, can go to the dojo in the upper part of Kamurocho to train a young man and make him fight in a tournament, while Masayoshi Tanimura, once he meets one of the Guardian Angels of the neighborhood, will have to try to resolve the various fights, acting as peacemaker between the litigants. Finally, Kazuma will have to defeat several gangs that will try to attack him from time to time. Either you love it or you hate it All this grafted into the usual gameplay of the game, which in no uncertain terms you either love or hate. Along with the aforementioned random fights, unnerving in all their usefulness for level advancement, we find the very long connection sequences, and the many things to do in the city between one mission and another. City that has gained some new areas, such as the roofs, which mainly used by Taiga offer interesting views of Kamurocho and a couple of ~running~ challenges. In the same way, the underground areas, parking lots, shopping malls or sewers, are well linked with the development and also give the game less conventional ~accessory~ parts, such as that of the mad scientist and his arcade cabinet or the excavations of bomb shelters dating back to World War II. This is to say that in Yakuza 4 he hasn't skimped on trying to rejuvenate, or rather to make more airy a gameplay that has certainly not evolved much over the years, but which given the goodness of the plot and the consequent fast pace that springs, it almost seems to advise us to play it all in one breath, to arrive without wasting too much time at the final redde rationem. This is because the characters (even the secondary ones) are masterfully outlined, and despite the hours of chat in the long films that accompany the turning points of the story told, one remains enraptured and interested in the stories that are revealed slowly and above all converge and they cross without too forced twists. The protagonists and their characterizations are the real strengths of the game. They are not granite and one-dimensional, with the progression we see them change, we get to know parts of them that we would never have thought of at the beginning of each chapter, they give us unforgettable moments, thanks to well-written lines of dialogue, but above all to the acting in the cut scenes. Taiga is the best of the group, a huge, massive ex-yakuza, with a perpetually sulky baby face, almost devoted more to his boss than to his real family, capable of sacrificing himself for him, a real anti-hero despite carrying a burden huge. Or Tanimura, who behind the facade of the corrupt cop is a benefactor, not to mention Shun Akiyama and his pro bono finance. Violence, corruption, the ruthless methods of the yakuza have now devastated Kamurocho, but there is always someone who fights for good, either for a distorted code of honor, or to try to do something for everyone. This is the most beautiful thing in the game, behind the blood and the severed fingers, behind the shady real estate deals, behind the sequins of the hostess clubs there is someone struggling to try to improve a collapsing situation. Usual From a technical point of view we are still in the old parts of Yakuza 3, i.e. we have woody animations and not particularly brilliant textures, but all this disappears in front of the usual lively and vibrant reproduction of today's Japan, plus all the new parts on roofs and underground, much better done than the average of the game. In short, Yakuza 4 will certainly not be remembered for the technical values per se, but undoubtedly for the general impact of the images on the screen. Where the Sega engine excels is in the creation of the bosses, of a very different kind than the simple ~picciotti~ you meet in the streets, better animated, with different attack patterns and above all with the enormous tattoos covering the body, and in the stunning facial animations within the long cutscenes, which give the game an extra step of authenticity to the whole.", "date": "2011-03-15", "grade": "8.5"}
