{"name": "Tales of Eternia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tales-of-eternia.html", "text": "Tales of... ...Eternia. This is the title of the game which, in an attempt to restore some order between the various chapters of the infinite saga, takes up the original name of the Japanese version and carries it with it also in the subsequent western localizations, thus abandoning that ~Tales of Destiny II~ that had created so much confusion in America at the time of the psx release. The story of Tales of Eternia (ToE from this moment) takes its first steps on Celestia: two people speak in a strange language, an old man and a young woman, the first explains to the second that she is the only hope for the whole world and that only she can undertake that journey, the girl nods and gets on a strange flying machine, turns on the reactors and leaves. The wheel of destiny has begun to move and thus begins Meredy's journey to reach Inferia, the unattainable mirror world in Celestia, which will lead her to make an emergency landing in the forests surrounding Rasheans and to meet Reid and Farah, her future inseparable adventure companions. The real adventure begins here, almost quietly, in a remote border village, and in total contrast to the continuous crescendo of rhythm and game that the story will have over the hours. The purpose of the first hours of the game, essential for the success of part of the adventure, will be the search and capture of the elementals, the Craymels. Over the hours, the light-heartedness that follows the story in the first chapters tends to disappear to give way to a thin layer of tension: betrayals and about-faces bring the story to a more adult level where Reid and his companions will understand that what they have undertaken it's just a journey to save the world but a growth path for their characters, too anchored in fears and fears related to childhood. Horizontal battles While on the one hand ToE embodies the typical clichs of the genre (a world to save, a company of inseparable friends, worlds connected to each other) what makes it different from other productions is undoubtedly the Linear Motion Battle System, a ~primitive~ version but decidedly satisfying of that combat system now present on all Tales of this generation, or rather of the combat structure that allows players to move not only horizontally within the combat itself but also to do so in the third dimension by modifying in real time battle strategies. The Linear system, being precisely a first version of this system, allows you to move only on a hypothetical horizontal line without having the possibility of changing plane. The main character is therefore used in real-time by the player who decides each time which move to use, the other members of the party are instead used by the computer AI which maneuvers them according to a default strategy or one pre-established by the player himself. The convenience (and ease) of dealing with only one character is however accompanied by the possibility of freezing the game for a moment, displaying a menu bar where you can indicate a certain series of actions for each character, ranging from the simple execution of a particular skill , to the use of a certain item on a certain character. The resulting system is a kind of hybrid battle system that at the same time allows the player to manage a battle both semi-automatically and fully automatically. Another element that goes against the trend of the canonical rpg is the management of escape in battles: in fact, you will not find an item in the menu that allows the player to immediately exit the battle, and there are not even any useful items for this reason; escaping will be all a matter of timing and player stats: within the battle you will need to find the right moment, with the enemies far away, to run from one side or the other of the screen to start a sort of countdown for the escape, the greater the player's reactivity, the greater the chances of getting out of the most intricate situations. In a very similar way to other games of the genre, at the end of the battle you will get a certain amount of experience, money and - if lucky - items. Horizontal battles From a graphic point of view, unfortunately ToE does not surprise: although enriched with a series of renewed graphic effects linked above all to magic and skills, it visually remains a psx game. The battle stages seem to have simply been adapted to the psp format, with the characters (and enemies) being blurry and fighting in absolutely poor environments. The world map view as you walk from city to city is reminiscent of anthat it is the 3D of the psx. The engine, on the other hand, is the flagship of the port: in no case, whether it's battles or cities, will you notice loading times, the game runs smoothly and fast as never seen on the psp. The sound sector comes verbatim in all its quality from the psx chapter, the game is also almost entirely dubbed in English. It is one of the best chapters of the Tales of saga, and this would already be enough to reassure lovers of the genre. It is currently one of the few RPGs for psp and certainly the one that deserves the purchase the most: the portable experience benefits the genre and the absolute lack of loading times is a panacea especially given other psp games. Unfortunately, the graphics of the psx remain, with just a few more light and transparency effects: surely in this respect we can give more given the effective power of the sony laptop. Not recommended perhaps only to those who were able to play it in its first appearance. Pros: The best rpg on psp. One of the best episodes of the saga. The portable RPG experience is worth trying. No loading. Cons: Graphically not excellent. Identical to the psx version. A little too easy. rpg. An acronym that for many fans of the genre means a lot, sometimes even the choice or not of a console. RPGs have lived in a world of their own, parallel to the rest of the market and crowded with people who either hate them or love them. A fairly common trend in recent years has seen the flourishing of this genre especially on Sony consoles, heavily supported by big houses like Square-Enix and Namco. This particular trend had not yet had the opportunity to occur on the latest arrival from Sony, the PSP which, despite being able to boast an already considerable list of games less than a year after its release, had not yet drawn on the world of RPGs. Namco has taken care of this particular fasting which, with the revival of Tales of Destiny II (chapter of the famous Tales Of series released for the American market for psx) offers gamers one of the best RPGs of the last ten years, one of the best of the saga, embellished with new graphic effects, no loading and a splendid display in 16:9.", "date": "2006-03-03", "grade": null}
