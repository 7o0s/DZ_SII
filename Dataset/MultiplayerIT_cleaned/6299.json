In exactly two years, the Hungarian software house Neocore has modeled and refined a title which, entering the fringes of the media spotlight, has been able to carve out a good group of enthusiasts, also convincing the critics thanks to some tricks that have made a game structure stainless (and always similar to itself) more varied and interesting. Of course, no big news could be expected from this third episode, also considering the short time available to finish the work and the many open fronts on which the Budapest company has been working in recent months. It is therefore not surprising that The Incredible Adventures Of Van Helsing III fails to hide the lack of resources with which it was completed and, despite some good ideas unfortunately only sketched, is not able to offer those welcome variations on the theme that the direct predecessor had introduced, thus proving to be attractive above all to those who have not yet trodden the lands of Borgovia (the fictitious region where the protagonist's events take place), exposing themselves against the criticism of the hard core who will not be able to easily postpone the lightness of certain errors. Little news? Little party! Van Helsing III is therefore a (high) representative of the hack & slash genre, inaugurated by Diablo about twenty years ago and enriched over time by a myriad of exponents. With such a varied competition, standing out is not easy and the Neocore title proves it both by confirming a convincing steampunk setting that reminded us for some choices of Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magick Obscura, the mistreated turn-of-the-millennial RPG, and with the usual irony in plot where there is no shortage of sharp jokes capable of snatching more than one smile. Humor  la The Big Bang Theory succeeds in the difficult task of reviving a narrative canvas that opens in a rather obvious way (we are dealing with the madness of a former prisoner who is the victim of magical experiments), but acquires bite during the work, resulting in being a pleasant epilogue to the events that began in 2013. Probably the most significant novelty is given by the introduction of six new classes that create a breaking point such as to prevent the possibility of importing previous saves, as in contrast could be done in Van Helsing II. We then find the ~classic~ (for the saga) bounty hunter; the interesting phlogistonist; the vulnerable elementalist; the builder and his war machines; the resistant protector; the Umbralist who makes speed her deadliest weapon. As per the script, each character corresponds to a different way of approaching battles: in this respect, the game system begins to wobble because you will soon realize that the balance between the various heroes, as already reported in the preview phase, does not is optimal, with the result that some classes are excessively vulnerable while others, on the other hand, are too heavily armored. Van Helsing III suffers for several aspects of the gameplay and is not up to the previous chapters Nothing is thrown away The first levels (the same ones analyzed two weeks ago) are not overcrowded with enemies (which, it should be remembered, are limited: once a room has been cleaned it will not repopulate as it normally happens in action-RPGs) and leave a minimum of freedom to test the powers of the virtual alter ego. To help, as we hoped, there are some ~tips~ even if unfortunately not very exemplifying; however, it won't take long for experts to regain confidence with the control system which, however, presents an important adjustment: the vials to restore mana and health have disappeared and have been replaced with a single bowl that regenerates itself. Continuing, the number of villains increases exponentially, but the level of challenge does not take off. One of the most vulnerable points of Neocore's production is in fact the skill tree, perhaps excessively simplified and certainly lacking in the variety necessary to allow a satisfactory range of tactical options. In other words, whatever the hero selected, you will often end up with the strengthening of the two primary skills, completely neglecting the remaining ones. This defect, not exactly negligible, is further aggravated by the bizarre decision to halve the level cap compared to the previous episode (now it is stopped at 30). If you add a medium-low level of challenge to the whole (which is why we recommend starting with a livello of high difficulty) which allows you to reach the limit well before the end of the single player campaign, a far from brilliant scenario conforms. To straighten the aim, a flagship of the Van Helsing series comes in handy, present from the beginning and much appreciated by the public. We are of course talking about Lady Katarina, a spirit figure capable of transforming into a lethal ally during the combat phases (therefore almost always). This character, in addition to creating a strong empathy with the player thanks to the frequent exchanges of jokes with the protagonist, is equipped with an extremely refined artificial intelligence: it will be sufficient to give orders to see them carried out with unusual effectiveness and precision. It also adds a considerable tactical variable because its help, especially with certain physically weak classes, becomes practically indispensable in order to continue. For the rest, the game structure respects the dictates of the most illustrious predecessors, with real swarms of enemies at every turn and very little interaction with the landscape and non-player characters. Much of the time is spent with the inventory screen open, intent on comparing the dozens of items dropped by monsters with those equipped, in the constant search for the highest maximum damage. In the base camp the activities to be carried out seem to be numerous: from time to time one can dabble in the creation of magical artifacts, in the training of the Chimera, the powerful beast that can hunt for rare objects or even manage a military campaign in perfect tower defense style (from this idea, already introduced previously, Deathtrap was born). On closer inspection, this is nothing particularly new, and indeed the sense of dj vu is often betrayed even by the HUB, as if the strength were lacking to propose something more varied. Optimization, this unknown The settings are varied, evocative and well designed, united as mentioned by the same graphic styles that refer to a particular derivation of the fantasy genre. Despite the good work of the designers, in some scenarios that are excessively rich in details (for example in the forest), there is the risk of not understanding well which is the road to take to reach the points indicated on the map or of displaying the ~hotpoints~ more hidden. The variety of monsters is also good, some of which are very successful. Unfortunately, the addition of polygons that could have given the population of Borgovia an edge has not arrived: the positive aspect is that even dated hardware configurations should have no problems maintaining good fluidity at the highest levels of detail. The reflections made for the game structure also apply to the graphics sector: despite a good general level that allows Van Helsing to remain above the average, one feels the absence of real updates, accentuated by the recycling of textures and settings already seen in the previous chapters. The same thing cannot be said for the valid musical accompaniment, probably the best of the saga; the English dubbing is convincing, while the Italian translation seems to have been left unfinished, considering the number of objects left in the original language. Getting to the thanks screen takes about ten hours, a figure perfectly in line with that of the previous episodes. Of course there are several reasons not to uninstall immediately: for example the cooperative mode or one of the two competitive ones. The so-called Touchdown is added to the classic deathmatch in which a maximum of eight players can participate, a sort of capture the flag with the bearer of the banner who cannot attack but only commit suicide. To be honest, however, not even these variants manage to warm the souls, resulting in the whole quite anonymous. The tested version has been the subject of a couple of hotfixes within two days of launch, a symptom that compliance with the roadmap has prevented programmers from fixing the usual and annoying technical flaws, for some of which the cure is still awaited . In particular, it frequently happens that the game crashes between loading one level and another or that annoying slowdowns occur when accessing the disk; some users have also complained of bugs with the use of a joypad, a device which is of course not recommended. Reports of other glitches of various kinds are also the order of the day during online games, with characters who freeze on the screen for no reason and sporadic exits to the desktop. On the forums of the software house and those of Steam, the distribuzione which Neocore relied on, the first and justified discontents were unleashed. To be honest, however, the guys from Budapest have shown that they know how to listen to their community and the hope that the title is not abandoned on a dead end is not senseless.", "date": "2015-05-29", "grade": "6.3"}
