A life spent with a rifle in hand can make you a practical, resolute and decisive person, but it is very unlikely that it will also make you a good father and an affable person, especially if the world you have helped to defend turns into a cage that hides the dictatorship under the cloak of security and if your child has chosen a path that you do not approve of. But this is not your story Marcus Fenix, the time has come to take a new generation of players by the hand and lead them behind cover, with the Lancer loaded, and help them face a new threat, as that boy you can't manage with never find the right words. So here we are talking about Gears of War 4, the new chapter in the saga which, after taking a last look at the past, tries in some way to overcome the cumbersome presence of its protagonist and the load of emotions he carries with him to open the your way to a new generation of heroes, while trying not to anger the old guard. Therefore innovation, but above all tradition, because the public has repeatedly declared that it expects certain things from this saga and those things, rest assured, are there waiting for you; if instead you are looking for something radically different, well don't knock on Casa Fenix. Tamarro, violent, traditionalist and full of multiplayer challenges, here is Gears of War 4! Only the dead have seen the end of the war As often happens after great revolutions, what comes next risks being just another form for the same evil. The war against the locusts has turned Sera into a scarred world that must start almost from scratch and try to shake off the fear of dying from horrible monsters. And it is precisely fear that has allowed the COG to transform itself from a force of liberation into an instrument of oppression. The population lives inside fortified cities, gilded prisons mass-built by highly sophisticated robots and defended by martial law and high walls that shelter them from fearsome wind eruptions, windstorms, lightning and heat capable of stripping your skin or electrocute you with bolts that sweep the ground. However, not everyone is happy with this lifestyle, a group called ~The Outsiders~ have decided to live outside the walls in urban agglomerations that are halfway between a hippie community and the Old West. One of the White Walkers' main activities is to raid towns and COG shipyards to steal something useful. J.D. Fenix, after having defected from the COGs, has become a Stranger, and it will be by participating in one of these raids that a chain of events will start that will turn his world upside down and will test him and all the people he cares about. Having tasted it in Vancouver, we had high hopes for Gears of War 4's single player campaign, it set the scene for intense father/son moments, interspersed with high-speed action scenes and classic cover-based shootouts. After the campaign at a normal level, for a total duration of about 7 hours, we can say that we were partly right, partly not. The result is a plot that always and only plays it safe, for fear of finding fans at home. The weight of inheritance Wanting to divide the story into three acts, the entire initial part is undoubtedly interesting: there is a sort of summary of the previous installments, J.D. is introduced, there are new enemies, outdoor settings, new weapons and we begin to put stage the thorny relationship with the father. However, when the new threat of the swarm is revealed, which is not so new, the game takes a track already seen and frankly not very exciting. Closed and underground settings, clashes that are indistinguishable from each other, situations that are not very varied and no real twist. Finally there is the third act, in which we expected some dramatic implications which, although present, are totally annihilated by the amusing and amused ~tamarraggine~ of an epilogue that winks at Pacific Rim and aims to relax the player after hours and hours of fighting in the dark. From a story point of view, Gears of War 4's biggest flaw is perhaps a failure to pass the baton between the old and new guard, although Marcus is only part of a larger story his presence is cumbersome when there is and you wish you were him, when he isn't there you wish there was and the moment never comes when the metaphor of ~now you are the hero, my son~ is triggered. For the rest, the plot does its dirty duty of always giving us a reason to go forward and provide a canvas to be soiled with the blood of the enemies. From a trivially technical point of view, Gearsof War 4 does not change the typical structure of the series by an iota, proposing long corridors in which the clash rarely opens up to wider scenarios, alternating a range of enemies ranging from robots that are quite easy to manage to increasingly bigger and pissed off monsters. There are just two or three moments in which the game allows for variations, just to let us catch our breath, but perhaps they are too few. Occasionally the progression of the game is interrupted by Horde-style moments that will test your tactical intelligence and ability to manage resources, are situations in which the risk of not making it will perhaps be even higher than in the boss fights and which will introduce you to the harshness of online clashes. The most frustrating aspect of firefights is probably related to some more advanced enemies, whose ability to take bullets sometimes borders on the ridiculous, especially when you empty a whole clip in the face of the guy on duty and he reacts as if we were armed with a hair dryer. Therefore, often the clashes are not difficult or particularly tactical, but simply long, moreover this resistance is not justified by particular armor. Fortunately, this is a problem that only affects some opponents. For the rest, however, the shootings are undoubtedly satisfactory, chaotic and bloody as they should be, even if we would have liked a greater use of the new weapons: a medium-range sniper rifle that must load the shot, a light machine gun and above all a shotgun that it fires both when we pull the trigger and when we release it, which makes the Gnasher look like a water pistol. We must also compliment the artificial intelligence which, barring a few minor flaws, guarantees opponents who don't do stupid things, even with medium difficulty, and teammates who actively participate, killing enemies, going into close combat and pulling us up in the time of need. We don't want to tell you more, it wouldn't be right to reveal the most interesting parts of the story. What we can say is that from a graphic point of view the game offers 30 frames per second in single player with some moments of pure visual spectacle, while in multiplayer it goes up to 60. Honestly in the whole game we have not seen a texture out of place, the details of the characters and monsters are spectacular, the light effects, especially after the explosions, are jaw-dropping, and we still haven't told you about the PC version which we'll talk about later! Although the environments are perhaps a bit static, here and there there are objects that we can destroy and we would have liked to have even more interaction. What impressed us least was the Italian adaptation. Some words left us a little perplexed (burst of wind? Really?), Marcus' voice doesn't sound like an old man pissed off at the world and a couple of enemies speak plain English. All against the Horde Gears of War 4's Horde is undoubtedly a rich, tough and rewarding mode, which will give your team moments of pure exaltation and depths of despair. In total there are fifty waves that you will have to face in order to be able to say that you have made it. The first will be very simple, but already from the twentieth you have either carefully prepared your defenses or you will be torn apart without any mercy, also because every now and then the monsters will get bonuses to health or damage. In fact, the fulcrum of everything is the Fabricator, a chest in which the Power Points obtained by killing enemies must be reported, which can be used to create turrets, bring companions back to life, build barricades or lockers in which to store the most important weapons and so on. Street. Managing your Fabricator's resources is key, as one turret up or down can mean the difference between a tight victory and a total loss. In the same way it is important to know the map and exploit its strengths to create bottlenecks and forced passages that limit attacks from behind, while avoiding concentrating too many structures in a single point, because then a single area attack is enough to make them out. Another essential aspect are the classes. All classes can use any weapon, but some of them have them right away (ie without spending precious currency) and can count on bonuses that influence their style of play. We covered this extensively in our preview, but let's do a refresher. There are five classes: Soldier, Scout, Heavy, Sniper and Engineer. Each being brings with it a well-defined style of play, the soldier will have bonuses with standard weapons, the scout has more energy and doubles his Power points if he collects it before the end of the wave, the Heavy mustdo a lot of harm in decisive moments and the Engineer has discounts in building defenses and can repair them, which makes him perhaps the most important class in a team where everyone is essential anyway. There are no limits to building your own team, however The Coalition strongly advises against teams made up of the same class. Obviously each class has a progression, in fact the skills are based on the infamous cards that can be bought with real money or with the game currency. A level 1 character will be able to use only one card, but as you level up the cards will become five, radically changing the approach to the fight. However you want to play it, the Horde is simply pure fun and full of different approaches in which there is no game alike and which could, alone, keep you busy throughout the videogame season. Xbox One goals Most Gears of War 4 achievements can be obtained by playing and finishing the campaign. We're obviously talking about those related to collectibles, COG Tags to collect, perfect refills to a few other things you can do along your way. Then there are the ones for co-op and of course anything related to multiplayer. In general all are quite feasible for an experienced player. Then there's the ~Seriously 4.0~ achievement which will require you to finish the game on the hardest mode, get ranked in all mulitplayer and max out your character in Horde mode. Maybe that's for people really named Marcus Fenix. Great desire for eSports As far as competitive multiplayer is concerned, Coalition is aware of offering a very different product from what is most popular today, but is convinced that it can still create a niche of enthusiasts and be able to have its say in the world of eSports. The most positive aspect is undoubtedly the developers' choice to include a free rotation of the maps which also includes those included in the DLC, so all players will be able to test them without necessarily having to spend any money. Anyone who wants to play that specific map in private games at all costs can do so by purchasing them. The other aspect concerns the cards, which however should not guarantee particular advantages in terms of gameplay, but only boosts for the experience or money that we will be able to collect, as well as skins for weapons and characters and, if we don't like a card, we will be able to destroy it and use the points obtained to create others. This should prevent the emergence of advantaged players. As far as the Horde cards are concerned, the matter is different, given that in any case we are not going to unbalance the competition between players. Speaking of competition, there are various ways of approaching online, there are those who do it for fun, those who are looking for a challenge and those who aim for the maximum. For this reason the versus modes will be enclosed in three distinct groups. The so-called ~Social Quick Matches~ without rank in which all modes will be present and at the end of the match you can vote for the next one, the Core Mode in which almost all the various types of matches are present and the Competitive Mode in which only Escalations are present and Execution. To access Core and Competitive we will have to play 5 matches which will establish our skill and place us in one of the five available ranks. Each mode has its own rank. As for the new modes, we've already talked about them in the preview: Dodgeball features a five-on-five team in which each opponent's kill allows us to bring one of our companions back to life. Arms Race is an update of a similar mode present in Gears of War: Judgment and will ask the usual team to kill enemies with a certain type of weapon, gradually scaling from the most powerful to the lightest, finally we have Escalation, which represents the Coaltion's attempt to create a real eSport. In this mode we will have to control three zones to accumulate points, however, whoever controls all three automatically wins, so it is not certain that the team in the lead has the victory in the pocket. This all takes place over a minimum of six to a maximum of 13 rounds. Another interesting detail is that at each round the losing team places a particularly powerful weapon, branching out the possible tactics even more, and increases the respawn time, so the more you go on the more each death can be decisive. Obviously we can't know if the servers will hold the load of players at launch, but the presence of dedicated servers bodes well for a smooth debut, not to mention the experience accumulated with Gears of War: Ultimate Edition. It also remains to understand when they will affect the rhythm", "date": "2016-10-06", "grade": "9.0"}
