{"name": "Pupperazzi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pupperazzi-recensione.html", "text": "Let's face it, even the most cynical of us pauses smiling in front of a photo of a funny little dog: it's practically a natural reaction of the human being, probably the basis of that special relationship that made the animal in question the best friend for quintessential. So why not try to build a game entirely based on this principle, where all we have to do is take pictures of dogs and post the images on fictitious social networks? If this may seem too strange to be true, you have not come to terms with Sundae Month, developer of this bizarre game that we analyze in the Pupperazzi review. Already the title is decidedly explicit, both as regards the concept underlying the gaming experience and the spirit that pervades the whole, because a sort of crasis of this type between ~paparazzi~ and ~puppy~ can only get the green light if the development team is going to come up with something really crazy. And so it is, in fact: Pupperazzi takes almost nothing for granted, apart from the basic dynamic of having to pursue certain objectives to advance in the game. Everything else is so bizarre as to make it an almost shocking title, at first, also because of its disarming simplicity, in conceptual terms. All we have to do is explore the settings and photograph dogs, possibly following some precise indications that are provided to us by some characters - obviously dogs too - to advance from level to level. Curiously, the world in which the game is set also foresees the existence of humans, but these have an extremely marginal role and, as explained by the dog-fireman in one of the first levels, they serve the animals as they ~take care of all the more boring things~ and for this they represent good friends. Moreover, this can make us reflect on how the man-dog relationship actually works and how the latter see us in reality, but this is another matter. Gameplay: explore, point and shoot A somewhat upset-looking dog, as often happens in Pupperazzi It starts from a sunny beach with a lighthouse and from there, by completing objectives, we unlock various other settings to explore in search of new canine photo shoots. The principle is somewhat that of Pokmon Snap, only in this case the game appears more structured, with the possibility of freely exploring the settings and also solving some puzzles, involving elements of the scenario and, of course, dogs. For each setting we are provided with objectives to complete, which concern particular subjects to be photographed (essentially dogs, in some specific situation or position) and the use of lenses or films to apply effects to the images. Or we can simply take photos inspired by some particular moment, posting them on the dogNET social network, in an attempt to collect a good amount of likes, comments and new followers. In some cases, reaching particular requested locations or certain situations in which the subjects find themselves requires interacting in some way with the scenarios and here some adventure-style elements are triggered with puzzles that may require the search for alternative routes, the collection of objects and attracting dogs to certain points of interest, thus prompting them to perform certain actions that can be useful for completing objectives. Pupperazzi's dogs can be caught in very special situations Each level offers a limited amount of photos that can be taken, so it is necessary not to waste too much attempts, also lenses and films must be purchased by spending the golden bones that can be found by exploring the settings and completing the missions. There is a good artificial intelligence that leads the canines to behave in a surprising way, especially in the interactions between them, giving a good impression of lively and populated environments, while not pushing on the fact of wanting to make the animals anthropomorphic and thus finding a sort middle ground between realistic behaviors and imaginative interpretations of canine life. A world of dogs Pupperazzi allows you to visit the settings in different situations of light and weather As we progress in the game we can apply various customizations to the animals, ~dressing~ them in various ways and adding accessories to personalize them, looking for the most captivating shots, but we must be careful not to flood dogNET with too many photos because we could be blocked for spam (rightly so). The various settings of Pupperazzi can be visited in various light conditions at different times of the day, in modor to exploit variations in the scenarios, but beyond these variables and beyond the application of lenses and films it is not possible to further modify the photos with effects and retouches in post-production, which could limit the creativity of the most passionate dog photographers. Still with regard to the photos, there is a lack of depth in the evaluation of the shots by the system: in essence, what is required of us is almost exclusively to frame a certain subject but how this is then captured in the photo has no great importance. In practice, it is rather useless to try to take as beautiful or particular photos as possible since there is no real evaluation of the technique or aesthetics, moreover the feedback on dogNET is often unpredictable, making the whole evaluation process somewhat random photos. However, the desire to look for the strangest and nicest shot possible remains, also because the comments on the pseudo-social network are truly enjoyable and furthermore the presence of a real ~Puppypedia~ pushes us to try to find and photograph all the breeds of dogs present in the game.", "date": "2022-01-21", "grade": "6.8"}
