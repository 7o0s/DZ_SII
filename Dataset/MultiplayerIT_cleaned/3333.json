{"name": "Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey per PS4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ancestors-the-humankind-odyssey-ps4-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey for PS4 undoubtedly represents an important milestone for the development team founded by Patrice Desilets, Panache Digital Games, which despite a reduced staff and an inevitably limited budget has demonstrated how it is possible to create an original and suggestive bringing it not only to PC but also to consoles. The experience, net of some marginal tricks, is the same one we appreciated last August: a survival of a disarming purity, at times excessive in its systematic repetitiveness, which tries to tell us about man's great adventure... or at least its incipit, set in Africa ten million years ago. A cradle of humanity that had very little tender and childlike, on the contrary placing itself as a wild and ruthless place, in which groups of primates took their first steps and, through trial and error, managed to carry on the genetic traits necessary for face the path of evolution head-on. Literally. Gameplay and structure If you have read the review of Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey for PC, you will already know exactly what to expect from the new work of Desilets, which has very little in common with the Assassin's Creed series if not a few small suggestions. The focus in this case is neither the action nor the story, at least understood as a narrative; but pure and simple survival, resisting day after day and year after year by cyclically satisfying the primary needs of our primate (eating, drinking, sleeping), paying close attention to predators and interacting in various ways with the world around us, seeking already after the first hours of triggering a certain type of socialization that can lead to the enlargement of the tribe, to procreation and therefore to a line of succession that can capitalize on the experience acquired up to that moment, albeit with the due (and often frustrating) exceptions. Citing a famous television broadcast, we can say without fear of contradiction that it is the pleasure of discovery that moves the formula of Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey, making it immediately interesting. Our character finds himself in a huge forest full of unknowns and threats that we will have the task of identifying, analyzing, experimenting in order to take steps forward. There are fruits that can be eaten, plants to be used for the construction of beds, herbs that cure certain ailments and new areas to go to, increasing the size of the explorable area after having challenged our primordial fears, the terror for unknown that also accompanies modern man and that can only be defused by trying to rationalize the context, where possible, or quickly escape its ominous embrace. The control system allows you to climb trees and rocks immediately, but jumping from one hold to another requires practice to avoid disastrous falls. In general, the commands are also quite cumbersome on consoles, with too many steps to perform a single action to repeat again and again. In the world of Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey one cannot orient oneself with the traditional map, but one must resort to intelligence, smell and hearing to study the environment around us and place any signals to have a reference. However, as mentioned, each operation requires several steps: the activation of one of the senses, the selection of a target, its analysis and then possibly its memorization. The identification of puppies to take care of by carrying them on our backs during our explorations, interpersonal relationships, however primordial (~can I comb through you?~), the way of dealing with snakes, wild boars and tigers: these are all elements that we will find ourselves facing during the campaign, discovering and metabolizing them slowly, perhaps trying to prevent a bleeding wound from causing the death of our primate. The game over is in fact rather punitive: after going from monkey to monkey until the tribe is extinct, we will have to start all over again. The repetitiveness factor is common to many survival, there is no doubt, but it would have been nice to find in the new Desilets title a hook that could make this aspect less heavy, at the cost of speeding up a progression that by focusing on these mechanisms that are always the same manages to aspire to a duration equal to a few tens of hours. Playstation 4 trophies The Trophies of Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey are just 14, all linked to the most significant steps of the progression: from the completion of the initial tasks to the first upgrades, to get to the transition between the various eras. The PlayStation version4 The use of Unreal Engine 4 has undoubtedly made things easier for Panache Digital Games, and in fact the console version of Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey appears quite similar to the one seen on PC, obviously net of a frame rate equal to 30 frames per second, which, however, can be unlocked from the options on PS4 Pro by deactivating vertical sync. The scenarios appear fairly well-finished, although some assets have low-definition textures and, in general, the behavioral routines of the NPC are very basic and limited, which unfortunately is also reflected in the enjoyment of the experience as a whole. However, if the authors' goal was to create a certain atmosphere, thanks to a ~tribal~ soundtrack and enveloping audio effects, we can say that it has been achieved. Too bad for the multiple visual disturbances designed to simulate possible poisonings, intoxications and so on: while recognizing their function, we found them very annoying.", "date": "2019-12-06", "grade": "7.8"}
