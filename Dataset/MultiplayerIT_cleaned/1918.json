{"name": "Splinter Cell", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/splinter-cell-2.html", "text": "The Ghost Cell I'm there, but you don't see me. Stealth mode relies heavily on taking advantage of shadows. To the right you will have an indicator that shows the ~degree~ of invisibility to the eyes of the guards (or cameras) and based on how much light there is in a given point of the scene, it is up to the player to use the darkness to move, hide and to ambush. After a few minutes of playing, you begin to get into the spirit of the character and completely identify yourself with Sam Fisher himself. It will soon be discovered that the shortest way is always the most illuminated and therefore riskiest, the next step will be to start moving crouched down, or walking silently, because in Splinter Cell the faster you move, the more noise it makes. Then you will understand that it is useless to waste a pistol shot when you can neutralize your opponent by taking him by surprise and finally you will begin to trust your instincts less and less in favor of precise planning of your actions. Never act impulsively, it's always better to have in mind what you want to do and the goal to achieve. Frequently you will find yourself thinking that some scenes, rather than a video game, seem to be an integral part of an action film: such as moving on a suspended cable and at a certain point having to pay attention to the bright lights that illuminate the area, or wait silently and immobile hidden in the shadows for a soldier's patrol to then take him from behind and force him to scan the retina in order to open a door. This is the great strength of the Ubisoft title, knowing how to bring the player into the action, creating a unique feeling between the player and his virtual alter ego. The Ghost Cell Interactivity this great unknown... Knowing how to exploit the surrounding environment, and one's own skills, is the best method to survive, and in this field Splinter Cell has no comparison with other products. It is possible to crouch, hang, descend from walls with a cable, flatten against the wall, climb certain surfaces, roll, move bodies, use them as a shield, even stay suspended thanks to the sole force of the legs between two close walls, and much more even more. In addition to this, Sam Fisher can interact with many objects present on the scene, such as throwing bottles and cans to attract the attention of the guards, using computers to obtain more information, breaking light bulbs to create confusion or more often to create an ~escape route~.  in the shadows. And again you will have to break into doors using the appropriate kit, which could be difficult for you, especially in moments of greater tension. The arsenal supplied to us by the NSA is also very vast, ranging from the classic automatic pistol equipped with a silencer to the automatic rifle that can be loaded both with normal bullets and with special hard rubber bullets to stun enemies, or with tear gas grenades or electric bullets (used on wet areas are a show). Just as the ~gadgets~ are very varied and very useful, which seem to come straight out of spy films: adhesive cameras, jammers to disturb transmissions, directional microphones, optical cables to look beyond closed doors, various types of burglary kits , up to the more classic flares. The night vision and thermal goggles deserve a special note, which will soon become a fundamental tool for moving easily in the dark. As for artificial intelligence, apart from some dutiful concessions so as not to make the game too frustrating, it must be said that it is excellent level. The various guards will try to raise the alarm as quickly as possible, if they have the opportunity, or if they are suspicious of the anomalies you create such as shooting a light bulb, or running on a noisy surface, while the civilians try to escape or hide. In Splinter Cell there are two different levels of difficulty: in hard mode the game is really challenging, the guards have a greater field of vision and are more sensitive to noise, you have fewer resources available and the overall difficulty is decidedly high. The longevity of the game is ensured by long and complex missions, but interrupted by some checkpoints from which you can restart in case of premature death. Some passages have to be tackled over and over again to be passed effectively, but allowing the player to save at any moment would have definitely detracted from the flavor of the game. The Ghost Cell What it takes for a great game to make it a Killer Application? Simple, the details. And Splinter Cell is full of meticulously reconstructed details. Each level manages to surprise, the programmers have undoubtedly done an excellent job: the numerous animations that Sam Fisher has when he is left motionless for a while, the facial mimicry that changes during the (forced) interrogations of the guards, the screen savers on computer screens, the breath that increases if you run up a flight of stairs, and which becomes condensation when you enter a cold room, down to the little things like when Sam brings the night vision goggles down on his eyes with a decisive movement of the head because maybe he shields himself with a hostage. All touches of class. Another successful implementation is that of the way to aim with precision. You have a crosshair that slowly narrows as the time passes in which you are on the desired target, so if we shoot in a hurry it will be difficult to hit a precise point, such as a light bulb or the head of a guard. In this regard it must be said that the damage is localized, if you shoot on a bulletproof vest the damage will be minimal, a blow to the head instead is lethal (you will learn to save bullets in this way). The animations are very well done, apart from when going down steps where more could actually be done, probably thanks to the modified Unreal 2 engine. Movements are extremely realistic, for example when crouching, it looks like Sam Fisher balances the weight of the body on the legs to make as little noise as possible, or when trying to scale surfaces the movement of the joints to make traction is flawless. The Ghost Cell Sound Really difficult to find something wrong in the audio department of the game, whether it's about the soundtrack or speech, both for environmental effects. Everything is taken care of in an exemplary way. Those who own a Dolby Digital 5.1 system will have a significant advantage in missions. In this mode you are truly in the middle of the action, so much so that you reluctantly have to sacrifice the music in order to better appreciate the rendering of the sound effects. Hearing an enemy walking on a wooden balcony making the boards creak can sometimes be decisive in moving to a safe area. The almost total Italian localization of all written and spoken text is excellent. It should be remembered that the voice of the protagonist Sam Fisher is that of Luca Ward, voice actor of some very famous actors such as Keanu Reeves and Russell Crowe. Graphics I have deliberately left the section dedicated to graphics for last. Splinter Cell literally redefines the standard for light and shadow effects on the Xbox, but before going into detail it must be immediately said that the Ubisoft title, on the technical side, is not perfection, nor a game that makes the most of the console's potential Microsoft. There are some defects, nothing serious is clear, but in the game there are some slight slowdowns and in open spaces there are sometimes some small traces of clipping on the horizon. At the same time, the use of FSAA is still not perfect. Having said that, the final result is of the highest level: Splinter Cell is one of the best graphically successful titles on Xbox, and its secret is to combine excellent textures, a good dose of polygons, excellent graphic effects such as reflections, or particle management, to a superlative management of the shadows. All shadows are calculated in real time, each light source influences the shadows of the character and objects on the scene, the dynamic shadows are projected with different results on the various surfaces and on several occasions you will find yourself struck by the result. The peculiarity is that each type of light is managed in a different way, some are strong and clear like the neon lamps in the offices, others are pale and nuanced like that of the moon half covered by clouds. You will find the red-orange effects of the sunset, the light that filters through the shutters or between the disconnected planks of a wooden porch, even the light emitted by monitor screens and that of televisions is different. Destroyed a light bulb, for example, the shadows will change and consequently the lighting in the room will change as it would in reality. This is undoubtedly the strong point of the whole graphics engine, congratulations to the Ubisoft programmers, if they wanted to amaze with special effects, well, they succeeded perfectly! Before concluding, two concluding notes. The first is that the level of general difficulty even at a normal level is quite high, in some sections it could be frustrating for piccoleties like perhaps not hiding a corpse well on pain of triggering the alarm. the service is also active in Europe, to download new missions and new equipment. The Ghost Cell Final comment In summary, what can be said about Splinter Cell? Many await phrases such as ~Exactly one year after Halo, a game of its level has been released~, ~A new Killer Application for Xbox~ or ~Splinter Cell is everything Metal Gear Solid 2 was supposed to be but was not~. Well, my opinion is that Splinter Cell embodies all these claims perfectly. The benchmark for stealth games is now undoubtedly the Ubisoft game, even if it's not perfect. There are some flaws, but Splinter Cell manages, just to stay on topic, to camouflage them thanks to a great gameplay. A must buy on Xbox. Second comment and finally XBox has found its Metal Gear Solid. Until a few months ago I would have been judged insane if I had ventured to produce such a consideration. In reality, Splinter Cell has succeeded in the difficult task of outclassing Konami's awkward and cumbersome rival in all respects, with respect to which it manages to provide a more complete, more satisfying and, without a doubt, more realistic gaming experience. . Splinter Cell has skilfully avoided following in the footsteps of MGS2, proposing a certainly different game structure, certainly more demanding but at the same time capable of reviving emotions, situations almost as if one were actually engaged in a mission in which at stake not only the final outcome of the same but also our lives. Details that previously had been considered only such, acquire a new, decisive importance for survival. Each step must be calculated with great care given that the slightest noise could announce our presence to the ears of the vigilantes and, therefore, put us in serious danger; every object on the screen can become a useful tool or reveal an escape route just when the situation becomes desperate. However, light is the real protagonist of Splinter Cell and, if its absence allows us to experience all the postulates of the stealth genre, its presence instead becomes revealing of the way forward, but also, above all, mortal danger. The splendid technical realization also completes a picture that already seemed perfect. For once, it's not the textures that make the news but the incredible management of the light sources and, with equal importance, the exceptional baggage of animations available to the protagonist. The latter, Sam Fisher, acquires personality thanks both to his characterization and to the splendid dubbing work which has seen his charm and that aura of mystery that has always surrounded the heroes increase. It's really hard to find something that doesn't work properly in Splinter Cell. The only drawback, if you can call it that, is that it is as realistic as it is challenging, but I don't think we should complain too much about this. Ultimately, Splinter Cell is the game that all XBox owners have been waiting for, that title of depth expected since the launch of the console and of Halo, which in the past almost alone had to bring up the promising, but not always exploited in its potential, Microsoft console. The Ghost Cell Splinter Cell, ironically, was born in the shadows with an announcement that almost went unnoticed by most of the media, which focused on other titles such as the upcoming Raven Shield. Shortly before E3 2002 we learned of a different product from the usual, having as protagonist not the classic team made up of different elements but only Sam Fisher, ex CIA agent, ex Navy Seal, and now in force at the Third Echelon team, a group formed by the best men available to the NSA. Right at the Los Angeles fair, the Ubisoft game revealed itself to the public in all its glory, and the hope of finally having found a rival to the sacred monster Metal Gear Solid 2 has become stronger and stronger with the passing of these months. March 10, 2004, United States, the story starts here. Sam Fisher is chosen to investigate the disappearance of two operatives in T'bilisi (capital of Georgia).
