However, it must also be said that, from a videogame point of view, they were the first to enjoy real commercial success, and to offer masterpieces on cartridges that we still sometimes pull out of the drawer. The first Digimon World on PlayStation, on the other hand, maybe not everyone remembers it well enough. However, the franchise has tried to regain ground in recent years, and thanks to the support of Bandai Namco, three good titles have also arrived in Europe, one after the other, of which Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory represents the ring end of the chain (at least for now). We're back to spending several hours in the virtual world, fighting alongside Digimon, and we can finally tell you about their latest adventures. Playstation 4 trophies Bringing home the Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory platinum will not be too difficult an undertaking, but rather threatened by monotony. Apart from completing all the secondary missions and the main plot, in fact, we will have to dedicate ourselves to finding 700 collectibles (the Digimon medals) and obtaining particular digivolutions. You will also need to participate in a handful of online matches to earn certain titles in ranked matches. At a guess, about forty hours, however, should be enough. Return to EDEN Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory is the direct sequel to that Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth released in 2016, always exclusively on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. Last year's chapter, however, Digimon World: Next Order, is part of another trend set in the Digiworld, connected only with bland references to the new adventure. It matters little, however, that the homeland of the digital little monsters is missing, since any self-respecting fan of the series will immediately find themselves at home. The plot takes place in a more or less distant future, where technology has progressed to the point of making real a virtual world already imagined in Sword Art Online, called EDEN. Here human beings can meet to live a parallel existence, while their physical body remains anchored to their home PC. The problem is that EDEN, despite the heavenly name, is threatened more than necessary by humans. Groups of unscrupulous hackers compete for its digital territories, steal the identity of Internet users and resell them on the black market. And in recent times they have also begun to manage an illegal sale of Digimon, identical to our poaching, treating them as simple masses of data and creatures to be fought for personal pleasure. Naturally we will not remain idle: playing the role of Keisuke Amazawa, a young boy with a face perhaps too disturbing at times to be the protagonist, we will join a group of hackers devoted to good, intent on stopping the crime of EDEN. And after all, the question touches us live: someone stole our identity by stealing our personal account, a very serious act in the Shibuya of the future since in the eyes of society we have become worse than outcasts. Naturally, in the course of the adventure we will meet many supporting characters, each with a personality in style with the canonical plot of Japanese-style RPGs, as well as an impressive number of digimon with which to make friends and fight. The problem of Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory is basically only one: it is a copy paste of the first Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth. And we're not exaggerating, since the title recycles areas, digimon, and even the characters from the first chapter of the series, offering us a sort of parallel story that begins for better or worse where the first one found its conclusion. For those approaching the franchise for the first time, it will be a splendid Digimon-themed RPG, with some flaws but solid enough. Those who have already played the first Cyber Sleuth, on the other hand, will hardly be able to free themselves from a feeling of distressing dj vu, and someone could rightly point the finger at Bandai accusing it of blatant recycling. Winning Digimon does not change Proposing a new Digimon Story that has little more than a rewritten plot arc is actually a very wise move. It has made it possible to minimize the risks, once again offering a rather good third-person RPG, which retains all the strengths of the first chapter. The first is the skilful balance between the narrative / exploratory phases and those dedicated to combat. The main story of Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory is extremely linear and privatea of big twists, but it does its job and allows the player to gradually settle in a very particular world, in which the border between the real and the virtual is extremely blurred. To continue, it will be sufficient to read the objectives in progress from the game menu from time to time, and select from our PC workstation (located in Hudie, the hacker's den) the missions marked with the wording ~important~. Naturally we will also be free to dedicate ourselves to the secondary ones, quite numerous, which will reward us with healing objects, cash prizes and digimon to enrich our collection. Both Shibuya and EDEN are divided into various areas (most of them also recycled from the first chapter), which will be unlocked gradually by continuing in the story. Each of them has rather asphyxiated dimensions, and usually we will not have to do anything but continue from one point to another to obtain a certain object. Much more interesting is the virtual world of EDEN, divided into servers within which dangerous opponents and increasingly powerful, and sometimes dangerous, digimon lurk. After all, the latter represent the heart of the production, and you will be happy to know that their number is now 336, given that another 87 specimens have been added to those of the first chapter. The management of the Digimon is practically identical to that of any title in the Pokmon series: we can take up to a maximum of eleven specimens with us. However, digital monsters should not be captured in tall grass, but scanned after having found them at random in EDEN. This means that if you have always wanted to take care of an Agumon, you will have two possibilities: look for it around, until you reach a scan level of 100% (each encounter will guarantee you a percentage of 20-25% depending on the rarity of the species) , or evolve one of its pre-evolutions. Because of course Digimon digivolve and de-digivolve depending on their partner's wishes. By transforming they gain additional powers and become much more resistant, but each of them can aspire to as many as four or five different evolution paths, depending on its statistics and the level it has at a given moment. The push for collecting will lead us to patiently experiment with all the paths, dramatically increasing the twenty hours of play necessary to complete the plot. Hacker's Memory's combat system remains anchored to an effective turn-based battle, in which we will be able to deploy three digimon at a time against those of our opponents. Our first favorite was Tentomon, but the game will also allow you to choose a Betamon or a Gotsumon, we preferred to follow the heart and the first animated series. The task will be to give orders to the little monsters inviting them to attack, defend themselves, or perform a special move (which will consume stamina points). The order of execution of the turns is indicated by a vertical bar on the right of the screen, and is influenced by the stats of the digimon: usually the biggest and fastest ones always attack first. Each digimon also has particular archetypes (virus, vaccine, data, neutral) which will make its attacks more or less effective against that of other species. This system closely affects the creation of team combos, since the affinity between party members is essential for their success. If for some reason the combat system bores you, you can always ask the artificial intelligence to fight automatically, but of course you would miss the strategic side of the title.", "date": "2018-01-23", "grade": "7.2"}
