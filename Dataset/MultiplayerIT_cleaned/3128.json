{"name": "XCOM: Chimera Squad", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/xcom-chimera-squad-recensione.html", "text": "Before the review of XCOM: Chimera Squad we were really curious to know something more about the new game from Firaxis, surprisingly announced and sold at half price until launch. Now that we've tried it we're always curious, but to see what awaits us in XCOM 3, of which this seems to be almost the prelude. But let's go in order. XCOM: Chimera Squad takes place a few years after the events told in XCOM 2. The world has now been reconciled, the Advent have been stopped and the alien races, free from the yoke of their masters, can try to collaborate and coexist with humans. Unfortunately there is someone who does not like this coexistence at all and who would like to create a new order by restoring the old conflicts, one terrorist act after another. For this special teams have been created, with agents of all kinds, who are responsible for maintaining order through targeted actions and investigations of the highest level. One of these, the Chimera Squad, is made up of members fresh from training, but who immediately have to deal with the problems of the megalopolis City 31, whose factions are in turmoil. Micromanagement XCOM: Chimera Squad is divided into two macro-sections: one set in the operational base from which all operations are coordinated and the other in the field. We'll talk about the second later, now let's focus on the first. The base of the Chimera Squad seems to be a simplified version of that of XCOM: apart from that it is not mobile, it is from here that we can select the operatives to send on a mission, promote them, assign them to research to unlock new equipment, make them carry out missions to find resources, have them trained to upgrade them or to heal serious wounds and so on. The base is always the place where we will have access to information on individual team members who, unlike what happened in XCOM, are not anonymous soldiers, but real characters, all with their own character and eager to chat to let us know their point of view. In theory, in this way the player should develop a more empathic relationship with them, which is also true, if it weren't for some problems that we will discuss later. In general, team management in Chimera Squad is much easier than in XCOM 2. Each character has slots to which various items of equipment can be assigned (weapon attachments, armor upgrades and consumables) and, as you level up , he gains extra abilities to use on the battlefield, related to his species. For example, Agent Muton, called Axiom, becomes more and more of a kind of Bud Spencer who solves missions with his fists, while the human doctor acquires ever more sophisticated support skills. Unlike XCOM 1 and 2, units cannot die in Chimera Squad. They can be seriously injured and incapacitated, but once in the field there are two possibilities: either the mission succeeds, and then everyone is taken back to the base, immediately recovering their energy (as mentioned, only some wounds remain giving penalties, but they can be healed ), or the mission fails for everyone. The most important function of the base, however, is the map of the city: it is from here that we can select the missions; start the investigations, i.e. operations in which a single organized faction is faced, formed by chained events that expand over several game rounds; and manage public order by sending operational teams to the various neighborhoods. Normally on the city map there are several missions to select, of different colors according to their urgency and linked to the different districts of City 31. Every day, that is, every turn, only one can be tackled. Carrying out a mission means not only obtaining the relative rewards, but also decreasing the turmoil of the neighborhood to which it is linked. The left missions cause an increase in discontent which can lead to real riots. So, as was the case for the management of relations with nations in XCOM, here too one must choose from time to time which mission to carry out not only on the basis of one's own advantage, but by observing the general picture. A city in revolt is more difficult to manage and the factions that want to subvert the established order derive undoubted benefits. Field gameplay Once you take the field, the gameplay of XCOM: Chimera Squad shows on the one hand its full continuity with XCOM 2, on the other the desire to diversify with the mechanics of the raids and with a game structure very different from that of the main chapters. While the XCOM missions take place on individual more or less large maps, in which all enemies appeari and objectives, in Chimera Squad are divided into smaller sections, interspersed with break-ins. Basically, before accessing each section, you need to arrange the units at the access points to the area (doors, windows, walls to be blown up, ducts and more), each of which has advantages and disadvantages. For example, entering through a window can increase mobility for a turn, while creating an opening in a wall with explosives can allow us to take enemies by surprise, but can block one of the team members for a turn. After positioning the team, the actual raid can be started, with our men who, once they enter the new area, can shoot at an enemy, seek cover or use a specific skill for raids. After the opponents' response, the raid is over and our men go in search of the closest cover, starting the actual tactical phase, which functions very similar to that of XCOM 2, albeit with some differences: the members of our team and the enemies move in turns according to the more classic evaluation of the initiative (therefore not one faction at a time). Each turn a character has points to spend on two actions: moving, defending himself, shooting the weapon in hand or using a skill. The system is the well-established one of practically all exponents of the genre, such as the recent Phoenix Point, Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden or the upcoming Gears Tactics, including covers. Even the interface recalls without great mysteries that of Firaxis' XCOM, capable as it is of giving the player complete control of the battlefield from the very beginning, despite the apparent thinness. Speaking of the missions, it should be specified that the objectives may vary but, whether they are the recovery of stolen information, the securing of some hostages or the simple cleaning of the area from all enemies, they will always take place on very small maps, with firefights that will be direct and immediately present, as well as self-contained (apart from in some cases where the arrival of reinforcements is expected, which complicates the situation a bit). The enemies are the ones we've known in other XCOMs, including skills: mechs, Chryssalid, rebel Advent troops, androids, turrets, andromedons and more. Their behavior is also similar, despite some naivety in the artificial intelligence, which is especially noticeable by selecting the lowest difficulty levels. As in XCOM 2, the variety is excellent and increases even more if we consider the bosses: units with special powers that usually have a name and that really give you a hard time. In general, the gameplay of XCOM: Chimera Squad is much more agile than that of regular XCOM and seems designed for a more relaxed use. Some missions are longer, but generally almost all of them are finished in ten / fifteen minutes, so much so that we thought it would be a perfect title to play on a tablet. Despite this, it works really well, apart from some limitations (you almost always fight in very small areas and the part of approaching the enemies, immediate here, is a bit missing). Storytelling and graphics The narrative direction is the least convincing aspect of XCOM: Chimera Squad. Either because we really didn't mind the drier and more brutal style of the other XCOMs, or because a certain adolescent drift in the dialogues, reminiscent of Marvel films, is evident from the first minutes of the game, and you want for the character designs, which smell right from the too much of low-budget American serial cartoon, we weren't able to get too passionate about the relationships between the members of the Chimera team and their personal stories. At the umpteenth joke from Avengers we began to wish we could skip the narrative interludes (having to write the review we avoided doing it), moreover useless for understanding the thin story that forms the background to the action. In reality, the description of the scenario works, with the exposure of the different factions in conflict and that of the dynamics of City 31 that have their own meaning, but then the inevitable joke comes out of place to remind us that in Firaxis they are masters of strategy, but they still have a long way to go to become storytellers. That is: they are better at narrating indirectly, creating balanced and multifaceted game systems, than directly, where they get lost in styles and easy solutions. Naturally for a game like XCOM: Chimera Squad the narrative side, understood in its sense of a story, is secondary, but for this very reason we don't understand why the need was felt to give it all this importance in terms of resources. From a technical point of view, the game nnot only does its thing, but it evolves what was seen in XCOM, with more detailed models and scenarios, richer animations and more convincing special effects. Don't expect who knows what, because we're not talking about a revolutionary breakthrough, but just a step forward compared to what has already been done. Let's say that it seemed to us more like an appetizer, waiting for the main courses, which will be served with XCOM 3. On the other hand, who would ever buy an XCOM for graphics?", "date": "2020-04-23", "grade": "8.0"}
