Simply, when I started Full Spectrum Warriors: Ten Hammers, I had a very strong deja vu (data disk effect). The impression was confirmed when an enemy passed in front of my team (I'm talking about a few centimetres), went quietly around a corner, and after settling down, looked out and took them all out. Even the long firefights between men practically in the open have been confirmed (it is clear that the developers liked them) and even here shooting against a clearly visible enemy does not mean that he can be hit ... an invisible hand (like Smith's), in fact , will direct all shots against the cover behind which it is hiding in short, more of the same, one would immediately say. The warriors with the rubber buttons (only old people will understand this one) However, I imagine there are some readers who don't know what I'm talking about. FSW: TH is a strategic game in which, leading various troops (you can control two teams plus some special units such as tanks or a sniper), you have to manage to overcome some scenarios of urban warfare, completing the various assigned objectives and bringing home the fur of his men. Everything is controlled with a mixed system of mouse and keyboard (or with a Joypad) through which to give movement and fire orders. The aim of the developers was to reproduce the feeling of the battlefield by making the dynamics of the firefights despite the setting. Thus we will have to move our troops with circumspection, taking advantage of the cover fire in the most risky areas and studying the maps to be able to get around the enemies placed behind insurmountable barriers. instead of adding special effects, time could be wasted equipping our men and enemies with some more refined script The warriors with the rubber buttons (only old people will understand this one) If desired, it is possible to divide a single troop to obtain two teams composed of two men, in this way it will be possible to control more areas of the battlefield. The teams are formed in a heterogeneous way so as to cover all the specializations: light weapons, heavy weapons and sniper. To overcome some more intricate situations, you will also have grenades available (the most useful are smoke bombs) with which you can flush out enemies or cover their view, preventing them from shooting at us. In the most desperate cases it is possible to ask for an air intervention. It is practically a joker with which to overcome stalemate situations from which you cannot get out. Another possibility is that represented by the skills of our men. For example, the sniper will be able to use the viewfinder to deliver a precise shot against an enemy behind cover, in order to kill him quickly. Unfortunately, in doing so, it will be discovered and, therefore, easily hitable in turn. As already mentioned, in some cases we will be able to control special units. For example, it may happen that you have to pass a road blocked by a tank which, obviously, cannot be destructible with the supplied machine guns (nor with grenades). In these cases we too will be able to count on the support of a heavy vehicle, in order to fight on equal terms. Vehicles are driven in the same way as humans: you point to the visible area you want to reach and, if the road permits it, you press the confirmation button to set off. News and problems The innovations introduced in this sequel are all aimed at fixing or mitigating the problems I mentioned in the first paragraph. In fact, the situation here is slightly better than in the past, with smoother action and a few more options to choose from. Unfortunately, the additions have made the control system decidedly more cumbersome (especially when you want to divide or reunite the troops) and, often, especially at the beginning, you risk getting confused with the keys (imagine making a team move in the middle of a firefight instead of bringing her together behind a wall... obviously the massacre is assured). It will take some time before you consider yourself the master of the battlefield and are able to handle all situations in the right time. To be unchanged, compared to the past, is the aforementioned AI. In short, instead of adding special effects, time could be wasted equipping our men and enemies with some more refined script. As I have already told you, in some cases a disturbing immobility reigns even in the face of immanent dangers, in others you will see your ~shooters~ firing at very close enemies (even in the open) without being able to hit them, in others the opponentsrsari will pile up in front of us knowing full well our position. On the other hand, incredible are the shootings at very long distances in which the same fools who have shown that they are unable to hit an enemy at a distance of an inch, manage to hit very small targets without difficulty... it will be some time before you can consider yourself masters of the battlefield and are able to handle all situations in the right time Technique and multiplayer On a technical level, the situation is better, although it is only an update of the first episode. The three-dimensional models have been made more complex as well as the elements of the different environments. Obviously some last generation effects have been added in order to justify the ideal configuration and DirectX 9.0. The animations of the soldiers are convincing and realistic and the clashes are quite spectacular (especially when involving multiple teams). Even at the audio level, the work done is excellent, with realistic effects that underline every action. Of course, something more could have been done, at least for PC (GRAW is on another planet) where the latest hardware is evidently underexploited. We just have to talk about the multiplayer well, imagine the multiplayer mode of such a rigid game It simply doesn't make sense and makes little sense; it often ends up stalling and, to sum it all up, it's not fun. Probably Pandemic could avoid implementing it given the style of play ... Multi-platform box The Xbox and PC versions are virtually identical across the board. The PS2 version is identical to the others in terms of gameplay, but is penalized by a much less impactful visual aspect characterized by fewer details and bleach-washed textures. PC version: To run Full Spectrum Warriors: Ten Hammers all you need is a 1.5 Ghz processor, 256 MB of RAM and a DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics card. The recommended requirements, however, speak of a 2.8 GHz processor, 1 GB of RAM and at least a penultimate generation graphics card. Final comment FSW: Ten Hammers is no more or less on the same level as its predecessor, for better or for worse. The game structure is always the same, as are the limits that risk making the action monotonous for many. After two years and a large background of received criticisms, something more definitely needed to be done. Despite this, don't misunderstand, if you enjoyed the first episode, you will probably appreciate this one too despite everything. All in all, it's a decent title with some fascinating and very original elements. Pros The game plan is well established and exciting. Good some actions added. Well, being behind a wall getting haunted by bullets is always fun. Cons Looks like a first episode data disk. The AI is still the same... and that's not a compliment... Boring multiplayer mode. Time passes Brave Americans who say a lot of bad words, bad Muslims who want to establish a dictatorial regime by exploiting terrorism as a means of struggle, technologically advanced weapons to get out of any situation, desolate cities where every corner can hide a deadly danger and yawn yes, always the same stuff (let's make a nice model and send it to Bruno Vespa). Just a few weeks ago I happened to review Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter which has practically the same background (only a few details change) and, if memory serves me right, the shelves have been full of games with similar assumptions for years. The first Full Spectrum Warriors was released a couple of years ago for PC and Xbox, convincing both critics and the public. The interesting game plan actually hid a rather limited structure. To quote myself (I wrote the review of the game, again for Multiplayer.it, at the time of its release) I can't help but remember how in many situations it seemed more like a puzzle game than a strategic one; often it was necessary to limit oneself to discovering the only strategy available to get out of the different situations and the game was done. I also remember how some excited situations often became ridiculous due to this underlying ~rigidity~ and the bad AI. In short, I happened to see a completely uncovered enemy leaning against a wall, which was not shot down by my men because it was considered undercover. Other times I have been able to admire enemies roaming freely in the middle of the battlefield, with my men who do not care even though they have received the order to shoot ... were they simply considered undercover too? No one will ever be able to answer this age-old question.", "date": "2006-06-28", "grade": null}
