Of course, the advent of the Internet and social networks has revolutionized many dynamics of interrelationship between sport and the public, but on balance a fan of 1992 interacted with the world of football in a very similar way to how we do now. He indulged in inventing systems to clear the ticket, he had fantasy football with friends, he suddenly became untraceable on match day, but above all he was already playing a Sports Interactive football manager at the time, remaining entranced by the depth offered by that simulation. it must be said, the video games of the British studio have become part of the routine that surrounds our way of experiencing this wonderful sport, and from this point of view it is not surprising that despite its nature as a deeply niche product, Football Manager is followed today by a community of fans that could very well fill an endless number of football stadiums. This year's edition is expected for November 8, 2022 on all platforms, except for PS5, whose version was suddenly postponed to a date to be set just a few days after its launch. In our review of Football Manager 2023 we will tell you about everything that has been added to the Sports Interactive management system, which once again retains the formula of its predecessors to improve it here and there with some targeted interventions. Here's what's new. A step forward on the licensing front: the UEFA competitions are here Football Manager 2023, for the first time in the history of the series, includes the official licenses of UEFA competitions The article will focus on the main novelties of the game, also because this year Sports Interactive has chosen not to retouch almost any element of the interface, proposing what is in fact a seasonal update embellished with some new tools to support the virtual coaches. In reality, the news does not only concern the new features now in the possession of the coach, but also purely aesthetic aspects of the managerial experience. If you are in the habit of spending hundreds of hours with Sports Interactive products, you will know it very well, in Football Manager , unlike for example games like FIFA and PES, licensing has never been a huge issue. In fact, the game has a very close-knit community of modders behind it, which has always enriched the vanilla versions of each edition with all kinds of licensed content. This year, however, the London studio launched an unexpected counterattack and for once anticipated the modders, signing an agreement that finally brings the official licenses of UEFA competitions into the game, natively. If the introduction of Champions, Europa and Conference League rights does not represent a significant novelty for geeks accustomed to resorting to mods, their debut will instead be very important for all other Football Manager fans, because if it is true that the simulation it is first of all immersion, getting to compete in the UEFA top-flight tournament and listening to the notes of the Champions League anthem is a priceless and absolutely thrilling sensation. In addition to the anthems, any other detail of the match will also be embroidered with the UEFA competitions theme, such as the graphics of the formations anticipating the match, or those of the VAR intervention, or even the scoreboard with the number of minutes elapsed , with the result that the feeling of being right in the middle of the most important European stages will be really strong. Long-term strategies with the new Team Plan The new Football Manager 2023 Team Plan we are sure will become an integral part of the habits of virtual managers It's strange how usually the innovations introduced in a Football Manager by Sports Interactive seem marginal at first, and then become such an integral part of how the club is managed that one wonders how it was possible to do it before in the absence of that particular feature . This is the case with the Data Center, and we are convinced it will also be with the new Team Plan, a tool that top clubs from all over the world have used for years, but which has never been seen before in a Football Manager. This year, Sports Interactive has thought of updating its football management system for the first time by including the Squad Plan, a tool that clubs use to carefully plan the composition of the squad for the years to come. The Team Plan, occupying a dedicated button at the top of the left bar, offers technicians the ability toanalyze in depth the amalgam of the team, going to find all those critical staffing issues that could arise over the seasons. More than an active tool, the team plan turns out to be a sort of refuge for the technicians, who can here experiment and indulge themselves by building the dream team they expect to assemble in a matter of years. You can choose any reference formation to find out if we will be covered in all positions after a possible change of form, or browse the various sectors of the pitch to monitor the influx of players entering from the spring and the outflow of those who they leave the club due to the expiry of their contract. The Team Plan has every intention of becoming a permanent part of the coaches' habits and of playing a central role in market planning, and although we haven't had the opportunity to test it adequately since it only bears fruit in the very long term, we are convinced that represents a crucial new feature for Football Manager 2023. Two new interlocutors not to be ignored In Football Manager 2023, having the agent on your side will be of utmost importance during a signing We know that Sports Interactive, in the creation of its managerial, is always looking for the perfect reproduction of the parametric reality. The company, in addition to having a network of observers that would be the envy of the main clubs in Europe, is also able to trace football phenomena that have nothing to do with numbers, which is why in Football Managers there is the VAR and in other sports simulations, its introduction is still a mirage. In this sense, it is not surprising that one of the main innovations of Football Manager 2023 is embodied by the weight that players' agents now find themselves having in the all-round management of the professional life of their clients. The agents, in addition to providing detailed information on the possibility of a transfer even before the club that holds his card has been contacted, they will also be able to intervene in the daily issues concerning the players, intervening for example to solve psychological problems that are affecting the athlete's performance. In our experience, we quickly realized that it's always better to have the agent on your side, because they dictate the rules of the game and overriding them never leads to any result. In fact, at the helm of SPAL we contacted the staff of Shomurodov, the Uzbek striker of Roma who the Capitoline club was trying to free at all costs, to find out what the agent thought of the transfer. The agent rejected us saying that the player had no intention of going down to Serie B, and so we thought about making an official offer to Roma who, as predicted, were very happy to sell him. Despite the agreement, the prosecutor got in the way and made the negotiation vanish, teaching us the hard lesson on the importance of agents in market exchanges. The new Supporters section of Football Manager 2023 allows you to get an idea of the expectations that the public has towards us The second interlocutor to which every coach, ancient or modern, inevitably ends up submitting is the public, which in Football Manager 2023 will be at the center of a new system useful for managing their expectations. Each club is profoundly different from the others, as are its supporters, which is why Sports Interactive has added a new window to the Company View screen that summarizes the composition of the public following the team, in order to offer the manager the possibility of better understanding them wishes and expectations. For example, a first-tier international club like Real Madrid will be followed largely by casual fans, interested only in results and not inclined to accept a series of negative results. Another, perhaps from the English Championship, will instead be supported above all by a hard core of hooligans, who have different needs and aren't very interested in victories. The categories are divided into Enthusiastic, Occasional, Passionate, Families, Comfortable and Corporate, and each will have very different requests, and often at the antipodes to those of the management. The new Supporters screen, in addition to giving further depth to the managerial dynamics, will be invaluable for discovering which aspects of club management to prioritize, a great novelty achieved by Sports Interactive. Insufficient progress in the field of simulated matches The game menus in Football Manager 2023 have been the same for 3 years While we're quite inclined to forgive the indolence of Sports Interactive which for the third consecutive year offers the same user interface without any substantial novelty, on the other hand we would have liked to see more decisive interventions in what is the beating heart of the London studio's management: the playing field. The football simulation is in fact the same as always, it remains light years away from something that is even just pleasant to look at, and although it presents some imperceptible novelties it is clear that on balance the reasons for switching to this Football Manager 2023 can be counted on the fingers of a hand without even all the ends in place. Sports Interactive has worked on the behavior of the artificial intelligence that guides the opposing coaches, who should now be more adept at responding to our tactical moves to stem and neutralize them. This is quite imperceptible, especially after a limited number of matches, but we have to admit that in some cases progress has been noticed, such as when in a Champions League match the opposing coach took advantage of our uninspired substitution to hit us and reach the draw in extremis. The match simulation aspect of Football Manager 2023 is behind in so many ways According to the developer, interventions on the AI of the players should then emerge, which however still prove to be lackluster in many situations and always ready to make sensational blunders that sometimes screw up entire games. We repeat, we would like to see substantial investments from this point of view: the Sports Interactive video game is the state of the art of football management, but in 2022 the graphic impact of the matches still seems stuck on the seventh generation of consoles, and until Football Manager fails to achieve decisive progress in this field, the product will inevitably remain a habit for a few fans.", "date": "2022-11-03", "grade": "8.0"}
