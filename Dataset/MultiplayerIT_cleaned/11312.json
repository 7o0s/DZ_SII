{"name": "Clid the Snail", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/clid-the-snail-recensione.html", "text": "When there are independent studios that want to try their hand at the twin stick shooter genre, we always feel a little bit of joy in our hearts. All in all, it is a simple genre to develop, the basic mechanics are linear and even with modest means, titles capable of entertaining and entertaining for a few hours can come out, the right compromise to satisfy lovers of these productions. However, when the gaming world moves at a crazy pace, it is good to consider what the market offers and what quality level your competitors have reached, especially if on Microsoft platforms titles such as The Ascent are distributed in subscriptions with negligible cost. Weird developers Beluga at their first experience, however, had a rather clear vision of the product and wanted to reach the public with something different from the usual, with a game that set aside the sometimes exaggerated rhythms of the genre to return to a slower and more reasoned, made up of inspired settings, but also of lasers and characters as curious as they are interesting. We approached the Clid the Snail review after this summer's trial with the sad regret of having found even more faults. Wasted opportunity? A snail to keep us company The bosses are a real thorn in the side, so much so that they often become frustrating Clid is a snail, as you could easily guess from the title to be honest, who doesn't particularly like the comfortable and quiet life of his fellows, which is why he was soon sent into exile. Fortunately, Weird Beluga has decided to give Clid two legs and make all the creatures of this imaginary world anthropomorphic, thus also removing that annoying problem of the slimy trail that would have distinguished our gastropod friends. The result is something unique, as mentioned in the incipit, with a stimulating story and plot and, without a doubt, the flagship of the entire production despite the trivial initial premises. The universe in which we find ourselves is fascinating, well thought out and full of details capable of telling a unique subtext, showing the player elements unrelated to the world of snails and quickly bringing the general vision of our problems into another dimension. A match stuck in the ground to be used as a torch or a lighter placed as an insurmountable obstacle are just two small examples, but they make us understand the extent of our deeds, immense in the world of Clid, but insignificant if evaluated with the weight of our size . In short, like all self-respecting heroes we will find ourselves having to fight against a gargantuan threat, capable of bringing not only our travel companions to their knees but also all the other races that we will meet on our way, an adventure told with general care and able to bring the player into the part, the only real objective of the production since from here on things start to fall apart. The pace and evolution of the levels are designed to give the player time to aim and fend off rather dangerous enemies, capable of stealing a large part of Clid's vital energy with one blow. We could say that Clid the Snail is the Dark Souls of the Twin Stick Shooter, abusing a now unoriginal meme, but the truth is that more than once the situations have reminded us of the trial and error fights typical of the From Software series . However, this is not always a good thing, given that the difficulty level often tends to soar suddenly, with long and repetitive sections against which the player risks crashing brutally, necessarily having to start over from the closest checkpoint feeling frustration , more than a desire for revenge and revenge. All due to slow gameplay and an aiming system, albeit extremely simple, which leaves too much room for imprecision and carelessness, a lethal combination for a game like this. Unfortunately, the constant and continuous slowdowns on PlayStation 4, the platform we used to review the game, do not help either, as well as an unclear and clean view of the setting, which ends up muddying everything that happens on the screen. The purple lasers collide with the gloomy colors that surround Clid in his adventure and also the other effects are not exactly noteworthy for a final result that shows the level of inexperience and the few strengths of the team in question. An armory to unlock Environmental puzzles, as well as shootings for a slow and reasoned rhythm. Clid's main weapon can fire in bursts and has a secondary fire that emits a charged pulse, enough for most vogues.lte to blow up various enemies in an overflowing explosion of innards. Although with the passage of time and the progress of the adventure, other guns such as gatlings and flamethrowers are unlocked, everything happens much too slowly and with the constant weight of ammunition counted for all secondary weapons, a situation that leads the player never to change his weapon so as not to waste the few bullets available, leading him to practically never use them. A pity therefore that the variety remains a chimera, where players will prefer to remain faithful to a weapon with infinite shots rather than finding themselves out of ammunition at the climax and being surrounded, or worse stuck, by enemies who will charge them head-on. The high level of difficulty also does not go well with the extravagant end-of-level bosses, certainly very tough bones for the average player, running the risk of an early abandonment of the adventure precisely because of that feeling of frustration already mentioned in precedence. Clid might surprise you with his enhanced shells capable of creating shields or throwing ice stalactites but they are hidden and extremely sparse mechanics, which never manage to become as integral to the gameplay as we would have liked. Thus we find ourselves in the hands of a basic gameplay while advancing in linear levels racking our brains to overcome the environmental puzzles, with the constant sensation of having in our hands a game that could do much more with little extra effort but that never succeeds to take off despite the good ideas put on the plate.", "date": "2021-09-07", "grade": "5.5"}
