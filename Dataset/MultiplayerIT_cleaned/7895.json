The rich game formula set up in 2011 is back today, with the plus of a respectable intellectual property, the DC Comics heroes, which lend themselves well to the typical gameplay of American kids. In short, even here the solitary player cannot complain. A long history, the 240 challenges of the S.T.A.R. laboratories, while having canceled the classic ~arcade~ in its place we find a long series of battles, characterized by different game conditions. In short, there is really a lot of irons on the fire, without forgetting the substantial multiplayer component. (Dis)United Earth The story, made up of 50 fights for five difficulty levels, takes us directly to the parallel universe area, in short, nothing new under the sun. Metropolis has been razed to the ground, nuked. Superman was tricked by the Joker into killing Lois and his son. Wracked with rage, he turned Metropolis into a dictatorship, with the other superheroes giving up and becoming his henchmen. However, the resistance is combative, led by the usual untrustworthy Batman. The turning point comes when from another Earth, in which the explosion of Metropolis did not take place, the remaining ~good guys~ manage to teleport the superheroes, starting battles between real ~doubles~ until the last apocalyptic clash . There is no doubt that the NetherRealm Studios formula works to make a story that is not a simple slideshow gallery between one match and another enjoyable, but it is equally true that in that of Injustice: Gods Among Us, there is much to complain about . Between doubles, deux ex machina, characters who enter and leave the scene quickly (perhaps by knocking down a wall), unintelligible joints and cloying dialogues that smacked of old already at the time of the pot-bellied Adam West, there is little to be happy about. In short, the quality of the writing is mediocre, it is perfect as a fan service for all Justice League lovers, but all the others could find it almost irritating due to the naivety of some ideas and solutions. Obviously nobody wants Shakespeare, but wasting the potential of a ~dark~, adult, real elseworld setting like that of Injustice is a real shame. The merits are others though. The first is what we talked about previously, that is, it focuses on the objective of going beyond the simple fil rouge between one clash and another, one arrives at the end interested, but also tired and perplexed. Its structure, like that of Mortal Kombat, gradually presents all the characters, in short, it is a real business card to show the potential of the combat system. You certainly pay the price of impersonating ~unknown~ heroes, provided that you haven't spent a lot of time in training beforehand, but more generally it manages to entertain for all its many hours of play. Furthermore, to flesh out the main menu with content, we think of mini games, to be understood as quick time events (hit the enemy, destroy incoming objects ...), which precede some fights. If successful, our opponent will start with less energy or vice versa. Lots to play The single player doesn't stop there. It doesn't get to the plethora of content seen in the previous NetherRealm Studios title but without a doubt players can't complain. Alongside the 240 tests of the S.T.A.R. Laboratories, which are unlocked as you obtain the necessary calculation of evaluation stars, and which vary from ~simple~ fights, to mini-games, to clashes with various or ~busted~ parameters, there is the reinterpretation of the classic Arcade, here called Battaglie. We have a total of twenty different types of clashes (for ten matches each), ranging from the more normal ones that see us fight against heroes or against criminals, to the more ~complicated~ ones, where it counts to win in less than two minutes, in which the poison makes us leave very debilitated, or where our energy is equal to a quarter of the total and so on. These real modifiers are many, and very interestingly, they are not all available from the start, but must be purchased by spending the hard cash of the game, i.e. the armory keys and access cards, which are obtained as you level up. Both are then necessary to unlock all the bonus content, to be understood as sketches, music, backgrounds, costumes and much more. Injustice: Gods Among Us therefore invites us to spend a lot of time with all modes (multiplayer included), since each content coRuns as you level up, mini internal challenges included. There is a lot to play on balance and once the Story is finished, a couple of battles won (in which each of the twenty-four characters on the roster has its own ending) you are far from having seen everything. You really need to grind, almost to the limit of repetitiveness to completely dissect the title, but without a doubt the American guys have done a good job to better diversify the gaming experience. The multiplayer part is also rich. Let's say right away that the netcode, net of a reduced online population since the game has yet to come out in our area, seemed quite stable, quick to enter the game, with zero lag to affect the fights, even if some slowdowns were not catastrophic have characterized our matches. Obviously, only when the servers are fully operational will we be able to know how the game will behave. The menu is the usual one: ranked, private and player games, King of the Hill and the ability to create or join a room. Furthermore, there will be daily challenges capable of offering quite a few experience points: at the time we are writing, winning twenty-five matches earns us 5000 points. Xbox 360 goals Injustice: Gods Among Us rewards the player with 1000 points for a total of 50 achievements. The objectives require us to properly dissect the whole game, both online and in single player, and also engage us in companies that should not be underestimated. How to get the maximum rating in S.T.A.R. lab missions, win all battles or unlock ~all unlockables~ in the archives. Heroes and villains But what is the heart of the game? Obviously the combat system and the roster. Here too NetherRealm Studios has not spared itself. The twenty-four heroes / villains are all equipped with a peculiar style and, given the danger of parallel universes, you never get duplicates with only different skins. Virtually no one specializes in melee or ranged attacks, everyone is ~capable of doing everything~, consequently Injustice: Gods Among Us is open to any type of approach with every character available. We tried all the ~fighters~ a bit, what seemed to be the most important distinction is the speed of the kick and punch combos rather than the strength of the special attacks. The different ~heaviness~ of some heroes compared to others is very clearly seen, just mention for example Catwoman and Superman's nemesis Doomsday, and more generally the roster gave us the impression of not presenting serious balancing problems between the characters , although since ranged attacks do not cancel those that use particularly fast and wide-ranging shots can be advantageous. Obviously only the online community will sanction who will be defined as top tier or low tier, for now every fighter seems to be able to give great satisfaction. But given the ~pyrotechnic~ nature of the game, the danger that someone is stronger than another should not be underestimated. A great applause must therefore be made to the complete combat system, as immediate as it is profound. Everything revolves around three ~normal~ attacks, their modifiers through direction input and related combos, special attacks, enhanced special attacks, holds, counter holds, parries, active parries, different types of lightening parries, peculiar abilities for each character, more obviously what the numerous films released have shown so far, or the choreographic super moves and the much-vaunted environmental destructibility. This is a nice list that makes it clear how the American boys have not limited themselves to doing the ~caciarone~ homework given the license available, but have staged fights that have nothing to envy in complexity to more ~serious~ titles and technicians. Going into more detail, the special attacks, with movements with the stick roughly the same for everyone, allow us to use the powers and gadgets of each character. For example Batman throws the batarang and grabs enemies with his grappling hook, Superman uses short and long range heat vision, Aquaman throws his trident or uses it to unleash the forces of the ocean, Green Lantern summons machine guns and missiles with the ring, Green Arrow uses his bow both as a weapon and to strike from a distance, Joker sprays acid and throws poisonous barrels, Shazam summons the power of lightning and so on. Each attack carried out or immediately loads the bar of the so-called Super different for each wrestler and stages a scripted cutscene that is often very funny and which above all takes a lot of energy from the opponent. To name a few: Stsuperman launches the victim into space and then sends him back to Earth with a Bud Spencer-like punch, the Joker opens the sequence with a cake in the face and ends it with explosives and pistol shots, Flash makes a couple of laps around the planet for a punch speed of light, Deathstroke uses machine guns and point-blank rifles, while Batman closes his sequence with the Batmobile as the protagonist. The rate of violence is extreme and excessive, with results more slapstick than Mortal Kombat: no blood or broken bones in plain sight. We laugh often and willingly, except when it is the enemy who breaks our faces. Then there are two other ways to consume the bar, enhance the special moves by pressing the right trigger or, just once in the game, put all or part of it into play in a real ~blind~ bet that stops the action. Whoever wins gains health or deals more damage. A real last resort move to be used with care, which in fact becomes available only when the second and last energy bar has been revealed (in fact, there is no round count). In addition, each character has an attack or a bonus that can be activated by pressing the B key. Beyond the confines of the internship Then there is the chapter on environmental destructibility, which represents a real plus of the game. Each stage is littered with objects to be used both to evade the opponent's blows and to attack him. In the Batcave we have for example the missiles of the Batmobile or electric cables in plain sight, in other levels we can launch bins, huge aircraft engines, statues, pointed crystals, grenades or release torrents of fire, freezing gases, but also real tsunamis. All with extreme speed and gratification, without forgetting the possibility of closing the sequence with a nice ~bouncing~ aerial combo. Simply push the right backbone in the presence of the hotspots and you're done. Furthermore, by means of a simple normal charged attack (watch the timing!) we can hurl our opponent beyond the boundaries of the stage, with a consequent fall and relative progressive lowering of the energy bar. Like the films of the special moves, these ~choreographed~ sequences are very violent but at the same time comical, as when we see Batman falling and bouncing like Wile E. Coyote from the ravine on the Gotham stage and then being run over by the subway. But all the other internships are no joke either: the one in Metropolis with its tissue paper palaces is a good example. The combat system is therefore full of possibilities, the tutorial is almost unsettling for all that it shows us in a short time, but we can say that it lends itself both to a disengaged approach, almost like button mashing, and to a more reasoned one, to put it the most technical and savvy players at the whip. In this sense, the five difficulty levels are perfect for varying the gaming experience to the fullest. On a normal level, you win quite easily, in history only a few final battles have put us in difficulty. Our advice is to start here to understand the rules of the game and to familiarize yourself with the moves (complete with hitboxes and animation frames prominently displayed in the options) and then quickly level up. The impression is that defenses, active or not, play a very important role for high-level challenges, much more than special moves. On a technical level Injustice: Gods Among Us is certainly a good watch, if we stop at the in-game parts. Transitioning from Story cutscenes to actual combat can be mind-boggling. The models of the protagonists are as well made, rich in detail and animated to perfection, as the cutscenes are generally in low resolution, dirty and polygonally rough. In short, a real shame, an almost abysmal difference given the excellent work done by NetherRealm Studios, and which clashes heavily with the artistic work carried out to stage the ~dark~ look of the bad heroes. A praise must be given to the dubbing, only in English, with actors in part and which makes us forget the Italian one made for Mortal Kombat, which had made many turn up their noses.", "date": "2013-04-16", "grade": "8.0"}
