{"name": "Empire Earth - The Art of Conquest", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/empire-earth-the-art-of-conquest.html", "text": "The classic (Heavy) We are facing the canonical expansion formula: additional levels and three campaigns for a total of eighteen new scenarios. We have a product that adds, for owners of the original Empire Earth, to the plethora of addons that are being baked in a continuous stream in this first glimpse of the millennium. In good EE style, we have the opportunity to take on new missions as the Romans, and then move on to the pacific of WWII, concluding with the futiristic campaign of the new era specially added with this expansion: the space age. It's not over, there are two new civilizations to manage, two new heroes who arrive to support the cause of their people. As you can see it is not that the contents are not there, but it seems that the offer is not able to arouse particular enthusiasm, given that there are no substantial changes. You'll say: ~Good strength, it's an expansion, what more did you want?~ I reply that more is now a must. How many times have we been able to say that an expansion proved to be essential to bring new life to the title ~father~? Very few. The Art of Conquest is obviously not one of these, also and above all because of one thing Timing (Poor) Often a poorly chosen choice or a too dilated period of time is enough, and with the same value of the result, completely different audience responses are obtained. In our case, Empire Earth came out the beauty of a year ago and never as in an inflated genre like that of the RTS it is necessary to strike while the iron is hot. Art of Conquest just comes out too late. If the total number of EE owners is potentially interested, the circle narrows if we take into consideration those who are still virtually addicted to this strategy, even after all this time. If we add that quality strategists are flocking in this period, then we have squared off around the thesis of overall weakness of this expansion. In support it must be said that at the time the Sierra title aroused many enthusiasms, including mine, while several people defined as ~purists~ turned up their noses in front of its graphics. Today things have changed and one cannot help but notice in an almost total plebiscite that the Empire Earth engine is aesthetically outdated. How can you not bring to mind the graphic delights and the gratifying visual feast that the most current games ... (also thanks to a clearly superior hardware) The millennial minestrone The main feature of EE, the one that everyone remembers, is that it was born and grew up on an idea that was as ambitious as it was difficult to implement, that is, taking into consideration an immense time span, which starts from prehistory up to the spatial future of robots. The double-edged sword is perhaps its strong point and there is a reason for saying this in the long run I understood that it is not generalism that pays off in the volatile world of gaming software for PCs, but rather the ability to emerge thanks to its specialization. Let me explain with another example. I can adore the medieval combat, and I can like the space setting. Maybe the second world war does not interest me at all and then I focus on medieval maps. I will never have the care of making a game dedicated exclusively to medieval battles. That's all. The success of games such as Shogun or the very recent Medieval, both belonging to the Total War series, says a lot about how the computer strategist is oriented today and what he aims for. Not too much that spoils, but the strategic ~retail~ that can accompany you for many months. And if I try, what do I find? Ok, let's retrace our steps for a moment. Let's see what we can still have among the new features. First let's start with the buildings of the new space age, which include the space port and the space turret, which are easy to understand. Totally destructive is the attack with the calamity of the meteor storm, which is capable of decimating opposing spaceships. Imagine one of the key scenes from Verhoeven's Starship Troopers, in which the terrestrial ships are swept away and set on fire There are two civilizations as I said, and they both come from the land of the rising sun. Korea and Japan (Maybe the programmers followed the soccer world cup?). The Koreans have fanaticism, that is, once the power is evoked, the units have higher attack values, but lower hit points, while the Japanese have a special unit, the cyber ninja. He is able to plant a bomb that can disable a building, but at the same time he knows how to fight with his trusty kaden if someone gets too close to it. And for multiplayer what can we expect? An improved system compared to the previous one, with greater stability. Eight players can clash happily finding opponents on the net easily, thanks to the Sierra online service. We are a fraction of a second in time As you can see, there is never a need to despair, there is always something good at a second, more in-depth look. It should be mentioned that the package comes in the classic DVDbox, but with the addition of an interesting guide from the First Edition (famous in America for packaging paper guides of all kinds and for every game) which includes the entire Roman countryside, for including a welcome ~goodie~. Finally, the only big drawback is the fact that this is a product for Empire Earth hyper-enthusiasts to the core, since I don't feel comfortable recommending this expansion to a new player who would like to embark on the brainy world of RTS. The field battle of the new adepts takes place right now between titles like Warcraft 3, the now upcoming Haegemonia and the titanic Age of Mythology. The art of conquest! I'll be honest, it's not always easy to break free from deadlock situations like a blank word document, waiting to receive input from frantically typed keys. Even more so when it comes to having to write about something that leaves you with very little to say. And then you let the flood of words gush almost spontaneously, placing something on the scale that goes far beyond a description of how things are. You start asking yourself about bigger, if we want more macroeconomic aspects. And try to understand how the game of those who play all out with hits on the shelves is conducted. And the pawns? Well, of course there are those, otherwise what conquest would it be? It's a shame that we players are those pawns. But what happens when the subordinates realize that the general is leading them to certain death? There are two cases: either they allow themselves to be dragged into the delirium of their commander or they throw their weapons on the ground, and go away with a gentle step, sucking on the stem of a daisy...", "date": "2002-11-15", "grade": null}
