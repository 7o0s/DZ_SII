{"name": "Ritmi paradisiaci", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/105999-beat-the-beat-rhythm-paradise-ritmi-paradisiaci.html", "text": "There was a time when the prosperity of music games allowed for anything in between, winking at huge audiences of users willing to pay annually to hit the buttons on a plastic guitar. The end of that era, just a couple of years away, was as sudden as it was devastating. The collapse has left a battlefield full of rubble and has returned, at least for now, rhythm games to a niche genre, dedicated to cultivating the opposite extremes of its offer. On the one hand titles like Rocksmith, due out in the Old Continent in a couple of months, with its rigorous didactic approach, strings to play and the prospect of long winter months spent learning chords. On the other Beat the Beat: Rhythm Paradise, triumph of the suspension of doubt and latest addition to a series born on Gameboy Advance, landed in the West on DS and now arrived in living rooms all over the world, even if a little on the sly. The formula hasn't changed one iota, with all due respect to those in search of originality at all costs but all the advantages of re-proposing the usual crazy, hilarious musical experience. minimal The fifty new challenges that make up Beat the Beat: Rhythm Paradise do not differ in structure from those of the two previous chapters: minimalist graphics, a precise musical theme, variety of interactions reduced to the bone and a high challenge rate. The Wiimote forgets its motion controller properties in favor of pressing only the A button and the B rear trigger; enough to keep up the pace. As always, the mini-games associate music with a small story, abstract or everyday, but the representation is completely accessory and most of the time it deliberately tries to distract, complicate the view and waste time. The ideal would be not to look at the screen, but hypnotic madness and habit combine by forcing you to follow with your gaze aviator cats throwing a shuttlecock, wrestlers flexing their muscles for photographers or amorous rendezvous on the little bench outside a school. The progression is rigorous, with the tests that are unlocked one after the other in a rigid sequence, but the structure alternates, as in the past, four independent scenarios with a remix that takes up the themes, unites them in a common context and tests what has been learned previously. Interesting how the dry design of Beat the Beat: Rhythm Paradise reduces even aspects on which almost all the other rhythm games that have written important pages in the sales charts of the past years had applied. For example, indicators with hyperbolic scores, stars, bonuses and multipliers are missing. It is limited to a final judgment that celebrates the passage of the test and, if you have been good enough, the delivery of a medal useful for unlocking the extras. In our view, there are problems balancing the difficulty, with sudden surges that in some cases lead to frustrating situations, but most of the time it is enough to take a break or dedicate yourself to perfecting the previous results to then go back to it successfully. The best version Landing on a home system, the Rhythm Paradise team had the opportunity to adapt the experience to the living room. In particular, a competitive mode for two players has been included which reviews some mini-games tested in single player. Unfortunately the selection is limited and the offer seems like a barely mentioned extra. Ultimately, the most interesting form of sharing of Beat the Beat: Rhythm Paradise remains the one that naturally pushes you to alternate with the controller: the dexterity necessary to get involved is very limited, making it accessible to anyone, but the required skill is a lot and often the complexity of an internship is subjective. It's as transversal as a casual game, but under the surface it knows how to be bastard like few others. Fifty levels finish quickly, in theory, but replayability is high between medals to collect and the request, specific from time to time for a single test, to complete it without ever making a mistake. In playful terms there is a good diversity of obstacles to overcome, with moments in which to commit to learning mnemonic sequences, others focused on resistance or rapid changes of pace and so on. The European version, as if that weren't enough, contains both localizations, in English and Japanese, making us choose which of the two we prefer to use each time we load the game. A highly appreciated bonus that accompanies the adaptation of the text into Italian. The visual variety is, like the musical one, impressive: simple but thematically different still screens betweenthey are the stage for crazy characters that seem to come out of a manga or abstract geometric environments but also traditional sources of inspiration, such as Ukiyo-e style tables. The two-dimensional graphics, depending on the moment simple or bare, must have helped to create animations perfectly synchronized with the music, being able to shape, cut and adapt them as needed. Overall the audio-visual experience is very pleasant and distinctive, promoted without reservations.", "date": "2012-07-16", "grade": "8.5"}
