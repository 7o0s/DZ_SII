A valid consideration both in a general point of view and, even more so, in that of a PC player with a certain background, made up of bunny hopping, rocket and strafe jump, the possibility of setting up his own server and that of expressing and share your creativity with mods and extra maps, only doing good for the health of the game and the community. That's right, just that background that a couple of decades ago id Software itself baptized, consolidated and brought to glory, making it a standard, except at a certain point distancing itself from it. But if there is no doubt that unlike the Campaign, where the Texan studio made almost all the right choices, the multiplayer seems to be the result of a confused and questionable design, schizophrenically compressed between too many different orientations. It is equally undoubted, however, that John Carmack's ex-colleagues are rolling up their sleeves, trying to straighten out their shot. After the release of a demo, the much talked about Vulkan support (which supplied so much fuel to the war between AMD fanatics and nVidia supporters), Photo Mode and the Classic DOOM weapon option, a few days ago the monumental Update 2, which introduced tons of material and structural changes to SnapMap. It also included refinements and balances for the competitive component, but above all Sector and Exodus, two modes that with their setting make up for certain problems with the pace of the games. A hellish pour of stuff, 100% free, which anyone who bought the base game can enjoy, with a set of coveted Free-for-All modes to be added soon. It is unlikely that multiplayer will really take off without a decisive awareness of its identity, a radical systematization of the gameplay and a revolution in terms of infrastructure, by now unlikely, but it is clear that id is trying hard to improve the focus on to the starting point and make it a supported platform and as ~democratic~ as possible, compatibly with a commercial context such as the current Triple A. Context that inevitably provides for a paid content plan, of which Unto the Evil is the first representative... Our review of Unto the Evil, the first DLC of the acclaimed DOOM I will swallow your soul The DLC first introduces three new maps. Cataclysm is a show to see and play, a location that thrives on great contrasts, those between a demonic dimension and a base in space, which flirt on several levels, now ~poisoning~ each other, now bordering on flashy barriers, now through the schizophrenia of teleporters. A lively, bipolar and very well articulated map. Also excellent Offer, which transports you to hell, welcoming you with a scenographic impact worthy of the best campaign missions. It is an arena with a roughly circular structure, some signs of marked verticality and a really well thought-out alternation between open and closed spaces, which allows you to pass without the tears often felt elsewhere between agile navigation and furious clashes. The trio closes down, in the name of ordinariness, with Ritual, which from an aesthetic point of view appears as a copying of Killing Floor 2 Outpost, while under the morphological point of view it does not add much to what has already been abundantly played since the launch, in particularly in maps such as Scavo. Unto the Evil also brings with it a new controllable demon, the Reaper, who moves nimbly and fast, hurling mighty beams. His real offensive potential, however, is revealed only once a bar is filled, when he can unleash a devastating attack, similar to a BFG blow. An unstoppable death machine on paper, but suitably counterbalanced by a limited energy reserve (350 vitality points), which makes it convex rather fragile. Do not underestimate the EMG Mark V, the weapon introduced by the DLC, a vicious version in appearance and sound effects of the single player's Pistol, which appears as a secondary without art or part and which instead if used with skill and tenacity sa prove lethal in results and rewarding in mechanics. The arrival of the Kinetic Mine was also appreciated, an explosive with remote activation seen and revised in dozens of other titles, thanks to which even in DOOM it is possible to diversify the approaches with traps, perimeter defenses and other useful solutions especially in the objective modes. Unto the Evil also gets along with the inevitable Hack Modules, introducing some fanciful pluses, such as Primordial Speed and Assalto Mobile, without attributing big concrete advantages. Finally, the package is strengthened by a new set of armor, Robotics, and mocking gestures, colors and motifs dedicated to aesthetic customization, which judging by the opprobrium that often and willingly happen to come across in battle are an element particularly appreciated by the regulars. Too bad for the matchmaking, which, although improved, certainly also thanks to the far from exceptional turnout of the players, at least in the format we tested, can come to force you to put up with various delays and malfunctions, sometimes making the use a real penalty of hell even before we have managed to cross its gates.
