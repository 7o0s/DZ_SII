{"name": "The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-settlers-ii-10th-anniversary-recensione.html", "text": "A complex production chain What has changed? In fact nothing. Our task is always to build a settlement that thrives and is well designed in every function. The dynamics of the game are extremely elementary, and truly within anyone's reach, while guaranteeing an excellent level of in-depth analysis, for those who choose to explore the game's potential, while still leaving the possibility of remaining at a more ~elementary~ level, allowing each category of player to find satisfaction. Everything is just a click away, the extremely immediate menus simply require us to select the buildings we have decided to build. To access the building menus, simply click on the building land symbols, divided into icons ranging from a small house to a manor house, to indicate the categories of building buildings in that area. Fundamental attention must be paid, in this new edition of the game, to the roads. Every single building, whatever category it belongs to, every pixel that represents something built must be connected to the streets. Without any exclusions. Otherwise our small and industrious inhabitants will not be able to undertake their endless journeys from the warehouses to the construction sites to transport the material and our settlement, quite simply, will not be able to develop. Build roads and your village will come to life. Not that it's difficult: even the roads are built with a click, just connect the starting point to the arrival point and you're done. Anyone who knows the genre knows how important the production chain is for the success of our games. We will therefore have to pay attention to the choice of buildings to be built, as well as their locations. We will start from the woodcutter's hut, which once finished and connected to the roadway will see its woodcutters go out into the woods (near which we will have built) and cut the trees which will then be sent to the sawmill which in turn will transform them into planks. Once delivered to the warehouse, they will then be used to build new buildings. Although the system with which we actually execute the commands for building is elementary, and the interface truly extremely intuitive, the real challenge of the game will be to study and fit the elements perfectly in order to be successful. The woodcutter's hut, for example, will soon run out of trees and we will therefore have to try to get the forester to replant them quickly enough to provide us with new raw material, while the sawmill, if it is too far from the woodcutters, will slow down the delivery process to the warehouse and consequently to the construction sites. The layout of the buildings and the road network will therefore have to be studied carefully, if we abandon ourselves to chance we can then expect nothing but, sooner or later, to see the ghost of failure appear. Stones and timber are quite close at hand. Things tend to get complicated when it comes time to go mining. The mines of iron, silver, gold and so on must in fact be ~discovered~ in advance. They will appear on the ridges of the mountains represented by their icon, where we will have to send a geologist to analyze the depths between the rocks, indicating which type of vein we are facing. Once built, the mines will have to be supplied with resources, such as fish or meat, which in turn come from hunters' huts, fishing huts, or bread from farms-mills-bakeries... in short, we don't want to kill hungry our miners, no? Expansionist aims in search of new resources But did you think that once you learn how to manage production chains you can sit quietly and watch our villages thrive? Well no. Resources run out. As in real life, also in The Settlers the cycles are not infinite, everything runs out. So legs on shoulder, the time has come to expand our borders and explore new territories, in search of new resources. Building beyond the borders marked by flags that delimit our territory is not possible. The military barracks arrive to solve the problem, which once built and occupied will automatically move the radius of the borders, thus allowing us to conquer new lands and resources. Naturally, our neighbors will also proceed with the same system and it will be inevitable, at a certain point in our expansions, that our borders collide with those of other populations. At this point the only way to proceed in the conquest of the territories will be, as is logical, the one that will see us go into battle. The combat system has not changed at all, compared tothe classic version of the game: we have to choose an enemy watchtower, decide how many soldiers to send and then attack. The battle will then take place automatically and its fate will be decided by artificial intelligence. No strategic effort, in this case. And we just have to watch, trying not to get too bored. In the campaign mode, made up of ten different missions, we will be able to manage only the Roman population, while as opponents we will find Nubians and Asians, who will be available in the free-play mode or in multiplayer which allows up to six players to play simultaneously. The game actually consists of a schematic repetition of the ~build-settle-fight~ system, especially in the campaign mode which sees the common goal of reaching a portal, hidden by enemies or geographical factors. The free play mode instead allows you to experience every possible nuance of our settlements in peace and without being disturbed by anyone. This reissue of The Settlers is, in fact, a thank you from the developers to all the fans of the series, who have followed them for ten years. A thank you that we feel like reciprocating, given the improvements made to the title that allow us to experience all the nostalgic load that those who have played the original cannot fail to experience, combined with the renewed playability thanks to the modernization carried out. Sea voyages have been made extremely more enjoyable and the 3D graphics contribute in an essential way to the gaming experience of our days. Even the sound sector has been rendered in an optimal way, making the acoustic effects of hammers, falling trees and sword crossings absolutely harmonized with the background melodies, creating an atmosphere that is anything but strident. Naturally, those who wish can set the sound options so as to exclude effects or background. The most important innovation, however, certainly lies in the multiplayer mode. The original game in fact allowed two players to play in split-screen with two mice on the same machine, while the modern version of the title provides for the possibility of playing up to six players both via LAN and online. Final comment The Settlers II - 10th Anniversary is a title that no fan of the saga can afford to miss. The first hours of the game guarantee a great nostalgic impact and, above all thanks to the precautions made that make it playable in the modern era, several hours of fun and involvement. Despite this, unfortunately, after a few hours of play it slips into monotony, even if the multiplayer modes help longevity and replayability. A piece of videogame history and culture that will keep us pleasantly busy, but cannot be considered more than a tribute to a saga that helped create a genre.Pros Excellent conversion from the original title Game modes without limits Optimization of the interface and 3D graphics engine Lan/online multiplayer mode for up to six players Cons In the long run, it can become monotonous and repetitive Campaigns not connected to each other Artificial intelligence not particularly developed Combat system not manageable by the user Comparison with the 1996 version - 3D graphics - Observation window is missing - Same combat system - Goods and buildings are identical - Representation of necessary resources in the building window - Grouping of goods in transport priority system - Destroying buildings allows recovery of half of the resources - Mines require more food resources - Rangers plant fewer trees - Soldiers can be sent back to HQ - Double and triple game speed - Simplified control system - Multiplayer up to six internet and LAN players - No multiplayer modes in split-screen - Three multiplayer modes: collect 100 gold, defeat all enemies, dominate 3/4 of the map Back in 1996, the developers of Blue Byte gave us a strategic game that has become a cult game for all lovers of the genre. It was The Settlers 2, the second chapter of a saga that was launched in 1993 on the Amiga and the following year in the DOS version. It was the 1996 chapter that got noticed by the gaming public, marking the beginning of a new era. PCs were now entering all our homes by force, the number of pixels of which the characters and settings were made up could no longer be counted on the fingers of one hand and the game dynamics became increasingly complex. Over time, however, the series has taken different paths from the ones it had begun to travel, always orienting itselfre more towards real-time strategy. Many players adapted with satisfaction to the new evolutionary phases of the saga, others regretted the original game principle. Today the bridgehead of the series is being offered to us again, offered to us with the dress of the party and various improvements both in the technical sector and in some corners that have been rounded off to make it more modern, more playable, but still the dear old Settlers 2.", "date": "2006-10-12", "grade": null}
