The time has come to give a definitive judgment in this review, keeping in mind what has been the history of the title and also of its previous expansion. In fact, compared to Gorgone, the situation has certainly improved, if only as regards the setting and the basic premise. The same cannot be said for the quantity of contents and for the total quality of the same. Let's go into detail in our review of The Outer Worlds: Murder on Eridanos. A day as a detective The premise of this second DLC is very trivial: we are called to investigate the murder of a very famous actress, Helena Alcione. Famous star of The Outer Worlds universe, she was recently hired on Eridano to become the testimonial of a new product that aims to revolutionize the system, making everyone happy. After the call we receive through the trusted ADA terminal, the journey to Eridano takes us to the outer edge of the system, straight to a planet that vehemently recalls Columbia from Bioshock Infinite, as we had already told you in recent days. The inspiration is important considering its nature based on floating islands, all connected by a series of bridges. Unfortunately, compared to the city created by Ken Levine, Eridano fails to stand out - forgive us for the pun - ending up drastically diminishing even those few strong points that it brings as a dowry. In fact, if the initial impact, thanks also and above all to the hotel which acts as a junction of the plot, leads us to believe that the artistic vein has definitely exploded in that of Obsidian, then it is the more peripheral areas that leave us cold, with external landscapes and structures interiors that certainly do not make you cry out for a miracle. During the four or five hours that the campaign of this DLC will take you away you will then have the opportunity to meet different supporting characters, and to find yourself symbolically taking on the appearance of an investigator. In fact, our investigations into Helena's death begin immediately and we will also be honored immediately with a nice scanner that will soon become a nightmare, emblematic for explaining the unsuccessful structure of the expansion. From a purely narrative point of view Murder on Eridanus is not bad and also manages to beat its predecessor in a rather simple way. The story has nice assumptions, it's set on an interesting planet and the idea of having to investigate and become a judge of the few suspects is fun on balance. Unfortunately the poor longevity, the trivial ending and the not negligible predictability linked to the fate of Helena and the culprit are together details that really do not allow the DLC to stand out over the rest of the competition. It's a shame because in terms of writing the irony of Obsidian is always brilliant, especially where you find yourself making sense of the deaths and dialogues with the accused. Therefore, seeing so much goodness abandoned to haste and low budget is never a symptom of satisfaction, rather of frustration. Change gameplay while staying the same There really isn't much to say regarding the gameplay of Assassination on Eridanus. Anyone who has played the base game or the first DLC knows exactly what to expect. We are therefore talking about a first-person action rpg that makes the shooting phase - almost at the limit of the FPS - and the multiple-choice dialogue phase its key moments. Worthy heir to Fallout: New Vegas - according to many who have had the good fortune to play the chapter of the saga currently owned by Bethesda and developed by Obsidian - what is important to keep in mind is that we are talking about a darn budget work more content. This aspect could be found in various elements in the base game, but above all in an extension that was certainly not exciting, which was then strongly re-proposed in the two DLCs. Murder on Eridano, specifically, carries with it a few hours of content and little variety, trying to add to the formula an investigation mechanic via scanner that tastes really stale and obsolete, as well as bloody repetitive. Basically it is just a matter of equipping the scanner as if it were a common gun and listening dozens of times to an unpleasant voice to remind us that there is some trace to be analysed. Nothing more and nothing less. This aspect is paired with a search for the murderer that works little and often puts the suspects on too different floors. In doing so it never really manages to make the search for the culprit difficult. Even the prosecution phase, as far as I know nowntate and verbose, it does not allow for many variations, immediately giving the impression of having to do with a strong disguised linearity. Despite all the criticisms on display, if you loved The Outer Worlds, its world and its characters, Murder on Eridanus will still give you several moments of hilarious fun. Obsidian's ability to fill the quests and dialogues with funny moments, as well as with some important political and sociological reflections, is a truly great gift. On the other hand, the team bases its ability on this aspect, even at the expense of a gameplay that is certainly not exciting. We cannot therefore say that discovering the secrets and pitfalls of Eridano did not entertain us properly, but we would have liked a few more flashes.", "date": "2021-03-17", "grade": "7.0"}
