{"name": "Gianluca Vialli's European Manager", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gianluca-viallis-european-manager_a.html", "text": "Money is not meant to be counted! Let's make a brief summary of what awaits us when we decide to install a soccer-manager simulator (wow, I like that word!). Do you have in mind when on Sundays, sitting on the steps in curve A (or B, you decide), you yell at the top of your voice 'cuckold referee'? Well: it has nothing to do with it. For that there is already Hooligans, correct fan simulator. I was saying: do you know the endless diatribes on Monday evening, when we cry over spilled milk and discuss the formation that Turris should have fielded to win the Champion's League? Here, with Vialli European Manager you will have the opportunity to do just that: choose a team, manage the club's funds, buy all the players you want, train them one by one, set up a valid season ticket campaign and line up the formations. And if you're lucky, your team will even be able to win some matches (wow!). To do these things, obviously, you will need funds and those that will be made available to you by the company will not be enough, you will also have to look for sponsors who will provide you with a convenient contract and you will have to spend the available assets very carefully. This does not mean, however, that you will have to spend the money, otherwise what will they give you to do? Money is not meant to be counted! Since there are so many options and since it is easy not only to feel lost in this endless sea of possibilities but even more so to make the worst choices, it is therefore advisable to start playing from the minor leagues, where it is easier to practice without necessarily of things face failures. We will have to choose the players for our team and, depending on the characteristics of each one, decide how to distribute the training times. But this is only the most immediate aspect of the game, the one that first of all catches the eye, but there are others, just as important in order to always have a substantial capital to be able to spend on our team. We will have to plan a season ticket campaign, for example, which can attract as many fans as possible, but which at the same time guarantees a good deal of revenue. And the money we earn will go to improve security inside and outside the stadium, to provide the necessary maintenance to the facilities and to pay the staff involved in working around the team. As you can see, it's certainly not a simple game and the amount of options available is truly impressive. The Trap in the click! The game interface has a simple structure that does not require particularly complex navigation, but the amount of options present is distributed over many menus and it is not easy to navigate among the many items. Managing the championship requires a lot of patience and many decisions, you need to plan game tactics and marketing strategies, you need to win against the other teams but also against the budget, which will be our persecution. Faced with such a level of detail and a high game complexity, when it comes to taking the field the PC will put us in front of the classic screen with the playing field and the possibility of increasing its speed or even directly viewing the final result. Substitutions, fouls, expulsions and accidents are possible and there is also a commentary in Italian. But the result is not very realistic, it seems to watch a game of pinball without a ball and in fact one of the major defects of this game is the lack of players. The action is invisible, you only see the icons that represent the notable events, such as fouls for example, but not even a shadow of the players and the ball and the whole game! This means that you will have to forget about watching the game up close and if you were thinking about a proprietary 3D engine to display game actions, then you will be disappointed. The audio does its duty, with relaxing and enjoyable music, the commentaries are spartan and have a limited library of phrases and the names of the players are never mentioned, which on the other hand is understandable since there are so many. The leagues and championships to play are really many and in a certain sense they give the title a variety also in the level of difficulty, given that for a novice it will be easier to play with club teams, perhaps from Serie B, than directly in a Champion's League. Spin the ball... We come, therefore, to the final considerations. There's not much to say about the game interface: there are just a couple of static screens and a screen dedicated to viewing the games. The game is perhaps too muchbit monotonous and if you are not a fan of the genre, get bored soon. This fact is to the detriment of the title, since it makes it niche and unattractive to those who would expect something more varied and lively. The graphics are clean and nice, but certainly don't shine for originality, moreover the lack of a three-dimensional section for the matches seriously affects the longevity, given that sooner or later you end up completely skipping the commentary and viewing the final results. A little bit of action would have only done well and then, on top of that, after spending so much time planning tactics and training the team, after spending so much time on the 2D interface, the player could break the monotony of the game by seeing the practical results of his work and following a match through the live eye of a camera. All these things make Gianluca Vialli European Manager a title intended only for enthusiasts and those who are willing to rack their brains between a thousand variables and a simple but flat game simulation. Another manager? Manager football enthusiasts will not be able to hold back a surge of joy in the face of yet another football title, even if we won't kick even one. Italians: a people of CT, recited an old saying that, apparently, is not entirely invented. There are and there will be plenty of managers inspired by the world of football, as long as there will be at least one ball and there will be blowouts who will run around it, and in the end they will re-propose, more or less, the usual soup by heating it up, at a time, with seasonal aromas. But how do all these titles differ? In the testimonial, for example. By now, making a good game is no longer enough, you need an important name nearby, a face that convinces you to buy and in this case the face is Gianluca Vialli. Who is it, you say? And what do I know?", "date": "2002-05-29", "grade": null}
