In this videogame transposition, the first title with an official Space Hulk license for 17 years now, there are some small additions, but the core of the gameplay remains the management of one's own units in cramped space wrecks - precisely called Space Hulk - with the possibility of success of the actions bound by invisible die rolls that play a decisive role in the outcome of the fights. Furthermore, the structure of two factions and two players that opposes the Space Marine Terminators, or armored supersoldiers sent to investigate the aforementioned wrecks, to the fearsome Genestealer, an alien species that has several similarities, especially in terms of behavior, with the Aliens created by Ridley Scott and Hans Rudolf Giger. Space Hulk is an all too faithful transposition of the classic tabletop strategy game Faithful to the original The Space Hulk single player is made up of the 12 missions of the Sin of Damnation campaign, included in the original board game, with the addition of three new missions that act as a prologue and tutorial by placing us in smaller and simpler environments to deal with than those of later maps. But even as the maps expand, corridors and narrow spaces remain the focus in the game as they are in the classic tabletop strategy. And it is in this claustrophobic setting that we find ourselves having to manage our units with the possibility, in the case of the Space Marines who are the absolute protagonists of the single player campaign, to put them in a guard position so that they automatically fire when an enemy enters in their line of sight. There are also the classic turn-based strategy game options, such as defensive movement, the possibility of rotating the units on the spot or placing them in a defensive position, nullifying a successful opponent's shot and forcing the enemy to make a new nut that could fail. A possibility, the latter, quite important when you find yourself facing the Genestealers whose melee attacks are nothing short of lethal. The alien creatures, selectable in two-player multiplayer and enemies controlled by artificial intelligence in single player mode, rely on movement speed that balances the least number of possible actions. Furthermore, when they have not been visually detected, the aliens are represented, in the screen of whoever controls the Space Marines, as ~beeps~ or as radar signals which are indicated, on the virtual board, by a transparent unit colored red. At these times the Genestealers can move more quickly until they are spotted, which makes it easier for the Space Marines to approach. Obviously the latter also have powerful melee shots at their disposal, vital especially when the weapon jams, but when using the Space Marines it is always better to try to keep the distance to avoid excessive risks as well as, with the Genestealers, it is good do not come in front of a fully armed soldier with no action points. In this regard, there is another important element to keep an eye on to avoid being helpless in the face of an enemy. Let's talk about the Command Points, extra action points shared by the whole team which are determined by an automatic six-sided die roll at the beginning of each turn. This means that there can be a large gap between the action points available between the two battling factions, as the cost of attacks generally requires 1 or 2 points. Claws against cannons Space Hulk's campaign, thanks to a good and aggressive artificial intelligence, offers plenty of challenge and setting the difficulty to the maximum level the title turns into a real test for fans of turn-based strategy. But, this is obvious, the gameplay is best expressed only in multiplayer, the mode of election of the title whose mechanics, as we have already reiterated several times, are that of the classic tabletop strategy. In this case, obviously, there isn't the pleasure of having miniatures and dice in your hands but there is that of playing from home immediately by adding friends or choosing to face a random opponent. In addition, the title includes an asynchronous multiplayer mode that allows players to jump into five games simultaneously and take their turns at any time of the day. Nothing new, as this mode has been around for as long as chess and paper mail, but it's a welcome addition, complete with cross-play between all platforms, which avoids the need to be online with each other.temporarily to play and demonstrates the development team's focus on faithfully reproducing the original experience. Attention that, unfortunately, is missing in the case of the aesthetic sector and the variety of the offer. The animations, if nothing else, are decent and, specifically, the heaviness of the space marines is beautifully rendered. The battlefield is framed from above and the aesthetic rendering, however poor, is acceptable, at least in relation to the production value of the title, complete with skits showing critical failures or riddled enemies. But here the zoom on the action makes evident the poverty of models and graphic effects with splashes of blood that are gruesome and not for the rate of realism. Fortunately, to balance the obvious drops in quality, there are appreciable cutscenes and we are surprised by a welcome find by the developers who have added an extra to the Space Marine experience. We are talking about a small camera installed on the shoulder of the super soldiers whose view is reproduced in a small screen located at the top right of the screen. A remarkable addition which, thanks to some flickering effect typical of science fiction films, hides the defects which are particularly evident in the cutscenes. Nothing transcendental but everything is sufficient to support the game mechanics and to the above we must add the creation of an excellent audio sector, limited but engaging, characterized by powerful voices, disturbing noises and atmospheric ambient sounds. But even if all the elements are theoretically in place, and the unexceptional graphics are justified by the modest production value, Space Hulk is still an excessively limited product. After 17 years of waiting, it is reasonable to expect something more than just two types of units, three uninspired additional missions and some corridors. Especially since the developers could have remained faithful to the series by simply implementing the many expansions of the board game. Obviously it is not certain that these extras will not arrive later, in the form of DLC, but the launch version of the title is still missing.", "date": "2013-09-04", "grade": "6.8"}
