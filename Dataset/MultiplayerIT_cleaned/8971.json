Are we kidding? Fortunately there are still the generals of yesteryear, those ready to rip the insignia off their clothes, those who get their beard trimmed by Chuck Norris, those ready to go against the wishes of politics and not use the bidet for six months. It is to them that we must entrust the future of the world... and to four rather truthful and young types aboard vehicles capable of breaching enemy territory. In reality there are five in the PC version, given that the good Gordon Freeman has also been added to the cast, who is in Renegade Ops like the maggots on the caponata. But let's not quibble. In short, puppets, pupae and puppeteers, we need to stop a joker who wants to conquer the terrestrial globe and to do so we need to spread a little lead, perhaps forgetting about so much banality (oh well, it's an arcade, come on). Are you ready for action? Are you as warm as a committee of constipated seal friends? La Resistance! Renegade Ops has a very simple game structure. So simple that it almost doesn't need to be explained: it's a multi-directional bird's-eye shooter with upgradeable weapons and special abilities. Since summarizing a game in thirteen words is bad luck, let's see some more details. Started the game you have to choose which level to face and which character/vehicle to use on the battlefield. Each one has its basic characteristics (speed, acceleration, weapon power) and its abilities, which can be unlocked by spending the points that are accumulated by leveling up. How do you level up? By accumulating experience points. How are experience points accumulated? By eliminating enemies, generating increasingly long combos and completing the different assigned objectives. In short, nothing that hasn't already been seen in a couple of hundred thousand other video games, to be optimistic. Hi, I'm Gordon Freeman. They haven't dedicated a game to me for years and so I let myself be hosted in other people's games. The objectives themselves are quite linear and require you to destroy vehicle X, to destroy vehicle Y or to destroy vehicle Z. The only variations to the formula are: reach the ~Foo~ location and save the character ~Pluto~, who still they always require you to destroy a few enemies by traveling a certain distance. The first few levels of Renegade Ops can be deceiving. They appear to offer open-ended gameplay, within the confines of a shooter, with crossroads and multiple paths to follow. In reality, the dream does not last long and one soon realizes that, although the rooms are quite large, one is forced to proceed along precise lines. Above all, the advanced levels are very linear and, at best, offer hidden areas in which to find some extras such as a bonus life and little else. Repetitions Despite what you may think, Renegade Ops does what it's supposed to do, which is it offers spectacular action, regardless of the camera's point of view, and fills players' eyes and ears with explosions and special effects, as if it were a movie from Michael Bay... ah no, they already stole this one to offend another game. The crux is all in figuring out what you want. Bam, kaboom, boom boom boom! Those looking for action will find the action, while those who want something deeperwell, you change the universe. In short, if we are to try to judge the title of Avalanche Studios (the developer), we must first frame it for what it is. Unfortunately, some critical issues emerge precisely by examining the extremely arcade nature of the game. Renegade Ops doesn't go too far with extras. By destroying enemies you can collect various objects: upgrades for the basic weapon, three secondary weapons, modules to recover energy and that's it. At the beginning, little attention is paid to it, but in the advanced stages of the game the repetitiveness makes itself felt a lot, also because the variations are very few. On a couple of occasions you find yourself aboard a helicopter, but they are isolated situations that only marginally break up the monotonous action. After finishing the campaign, which will take about three hours, there will be very little left to do. There is the multiplayer mode, but it's not particularly well done and after a couple of games you want to move on to something else. If you want you can replay all the missions to level up all the characters, but what's the point? Furthermore, the second or third time you face a map, the real enemy becomes boredom, also because, as written above, the missions are very linear and there is no room for any initiative by the player. A free level where to indulge oneself with vehicles would have been appreciated, so dto make sense of wanting to make them level up and instead nothing.", "date": "2011-11-07", "grade": "6.7"}
