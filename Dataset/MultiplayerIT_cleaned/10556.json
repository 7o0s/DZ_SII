Two years after its debut on PC, the game has finally also landed on the previous generation consoles, PS4 and Xbox One, with an interface adapted as far as possible to the controllers and the inclusion of four DLCs (Fastering Skies, Legacy of the Ancients, Blood and Titanium and the very recent Corrupted Horizons) which increase the body of the experience even more. We talk about it in the review of Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition. History Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition, one of our soldiers aims at a big enemy In the not too distant future, global warming and the melting of the polar ice caps lead to the emergence of the terrible Pandoravirus, hidden for eons in the subsoil of the planet. Within a short time the virus contaminates the waters and transforms most people into violent mutants who respond to a mysterious collective consciousness, whose only purpose seems to be total destruction. To respond to the emergency, Phoenix Point is created, a military protocol that gathers the best soldiers and the most advanced technologies in order to face the advance of the so-called Pandorians. In the meantime, however, the world changes and among the survivors three large factions emerge with which we will have to deal: the fanatical Disciples of Anu, the utopian Synedrion and the militarists of New Jericho. Structure Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition, the Geoscape After completing a relatively short and superficial tutorial, which leaves in our hands the task of understanding the many mechanics that characterize the Phoenix Point experience and its often intricate interface, we find ourselves in front of the Geoscape: a device that monitors the Pandoravirus activity and detects any points of interest on the global map. On board an XCOM-style aircraft we will have to reach these places to reveal their nature, then decide whether to land and deploy our soldiers to face a possible mission. The assignments can revolve around the simple elimination of the mutants present in the scenario (generated by a procedural system), reaching a certain area, defending or collecting resources. Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition, a map and unit movement system At the same time it is possible to assign manufacturing or research functions to the various departments of the headquarters which are carried out while we explore the settings and which mark the main progression of a campaign which boasts a duration of about 35 hours where the DLCs do not also come into play. As mentioned, the Behemoth Edition includes the four major Phoenix Point downloadable contents, which can be activated or not from the main screen and integrate into the progression by adding further contents to the package in terms of missions and enemies, although some new features introduced are not very successful ( see the mediocre flying fights). Gameplay Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition, the manual aiming system that allows you to hit specific points of the enemy The first hours of the game are undoubtedly the most complicated and highlight the uncompromising approach of Phoenix Point, made even more complicated by an interface that frankly has not been translated to the best of controllers and which often leaves you lost on the way of cumbersomeness and lengthiness that are assimilated only after a fair amount of trial and error. The system is naturally that of a turn-based strategy game, but with some interesting variations on the theme: on the one hand, the possibility of aiming manually during an attack, thus to hit specific parts of the body of the Pandorians or perhaps eliminate a parasite that has taken control of one of our companions; on the other hand, a management of the will that weakens if the situation turns for the worse, making our units less performing when they are in difficulty rather than providing them with an extra starting point to recover. This type of approach requires, already starting from the intermediate difficulty level, careful, punctual and patient planning in relation to each phase of the mission, given that the enemies inflict huge damage (although they are moved by an often confused artificial intelligence) and the death of soldiers is in most cases permanent, which can leave us immediately with an emptied roster and heavily undermine our possibility to move forward. The console version weighs down the system further due to a very unintuitive control system, which makes complicated mundane mechanics such as the use of a medical kit or inventory management, and suffers on several occasions from crashes that force you to go back to the previous save, in the hope that it doesn't date back to a few hours earlier. The uploads are also too long, we're talking about two or three minutes on PS4 and twenty or thirty seconds on PS5. Graphics and sound Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition, a soldier about to open fire on the enemy Phoenix Point is a project born from the bottom up, financed through crowdfunding, and this aspect inevitably affects the technical sector of the game, which had not already impressed on its debut on PC. Two years later those technical ingenuities appear even more evident and, although it is certainly not a problem to watch static cutscenes, composed of artwork narrated in English with Italian subtitles, the in-game graphics leave something to be desired. The procedural maps, as often happens, in fact they tend to look alike and bring into play solutions that are far from the quality of a level design proper. As far as the sound is concerned, the music is certainly surprising, which seems to come from a survival horror rather than a strategic one: the themes of Phoenix Point are certainly similar to this interpretation, but the aesthetics of the game certainly does not help to enhance such an approach.", "date": "2021-10-17", "grade": "7.0"}
