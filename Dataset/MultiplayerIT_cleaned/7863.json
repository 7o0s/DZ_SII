{"name": "Torna a casa Wilson", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/118037-dont-starve-torna-a-casa-wilson.html", "text": "Simple graphics, survival mechanics and sandbox structure are three cornerstones of the indie universe which thanks to technological modesty has rediscovered that ancient complexity forgotten by various modern super productions. Minecraft itself, the current ruler of the indie world, includes survival mechanics and this mix of genres has also given us pearls such as Project Zomboid, probable inspiration for that Fortnite that will bring Epic to the next-gen. In such a rich panorama, the apparently more modest Don't Starve has managed to attract the attention of the gaming world thanks to a peculiar aesthetic sector and thanks to the combination of intuitive mechanics and high difficulty. Better than Bear Grylls At its root Don't Starve is a survival sandbox with a decent farming component. The protagonist is the weak but brilliant Wilson who suddenly finds himself catapulted into a wild and unknown world. The main purpose of the unfortunate scientist is to survive in a hostile environment in the hope of finally being able to return home. Nothing simpler for the average modern video game hero, but Wilson has no muscles and must rely on intellect. This, fortunately, can be a powerful weapon and allows our unfortunate adventurer to assemble equipment worthy of Bear Grylls while avoiding, among other things, the horrible experience of having to eat animal innards gone bad. To assemble the basic tools, different materials are needed which lead us to build increasingly complex tools and clothes going through different stages of technological evolution. Obviously, we start with the most accessible raw materials, such as sticks or stones, which allow us to build torches and bonfires, fundamental resources for surviving when darkness arrives. In fact, the night is black, impenetrable and hides threatening shadows, long claws and ravenous creatures. Fire can drive them out but, sadly for Wilson, it's not enough to ensure survival in such a hostile place. Often, in fact, the cold is too intense and the precarious living conditions can lead to an unseemly state of madness, transforming the protagonist into a nutty snack for monsters. For this it is not enough to stop at straw clothes and small fires and it is indeed mandatory to evolve one's knowledge to face the infinite dangers and to be able to plan a survival that crosses the seasons. Is it better to go for the warm clothes right away or collect some food? How much wisdom is there in tasting unknown plants hoping they don't have perverse effects? What is that huge shiny stone for? These and other questions represent the core of the experience, in a trial and error studded with sometimes pleasant and often dangerous surprises. And here, as the hours go by, the apparent simplicity of the title gives way to a remarkable complexity in a maelstrom of situations, climatic emergencies, powerful monsters and objects in profusion. As development progressed, the number of elements that make up the gameplay of the title has expanded considerably to include earmuffs, backpacks, mysterious objects, increasingly dangerous monsters and even a lightning rod. An introduction, the latter, which is anything but accessory, given that the evolution of the title includes the implementation of devastating storms. And if Don't Starve is already a challenge during the first games, which if faced blindly are real nightmares, imagine the difficulty that involves keeping the fire burning amidst lightning and thunderstorms, between monstrous frogs raining from the sky and horrific who longingly observe our fire which is extinguished inexorably. Animals and monsters proliferate everywhere and to eliminate opponents it is necessary to resort to various strategies that involve both the use of increasingly complex objects and the ingenuity of the player who can set fire to a forest full of monsters, lead two creatures of different species kill each other or use a corpse as bait. All tactics, expanded by the development of disguises and walls, essential for optimizing the short times and increasing the chances of survival. In a panorama of this kind, every resource is indispensable but it is not said that it is wise to collect everything that comes before us. In certain circumstances, in fact, it is better to give up some comforts to aim at evolving technology, building advanced machinery and significantly improving clothing so as not to remain in canvas breeches when the snow arrives. Winter is in fact lethal and not only due to the cold but also due to the shortening of the days during which, in order to obtain enough food in a short time, it is imperative to resort to trappels and advanced weapons. The charm of the challenge Top view, comic graphics and well-kept animations give the title a modest look, perhaps even flat for some, but ultimately very pleasant. The goal is to outline a dark fairy tale and the title undoubtedly hits it by enhancing everything with seven protagonists worthy of a horror film, noir touches, distinct habitats, climatic effects, swarms of weird creatures and gym pigs. In some situations farming can still be boring, especially for those who do not like this type of formula, and the setting, however rich, is only one, but between monsters in quantity and touches of atmosphere there is always something to get distracted . In addition, the alternate characters and procedurally generated maps keep the replay value high, which is the mainstay of the game. The night, then, represents a real challenge in its own right and running out of materials to light a fire can give rise to rather convulsive situations. The flashlight drives away creatures of the night but has a short duration and does not guarantee a wide view. For this reason it is easy to end up in the arms of monsters and animals that are not afraid of flames and who can't wait to devour a nice morsel that is still hot. Obviously, having become familiar with the title, situations of this kind become increasingly rare. Although the randomness in finding precious materials can quickly speed up or slow down a game, the game mechanics are quite refined and provide ample optimization possibilities which after a few games become the very center of the gameplay. The growing knowledge of available technologies and the potential of materials allows us to plan a strategy, not to run out of essential resources, to search only for indispensable elements and, therefore, to shorten the number of days needed to assemble equipment worthy of this first name. A process that can also be obtained by consulting, through the web, the experiences of other players, learning which plants are harmful to health and which are essential for not succumbing to tension. But, resorting to the advice of third parties, part of the pleasure of discovery is lost which in Don't Starve is essential to keep the player's interest alive. However, the title does not leave us completely on our own. The type and number of materials to build each item is indicated in the relevant blueprint's tooltip. And to discover new projects, it is sufficient to collect the materials necessary to build specific advanced machinery that lead to a new technological leap and a sharp increase in life expectancy. But, despite the wide possibilities for character evolution, the challenge always remains high. In fact, it is not possible to rely too much on one's ability with a combat system that only provides for the click of the left mouse button on the creature to attack. The strategies we have just talked about allow you to resolve various situations, but face-to-face encounters with monsters are often dangerous, especially when there are whole swarms of ravenous creatures attacking us. Basically, the initial impact is decidedly difficult and despite the intuitiveness, a considerable amount of information is needed to build noteworthy experiences. In any case, the developers have also thought of those players who don't have the time or desire to deal with too dispersive mechanics. We are talking about the adventure mode structured along six levels of increasing difficulty and which, like the other elements of the title, will evolve further in the future. This mode is accessible through special portals located in the standard survival mode and represents a different but no easier experience. Despite the objectives set, the adventure mode, which puts us on the heels of the mysterious Maxwell, offers an even higher degree of challenge between the enormous number of monsters and small inconveniences such as the proliferation of shrubs full of thorns, the collection of which automatically causes physical damages.
