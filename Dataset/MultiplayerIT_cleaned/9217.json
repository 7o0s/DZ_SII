Looking at some images it is easy to misunderstand and think that you are in front of a game dedicated mainly to lustful otaku, but Arc System and Examu, once again, seem to have committed themselves to offering 2D fighting game lovers one of the most complex and satisfying experiences on the square. With the imminent arrival of the third chapter on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the development team has the possibility of relaunching the series also in the European market, although the main target clearly remains that of The Last Blade and Street Fighter 3 lovers: Third Strike (or doujin games like Melty Blood and BigBang Beat). Arcane or archaic? In line with other 2D fighting games, Arcana Heart 3 tries to motivate the constant on-screen fisticuffs by sketching out a rather insignificant plot. After the tragic events that formed the backdrop to the second chapter of the series, this time we see the birth of a new criminal organization called Drexler, headed by a wicked and, needless to say, super-sexy girl. The insignificant narration takes place through very short exchanges between the splendid artworks of the fighters who alternate on the screen, while the player will be able to choose his opponent from those proposed from time to time before the final battle with the devastating Ragnarok. As per the tradition of the series, the Arcana are back, titanic creatures to be associated with your fighter before a match and which can be summoned into battle to unleash powerful attacks. Each Arcana not only differs in aesthetics, but is characterized by unique abilities or specific characteristics: some of them inflict very heavy damage, others reduce the opponent's strength, still others are able to paralyze him for a few moments to allow us to attack him without problems. If we consider that even the fighters are distinguished by strength, speed and special attacks, it is easy to understand how much strategic freedom can be obtained thanks to the hundreds of possible combinations. Playstation 3 trophies Getting all 51 trophies in Arcana Heart 3 isn't easy at all: in addition to more mundane missions, such as finishing Story Mode for the first time or playing the first game online, there are several that will require hours and hours of practice. For example, you will be asked to complete a 666-hit combo, perform very complex combos, defeat all enemies and Arcana or complete the game on the highest difficulty level. Ready to roll up your sleeves? Fan Service in power! Fans of the series will find the same complexity in the combat system, and once again it will be necessary to learn and master the techniques of each character or to perform very elaborate combinations. An on-screen indicator, when filled, allows you to carry out devastating special attacks and cancels, while the introduction of the Force Gauge system adds further strategy to the game: it is an unprecedented ability thanks to which you can absorb the characteristics of your Arcana and eventually summon it for an attack. In this way it is possible, if desired, to balance the weak points of one's alter-ego and make a slow character associated with a fast Arcana more effective. To make life easier for novices, the developers have however added the possibility of simplifying the combat system, allowing you to perform complex techniques with the press of a single button. In addition to the story mode, Arcana Heart 3 limits itself to offering the usual Arcade and Versus for quick games against artificial intelligence or against a real opponent. There is also an online mode in which to challenge other players and obtain reputation points, although in this case we often come across the same lag problems that partly ruined the BlazBlue experience. Fluid and pleasant, graphically the game combines very detailed backgrounds and a high resolution interface with sprites of the characters made in pixel art and with a deliberately retro style, albeit in low resolution and very little detail. On the sides of the screen, two full HD artworks show the two challengers changing expressions depending on the actions performed: the juxtaposition could make someone turn up their noses, especially considering that the game screen thus remains at 4:3 (in line with the originle arcade version), but from the options it is possible to safely eliminate the artwork or alter the graphic style according to one's tastes. An inevitable note of merit goes to the design of the 23 maidens, all beautifully designed and characterized by original costumes capable of driving anime and manga lovers crazy.", "date": "2011-06-23", "grade": "7.8"}
