For all those who do not know what Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon is, simply say that we are facing a simple and elementary third-person shooter where our goal is to eliminate wave after wave of insects, stuff like ants, spiders , bees, ticks, as in the worst of the best American science fiction films of the 50s, alternating with gigantic robots and alien spaceships. In short, a good mix between the imagery of the B series made in the USA with that made in Japan, all grafted onto mechanics that recall those of a random Dynasty Warriors, where you move from one area of the map to another, after having duly cleaned. Ugly as hell The charm of the game all derives from being an exact copy of an old-school shooter, no longer scrolling, but in three dimensions, complete with a destructible scenario (forget the charms of a Frostbyte though), dozens, indeed hundreds of layout and with a very high replayability rate. Let's remove the tooth immediately and start with the most important problem of the game, cosmetics. Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon is a frankly unpresentable game, the first chapter already was in 2007, let alone now, despite small improvements. Everything is pauperistic and old-gen, with a few splashes of texture of a certain level, and it is also the celebration of interpenetration between polygons. In truth, some things are appreciated, such as the huge bosses, or a frame rate that never goes too far in crisis despite very crowded situations. In short, a disheartening panorama, which however fades into the background in front of solid mechanics, to that sense of fun and satisfaction given by a great immediacy and not least by the fact that the game is sold at a budget price, which never hurts . However, there are many innovations, starting with the class system. Before each mission it is possible to choose whether to be an anonymous soldier, an engineer (let's call him that), a flying infantryman equipped with a jet pack or a slow, but powerful and extremely resistant ~tank~. The first is the classic average character, he can equip almost all the weapons, but he doesn't have a secondary skill. The engineer can install automatic turrets, place mines and radars, the flying soldier... flies, while the ~heavy~ soldier, in addition to being able to take more damage, equip shotguns, miniguns and various rocket launchers, is equipped with a laser shield and of an area shot. The weapon drop system is also new. First of all, there are about three hundred, more than double compared to the first chapter. Now they become available as the player levels up, and can be bought by spending the points earned in each single mission. This triggers a system very similar to that of Diablo-style hack'n'slash in which loot and looting are the masters, with the highest-level weapons that are bestowed only by the ~highest-ranking~ enemies. It goes without saying that the dozens of weapons are very different from each other in terms of range, power, burst and so on, finding the right one for a particular enemy is always a good challenge, without forgetting the need to wait to level up to be able to use them. Playstation 3 trophies Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon rewards the player with 50 trophies, 30 bronze, 10 silver, 1 platinum and 5 secrets. They are almost all related to the number of kills obtained by species or using certain weapons. The most difficult ones to obtain concern the achievement of the level cap and the purchase of all weapons, it being understood that killing 25,000 insects or destroying 100 anthills or dens is quite complex. More bugs... When weapons are not enough, it is possible to use special resources such as mechs, tanks, fixed positions of various types and helicopters. In short, one never gets the impression of being too much at a disadvantage, not even when one is faced with three, four bosses together, dozens of ants and spiders and maybe some flying UFOs to fill us with lasers from the sky. As if that weren't enough you are never alone in the game, our bot companions are quite smart and combative, and very importantly equipped with good aim. They also take their being Red Cross nurses very seriously,making us return to the game when we are about to die, like good cooperative players. It would seem a title that, graphics aside, is a huge step forward compared to the first chapter, unfortunately it is not. It's certainly a step forward, but not as one would expect. The defects remain, in fact the repetitiveness kills the single player, the action is always the same, in short, the customization and the classes are not enough to give the necessary variety to the gaming experience. Fortunately, the multiplayer modes come to our rescue, finally also online for up to three friends connected for the campaign, or six for the wave survival, or the never too much appreciated split screen, certainly, however, the constant repetition of the action and related goals is something to be reckoned with.", "date": "2011-07-06", "grade": "7.0"}
