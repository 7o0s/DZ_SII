Video games may or may not like them, they can occupy a tiny part of one's free time or represent an enormous passion, but everyone is able to have fun by fidgeting in front of a monitor. Perhaps this is the reason behind the unexpected success of Ubisoft and its Just Dance, which has now arrived with its third chapter on all home consoles currently on the market. Predictably, it didn't take long before someone else tried to follow in its wake, and after the successful Dance Central for KINECT, PlayStation 3 also offers an exclusive dance game for its users. All that remains is to see what more DanceStar Party has to offer to its main rival. Move it, move it! Those who have already had the opportunity to try Just Dance 3 or Michael Jackson: The Experience for PlayStation 3 or Nintendo Wii will find themselves in front of an almost identical structure: holding the Move in the right hand, the player must follow the choreography of a dancer placed in the center of the screen, imitating the sequences as much as possible and occasionally glancing at the silhouettes that indicate the next movement. Also in this case the game is far from severe, and to have fun it is not at all necessary to prove to be an expert dancer: the important thing is that the hand holding the Move follows the movements indicated on the screen with the right tempo, while the rest of the body can follow the dance as it prefers without necessarily compromising the final score. This, if on the one hand it gives the possibility to the smartest to cheat and score remarkable records even while sitting, on the other hand it allows anyone, from the merengue lover to the most wooden and impeded of players, to have fun in company and feel valued. While the tracking of the PS Eye camera is quite forgiving and simplistic, it works very well, while getting it right will always be a huge challenge. Deriving directly from the SingStar franchise, DanceStar Party inherits a very powerful tracklist, made up of a number of songs that are not exciting but also from a series of extremely well-known artists. They range from Duck Sauce to Rihanna, from Barry White to Usher, passing through Diana Ross, Chemical Bros and Lady Gaga, while a good number of unreleased songs can be purchased through an online store, exactly as has been the case for some time with SingStar. Too bad for a less substantial amount of initial content than one would have expected (we are talking about a dozen songs less than Just Dance 3), but the record deal empire in the hands of Sony could represent the future strength of what has all the cards on the table to become a new and strong musical brand on PlayStation 3 with the next iterations. By now a tradition of recent musical titles, each song has different levels of difficulty, different more or less elaborate choreographies and also two different versions, one shorter than the other to meet the needs and times of all players. Playstation 3 trophies Between one dance session and another, the player will be able to unlock a whole series of trophies linked above all to the score and the result obtained at the end of the song. Some of these encourage you to be more ~social~, sharing videos on Facebook and Twitter, while others, more original, require you to ~burn at least 200 kilocalories a week, for a month~. Dancing in style Graphically DanceStar Party presents itself in a rather anonymous way, far from the work done by Michael Jackson: The Experience in terms of characterization and stylistic choices, or by Dance Central 2 itself in terms of interface care; however, some may appreciate the possibility of enjoying the video of each song on the backdrop. Too bad for the absolutely zero sense of progression, since all the songs are unlocked from the beginning and there are no extras and tangible content that encourage you to move forward. Another interesting mode is the so-called Dance Creator, thanks to which you can record your performances thanks to PS Eye and Move, and then use them later in the game and propose new choreographies to your friends: it is already a very successful idea , but which has huge future potential in terms of user-generated content. At the moment you can take pictures or save game segments and then share them with friends or keep them in memory to review them later, but who knows that in the future, also based on user feedback and growth.mentions of the franchise, Sony decides not to give a dedicated and elaborate platform for sharing content between players. Social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are now seamlessly integrated within the title, giving everyone the opportunity to show their performance in seconds. Finally, last mentions for the inevitable multiplayer mode, which allows two friends at a time to challenge each other locally by freely customizing the type of choreography and the song to dance to.
