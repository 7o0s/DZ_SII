Suffice it to say that the Japanese Cave, one of the most active companies in the sector in question, offers a catalog made up of ~stuff~ such as DoDonPachi, Espgaluda II, Bug Princess and many others on smartphones and tablets. But there are several more or less famous teams that offer quality shooters: among these there are also the Slovaks of Art in Games, which almost 6 years after the first AirAttack are now launching a truly excellent sequel on the market, for less than one euro. AirAttack 2 is a must buy for any self-respecting shoot'em up fan You are a bomb AirAttack 2 has World War II as its setting, certainly not an original choice for this type of product. More generally, the title of Art in Games does not aim to reinvent the genre, but rather to guarantee a particularly high quality level in each of its elements. Nonetheless, there is no shortage of interesting gameplay solutions capable of offering an attractive experience even to those who have spent years dodging bullets of all types and sizes. Compared to other titles in which being hit is equivalent to instant death, in AirAttack 2 there is an energy bar, possibly to be filled thanks to rather rare bonuses to collect. This is obviously a solution that makes the level of difficulty less extreme than other similar products (such as Bullet Hell), thus making the game accessible not only to an audience of purists. The latter will still be able to obtain satisfactions from the secondary objectives of the various missions, the completion of which is in most cases anything but simple. The control system is the typical one adopted in these cases on touch screens, i.e. with automatic firing and management of the aircraft's movements delegated to finger movements. Added to this, however, is the ability to throw bombs on the ground, simply with a touch on the screen, in such a way as to be able to hit the positions and vehicles placed on the surface more effectively. In addition to this, bombs also allow you to destroy practically every building under your plane, from the smallest houses to large structures such as buildings, towers, factories, bridges and so on. This is not only an aesthetic and accessory element, since often these objectives are linked to secondary missions and in any case help to provide bonuses and coins with which to buy upgrades. The latter allow you to increase the capabilities of your aircraft (among the 5 total available) by adding wingmen, rockets, lasers, flamethrowers and the like; probably the most interesting bonus, however, is the one that temporarily allows you to switch to the tail turret in a first-person view, guaranteeing firepower and remarkable effectiveness destined to come in handy especially during the spectacular boss fights. All this is then enhanced by the technical component, which takes advantage of an excellent proprietary graphics engine to create completely polygonal settings with a high level of detail and great variety: it is not at all uncommon to lose concentration because you are busy observing the beauty of the scenarios and vehicles made by the Slovak software house, always alive, full of elements and enriched by a convincing dynamic lighting. Also noteworthy is the reproduction of the water, particularly realistic, and the orchestrated soundtrack composed of 30 tracks and very apt. Finally, it should be noted that Art in Games wanted to correct the main flaw of the first episode, i.e. the paucity of content: in this case, instead, there are 22 levels to which are added daily and weekly challenges with prizes, rankings and the possibility of chatting in game with your friends.", "date": "2015-12-28", "grade": "8.7"}
