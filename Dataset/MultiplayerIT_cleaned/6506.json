And who knows, maybe even the extremely similar name is not entirely a coincidence. Surely, however, Cooking Mama Limited, Japanese author and publisher of everything that revolves around the world of Mama, would like to monopolize the thoughts and wallets of younger or less committed players, proposing alongside the main series also various conceptually more or less connected spin-offs: this is actually the second foray of our cheerful housewife into the world of gardening and garden care, the first took place several years ago on Nintendo DS with certainly not bad results, but will it have gone like this in this case too? After the kitchen, Mama tries to enter your gardens too, but will she have a real green thumb? From producer to consumer Those of you who have read our very recent review of the latest Cooking Mama will undoubtedly remember how we complained, among other things, of a certain lack of cohesion between the various challenges, of something that could serve to link of them all the minigames and at the same time provide a basic structure to the game and a goal, albeit loose, to the player. Well, in the case of Gardening Mama: Forest Friends, this complaint cannot be made. You should know that outside Mama's kitchen there is a whole world to discover, to be precise a vegetable garden that gets bigger and bigger over time, a forest inhabited by cute anthropomorphic animals who, given the crisis, decide everyone to set up on their own and to open shops and restaurants, and to various destinations scattered here and there, reachable by the most varied public transport, where Mama's friends live, who won't stop breaking, that is, kindly asking for help, because in the gardening they have a lot of good will but are a little incompetent. The game is divided into days, as every good farmer knows, you get up early in the morning and go to bed already at sunset, and basically consists of planting various types of flora, whether they are flowers, vegetables, fruit or ornamental trees, take care of them day by day and finally collect them or obtain wood from them. You can do all this for the pure pleasure of doing it, or, and this is the goal we were talking about, to satisfy the requests of animal friends, who will show up from time to time to ask for a favor. Rabbit wants to be a florist? The flowers will ask them to you. Bear thinks he's a great chef and opens a restaurant? However, you have to give them the aubergines to put on the pizza. But your animal friends are not leeches who live off your work: in exchange for your services they will provide you with generous amounts of vouchers to be exchanged in the shop to purchase the most varied decorations and furnishings possible for the garden - which will always grow in proportion to how much work you do and how well the businesses you support are doing - so you can create the botanical garden of your dreams at will. How we get the seeds to plant remains to be clarified: certainly not by going to a shop and buying them, after all we are in a world where all commerce rests on your shoulders. Requests will arrive daily by post from various friends around the world, also gardeners, who will need help, for example, in picking aubergines or tomatoes, pruning dry branches, arranging flowers in vases and so on: these activities are solved, you will have understood it, in a classic stylus and touch screen mini-game. The reward for a job well done is the seed to be used in the garden, and the circle comes full circle. The 3D effect Stereoscopy is implemented without infamy and without praise. Above all, it is almost useless even for aesthetic purposes, given that everything on the upper screen is primarily in 2D (the 3D effect on polygonal elements is certainly much more spectacular), and above all it is practically invisible, given that all the The player's attention is focused on the other screen. Still, it's nice to know that it's there. Zero kilometre The first few days of the game are basically a detailed tutorial in which Mama explains all these elements to you, and actually at the beginning you are pleasantly surprised, almost overwhelmed by what seems like a huge amount of features and variety. But then you go on to manage everything yourself, and the knots come home to roost. The day-to-day gardening business, to begin with, although it's run through an inter comfortable and intuitive face, it is resolved in ways that soon become always the same and repetitive, given that everything is done with a simple touch of the stylus, something made even more bitter by the fact that in the prequel to cultivate a plant correctly, it was necessary to face the canonical mini-games, which also had something instructive. The cycle repeats itself always the same: checking the garden, planting, watering, watering, watering again until the plant is ripe, harvesting, cramming into the barn, satisfying the requests if necessary, and finally, but this is not even strictly necessary, wander around the shop to buy various embellishments. This phase is so tedious and not very varied that it soon loses interest, just as the sense of progression initially given by the enlargement of the garden and the possibility of embellishing it as one sees fit is soon lost. A real pity, because the basic idea was good and certainly served to give the whole a coherent and potentially exciting structure. And then all that remains is to turn to what has always been the beating heart of Mama's games, the minigames. These, as we said, depend on the letters that arrive day by day, but the title is never stingy in unlocking one or two per day until the fifty present in all are reached; obviously, once addressed, you can recall them whenever you want. Even here, however, things are not going very well: from a conceptual point of view there is a lot of variety, there are mini-games that involve simple manual dexterity, others eye-hand coordination, still others engage the reflexes and there is also some a good dose of strategy, but the same variety is not found in the test of facts, that is when you put the stylus on the touch screen, given that the gestures to be performed in the end are always the same and even those alternative controls present are missing in the minigames of the latest Cooking Mama, which also did not form the core. Compared to the latter, those of Gardening Mama are slightly more difficult, and only by obtaining the maximum score will you be rewarded with the coveted seeds, but the maximum score can also be obtained by calculating it on two successive attempts, as it should be having regard to the relevant public; also from a technical point of view we are probably a step below the main series, with the touch that does not always seem to respond properly. Just as the technical point of view in general reveals a minor cure: the polygonal rendering of the garden is good but very simple, everything else remains two-dimensional and if this is not a bad thing in itself, the scarcity of animations tends to reduce everything lively and cheerful aspect that should characterize these games. Even the sound is affected by a rather rose water commitment: the music is few and monotonous, the effects repetitive, and the speech, which has remained in English, seems to come out of an old rotary phone, in stark contrast to the clear and ringing one by Cooking Mama.", "date": "2015-03-11", "grade": "4.5"}
