But if you peeked at the vote at the bottom of this Xenoblade Chronicles 3 review, then you'll have understood that, in the end, we loved it. Tetsuya Takahashi's new role-playing game has a decidedly slower start than expected, but the Japanese director managed to make us syrup up to 45 minutes of consecutive dialogues in the unforgettable Xenogears of '98, so a minimum of confidence let's say that if the it is earned. Takahashi has this ability to go straight to the heart, to hide stories full of humanity behind a sci-fi anime patina that can only mislead those who judge a book by its cover. Xenoblade Chronicles 3, in fact, is an experience that stays inside, and will probably become one of your favorite JRPGs ever. In the next few lines we explain why Monolith Soft is a new masterpiece for Nintendo Switch. Explore Aionios Xenoblade Chronicles 3, the maps are really huge The problem lies entirely in those initial ten hours, which can even become twenty if you start exploring Aionios, retrace your steps, go look around in that cave over there or behind that little hill over there. The world of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is gigantic, but so vast that we were convinced it was a real open world until we reached the border that separates, with a not too long loading, the first region of the game from the adjacent one. What deceived us was the variety of biomes that characterizes each region: instead of dividing the world into multiple maps representing iconic scenarios such as the desert, snow-capped mountains, jungle and so on, Monolith Soft has chosen a much more interesting topography and multifaceted, which often develops both horizontally and vertically. The placement of monsters and collectibles is more reminiscent of Xenoblade Chronicles X for Wii U than the numbered titles in the series, with a tendency to use enemy level and aggression as an indicator of progression: the curious player can explore places they don't lead to. the main or side missions, but at your own risk, as there is no Game Over and defeat results in a return to the nearest checkpoint. The world of Aioionos is amazing in terms of level design and Monolith Soft has adjusted the exploration shot by completely discarding the environmental interaction dynamics of the second episode to embrace a bland metroidvania component, with movement skills such as climbing, running uphill or the rope slides which, once unlocked, allow you to reach previously inaccessible places. Thus, returning to explore the regions already crossed makes absolute sense, because there is always a container to find, an aether channel to absorb, a body to pass on, a rare enemy to defeat. As you continue in the main story, the areas become more and more complicated to navigate, but in this sense the game interface only helps relatively: Monolith has introduced a navigation system that indicates in real time the optimal path to follow until to a marker or objective, just like a GPS. Without a navigator, exploring Aionios would have been much more frustrating because the 2D map is really sparse, which is putting it mildly. It automatically records the locations of points of interest, camps and objectives and can be called up as an overlay while on the move, but it has practically no other features that would have come in handy with such a large world. Fast travel within the same map takes a couple of seconds at most, a few more if you move from one region to another, but the cumbersomeness of the system sometimes weighs down the experience, especially if you are dedicating yourself to resolution of side missions left pending, which sometimes make us go around the world even if only for a short dialogue. Xenoblade Chronicles 3, the world is full of rare enemies to defeat to find treasures and collectibles In this sense, Monolith Soft has taken a few steps forward compared to the long-winded secondary missions of Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Not that the objectives of these assignments have become particularly interesting, it is still about collecting objects, killing monsters, finding NPCs and reading dialogues, but the different unlocking dynamics and the fluency with which the missions are solved help to streamline a part of the RPG experience that few software houses manage to get right. Side missions in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 are unlocked simply by talking to charactersalready have the evergreen exclamation mark in the head, interacting with the question marks suitably marked on the map, or eavesdropping on other people's conversations. In the last case, an intermediate step is unlocked which establishes the narrative system of the secondary mission: in fact, the protagonists must be gathered around the table of a camp or a canteen and made them discuss the information learned, who can start additional missions or give points extra experience. Xenoblade Chronicles 3, discussing overheard information unlocks certain side missions Completing the side missions and the different NPC Cards - practically a list of collectibles to be found and delivered on the fly from a special screen - also improves the relationship between the six protagonists and the community on duty, which in turn unlocks new opportunities or bonuses. A feature of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 with which one must necessarily come to terms, in this regard, is the function of the colonies, practically the ~cities~ in which the soldiers of Agnus and Keves live. Distinguished by the aesthetics corresponding to the two kingdoms, the colonies all look a bit alike: they are basically tent cities dominated by the Ferronis on duty with his Chronoflame. On Aionios there are no real cities, not like Alcamoth or Torigoth, to mention two agglomerations of the previous games, even if the new title Monolith Soft reserves some surprises in this sense. We regret the lack of variety in urban scenarios a little, but it makes perfect sense in the economy of the narrative and gameplay. Fight for the future Xenoblade Chronicles 3, the combat system is intuitive but very rich In short, at the beginning it is as if Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is holding back and continuously hiding its muscles. The campaign too tends to be linear, having to bring together the six protagonists and then put them on the way to Pian di Spada, the gigantic weapon that stands out on the horizon and which would seem to hide the secret of a world trapped in a senseless cycle of war and violence . The impression, therefore, is that of following a precise trajectory, which makes Noah and the others take a tour of the colonies in search of potential allies to free from the yoke of the mysterious Moebius: from this point of view, the first bars of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 reminded us of the Dragon Quest formulas, where each city has a story to solve before the party can continue on its journey. In addition, the narrative also includes the combat system, which immediately becomes and the culmination of the series. Despite the amount of icons, wordings and abbreviations on the interface, the gameplay remains streamlined and intuitive, satisfactorily explained by short and concise tutorials that get straight to the point and remain accessible from the options screen. Xenoblade Chronicles 3, in the Soul Map you can upgrade the Uroboros However, the potential is beginning to be glimpsed almost immediately. As happened in the past, Monolith Soft leans towards a gradual distribution of mechanics and features. Thus, if initially you feel suffocated by the slowness of the reload times, as the story continues, new dynamics are unlocked that enrich the gameplay more and more. The Uroboros form itself is smarter than it looks. It is not only a window of invulnerability that allows you to inflict huge damage on the enemy, but also an emergency maneuver to save the dying characters, choosing whether to activate the transformation immediately, or risk a few more moments to load the Attunement with the Fusion techniques and therefore access the enhanced versions of the Uroboros Techniques. In this sense, the so-called Map of the soul allows you to develop the Uroboros by choosing the skills, bonuses and Techniques that are right for you: the small number of Points Souls that are earned by fighting forces you to choose the learning order carefully, although it is always possible to get into a corner to grind points at the right moment. Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Group Assault is your most powerful weapon against bosses Practically every dynamic of the combat system has a strategic aspect of some kind. At a certain point, the player must choose whether to ring in combos using up to six Techniques set on the Joy-Con face buttons, or whether to sacrifice extra damage to charge the indicators of Special Techniques and Group Assault. The latter is essentially a minigame of fundamental importance: understanding the Group Assault can be the difference between victory and defeat. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is not a difficult game and in any case it is possible to increasere or decrease the default difficulty level, but it can be challenging and some campaign bosses can give you a lot of trouble if you don't delve into the combat system. Monolith Soft has downsized the role of the Smash and Burst combos, which however remain very useful against the most powerful enemies: in fact, most rare monsters and bosses become enraged once they reach a certain percentage of life, changing almost all the schemes of attack. The sooner they break down the better. Xenoblade Chronicles 3, the protagonists can assume the Classes of Heroes A sort of Final Fantasy-style Job System that surprised us with its variety and versatility also contributes to the depth of an excellent combat system, which over time puts the player's positional skills and timing to the test. Initially this class system is limited to the six protagonists, who in practice can exchange roles and therefore weapons and Techniques... and even clothing. Each class unlocks specific techniques or passive skills at level up: some of them, called masterful, can be set by the character who has learned them even after he has changed class. It goes without saying that this intuitive dynamic is designed to better define individual roles, since different attack classes unlock completely different skills and techniques. This does not prevent you from attempting hybrid configurations, perhaps by making a character grow more roles and then assigning him Defender and Healer Skills and Techniques that guarantee him minimal autonomy in battle. Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Master is a Hero to be recruited who fights with a Gladius in the shape of a nunchaku The distribution of roles is one of the most important aspects, since the outcome of a battle revolves around the micromanagement of the Wrath, that is, the attention that the monster pays to one character rather than another. The matter becomes even more interesting with the addition of the Hero, practically a seventh character that the player cannot control, but who participates in the fight as if he were one of the six protagonists: he has his accessories, his gems and his Techniques set and non-replaceable that define its role and utility in battle. The most interesting aspect of the Heroes - who are recruited by completing the corresponding missions, often mandatory and sometimes optional - is that the six protagonists can take on their own classes, further expanding their personal library of Masterful Techniques and Abilities. Each heroic class is played in a completely different way from the others, and the variety of weapons and situations is enormous: ranging from Master, the healer who fights with nunchucks to Zeon, the typical sword and shield armed defender, passing through Juniper the archer and many others. Heroes and monsters Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Taion is one of the characters that develops the most throughout the story The Heroes are an element of the narrative that limps a hair because, despite being part of the story, once recruited they become an element of gameplay and, with a few exceptions such as for example the two adorable Nopons who accompany the protagonists everywhere, most of them no longer has relevant roles, except during their personal side-quests. The first hours of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 are therefore characterized by truly unusual narrative solutions, and one gets the feeling that Takahashi has not managed to optimally balance the novelty of the gameplay within the new story. In general, weighing on the experience of players who have completed the previous two Xenoblade Chronicles, is the almost complete absence of what we call ~world building~. The script doesn't explain why Gormotti and Alti Entia are together, why Miyo and Sena have nucleic crystals in their chests, how these soldiers materialize weapons from nothing that they call Gladius and so on. For those who have not played Xenoblade Chronicles 2 this will certainly be Arabic, but we assure you that for the fans these are aspects that matter, while it almost seems that Takahashi expects all players to take these references as fact, in a short circuit that works until a certain point. Xenoblade Chronicles 3, the direction of the kinematics is truly excellent Of course it's all part of a very specific plan since, just as the gameplay cards are gradually revealed, the narrative also takes a few hours to melt. By racing, and dedicating the bare minimum to exploration and side missions, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 can be completed in about seventy hours, but we estimate that it takes at least a hundred to see a bit of everything, unlock every Hero and class at max", "date": "2022-07-26", "grade": "9.2"}
