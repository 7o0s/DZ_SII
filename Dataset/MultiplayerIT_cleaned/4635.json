{"name": "Ship of Fools: la recensione del roguelite piratesco un po' manageriale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ship-of-fools-recensione.html", "text": "If a roguelite is done well, it can be understood by how many times you find yourself doing two in the morning to find out what is hidden behind a particularly challenging level or boss. This was our experience with Ship of Fools, a game that mixes streamlined naval combat with micro-managerial resource management, all with roguelite mechanics. Developed by Fika Productions and published by Team 17, Ship of Fools is perfect for having fun in company by lining up shipment after shipment in the hope of getting further and further. It is a roguelite, a type of game that differs from roguelikes in that dying does not mean losing any progress made. In fact, between one game and another, you can improve your equipment with the resources of the previous expedition and continue with the story. In this Ship of Fools review we will analyze how the developers have managed to build a unique and familiar experience thanks to their very personal way of mixing videogame genres. The result is a light-hearted adventure, but one that doesn't get boring even if at times a few drops of frustration have been felt. From Asphodel to Acquapocalisse The Stormstrider ship is the bulwark you'll need to defend in Ship of Fools to complete your expeditions If you enjoyed Hades, one of the best roguelites of recent years, then Ship of Fools will be a somewhat familiar experience handling some mechanics. As in the underworld of Greek mythology, you will meet merchants along your way who will be able to sell you items and resources. Similarly to Zagreus, you will also receive upgrades in the form of idols and statues to equip on your ship (in dedicated slots), but all this will be lost between one expedition and another when the storm sinks your ship and brings you back to land Indeed, in Ship of Fools, the world was plunged into a state of chaos when the great lighthouse that protected the Archipelago mysteriously broke down. Now a storm has populated the seas with evil creatures that make navigation impossible, it's the Aquapocalypse. The only ones brave enough to challenge monsters and hurricanes are the Folli (fools in English) who, with their ship, the Stormstrider, embark on very risky expeditions to find out what happened and try to put things right. The fools who challenge the sea Each Madman has a special ability available that affects combat or resource management Players will be able to take on the role of one of ten Crazy, anthropomorphic sea creatures, each with a unique characteristic. The first two that are available are Todd and Hink, the first has as a bonus skill greater speed in melee attacks, the second instead adds area damage to the projectiles of his cannons. Each of the other eight characters has a unique characteristic, but in order for them to join your crew you'll need to unlock them first. Some are hidden on islands, others are lost at sea and you will have to rescue them. There are skills of all kinds, from combat to resource management; therefore, there's really a lot of choice when it comes to customizing your play style. Another intriguing feature of Ship of Fools is that your characters cannot die. To determine the end of an expedition, in fact, is the sinking of the ship which occurs when the life points run out. The goal of the Fools is precisely to protect the Stormstrider with cannon shots and oars (for close combat) by shooting spiders, octopuses, mosquitoes and any other creature that wants to harm her. You will start with 5 life points and then gain more and more thanks to the tendrils (in English), the only object that survives between one expedition and another. With this currency you will be able to upgrade the health of the ship, the damage of the cannons and unlock some resources guaranteed at the start of each run such as coins or harpoons. These items are essential to survive the fury of the seas: the former allow you to buy upgrades from merchants while the latter are used to collect the resources that enemies drop into the sea. Co-op and solitary Ship of Fools is at its best in couch co-op to share the joys of passing a level or the frustration of sinking Ship of Fools is designed to be a couch co-op game (but there's also online multiplayer) in which two people take on the seas of the archipelago by communicating the threats they spot and taking turns reloading the cannons. Played like this, the title gives its best because the overcoming of each level and the frustration of each sinking are shared and do nothing but encourage those who play to make pstart another run. The best strategy is to take care of each side of the Stormstrider by keeping an eye on the bridge and deciding on the fly who is in charge of hitting the many creatures that will try to board you. However, lonely sea dogs have nothing to fear: this title can be tackled comfortably in single player thanks to the addition of a robot turret to your arsenal. You'll still have to reload her but she'll take care of the many enemies that you can't face. In solo, however, it becomes slightly more difficult to manage special ammunition precisely because of the automatic turret. Sometimes, by breaking crates or buying them from a merchant, you can get special ammunition for your guns (piercing, incendiary and much more) the problem is that if you decide to load them into the automatic turret, she will shoot them at will instead of focusing on the more dangerous enemies. Luckily the cannons can be moved from one side of the boat to the other so the strategy we used was to load the hand cannon with the special ammo and leave the automatic with the standard. Sailing like on the high seas The map from which to select levels of Ship of Fools is one of its most original and fun innovations One of the most unique features of Ship of Fools is its level selection within each expedition. Like true sailors, at the beginning of your game you will be presented with a map containing many small hexagons. From where you are (and this applies to each passage from one level to another) you can choose whether to go forward, diagonally downwards or diagonally upwards. Each hexagon also has an icon that indicates the reward you can get for completing that level, just like the gates of Hades. There are coins, harpoons, vines, wooden planks to recover life points, chests containing random resources or merchants to buy upgrades. Beware of the storm though, every 3 levels your options will start to shrink and more and more white hexagons will disappear. If the next level is represented by a black tile with a skull above it, it means that you have reached the first boss and in these battles the sea does not forgive. This bad guy (let's not spoil the others because their discovery is the lifeblood of every roguelite) is a dangerous kraken that will attack your ship trying to sink it. Better not waste time shooting him, when you see an exclamation mark near a tentacle, approach it and push it away with a flurry of oar strokes. As in Hades, the first boss is the real obstacle to understanding and progressing the game, once the kraken is overcome, the whole experience becomes more fluid and the evolution of the ship and armaments harmonizes more and more.", "date": "2022-11-23", "grade": "7.5"}
