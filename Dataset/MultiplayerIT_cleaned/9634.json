Also for this reason, the update is available for free for those who already own the game on other platforms. What we have found in our hands is therefore a product that is in some ways more refined and slightly enriched: by completing the campaign it is possible to unlock a small different challenge modes depending on the platform (Vykkers Labs on Xbox, Toby's Escape on PC and PlayStation). Reasons enough to recommend the purchase even to those who had given up in the first place? Let's find out in the Oddworld: Soulstorm Enhanced Edition review. History Oddworld: Soulstorm Enhanced Edition, the touching encounter between Abe and a dying Mudokon Undoubtedly the most successful and interesting aspect of this remake, thanks to the excellent quality of the masterfully directed CG sequences, as indeed we also underlined in the first review of Oddworld: Soulstorm, the story of the game reinterprets the events of the original Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus using a dark and dramatic tone, which is evident from the very beginning. The opening sequence sees a train heading at high speed towards the RaptureFarms, chased by a group of drones that shoot at it. The Mudokons who hijacked it are desperate and call out to Abe, who travels with them and who apparently coordinated the operation, but seems fatally distracted by the mysterious object he is holding in his lap. Oddworld: Soulstorm Enhanced Edition, the seer of the Mudokon tribe warns Abe of the imminent danger How did that explosive situation come about? After the events of Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!, Abe had managed to free the Mudokons from the Glukkons' captivity and lead them to a safe place... until then. The hero is reluctant to accept the role of guide and example for his people but, as the seer of the tribe tells him, time is running out and he cannot afford uncertainties. Just then the hiding place is discovered by the enemies and ends in flames, forcing the protagonist of the adventure and his companions to flee in a disorderly manner. Abe still isn't clear on his role, but an encounter with a dying Mudokon, who has crossed the desert with a serious wound only to deliver him a special item, makes him realize that he must put aside his doubts and fight. Gameplay Oddworld: Soulstorm Enhanced Edition, Abe being followed by some Mudokons in one of the campaign scenarios The gameplay of Oddworld: Soulstorm has clearly not changed in this Enhanced Edition and still relies heavily on a trial & error approach which is fortunately supported by an abundance of checkpoints. The protagonist must jump, climb, move silently in the presence of enemies, solve environmental puzzles using his song or his companions, as well as collect resources to be used individually or combined thanks to a simple crafting system. the central point lies in the cumbersomeness of Abe's movements, as well as in the slowness and imprecision of his interactions with the scenario, as opposed to situations in which promptness and speed are required, on pain of death. Not being able to revisit this philosophy from scratch, the developers have tried in some way to mitigate the degree of challenge and therefore make some sections less punitive: a bit like putting a plaster on an open wound, but so be it. In fact, the problem remains and is quite evident: often the commands do not respond as they should, giving rise to largely undeserved game overs, because the character is asked to perform actions that clash with his limited mobility. What you see on the screen is precisely the contrast between a new action concept for the series and a system that cannot satisfy these demands, if not paying a high price in terms of frustration. Fortunately, as mentioned, some things have been improved with the Enhanced Edition: sequences that previously seemed really difficult can now count on lower damage or more humane timing, and even the fellow Mudokons at our orders have become more cunning. Likewise, the annoying blocks of some enemies in their patrols have largely been resolved. Of course, it would have been nice to see an improvement in interactions as well. Contents Oddworld: Soulstorm Enhanced Edition, one of the sequences in which you have to protect the Mudokosno In terms of content there is little to reproach Oddworld: Soulstorm Enhanced Edition, if we consider that the fifteen (plus two) levels of the campaign require at least twenty hours to complete and there are four different endings, which are unlocked in based on the number of surviving Mudokons at the end of each mission. fans of the series will no doubt remember. The duration of this extra content is rather short, so much so that it lends itself well to speedruns but expresses the trial & error philosophy that we find within the campaign with even greater conviction. Graphics and sound Oddworld: Soulstorm Enhanced Edition, Abe looks at us dejected The graphics of this new version of Oddworld: Soulstorm have obviously not changed compared to what we saw in April, but the technical realization is also one of the aspects that the developers have tried to refine, going above all to eliminate the frame rate uncertainties that were noticeable at launch. On Xbox Series S we encountered a few too many stutters which, however, should have been fixed with the day one patch. In general, we move between ups and downs: the CG sequences are really beautiful, as mentioned, while the quality of the scenarios is a bit fluctuating: some appear suggestive, others a bit too generic and sometimes dirty in the textures. Nothing to say instead about the style of the characters, well characterized, while the musical accompaniment is confirmed as pleasant but essential.", "date": "2021-12-01", "grade": "7.5"}
