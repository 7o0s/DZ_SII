{"name": "Grand Theft Auto III", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grand-theft-auto-iii.html", "text": "Many times there has been talk of games that are technically beautiful but poor in gameplay because they are limited or too restrictive in terms of freedom of action. With GTA III you won't have these problems and I don't think I'm exaggerating by saying that perhaps it's the game that comes closest to the concept of absolute freedom that videogamers have been pursuing for a long time. In case you get tired of the main missions (which still follow a fixed storyline) and you feel like doing something else, the only thing I can tell you is: do it! You can really let your fantasies run wild and do everything you can never do in real life (unless you want to spend the rest of your days in jail): steal a car and run over pedestrians, shoot people, take beat up a defenseless old lady, practice sniping with a sniper rifle (if you have recovered it), steal a taxi and drive people around, cause a serious accident and, when the ambulance arrives, steal it and then throw it into the sea. The only limit will be your imagination! You can even take on board one of the many ~fireflies~ that you can find along the sidewalks of the city at night and take it to a secluded place to ... um ... let's change the subject. Naturally, the more crimes you commit, the more you will be hunted down by the police, so you will have to pay close attention to the star-shaped indicators which gradually light up as the number of criminal acts increases: it will be enough to light up four of them to even call in the police helicopters ( but later the special forces with tanks will also arrive!). The impression that all this can give you is that of being faced with a real city, also because the programmers have given their best to recreate the life and situations common to each inhabited center. In the course of your actions you will often stop just to admire the incredible level of realism achieved: dozens of people walking on the sidewalks, a lot of cars on the street, even the rubbish on the ground that rolls when the wind picks up, variable weather conditions (there is also fog) and damage to the cars. But none of this could seem true without an artificial intelligence that makes everything behave and react as if it were plausible and from this point of view the game is really appreciable; People interact with each other and with the surrounding environment in a convincing way; try to beat up the citizens and you'll notice that their reactions can be multiple: someone will reciprocate your gesture (and if there are many people around you can even get into a fight), others instead will run away. Naturally, all of this also involves the evolution of your ~career~ as criminals: do something offensive towards some clans and they will turn against you, even getting you shot as soon as you set foot in the areas they control. Naturally, for an even more credible rendering, an adequate development of the more technical sides of the game cannot be missing and, even here, there is nothing to complain about. The engine sends a considerable number of polygons to video, in the form of complex buildings, pedestrians and vehicles (and, of course, your character is not missing), covered with valuable textures and a good variety, without accusing major problems, if not one frame rate abundantly below fifty fps (which in any case does not excessively affect the final yield). Instead, we could talk for a long time about the sound that will surely make all game buyers happy. Just think that every car has a radio inside that you can tune into the frequencies of the nine radios that broadcast music in Liberty City. In total there are over three hours of music that ranges from all genres (there's even classical music!) and there's no shortage of advertising breaks either. Add in sound effects that underscore any action you take and all the fully spoken character commentary (although the localization is limited to subtitles there are hilarious Sicilian phrases spoken by the mobsters!) and you have an idea of what to expect. What else to add? After the partial disappointment of the second episode of the series, DMA Design redeem themselves with a title that, albeit with some flaws (first of all the not exceptional frame rate), cannot be missing in the playroom of every self-respecting gamer! Definitely one of the funniest games released in recent years! Pros: Hilarious! Extreme freedom of action Superb sound Cons:Frame rate not exceptionalSpeech is not in Italian Site hosted on GTA III Liberty City is a city like many others: it has its neighborhoods, buildings and people who go about their lives. As in any self-respecting metropolis, alongside the population that respects the laws and earns an honest living there is the so-called ~scum~, the bad part, made up of petty criminals, drug dealers, thieves, mafiosi, etc., etc. In this case we are faced with a city controlled by seven rival gangs: ranging from the Mafia to the Yakuza, passing through the Colombian clan, the Hispanic clan and so on. Needless to say, these clans vie for absolute power over Liberty City through shootings, murders, and so on. In the midst of all this is your alter ego: young, fresh out of prison and eager to get his hands on everything a city can offer to a gangster with big ambitions. At the beginning of the game a friend of yours will make you sympathize with one of the clans present in the city and from that moment on you will have to carry out tasks that will lead you to carry out all kinds of known criminal acts: in general it will be a matter of killing some individual targeted by your clan and other ~tasks~ of the kind, but the variety is not lacking and don't be surprised if in some missions you find yourself having to collect the ~pizzo~ from some shopkeeper, or having to drive a fireball (obviously stolen!) in a clandestine race. In other situations you will have to take into account the time since you will need to be in a certain place at a certain time (remember that each day lasts about thirty minutes in the game). The various assignments will take you to explore Liberty City and here applause goes to the programmers for their efforts to recreate such a large city: it is in fact made up of three main areas, respectively Portland (the industrial area), Staunton Island (the shopping precinct) and Shoreside Vale (the suburban area). The three parts are really huge and before you can fully explore them it will surely be a lot of time.", "date": "2001-11-13", "grade": null}
