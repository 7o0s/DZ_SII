{"name": "Crimsonland", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/146778-crimsonland-profondo-rosso.html", "text": "Originally conceived for PC (2003) and released as a remake last summer on PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4 and Steam, Crimsonland, an old-school top-down shooter that winks at historical titles such as Smash TV, Robotron : 2084 and Alien Breed, arrives several months late also on PlayStation 3, on the strength of the so-called ~Cross Buy~ between the three Sony platforms, although, at least with our print code, the title can still be purchased on the PlayStation Store. Despite the curious shift forward, the work developed by 10tons Ltd is presented in the same form that we have already reviewed on PlayStation Vita, with the same contents present in all other versions. The only tangible advantages compared to the iteration on the powerful Japanese laptop are the undoubted convenience of the evergreen DualShock 3 and, above all, the ability to enjoy a generous screen, given that the too small sprites of enemies and protagonist gave more than a few headaches on the PlayStation Vita panel. After completing it and having tested all its modes, these are our impressions. 10tons Ltd also brings its vintage-inspired shooter to PlayStation 3 Elle as a lake of blood As happened in many of the similar titles of the past, Crimsonland does not have a plot, and its beefy protagonist does not have a name: the only thing we know is that our ~space marine~ is isolated on a tremendously hostile planet , which regurgitates all sorts of monstrosities to put an end to its survival ambitions. Unlike the more classic scrolling shooters, various RPG elements also flow into the 10tons Ltd work, given that in the so-called Quest mode, a sort of main campaign, in addition to numerous new weapons, it is also possible to unlock an infinite number of Perks, to be exploited in the so-called Survival mode, in turn divided into six different sub-modes (also to be unlocked) and characterized by online rankings. The campaign, playable both in single and in local cooperative, up to a maximum of four players, offers sixty levels that can be tackled in three different difficulties, two of which must be conquered after finishing the first rush on normal. We must underline that the level design is rather flat, given that all the stages are nothing more than plains without physical obstacles, with the exception of the nests where some enemies are born, and a certain basic repetitiveness is already felt after finishing the very first chapters, all characterized by ten levels and the inevitable final boss to defeat. Unfortunately, even the variety of the bestiary doesn't help, given that between zombies, overgrown lizards, bizarre aliens and a handful of genetically modified arachnids and insects, no fantasy or artistic flair emerges, also bearing in mind that some new species have been introduced precisely with the remake from last summer. The main purpose of the game is to resist the various waves of monsters, capable of literally suffocating the player by flooding the entire TV screen, according to circumvention and encirclement schemes that vary from species to species. To get the better of the bloodthirsty horde, whose progressive demise is marked by a convenient indicator placed at the top of the screen, our hero has a respectable arsenal, which must be unlocked with patience by overcoming all sixty levels. It starts from the simple pistol and goes up to lethal ion miniguns, passing through plasma cannons, rocket launchers of various types, shotguns, flamethrowers, assault rifles and so on, whose effectiveness varies according to the situations: in fact it goes considering that, at least in Quest mode, the weapons (thirty in all) are released in a completely random way from the killed monsters, and sometimes the overwhelming number of enemies makes some levels extremely frustrating and unbalanced, since it is not always possible to get your hands on a suitable fire mouth. In addition to the copious arsenal, various bonuses that appear on the map from time to time, also released by killed enemies, help the protagonist: from the triple shot to the tactical nuclear bomb, passing through rapid fire, bonuses that slow down time, increase speed or freeze enemies, these tools become fundamental in the economy of Crimsonland, since they disappear from the screen rather quickly and the player must always manage his movements carefully. Wrong aiming a couple of times at the wrong time, in fact, means being overwhelmed by enemies and being killed in a few moments. The control system is quite responsive, and uses the left analog stick to move, the right to takeaim and triggers to fire; the L1/R1 keys to reload weapons are practically useless, given that in the vast majority of occasions it is preferable to empty a magazine and wait for automatic reloading. The possibility of using a generous screen and the comfortable DualShock 3 make the experience much more satisfying than the discreet one for PlayStation Vita, especially when you can play in the company of three friends sitting on the same sofa. Unfortunately there is no online co-op mode. Survival mode, as specified, offers six different types of game, more or less fun depending on the rules introduced by the developers: in the classic Survival you simply have to survive progressive waves of enemies, and every time you level up you can equip one of the Perks unlocked in Quest mode (some catalyze the physical characteristics of the hero, others increase the score, allow you to use the desired weapon and much more). In Rush you must survive a single, impressive wave of enemies, equipped only with the trusty assault rifle (a replica of the classic AK-47 Kalashnikov); in Weapon Picker the weapons appear randomly on the map, and it is possible to use only one magazine for each of them, forcing the passage from one weapon to another to get the better of the monsters; in Nukefism there are no weapons available to counter the enemies, but you can only kill them through the bonuses scattered throughout the level, while in Blitz, which is unlocked only after finishing the Quest mode, the matches have a higher speed and you can draw on all Perks and previously unlocked weapons. Despite the basic repetitiveness, the title is still enjoyable and fun, pushing the player to constantly improve thanks to the leaderboard, moreover Crimsonland offers an old school hardcore challenge, which will be appreciated by fans. Longevity, for the Quest mode, at the normal level is around three hours (including repeated attempts), while the Survival with its rankings, the six types of game and the constant drive to improve the scores, can keep you busy for a long time . From a purely technical point of view, the title 10tons Ltd does not squeeze the previous Sony flagship, mixing two-dimensional elements and simple 3D models, well animated but as mentioned not too varied from an artistic point of view. Spectacular, however, the number that they can reach on screen, and even more impressive is the lake of blood and dismembered bodies that will cover almost the entire playing area at the end of each level. It is a pity that the settings of the various chapters do not differ significantly from each other, given that they are all flat and with simple chromatic variations between prairies, desert, rocky and volcanic habitats. The sound effects are discreet, thanks to vintage-flavored samples, while the ~metalhead~ soundtrack is rather repetitive but still suitable for clashes.", "date": "2015-03-18", "grade": "6.5"}
