And so in the darkest and most terrible moment, when cities are invaded by a horde of zombies, vampires and werewolves, a scientist decides to use his most important creation, the time machine, to give the world hope. Point the device at different historical eras and project characters such as Abraham Lincoln, Cleopatra, Napoleon Bonaparte, Queen Elizabeth I, Julius Caesar, Nikola Tesla, the Pirate Blackbeard, Leonardo da Vinci, Joan of Arc and others into the present: a handful of heroes ready to confront modern technology and embark on a battle to decide the fate of the planet, strengthened by a second chance that they do not intend to waste in any way. This is the incipit of Second Chance Heroes, the action game developed by Rocket City Studios for iOS devices and currently ~in competition~ on Steam Greenlight for a possible landing on PC as well. Using an isometric view and a gameplay that draws substantially on the tradition of ~twin analog shooters~, the game offers twenty-six levels characterized by different settings and situations, in which, however, our objective always remains, fundamentally, the same: eliminate all the enemies and move on to the next area. Second Chance Heroes is a quality, solid action game with an intriguing starting idea One and triune The Second Chance Heroes campaign can be tackled in single player or in cooperative online multiplayer mode, for up to three participants through the lobby mechanism. Each player selects two characters who can alternate at any time, by simply pressing a button, and who each have a vital energy bar and unique skills, ranging from the default weapon to special maneuvers. The first two available heroes, Abraham Lincoln and Cleopatra, attack respectively with a powerful chainsaw and ranged spells, while for example the pirate Blackbeard slices his opponents with two huge sabers. Unlocking the characters requires a certain amount of gold coins, which are earned (slowly) by playing or by making some in-app purchases. The classification of the various Lincolns, Joan of Arc, Napoleon etc. owes a lot to MOBAs, with their ~ranged~, ~tank~, ~rogue~ and so on categories, even if in this case the strategy gives way to pure action, with just a few simple environmental puzzles as a variant, while avatar control takes place via two virtual sticks that move the character and direct its attack, as well as additional buttons for the rechargeable specials. It only takes a few minutes to appreciate the solidity of the experience offered by Second Chance Heroes, definitely above the average for mobile productions. Of course, there are some uncertainties, above all an often questionable collision detection, which we hope will be fixed through an update, but in principle the game is all there, fun and engaging; also thanks to a respectable technical sector, strong in fluid and stylish graphics, as well as a rock accompaniment finally able to show a pinch of personality.", "date": "2014-03-10", "grade": "8.2"}
