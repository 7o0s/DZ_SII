{"name": "Uno contro tutti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/137537-hyrule-warriors-uno-contro-tutti.html", "text": "It is difficult to think that two worlds as distant as that of The Legend of Zelda and the musou can really mix, amalgamate, find points of contact to finally give life to a title that maintains the flavor of both without making havoc of the original ingredients. And to tell the truth, the reality is quite far from this utopian and ideal balance between the two sources of this crossover: Hyrule Warriors is in fact, in essence, a ~reskin~ of a Dynasty Warriors with the characters and settings of the Nintendo saga , a full-fledged musou as expressly requested by none other than Miyamoto himself. A situation that lays the foundations in practice for an authentic watershed among those who have doubts regarding the purchase of the Tecmo Koei production: those who have never loved the type of gameplay that the Omega Force team has been offering for over fourteen years now ( !!!), since the very distant Dynasty Warriors 2 for PlayStation 2 dated 2000, can easily turn away. Because there's no Link or Zelda that holds: here you just beat hard. Almost. Good night and good beating Hyrule Warriors is developed by Omega Force in collaboration with Team Ninja (and under the supervision of Nintendo obviously) keeping largely unchanged the substance of the gameplay of the aforementioned musou: in a nutshell, it is therefore a large-scale fighting game in which the main purpose is to defeat entire armies made up of thousands of enemies by directly controlling a single character. And what does all this have to do with the world of Zelda? Little without a doubt, and in fact it is no coincidence that Hyrule Warriors takes place in a parallel universe to that of the main Nintendo timeline (Aonuma compared it in this sense to The Avengers), with situations and plots that have no real connections beyond beyond the very boundaries of the game in question. And fortunately, we would dare to say: in fact, the narrative plot, which one would bet was not conceived within the walls of the Kyoto company, has such a thin and impalpable thickness that it soon becomes negligible, if not cloying. Everything revolves around the fight between the inhabitants of Hyrule and the witch Cia, who falls in love with Link and is jealous of the latter's relationship with Princess Zelda. Hence the decision to plunge the kingdom into chaos by invading it with an entire army of evil creatures. The rest flows between sequences, static or animated, characterized by very banal situations and dialogues that are often surreal in their emptiness, with characters that are never even minimally developed in a way worthy of the name. Although Hyrule Warriors is certainly not a type of game from which it is correct to expect particular quality in these respects, it is equally true that given the goodness and potential of the material from which it was drawn, something more could be done. Patience, because all in all it is in the gameplay that the Tecmo Koei production should show the greatest substance; and fortunately in fact from this point of view the situation is better, clearly demonstrating the extraordinary experience gained by Omega Force over the years. It doesn't take much to become familiar with the controls of Hyrule Warriors: the two keys for light and strong attacks through which to create combos and the one for dodging are the cornerstones on which to build your victories by eliminating enemies of all sizes. Then there is a key to hook the strongest opponents, as per tradition for the three-dimensional Zelda episodes, which helps a lot considering the modest quality of the virtual camera. Instead, almost useless, at least according to our experience, the parry, completely replaceable with the much more effective already mentioned dodging. The circle is closed by the special move, available by loading a special bar, and the Spell, linked to another bar and which allows for a short time to perform stronger and faster attacks while suffering less damage. Those who already know the musou will understand that Hyrule Warriors certainly cannot be defined as a fighting game supported by a particularly technical combat system: the needle of the balance is moved rather on the spectacularity of the action, on the absurdity above the lines of enormously unbalanced clashes in which the hero manages to defeat thousands of enemies. This simplicity, thanks to the very little artificial intelligence of the opponents, inevitably translates into a lack of depth, which is highlighted and underlined over the hours, determining the inevitable appearance of a significant underlying repetitiveness. Situation only partially mitigated by the structure and development of the missions, which despite the obvious differences case egIf so, they almost always result in the player requesting the same actions. In practice, the large settings that stage the events present the two (or three in some cases) armies deployed on the battlefield; usually the opposing forces are already in possession of most of the territory, and it is up to the player to try to gain space for his men. This occurs by taking possession of outposts and garrisons, which are essentially open areas (in the first case) or closed rooms (in the second) distinguished by the presence of a kind of totem. By defeating the head of the garrison or of the outpost, he takes possession of it, with the totem that takes on the blue color, generating soldiers from his own army and thus strengthening its ranks. In addition to this, in most cases you find yourself having to defend the base, to escort a character or avoid his death, or finally to eliminate a specific opponent. Hyrule Warriors brings with it the strengths and weaknesses of the musou, but in the world of Zelda everything seems more beautiful A caress in a fist The Legend mode basically flows like this through eighteen levels, with settings taken from the locations of Ocarina of Time, Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess; considering that it takes from 20 minutes to half an hour for each level on the normal difficulty level (there are 4 in total), it takes little to understand that it takes roughly between seven and nine hours to watch the final sequence. Fortunately it is in the variety of usable characters and in the interesting development system of the same that Hyrule Warriors finds new life and interest: in fact there are thirteen, almost all faces known to fans of The Legend of Zelda, and each of them equipped with a peculiar system combat and unique features. They might seem few considering the eighty present in Dynasty Warriors 8, but the wide range of moves and the numerous different weapons that each of them can use actually multiplies the available variants. The Bazaar then allows you to buy, by spending rupees and materials collected in battle, new attack or defense skills, improve weapons by merging them together or even increase the level of individual characters. In this way Hyrule Warriors tries to make up for the limitations of the gameplay with the amount of content, which in fact is truly remarkable: just think of the Adventure mode, definitely not only catalogable as a simple secondary option, but on the contrary robust to the point of guaranteeing at least as many hours of gameplay as in Legend mode. No plot in this case, but a series of missions arranged within a grid that in appearance recalls the overworld of the original The Legend of Zelda for NES. Each box allows access to a mission, which can generally be completed in a few minutes and with a specific objective or with precise conditions and limitations. Success is then evaluated and awarded with a medal, which allows both to proceed within the grid and to obtain prizes of various kinds. Among these, even some cards (candle, compass, bombs, bracelet) that can be spent in the grid itself to discover further and even more interesting secrets to unlock, such as some characters and weapons that can only be obtained through the Adventure mode. The playful offer is completed by the Free and Challenge modes, which offer further variations of what is in any case the main theme of the continuous and repeated ~farming~ of objects, weapons, materials, rupees and experience, through which to bring one's characters to the maximum possible level. Hyrule Warriors therefore certainly cannot be said to lack the amount of content, even more so considering the good intentions in this sense of Omega Force with regard to the release of extra packages and paid DLC after the launch in stores. As far as quality is concerned, here the discussion gets a little more complicated: if we have already said of the innate (for the genre) scarce refinement of the combat system and the inevitable repetitiveness of the action, it is also in the graphic component that the work of Omega Force can be defined as non-homogeneous. In fact, while the characters generally enjoy a convincing modeling, with an excellent level of detail and more than fair animations, even if in some cases a little wooden, the settings can be defined as good at best, while at worst they offer glimpses at the level of previous generation of consoles. The architecture of the structures is in fact far too squared and simplistic, with empty and bare rooms that often resemble each other and poorly defined textures; a greater variety and a curesuperior in this sense would have helped to make the exploration of the game areas more pleasant, which on the contrary are only very rarely able to gratify the eye. Even technical defects, such as interpenetration of polygons and the pop-in of some elements of the scenario at a short distance, give the idea of a heavily unbalanced title from a graphic point of view: very pleasant if not spectacular if observed ~closely~, perhaps when your character gets rid of a hundred enemies with a special blow, considerably more objectionable instead looking away. From a purely stylistic point of view then, it is impossible to deny the gap between the ~made in Nintendo~ characters and those created from scratch for the occasion, decidedly of a completely different thickness. The exploitation of some elements of the Zelda series can also be improved: for example, it is possible to obtain, hidden in the iconic chests with a lot of relative music during their opening, a series of ~typical~ objects such as bombs, the boomerang, the bow, the grappling hook, but their exploitation is a bit superficial, linked to precise predefined moments mostly during the clashes with the Bosses. Even the soundtrack lives with difficulty in the mix between the songs taken from the Nintendo series, now authentic classics in the history of video games, alongside the banal and very forgettable rock songs with 80s guitars that are instead distinctive of the Omega Force titles. Also noteworthy is the two-player multiplayer, which allows you to tackle any mode present in co-op, with one player following the action on the TV while the other uses the GamePad screen. Functional certainly, but with a significant impact on frame rate and resolution due to the need for the console to render two images simultaneously. Completely absent, on the other hand, online, with the exception of integration with Miiverse and an accessory function in Adventure mode.", "date": "2014-09-17", "grade": "7.6"}
