Ubisoft has understood this well, for example, and rather than soiling the exceptional work done with Rayman: Legends, it has preferred to present iOS users with a running game created ad-hoc to be played via touchscreen. With Joe Danger Touch, the Hello Games team has practically followed an identical philosophy, putting aside any attempt to replicate the mechanics of the appreciated console chapters and instead developing a game that is simpler, but also more suitable for the platform thanks to a gameplay entirely based on tactile inputs. As with Rayman: Jungle Run, never could a decision have been more apt in this case. It's me! Joe! After a few games it becomes clear that one of Hello Games' goals was to expand its successful franchise to a wider audience, without however displeasing those who appreciated Joe Danger and Joe Danger 2: The Movie. At the base the aim of the game remains substantially the same, with the player who between loops, ramps and obstacles must reach the end of each level by accumulating as many points as possible. To change the cards on the table, however, there is the impossibility of increasing or decreasing the speed, with the result that Joe Danger Touch focuses less on performing spectacular stunts and is much closer to a classic running game. The first few levels introduce you to the simplest inputs predictably, with the simple ability to jump or crouch through the press of a finger on the screen. A rather slow start, but that within a few challenges gives way to much faster and more frenetic action: in the slightly more advanced levels the user's fingers jump from one point to another on the touchscreen to collect the extra items or disable obstacles, swipe around to change lanes or perform some tricks in the air. The result is a game faithful to its roots but able to offer a very different feeling, perhaps less thought out but certainly faster, more practical and immediate. The quantity and variety of content make it difficult to get tired: dozens and dozens of levels of increasing difficulty lead you to go through different environments, while the coins collected can be used to buy alternative characters, each of which has particular bonuses. Here perhaps the only real note of the entire game should be made, since, although all the avatars can be unlocked without resorting to in-app purchases, the score multipliers reserved for some of them make it possible to aim for the top of the online leaderboards only and exclusively after spending a few hours unlocking the expensive Golden Joe. To encourage you to play and replay the various levels, the English team of Hello Games have adopted the classic medal system, which can be unlocked by finishing each challenge within a certain time, collecting all the coins along the way or touching the hidden stars in the scenario. Collecting the letters that make up the word DANGER is another way to multiply your score, while traditional solo challenges are combined with intense one-on-one speed competitions. Those who have played the chapters on PSN and XBLA know well that one of the strengths of the series is the union of a very pleasant cartoon style and bright graphics, and it is nice to see that the team led by Sean Murray wanted to keep it on tablets and smartphones the same visual impact. Each path is colorful and lively, with the backdrops exploding with small details and side elements: we certainly would have preferred a greater variety and thematic differentiation between the settings of the various chapters, but at least the graphic exuberance of the game ensures that there is not even an aesthetically sparse or subdued level. Once again the graphic style and aesthetic taste inherit as much as possible from the Nintendo school, both in the scenarios and in the protagonist: with his helmet, cape and distinctive colors, Joe is an absolutely unique character full of personality, further enriched by nice animations and funny vocal exclamations. But between cubes in the desert, hills with eyes and pipes to cross on your motorbike, you lose count of the indirect contaminations of Mario's company.", "date": "2013-01-18", "grade": "8.7"}
