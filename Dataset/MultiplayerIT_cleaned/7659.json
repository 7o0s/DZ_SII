The innovations in terms of gameplay were in fact very few and the game, however fun and spectacular, limited itself to re-proposing the formula of the previous chapters, while making everything available at a decidedly popular price. The curiosity with respect to Asphalt 8: Airborne was therefore a lot, and we can safely say that we were amazed by what the developers of the French house have managed to invent to refresh the franchise. In a word: fly. We know that Asphalt has always been an arcade racer, but in this case the introduction of ramps and different height levels for the tracks makes the difference and allows us to perform high-impact aerial acrobatics, jump from one point to another track and access shortcuts that would not normally be within our reach. This type of mechanic naturally requires a careful and multifaceted level design, and this requirement has been fully satisfied: the nine locations present (including Nevada, Iceland, Tokyo and even Venice), which can also be tackled in mirror mode, they are full of crossroads, bridges, more or less hidden passages that can give us an advantage over our opponents or, conversely, slow down our run. Not bad: as per tradition, in the game any spectacular maneuver (whether it's a simple drift or a jump) fills up the important nitro bar, and it is thanks to frequent and careful use of the boost that we will be able to cut the finish line first. Asphalt 8: Airborne represents the perfect sequel, able to enrich an already proven formula ...you go, you go, you go! However, the first novelty that catches the eye in Asphalt 8: Airborne is not the question of jumps, levels and shortcuts, but the splendid graphical interface, completely redesigned and now incredibly stylish and in step with the times. In fact, on the left side of the screen we can view our car, while the right side scrolls vertically with the various modes, always giving us a precise projection of our progress within a career that has never been so full-bodied, made up of eight different seasons for a total of one hundred and eighty individual events. To the type of race that we already knew, moreover, new ones have been added, namely the Slalom and the Infection, which therefore go alongside the inevitable one-on-one, elimination and so on. In short, there is a great deal of substance and just as much variety of situations, within a structure which, if at the beginning seems like an in-app purchase fair (the main screen almost looks like a shop window, in this sense) reveals itself later a few decidedly ~loyal~ races towards the user, who can decide to unlock cars and events immediately (putting his wallet) or obtain the same result by racing and obtaining some victories. Freemium haters should also know that there is only one currency in the game and that you are never in a situation where you have to spend money in order to continue. The multiplayer sector is also excellent, which adds to the traditional eight-player races the possibility of challenging friends in asynchronous mode, therefore based on the ghost. The control system has remained unchanged, with the default setting based on the accelerometer and rather precise, but preferable only if you play on the iPad. If you use an iPhone or an iPod Touch, fortunately there is an excellent touch alternative, which is also punctual and reliable even in the most agitated situations. Finally, a few words for the technical sector, which is also improved compared to Asphalt 7: Heat, thanks to more detailed polygonal models (many cars are new, however), tracks that are on average more beautiful to look at and with a greater number of objects, as well as an attention to collisions that was previously lacking altogether: try crashing into a wall and you will see the car break apart in a completely plausible way, rather than simply stopping as it happened in the past. The sound is also beautiful, which accompanies the action with the right attitude and is never too much.", "date": "2013-08-26", "grade": "9.0"}
