As we inexorably approach the fourth year since the original release on PS4, the PlayStation Studios production label is preparing to launch the PC version of God of War on the market, an excellent old-gen exclusive which, after a quick coat of plaster in occasion of the PS5 update, it now aims to flex its muscles on the platform least subject to technical or performance impediments: the computer. Times have really changed, we all have to get over it by now, and it probably would have been impossible to even imagine see Santa Monica's latest work, the one created and directed by Cory Barlog, arrive on PC at the time of the original launch on PlayStation 4. And instead today we are here to tell you about this important conversion within the God of War review PC you are reading right now. A conversion that has a particularly evident specific weight: the soft reboot of the series is still considered today an important step forward in terms of storytelling and graphics and, in combination with The Last of Us 2, is often counted among the best exponents of the past generation of Triple A videogame projects, not to mention the incredible amount of awards for Game of the Year that it has been able to take home. Furthermore, this PC version comes accompanied by a great deal of fanfare regarding the work done by the developer to implement options and settings now considered a must if you want to arrive with a product capable of being attractive to PC enthusiasts in the modern era.God of War PC is in short, a bit of a watershed: it must continue on the path beaten by Horizon Zero Dawn and Days Gone, proposing a conversion job that will forgive the 4 years it took to have this exclusive on the computer but, at the same time, must prepare the track for what will come after which, inevitably, cannot be limited in this 2022 only to the collection of Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy. We'll see what happens in the coming months but, for now, let's go back to Kratos' adventures in the Nordic territories. First, however, a quick warning: this review focuses exclusively on the quality and value of the PC conversion by delving into the graphics, settings available on computers and the performance of the porting, assuming that the reader is already aware of the original work. If this is not your case, we strongly advise you to read the original review of God of War for PS4 where you will find very detailed information and judgments on the story, gameplay, combat system and the entire gaming experience. What is God of War (2018)? Kratos wonders about his exploits in God of War Before getting to the heart of the review, it is worth spending a few summary lines on the 2018 God of War, for those who are too lazy to read our PS4 review. The Santa Monica title is a sort of sequel to the original trilogy (tetralogy if we also want to consider Ascension) without really being a direct sequel: the new game in fact assumes the existence of the previous chapters, but uses another alphabet to stage the its gameplay and, for this reason, the term soft reboot has often been used. A total change of setting that passes from the reassuring familiarity of Greek mythology to the bold and impervious Norse iconography. A substantial change to the camera that inexorably approaches that of the most modern action cameras: from behind, very close and, above all, completely free in management. A combat system rethought from the ground up starting from the management of paraphernalia and equipment, up to the attack patterns and the type of enemies encountered. But above all a substantial innovation in the narrative that cuts all ties with the past in function of a strongly cinematic style and incredibly close to the elements that made the Naughty Dog productions well recognizable. God of War of 2018 is a chapter that has been able to revolutionize a series without distorting its distinctive features, but rather proposing something in step with the times capable of being more attractive to those who had never interfaced with the series, but at the same time not betraying the historical fan base that was born and raised with PlayStation. The same the same experience is available on PC from 14 January 2022 for 49.99. Zero unpublished content and zero changes to the mechanics or to any accessory element: the same, identical game, which can be purchased and downloaded on Steam and on the Epic Games Store. But how is this conversion concretely? The charactersistics of the PC version Kratos prepares to fight a Troll in God of War As previously mentioned, God of War for PC is virtually identical to its PS4 counterpart (it's actually closer to the free PS5 upgrade for obvious reasons) and this is also reflected in the settings which feature the same settings and options for what it concerns audio, interface, visual, game features, accessibility, photo mode and language selection. The only and crucial differences are found in the new items introduced for this conversion and which implement the settings concerning the screen, graphics and command management. Let's start from the latter: the Santa Monica title natively supports the PS5 DualSense and the PS4 DualShock plus Xbox pads and any other Windows compatible controller. The ideal command setup will be automatically selected and all the overlays will adapt to the type of buttons present on the device. In addition, full keyboard and mouse support has been added. We could discuss for a long time the desirability and pleasure of tackling a third-person action with this type of controls, but we all know that the world is beautiful because it is varied and Sony's decision to offer this possibility is certainly to be commended, with so much of dedicated setup of the keys that can be modified to your liking without any kind of limitation. Indeed, paradoxically, the work is better precisely in terms of mouse and keyboard compatibility than pad support. Exactly as happens in the PS4 / PS5 version, in fact, it is not yet possible to manually set the individual buttons, but you have to adapt to the few alternatives thought up by the developer. To be even more practical: we will be able to vary the interaction/dodge combination or the key used for the turnaround or, again, the use of the triggers to attack rather than using Atreus, but we will not be able, for example, to set a specific turnaround button or select the keys to our liking for attacks. Given the granularity offered by the mouse and keyboard options, we would have liked to find the same kind of customization for the controllers too. The key configuration in God of War for PC Inside the screen item we find instead the first handful of graphic settings and related to the display mode which then represent the backbone of this porting. In God of War PC it will finally be possible to take advantage of wide and ultrawide monitors with 16:10 and 21:9 ratios in addition to the classic 16:9, there is clearly full HDR support even on computers and, very interesting, there is the native implementation of NVIDIA Reflex available to all GeForce graphics card owners. It is therefore possible to both enable the basic mode to reduce input latency, and the boost mode and for those who have monitors and mice compatible with the GPU manufacturer's latency analyzer, the game also gives the possibility to enable the flash box for measurement of the performance of your PC. Also within this menu, to highlight the bipartisan nature of the conversion, we find the options relating to DLSS and FidelityFX Super Resolution for managing resolution scaling. God of War fully supports the latest release of Deep Learning Super Sampling from NVIDIA, 2.2, and allows you to select the usual 4 presets of this technology: Quality, Balanced, Performance and Ultra Performance with a real-time modification of the rendering resolution keeping the video output one still. The same goes for the FFSR which can be enabled as an alternative to DLSS to use the Super Sampling developed by AMD by choosing from 4 values: Ultra Quality, Quality, Balanced and Performance. The latter technology therefore allows you to go higher as regards the rendering resolution by having an additional quality setting, while DLSS allows you to use a further lower resolution value to meet the frame rate needs. The graphics settings related to God of War resolution, DLSS and FFSR DLSS vs FFSR in quality mode DLSS vs FFSR in performance mode We have done numerous tests and analyzes to try to compare the two types of Super Sampling with our NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 and, as you can see further down in the graph, NVIDIA's DLSS continues to have a powerful edge: on a qualitative level, the detachment is perceptible to the naked eye especially in the two lowest settings and nevertheless the loss in terms of frame rate is really marginal. Clearly the Super Resolution from AMD knows how to defend itself well and is in any case an extremely comfortable option for those who have installed a Radeon in their PC and can thus gain 20-30 FPS compared to the native rendering mode, but if you have an NVIDIA GPU there is no is a single reason to prefer FFSR over DLSS. The Santa Monica game also allows you to work with resolution rendering scaling by hand in case you don't want to or can't use NVIDIA and AMD technologies (the three options they are mutually exclusive). Among other things, with an anomaly that we just couldn't explain, this is also the only possibility that the game offers to those who want to change the native resolution. In fact, God of War runs on PC exclusively in ~windowed~ mode with or without borders and, we don't know if due to some limitation of the review code, the normal exclusive fullscreen cannot be used. Consequently, it is not possible to change the resolution unless you physically want to ~reduce~ the window in which the game runs, making the Windows desktop and other applications visible. Or using the scaling above. The graphics settings Kratos argues with Atreus in the new God of War Finally, moving on to the last exclusive option of the PC version of God of War, we find the real graphics settings. We take the opportunity to remind you that this conversion does not have any kind of rendering limitation or frame rate block: provided you have a very performing PC, you can play in 4k at more than 90 FPS. Moving on instead to the actual settings, while also appreciating the innovations introduced by Santa Monica in this case, we cannot hide that from such an important title we would have expected to find a greater granularity of options. In fact, we will be able to act on a very limited number of settings in the name of ~little but good~. In addition to a preset that automatically manages all the various items and which allows you to choose between a minimum graphic quality, faithful to the original for PS4/ PS5, high and ultra, there is obviously also the possibility to customize each setting. In the latter case we find the settings relating to the quality of the textures, to that of the models, the value of the anisotropic filter, the level of shadows and reflections, the management of atmospheric agents that we find in the outdoor sections and an option relating to ambient occlusion. There are no settings related to anti-aliasing, level of detail, field of view or other features that we are used to find in modern titles developed on PC. God of War graphics settings Therefore, if a certain type of ~savings~ work done by Sony to try to bring to PC a conversion that presents the bare minimum to be acceptable is evident, at the same time we must recognize an excellent optimization work that allowed us to run the title on the clearly high-end test configuration, manually pushing all the graphics settings to the maximum and always remaining around 60 FPS in native 4k without DLSS or FFSR. An extraordinary result which is clearly linked to the old-gen nature of this production, but which should not be diminished since it makes it even more enjoyable to play the game even if you have already played it on the occasion of its original release on consoles. However, we have scruple, ran God of War very quickly even on a slightly lower end configuration with an Intel i7-11700K and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 remaining just below 45 FPS always in native 4k without DLSS or FFSR. When NVIDIA and AMD technologies are enabled, the frame rate rockets upwards with a range between 15 and 30 FPS depending on the setting used, as clearly visible from the graph below. having been able to test it directly, we are sure that God of War can run consistently above 60 FPS on practically any mid-range configuration, without worrying too much about the selected graphics settings, provided you work a minimum on the rendering resolution through the use of DLSS and FidelityFX Super Resolution.
