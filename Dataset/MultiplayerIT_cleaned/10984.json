{"name": "Brothers in Arms: Hour of Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brothers-in-arms-hour-of-heroes.html", "text": "Right from the start, it is evident how Gameloft (which does not exactly have the reputation of being a software house that makes innovation its strong point) has taken the characteristic mechanics of the chapters released on mobile phones and N-Gage and transported them to the iPhone with few variations. The first and most important obviously concerns the control system, which offers three different solutions, but all sharing the need to move the character using a ~virtual analog stick~ located in the left corner of the screen and to shift the gaze by scrolling with a finger on the touchscreen. A method that - we say it right away - does not seem to have been sufficiently cared for by the developers. First of all, the very nature of the control system forces the user to cover a large part of the screen with his own fingers, making orientation sometimes difficult; secondly, the movement of the character is not precise, and it happens too often to see our soldier move in unwanted directions. Not to mention the management of the vehicles: tanks and jeeps are difficult to drive with agility, especially the latter, with an absolutely unmanageable on-screen steering wheel. Noting that Brothers in Arms: Hour of Heroes does not represent a hymn to playability, it should unfortunately be highlighted that the Gameloft product fails to excel in any particular area. From a graphic point of view, the title bears witness once again to the difficulties of French developers in fully exploiting the much vaunted potential of the iPhone hardware: the final result is not very far from what has been seen in the mobile and N-Gage sphere, with quite angular and with rather poor animations that move on not particularly complex scenarios, also debased by a full-bodied pop-up and slowdowns in the frame rate. The gameplay, on the other hand, suffers heavily from the problems encountered previously, but in itself it would not be bad at all: the adventure develops over the course of 12 missions divided into three different scenarios, with the conventional third-person shooter action interspersed with the aforementioned sections on board of tanks and jeeps. The difficulty level is quite low and the strategic part is reduced to a minimum, consequently Brothers in Arms: Hour of Heroes is an experience that any player with a minimum of skill can complete in a matter of hours: they are of little use Xbox 360-style achievements, as they are extremely easy to achieve and don't contribute to unlocking anything interesting. The subtlety of the storyline, trivial and devoid even of characters with a face and a name to become attached to, must also be included in the set of unconvincing elements of the Gameloft product. The only truly unassailable aspect of Brothers in Arms: Hour of Heroes is ultimately the sound sector, with military music suitable for the purpose, well-made speech (in English) and realistic effects. PRO Basically good gameplay Great sound effects AGAINST Inadequate control system Mediocre graphics Easy and quite short", "date": "2008-12-09", "grade": "6.5"}
