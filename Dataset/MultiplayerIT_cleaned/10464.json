{"name": "Integrazione cercasi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71341-queen-teen-the-clique-integrazione-cercasi.html", "text": "As in the most famous television films for teenagers, the whole story features a girl who has just arrived in what would seem to be the most snobbish school in the area (or so it is evident from the terrible and haughty welcome that the young woman is given) and ready to do new acquaintances. The goal is obviously to fit into the new school ~macrosystem~, collecting friendships and joining the group. In addition to interacting with the numerous and varied characters, the protagonist will have to take care of her look down to the smallest detail, earn money with small jobs remedied at the shopping center and follow school lessons (art, geometry, physical education, chemistry and the unusual economy housekeeper). To begin with, you can immediately choose your character from a range of proposals, without being able to change it, with the exception of clothing; at this point you're ready to jump into the new adventure, without forgetting useful tools such as a map for getting around, a cell phone to always keep in touch with friends and a purse. Friendship for sale As soon as you start to get to the heart of the adventure, something strange is immediately perceived. The first girl who welcomes the protagonist explains with a smile how things are going in the intricate school environment: she dwells on the fact that to conquer her companions and obtain their friendship it will not only be necessary to constantly do them favors and errands, but also to satiate their incredible desire to gossip. A sort of mission, in short, to ensure the loyalty of others, an approach that is at least unusual and undoubtedly distorted for a game that is aimed at the little ones. The initial impression of being faced with a title with extremely superficial content will never be denied again for the entire game time. The wildest gossip reigns supreme and truly constitutes the fulcrum of friendships: obviously everything does not end with mere listening, but the game requires you to flaunt the incredible news you have learned (such as the fact that a girl has a spinach in her teeth or another woman's father went bankrupt...). From the first meetings it often happens to witness the refusal of the companions who judge the protagonist's look not fashionable enough for their levels. If in this picture work and study are thought to be positive elements, unfortunately there is the risk of making a blunder: in fact, work experiences are reduced to a mere means of being able to redo one's wardrobe and satisfy the tastes of friends, while school successes will be a ploy to approach the group of intellectuals and participate in their party. Just complicated Leaving aside the flaws of the entire story and going into the details of the proposed mini-games, it is possible to express less harsh judgments. Without a doubt, the multitude of characters with which you can interact makes the game more interesting, even if you are often faced with obvious or, worse, repetitive phrases. As far as chores are concerned, even in this case there is a certain variety: one can thus embark on a career in the restaurant world (juggling ice cream, tacos or breakfast at the bar) or serve customers in the most ~in~ of the city. The school dimension is no less and presents various choices: from knitting a sweater during home economics lessons to creating solutions, sometimes explosive, in the chemistry laboratory, without forgetting free-climbing in the gym. In this panorama, however, the choice to create extremely simple games with incredibly articulated instructions is very striking: very long sentences, in which you practically always end up losing the thread of speech, in reality they hide very banal and always identical mini-games. In short, clarity is not exactly the strong point of this title. On the other hand, however, there is a certain attempt to diversify the mini-games by allowing the selection of the level of difficulty, even if Queen Teen - The Clique never manages to untie itself from that aura of repetitiveness from which it is enveloped.", "date": "2009-10-15", "grade": null}
