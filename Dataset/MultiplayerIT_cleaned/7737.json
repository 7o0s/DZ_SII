{"name": "La corsa all'oro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/120954-greedy-dwarf-la-corsa-alloro.html", "text": "The nice introductory sequence of Greedy Dwarf shows us the protagonist of the game, a wiry miner, while he makes an extraordinary discovery: the mine in which he is located hides gold, lots of gold! There's only one problem: the precious metal is guarded by ferocious orcs who have no intention of giving it up and are indeed determined to hunt down anyone who dares to get close to their treasure. This is the incipit of the new action game developed by Sleeper Cell for iOS devices, a title that strikes you right from the start for the color tones used to enhance the atmosphere of the thirty-two tunnels that currently make up the single player campaign. Our goal, in each of the levels, is to collect as much gold as possible by traveling in an Indiana Jones trolley and trying to avoid the many traps that await us along the way. The developers have included two possible configurations for the controls, which in each case rely completely on the touch screen. The first, by default, sees us drag a finger at the bottom of the screen to move our improvised vehicle to the right or left, thus intercepting the gold nuggets to collect, and touching the display with a second finger to leap. The second configuration is instead based on traditional directional arrows, but we soon realize that a digital type control does not go well with the need to regulate the movements of the wagon in a very precise way, on pain of falling into a completely different what a healthy lava bath. Greedy Dwarf does exactly what it sets out to do: entertain in a lighthearted way A diamond for a yes Immediate, frenetic and pleasant, the gameplay of Greedy Dwarf lends itself perfectly to occasional and impromptu use, as often happens with ~ultra arcade~ games with a very affordable price. The Sleeper Cell guys have tried to make the action more varied by using a couple of interesting gimmicks, such as the transition from the third-person view to a side view, almost like a two-dimensional platform, during certain sequences. Similarly, ~magic~ orc traps have been inserted that suddenly reverse gravity, sending our trolley to the ceiling and forcing the protagonist to hold on to it while we try to get the hang of the momentarily reversed controls. We have also noticed a certain attention to the progressiveness of the experience, in the sense that during the first stages it is not at all difficult to collect all the available gold and successfully complete the mission, but soon things get more complicated, the paths become full of chasms and skimpy jumpers, and at that point you need not only precision and quick reflexes, but also a good memory, so you know what to do and when to do it during a possible second stint. The simple mechanics of Greedy Dwarf are supported by a technical realization that lives up to expectations, thanks to very fluid and well-designed graphics, which make use of contrasting shades to obtain a certain visual impact, and rightly so. The sound, on the other hand, didn't impress us: perhaps it was time to work on a more significant accompaniment.", "date": "2013-07-11", "grade": "7.3"}
