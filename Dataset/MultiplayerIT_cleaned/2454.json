{"name": "Red Faction", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/red-faction_a.html", "text": "The PlayStation 2 falls in love with shooters What about this game that you don't already know? The programmers of Volition, after the modest success achieved with Summoner, have embarked on a much more ambitious undertaking by bringing a first person shooter to the PlayStation 2 that can rightly be considered revolutionary. There's certainly no shortage of quality FPS on Sony's 128-bit console. First Time Splitters, then Unreal Tournament and Quake 3 Revolution showed that even consoles are able to accommodate previously exclusive titles of the most pumped PCs with dignity. Red Faction, however, surpasses all its predecessors thanks to a series of innovations that will radically change future productions. The much vaunted Geo-Mod Technology (geometric modification), which had been talked about often and willingly in the past, turns out to be an introduction as risky as it is successful for the results obtained. The merits of RF certainly do not stop here... Look how I blow you up... As I have already pointed out, Red Faction is presented to us as a first person shooter. Far from the tradition of ~classic~ shooters belonging to the Quake genre, RF instead takes a lot from that computer masterpiece called Half-Life. Thanks to a simple but easily accessible menu we can access the two main game modes (single player and multiplayer), a training section and a series of options present in all games of this type. An enthralling introduction immediately launches us into the heart of the single-player game. The control system, although difficult in principle, presents solutions that are sure to be comfortable and effective in execution. Never like this time does the lack of mouse support feel like .... Through the left analog stick we can walk forward / backward and move sideways, the right one allows us instead to turn around 360 degrees, to look up and down. The R1 and R2 buttons are instead assigned by default to the main and secondary shot respectively. As in any self-respecting FPS, the arsenal of weapons available is vast and ensures excellent protection even in the most delicate situations. Initially we have a simple control stick, taken from a guard, and capable of producing lethal electric shocks. In the continuation of the game we will instead fill our large pockets with the most modern inventions of war technology. Among the 15 weapons included in the game, the machine gun deserves a special mention, capable of firing 12 and 5.56 mm bullets; the continuous-fire assault rifle (amazing!); the flamethrower; the fusion missile launcher (devastating!); and the explosive charges that can be operated remotely, very useful in case you want to test the effectiveness of Geo-Mod Technology. I don't like that wall! Having begun our adventure in the darkest tunnels of the mines of Mars, the rebellion against the Ultor Corporation will take us through countless very different environments. Thus we will end up in very modern laboratories, on the carriage of a subway train, on the surface of the planet and even in the icy waters of some Martian lakes. To cross the most inaccessible places we will be able, from time to time, to resort to some vehicles equipped with very powerful armaments: an ATV (All Terrain Vehicle); a drilling machine; a fighter jet; an armored assault vehicle; and even a submarine. Such brute force would be useless if we couldn't take advantage of Geo-Mod Technology. The latter in fact allows us to change the game settings by blowing up walls, columns, bridges and almost everything that comes our way. Can't find the key to open a door? It is sufficient to place an explosive charge on the wall or launch a missile to open a passage and enter the previously inaccessible room. This is an innovation that has no equal in the history of shooters and that only by playing Red Faction will you be able to appreciate and understand its greatness. I doubt that the next titles of this genre will be able to do without this technology... Censorship issues? Red Faction proves to be satisfying in every situation and in every element but certainly there is no shortage of defects. First of all that concerning the frame-rate, brought by Volition to 30 frames per second, far from the now canonical 60 fps. Furthermore, in the most agitated scenes and during the most devastating explosions, the fearsome slowdowns of the graphics engine appear, not even too incognitowhich, although occasional, always turn up one's nose. Added to this is that the acclaimed Geo-Mod Technology is unfortunately not applicable to all surfaces and all walls. In fact, metal doors and thicker walls are not scratched even by a repeated detonation of explosive charges. Finally, a secondary but immediately noticeable detail is that the Ultor's guards all die in the same way. Killed by a pistol or a missile, the unfortunate soldiers perish without particular differences. So don't expect severed limbs or flying heads since probably for censorship reasons Volition did not want to rage on the bodies of the characters. Lethal Weapon... From the point of view of graphics, Red Faction fully convinces without surprising. The high-resolution graphics and the detailed environments do their duty without squeezing the PlayStation 2's emotion engine to the max. The excellent and varied textures present in the game almost make us doubt who thought that the Sony console was not capable of effectively handle high-quality textures. The polygonal models of the characters are discreetly made and animated but they certainly don't cry out for a miracle. The same can be said for the interlude scenes which would have deserved greater care. Incredibly detailed and spectacular are the weapons, among the most beautiful and believable ever seen in a shooter. The non-secondary protagonists of the game are the music and sound effects, both excellent and certainly pertinent to the situations. Red Faction or Half Life? In conclusion I think I have no doubts about the quality of Red Faction. Good graphics, amazing gameplay and captivating story make this game a must not only for FPS enthusiasts but also for all PlayStation 2 owners. Apart from some minor flaws, Red Faction deserves to be awarded the prize for best shooter available for PlayStation 2 and probably every console. The high longevity is made even more consistent by a very happy multiplayer mode that will keep you glued to the joypad together with a friend of yours. Waiting for Red Faction 2, which is already rumored, and Half-Life PS2 this could be the best possible purchase for a genre that is giving its best on PlayStation 2. And if you are interested in knowing why Red Faction has been elected as a symbol of the anti-globalization struggle... Pros: Fun and compelling Good graphics Geo-Mod Technology Amazing weapons Multiplayer mode High longevity Cons: Some slowdowns Not exceptional cutscenes Geo-Mod limited to some surfaces Come to Mars! ~Come to Mars, help us create a new world!~. These are the words that convince a promising military academy cadet, Parker, to leave Earth and embark on a new adventure away from home and from an existence devoid of the satisfactions and dreams cultivated by every boy his age. However, the young Parker soon understands that the Red Planet would become not only his new home but also his grave. Together with thousands of other men he finds himself in the depths of Mars to carry out the unrewarding work of the miner, losing any residual hopes of freedom with each pickaxe. The Ultor Corporation, having become master of the life of the miners, forces each of them to backbreaking labor and very harsh living conditions. Guards armed to the teeth keep watch in the mines, violently extinguishing any hotbed of protest. As if that weren't enough, a terrible virus spreads among the miners, exterminating them or, at best, transforming them into horrible creatures. This is too much for Parker who, after witnessing his friend being killed, unleashes his rage and takes the lead in a revolt organized by a group of people called the Red Faction. With the help of Eos, secret soul of the rebellion, and Hendrix, ally and spy among the enemy ranks, Parker will unleash a war that will shock the entire planet. The Ultor corporation is by now numbered...", "date": "2001-07-10", "grade": null}
