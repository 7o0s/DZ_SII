{"name": "Zax - The Alien Hunter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zax-the-alien-hunter.html", "text": "A wiry Rambo from space The character of Zax is certainly not an example of a complex personality, being the classic example of rambesco macho, worthy representative of that bevy of characters born in the wake of the old Duke Nukem, with whom they share the cadence of the voice, the big square jaw as well as the customary display of the iron biceps. At the beginning of the game, therefore, we meet a very fit alien with somatic features of rare ugliness, known as Zax, a tramp and adventurer by profession, looking for the big opportunity that will allow him to change his life and have fun. In the meantime, he wanders through space aboard his old and run-down spaceship in the company of Zelon, the artificial intelligence of the on-board computer, which he named after his favorite movie star. To top off bad luck, the old Zax is forced to crash land on an unknown planet due to a breakdown. Stuck on the surface of the alien world, our hero will improvise as the savior of the oppressed native population, long under the yoke of Om, a sort of evil machine-god who has transformed most of the primitive and peaceful Korb into soulless robots. his orders, enslaving most of the survivors. Shoot and then run!! What kind of game is this Zax? The game developers call it an action/adventure, a wording that can mean all or nothing. The general setting is that of a classic two-dimensional action-RPG with an isometric view; we have an inventory and a fair number of NPCs to interact with, not least the nice Zelon who will accompany us via radio throughout the adventure. In reality, Zax has very little to do with PC RPGs, lacking the fundamental requirement for any self-respecting RPG or A-RPG, namely Experience. Our character's evolution path is unique and exclusively involves his (rather well-stocked) armament and a semblance of equipment, which essentially boils down to the different types of energy shields and the batteries to make them work. The funny thing is the possibility of creating the objects we need from scratch, simply by collecting enough raw material around (minerals and crystals) and pouring it into the Object Generator, located inside our ship. Shoot and then run!! Returning to the interaction with the NPCs, it should be pointed out that they are in fact a few, limiting themselves to a couple of shamans from the Korb tribes and the same aliens that we will occasionally save, and in any case the level of interaction remains low , since we will only be able to listen to what they have to tell us and follow their instructions, perhaps solving some small collateral ~quest~, such as, for example, disinfesting the caves below a village under siege from evil androids. As I said therefore, Zax is a game that places all its cards on action and fights, a component emphasized by the peculiar control system designed for this purpose by the guys from Reflexive. Most games with isometric or third-person view use the mouse or keyboard as control devices (in which case the use of a pad is recommended). If we think of Diablo, for example, neglecting the use of hockey, it is perfectly playable with only the help of a good desk mouse. On the contrary, Zax's control system is similar to that of first-person shooters (Quake) and third-person shooters (such as Heretic2 and Max Payne), as we will guide the protagonist's movements using the keyboard, while using the mouse we will take aim and we will fire (thanks to the cursor turned into a viewfinder). It may seem like a trivial question, but if you focus on it for a moment, you realize that it is a decidedly unusual control system for a 2D shooter, and in fact it is on this point that perplexities and appreciations have arisen on the part of those who have viewed the game demos. As far as I'm concerned, I find it to be an excellent gimmick, since, as is obvious, the mouse+keyboard combination allows all that series of maneuvers typical of shooters (strafe, etc.) and I admit that I decidedly embellished myself in maneuvering Zax, making him run in one direction and shoot in another, perhaps dodging the crossfire of a couple of androids. The technical aspects, that is: let's tighten our belts and be satisfied As I mentioned, the here prfree Zax certainly will not make your brand new GeForce3 sweat. Not that the technical realization is poor, far from it, indeed the care taken in the realization of many of the scenarios is admirable. Certainly the pre-rendered 2D graphics have definitely had their day, but in this case we are faced with a well-made product, with a clean and well-detailed rendering on the screen and almost free of smudges such as overlapping sprites and so on. Some more effort could have been made in the animation phase of the sprites themselves, which do not all seem to have been made with the same care and often make unnaturally jerky movements. As for the game's audio, I wasn't overly impressed by the soundtrack, a series of fairly bland tunes, especially in this day and age of dynamic music and scripts that adjust tracks according to on-screen events. Much more enjoyable are the sound effects, a bit ~cartoon~ perhaps, but which go well with the graphic setting of the game. The voices of the characters also pleasantly impressed me, especially that of Zax himself, worthy of the best suburban space tamarro, together with those of some of the robots and ~Metal Demons~ in Om's service. Concluding Ok, at this point you will expect the classic ~standard~ judgment for those games that are not exceptional, but not even so bad that even enthusiasts cannot buy them. In reality I believe that Zax, although it remains a ~little game~ offers much more meat in the fire than it appears at first glance, especially in terms of mere fun, and if you let yourself be ~taken~ you could continue to fragga aliens for hours without realizing it . The gameplay born from this umpteenth JoWooD alchemy is in fact decidedly addictive and even if the fun won't last for exactly months, you certainly won't be disappointed by playing a genuine shoot 'em-up like you haven't seen for centuries. Lately JoWooD, an enterprising publisher from beyond the Alps, has been taking care of the publication of titles which, if they don't shine for their technical realization and gameplay variety, certainly boast a certain originality. Just think of titles like the recent The Sting!, to note the interest of this publisher in games that may not go down in history, but all in all they turn out to be a pleasant pastime for those who play video games without being hardcore gamers. Well let's take a look at this Zax, a title that has managed to attract some interest precisely because of its being outside the box, at least from those we have become accustomed to in recent times.", "date": "2001-10-01", "grade": null}
