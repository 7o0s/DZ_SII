{"name": "X-Men Destiny", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/94602-x-men-destiny-destino-beffardo.html", "text": "Version tested: Wii It has been a long time since a video game based on the mutant superheroes of the Marvel universe has been made, so the announcement of X-Men Destiny was greeted with enthusiasm by the many fans of the comic. For years at the top of the American sales charts, the magazines dedicated to the X-Men have known periods of greater popularity, as often happens, in conjunction with the release in cinemas of the related films, the latest of which (~X-Men Men - L'Inzio~) has succeeded in the arduous task of bringing an interesting and spectacular story to the screen despite the lack of some of the most representative characters from Professor Charles Xavier's ~School for Gifted Youth~. It is an interesting reading key, in the sense that perhaps managing a large number of prominent personalities within the same story can be a problem, as one hero can steal the show from the other and at the end of the day both could complain of low valuation. It is perhaps for this reason that the developers of Silicon Knights, in collaboration with Marvel writer Mike Carey, have decided not to create the usual tie-in in which it is possible to control the various Cyclops, Wolverine, Colossus and so on, but to introduce three new characters who out of the blue discover they possess mutant powers and who in the course of the adventure are called to decide their own destiny, in this case whether they prefer to fight alongside the X-Men or join the ~Brotherhood of Evil Mutants~ (of course in the Marvel house really stupid ideas come to mind, and not too rarely in hindsight) under the orders of the powerful Magneto. The three characters in question are Aimi Yoshida, a Japanese girl who escaped the capture of her family by anti-mutant organizations; Grant Alexander, the typical American kid who likes to play football; Adrian Luca, son of an extremist who hated mutants and who was killed during clashes. In the game we can choose which of the three to play, therefore what kind of powers we want to possess: the ability to emit energy beams, a skin as hard as stone with super-strength attached or the ability to manipulate shadows to transform them into sharp blades. The sad reality The interesting narrative incipit, which introduces new characters all to be discovered, as well as the potential inherent in the choices to be made during the game, are unfortunately not accompanied by a structure capable of withstanding its weight, both from a technical/artistic point of view as well as gameplay-wise. In fact, a few seconds are enough to ascertain the poor quality of the Silicon Knights product, starting with the mediocre sequences in the by now inflated ~animated comic~ style, with a character design decidedly not up to par with the Marvel comics from which the game is based, and continuing with a whole series of genuinely unwatchable elements: angular polygonal models, badly animated (they don't even move their mouths during the dialogues...), with textures characterized by such a low resolution as to show enormous pixels (see the tattoos on Adrian's arms) , who fight opponents all the same in bare, flat, very ugly to look at scenarios, with unpresentable interaction effects (the walls that are hit and magically ~disappear~) and an avalanche of glitches that include interpenetrations (once the our character has mysteriously sunk into the ground, fortunately without getting stuck in it) and problems in managing the view, which is really uncomfortable, especially during fights with the toughest opponents. Wii owners are used to technically disappointing productions, especially when it comes to multiplatform titles, but X-Men Destiny sets new standards in this regard, so much so that it is truly surprising how in the entire development process no one has noticed how many let her have the game. Flaws that unfortunately are not limited to the graphics and the artistic figure, but also afflict the gameplay, badly ~sketched~ compared to the noble premises. In fact, it is not enough to insert three characters and place the player in front of choices, if these elements do not lead to a differentiation of the experience. From time to time it is possible to align yourself with the ~good guys~ or the ~bad guys~, but the cards on the table basically don't change and we always find ourselves leading our hands in the usual ways, against the usual enemies, interspersing the clashes with platform sessions that mimic Uncharted and Prince of Persia (the one in cel shading) without having a minimum of the charisma and quality of these two products. The upgrade system has nothing to do with the mechanicstypical of role-playing games, as instead it was hinted before the release, and the new abilities also hide some flaws, for example the power to materialize ~stings~ around the character fails in the objective of beating the opponents because the system simply fails to detect the collision.", "date": "2011-10-19", "grade": "5.5"}
