Despite some four-wheel excursions, continued for years with the WRC series and recently with the new intellectual property Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo, the Milanese development house has mainly linked its career to motorcycling titles, embracing a style of play rather inclined to realism. While work continues on Ride 2, the sequel to the new two-wheeled franchise that breaks the mold of classic racing for a freer formula, the team took advantage of the ~know-how~ gained with the game to produce a curious spin-off, Ducati - 90 Anniversary, essentially a very focused version of Ride, entirely based on the historic Bolognese house. The idea is interesting for the reasons you will discover in the course of the review: will Milestone have succeeded in easing the wait that separates us from the new Ride? Will Ducati - 90th Anniversary be able to lighten the wait that separates us from the new Ride? I see red Ducati - 90 Anniversary already has an eloquent title: it is a celebration of the company's career, through its models that have characterized almost a century of life. Ducati was in fact born way back in 1926, even if we have to wait thirty years for its debut in the world of mopeds. As can be guessed, this title is entirely dedicated to the company's racing cars but at the same time has a close relationship with Ride, sharing many elements, starting from the circuits. Milestone has created a brand new one, the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, for the rest it is all or almost all recovered from Ride, with slight graphic improvements. The list of contents includes 13 circuits, with some variants that substantially double the number, and 39 motorcycles, ten of which were recovered by Ride. Not even asking, they are all jewels that have marked the history of Ducati, so it is clear that Milestone is a product dedicated especially to fans of the Borgo Panigale house. The presentation is quite in line with the standards to which the development team has accustomed us, sober and characterized by a prevailing red and menus with a not exactly lightning-fast response. It cannot actually be said that the general style conveys particular emotions, even if for a title like this it does not represent a crucial detail, the options are functional enough and even small touches of class are appreciated, such as the loading icon , often too derivative (the usual circle), but creatively resolved by Milestone. Unfortunately, however, the loads still remain a thorn in the side since the days of Ride, resulting in long and unnerving between the various races, but also moving between the same menus. Reliving history... in our own way The most appreciable feature of Ducati - 90th Anniversary is the career mode, or Historic Tour, partially recovered from Ride but revised for what the concept of this product is: reliving the Ducati years starting from the middle of the century, through a series of Themed races center around a particular model. To move on to the next race you need to win stars distributed to those able to conquer the first three places on the podium but this makes the structure more elastic than the classic formula of the simple win and continue. Someone may turn up their noses at the simplicity of the structure not being able to speak of a real career but of a predefined set of races, but in any case it is fun to review motorcycles and circuits, continuing over the years up to the present day. We are not dealing with a production designed to entertain for a long time, but a tribute to the brand designed for the most ardent fans, who will find many stimuli in the amount of details bestowed by the game on the house. This does not mean that even the occasional player of this genre, or not too interested in the red, can take away his satisfaction by enjoying some forays on two wheels. Another appreciable detail is the tutorial proposed at the beginning, which tries to introduce the mechanics with the utmost softness, adapting to the player's performance. Playstation 4 trophies The concise nature of Ducati - 90th Anniversary makes it easier to win Trophies, as there are fewer digressions that could lengthen the time to win them. Basically, even only the ~first times~ ensure a decent loot, in fact, less than an hour of play is enough, facing the main career to conquer over 10% of the Trophies, including a gold one. Dreaming of the current-gen The out of tune notes arrive once on the track: it is not clear what there is to be elaborated in the long loadings that characterizeerizzano Ducati - 90th Anniversary, probably not the graphics engine, certainly not among the strengths of Milestone production. The cross-gen origin of the engine is quite clear, at least for the PlayStation 4 version we tested, closer to the previous generation in terms of rendering, with the only difference being the resolution used, which reaches native 1080p. However, the definition guaranteed by the additional pixels is a double-edged sword, ending up amplifying the general, rather spartan look. The saturated colors give a somewhat plastic effect, the effects are at a minimum wage and the pilot animations are woody and unrealistic. As if that weren't enough, the console version is locked at 30 frames per second, devoid of any effects that could smooth out the action in any way. This is not a defect per se, but it is truly unacceptable to support a similar frame rate in relation to the proposed graphics sector. The situation doesn't improve too much on the gameplay side: the driving system is fun, with a substantially arcade setting but with simulation veins to take into consideration if you don't want to taste the asphalt. Mistakes are punished rather severely: going off the track or touching opponents almost always results in a disastrous fall, the problem is that the collision system and physics are not always convincing, leading to dubious situations. In general, in any case, Ducati - 90th Anniversary manages to defend itself quite well on this aspect, provided it overlooks the visual side.", "date": "2016-07-27", "grade": "6.5"}
