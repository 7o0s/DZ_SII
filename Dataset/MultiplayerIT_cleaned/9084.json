{"name": "El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93139-el-shaddai-ascension-of-the-metatron-in-nome-di-dio.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3 There are games that go beyond graphics or technical aspects in general, often enthralling users exclusively for their gameplay. Others instead, which go beyond the elements just described, making you fall in love with their plot or visual aspect, often allowing you to fly over, within certain limits, those aspects related to naked gameplay, despite even possible, small defects. El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron, an action game with platform elements developed by Ignition Entertainment and produced by Konami, could easily fall into the latter category of products. In fact, as we will see later, it is in some ways a game in itself, something to be evaluated as a whole by taking into great consideration the particular graphic style adopted by Sawaki Takeyasu, an artist who boasts works of undoubted prestige in his curriculum such as the drawings for Okami and the Devil May Cry series, and the themes. On the other hand, the game already from the title suggests how particular it is in this sense. Indeed, El Shaddai is one of the Hebrew names that are used in the Bible to indicate God. And the plot behind the product is also clear: inspired by the Book of Enoch, an apocryphal text of Jewish tradition, it tells of Enoch, a monk/scribe warrior in search, on behalf of God, of seven rebel angels, who have practically unleashed hell on earth by negatively affecting human beings. These creatures must be stopped within a certain amount of time and brought back to the Kingdom of Heaven, before a kind of universal flood is triggered that can wipe out humanity, guilty of having largely rebelled against God. this difficult task, our hero will be accompanied in the adventure by Lucifel, a strange angel in a suit and tie constantly busy talking on his cell phone, in the role of guide and even rescue point, and by the four archangels Raphael, Uriel, Gabriel and Michele, on a long journey that will lead him to face not only the seven fallen angels mentioned above, but also a large group of their servants and even himself, morally poised, in some ways, between darkness and light. Continuous action The story briefly mentioned in the previous paragraph serves as a pretext for the developers to create a third-person action game with a fixed camera that we could define as having visionary contents, a product basically devoid of a classic game structure, seasoned with dreamlike tones that enchant those who decide try it out at least once. The core of the entire gaming experience is the fights. They usually take place against enemies with a particular look as we often find in many Japanese anime, an unusual mix between demons of the Japanese tradition and angels of the Catholic collective imagination, often dressed complete with a t-shirt. And they have an atypical structure: while relying on a classic control system based on the exploitation of two buttons which respectively house the attack and the jump, plus two backbones used for parrying and a move to throw enemies into the air (in combination with the Square) or, in certain situations, to steal weapons, the clashes show off completely original dynamics. After having stunned the opponents with a few blows and having destroyed a good part of the armor that protects them, in fact, Enoch can steal their weapon and use it against them, perhaps by performing some particular combo. This move does not have a purely aesthetic value, in the sense that it not only serves to make the battle a little more spectacular, but it has absolutely important tactical functions given that it gives the player the double advantage of making the opponents harmless and increasing their damage . Furthermore, the fact that these tools must be purified before being able to use them, by pressing a dedicated key (L1): an operation that must be repeated with a certain constancy also for the three standard weapons of the protagonist, under penalty of losing effectiveness due to the Evil that comes absorbed by them as they strike demons. At worst, you can always use the dear old hands and the classic kicks. However, the game is not, as it may appear at first glance, a simple button mashing. It is true that everything is immediate and that the execution of combined attacks takes place rapidly and in a varied way with the different pressure in duration and speed of the keys. But it is equally true that as the adventure progresses, with the increase in general difficulties, the number of opponents and the type of opponents, especially the bosses, everything changes and it is not enough to press buttons at random ormadly to bring them down. Hard enough Among other things, as further confirmation of all this and of the originality of its gameplay, El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron does not include any on-screen indicators, so for example the health status of Enoch can be guessed by the player only from the number of armor pieces covering his chest. But even, still on the subject of fighting, since there are no visual signals or anything else, it is up to the gamer to understand for himself when to press the right button to perform a certain counterattack, a parry or a combined move. Even the interventions of the archangels like Uriel who come to the aid of Enoch during particular game situations, such as for example to regenerate the armor or, if necessary, to reinforce the attacks and allow the hero to unleash a devastating attack that changes according to to the weapon used, even if determined by the completion of the reloading of a special bar (also invisible), they are signaled and announced only by the voice of the creatures themselves. Not to mention the fact that you have to manage, and know how to do it, your moves as well as the weapons available. Depending on the equipment, in fact, the approach to the battles themselves also changes, since Enoch is able to carry only one tool with him at a time. And eventually to replace them you have to wait to cross appropriate icons that change along the way or, as already mentioned, stealing them. But what are these weapons? They are three for the duration of the story: we have the Arch, which is a luminous arc equipped with an energy blade on the curved part, which the protagonist uses in fact as if it were a sword. Then we have the Gale, a strange circular object positioned behind the hero's back, which allows you to hurl a set of projectiles at the enemy, and finally the Veil, two luminous objects that Enoch can wear as if they were gloves and join together to form a circular protective shield, or to attack, thus giving more physical strength to his fists. These tools are the only fixed ones available to the hero for the entire story. Obviously the title is not free from defects: in our opinion, the camera with fixed shots that we mentioned at the beginning stands out among all, which can sometimes create some visual problems. Then the absence of an option to hook enemies, which cannot fail to make some situations that involve a certain number of opponents to be faced simultaneously a little frustrating. Finally, a fair basic repetitiveness due to a certainly not wide variety of enemies and things to do. Playstation 3 trophies El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron can count on the beauty of fifty Trophies to unlock, some of which are secret. They are divided as follows: 1 of Platinum, 2 of Gold, 8 of Silver and 39 of Bronze. To get them you have to meet the game requirements, such as defeating 500 enemies or completing the various chapters for the simpler ones, or getting the G score by finishing each level in Hard mode or without undergoing game over for the more difficult ones, up to the coveted Platinum, for which all other prizes must be obtained. Digital painting To partially overcome the risk of monotony during the approximately seven to nine hours that are needed to complete the adventure, given that the game lacks real exploratory phases, the developers have included several typically platform sessions, both two-dimensional and pseudo 3D , which somehow balance a playability that could otherwise be tiring in the long run. These phases are quite difficult, but never frustrating, and from a general point of view we can define them nothing short of spectacular, thanks to a style that faithfully reproduces, for certain mechanics, the best of the classics of the genre, and to the choice of the programmers to adapt what has just been described to the narrative and visual context of the product. Enoch jumps and glides, also taking advantage of his weapons, on cloud or rock platforms, riding when needed on very high waves, with an explosion of colors and effects in the background that catch the eye of those who play. Indeed, there is no doubt that, beyond everything, the strong point of El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron is represented by a graphic design that is difficult to describe in words. It is a unique, particular, artistic style to the point of looking like a picture in continuous movement. Hypnotic scenarios that seem to have been born from the fantasies of a painter of other times, represented with acid colors and with undefined outlines, and which range from settings dominated by black and phosphorescent colors to sections with more suffused, soft, almost watercolors, in a succession that despite the contrast of schemthe chromatic does not disturb and indeed, enchants. The character design alone is something absolutely original: the protagonist is, as mentioned, a young scribe / monk with long blond hair who wears white armor and a pair of jeans, his guide is practically, name aside , Lucifer himself, represented here as one of those frantic and stressed out managers. In a combination of the sacred and the profane, of typically Japanese and other more Western elements. In this context, a really well done dubbing in both English and Japanese (both subtitled in Italian) could not be missing, apart from the occasional lack of lip synchrony of the characters, and above all an epic soundtrack, with music in some situations very inspired, especially during the most important fights.", "date": "2011-09-19", "grade": "8.5"}
