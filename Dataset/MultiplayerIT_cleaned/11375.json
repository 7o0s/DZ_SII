{"name": "Silent Hill: Origins - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silent-hill-origins-recensione_a.html", "text": "The recent history of video games is full of games born and originally developed only for a console as its possible killer applications, then converted to other platforms after some time. Thus, out of the blue, the Resident Evil saga comes to mind with the fourth chapter exclusively (which turned out to be temporary) for the Game Cube or, to stay at Sony and on the PSP, GTA: Liberty City Stories. It was therefore inevitable, perhaps, with a cool head, to hypothesize a conversion for the Monolith of Silent Hill: Origins, a highly coveted title by fans of a series that has had its definitive consecration on this platform in recent years. The story of this game is now known: initially born as a remake for PlayStation 2 of the first chapter of the saga, which saw the light on the old PlayStation back in 1999, the game was then redesigned for the Sony portable console and entrusted to a USA team, the climaxes. A choice, this, which made many fans turn up their noses at the time, fearful of seeing the final product distorted, as it seemed among other things from the first official information released, where a totally different game was presented to the public, for the worse, from the original concept. Fortunately, things did not turn out to be such and Silent Hill: Origins on PSP at its release recorded a certain consensus on the part of insiders and enthusiasts. And now the title that promises to further unravel the origins of the Myth is on PS2. Prequel Origins tells the story of a truck driver named Travis Grady who, after having nearly crashed his vehicle following some flashback visions, and having witnessed a mysterious apparition, saves a little girl from a burning house and then wakes up, to due to a faint, on a bench in the city Dumbledore... And from that moment on it will be up to us to find out what happened to the girl and how and why the man actually ended up in that mysterious place, through the branching out of a plot that it is placed temporally before the events narrated in Silent Hill 1. More precisely in the phases following the fire in the Gillespie house, years before the arrival of Harry, the ritual of reunification, of Incubus. The structure of the game is the classic one to which every good survival horror has accustomed us in recent years, and that is a set of exploratory phases mixed with moments in which you have to solve puzzles or fight for your own survival, and in which the gameplay itself it's just a way to give meaning to a chain of actions and make the facts evolve. Why also in this episode, which as per tradition, is an adventure horror with a strong psychological impact, much more attentive to the story and its developments than to the clashes Prequel , we prefer to give space to the plot, to emotions, to a more intimate terror. The gameplay of Origins in fact mixes some of the best elements of the entire saga, adding some new ideas here and there, as if the developers had not wanted to go further for fear of distorting the final product and dissatisfying the more traditionalist fans. A good? An evil? It depends on your tastes. Fear behind the mirror The fact is that the atmosphere is once again the key element of the title: wandering in the darkness of a mental asylum, with only the light of a torch, the sound of something or someone crawling in the shadows behind, or banging on the walls , the distressing background music, are like no other. So the only significant innovations can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and, apart from the passage from reality to the Otherworld through the aid of mirrors, and therefore no longer in a ~natural~ way, during the exploratory phases, most they mainly concern the combat phases. Here we have tried to implement the concept of survival applied in a videogame context. If you were involved in an attack and had to defend yourself as best you could, how would you behave? Surely in any useful way, even by grabbing a blunt object. And it is this way of acting that made Travis adopt by the developers: televisions, IV stands, sticks, even fists. By holding down the X button, he can even charge a shot and by releasing the same button, he can hurl certain objects at monsters. Unless you're in a melee. There are various types of melee attacks to which Travis can react differently depending on the command displayed on the screen (button button to press quickly, etc), just like in Shenmue. Once a blow has been avoided, you can counterattack and rage on the enemy's body: in these cases, just release the R1 key which is used to assume the fighting position and press X again to finish the opponent on the ground. The series Silent Hill is an adventure video game series con third-person view and with a horror background, which over time has seen the light on almost all existing game platforms from its origin to today. The peculiarity of the saga consists in its gameplay more focused on the evolution of the horror-psychological plot and on the twists and turns than on the frenetic action typical of other similar productions. Usually the stories are set in an American town (the same one that gives the product its title) perpetually surrounded by a thick fog and at times covered by rains of ash, which was built on a sacred area for the ancient Indians. The area hides terrible secrets and a strong psychic power, so much so that every time a restless soul enters the city, Silent Hill is transformed, mutated into a nightmare scenario, as if it were molded on the pain of others to reflect what torments, even unconsciously, the visitor, transforming himself into a sort of purgatory capable of redeeming sinners. Or condemn them outright. Differences between versions Too bad for the slowness of the protagonist of the adventure sometimes in turning around or starting to run: in the first case you risk a bad end if you are surrounded by more enemies, while in the second case you risk being hit, given that Travis before start fleeing (Square button) takes a couple of steps. But apart from this and the bad habit of some monsters to be found immediately behind a door (they appear as soon as the area is loaded and attack) without giving the user almost any time to defend himself, the most annoying thing of the game remains in our opinion the impossibility of being able to freely manage the use of the camera, a very important element, especially in a similar title where it is sometimes essential to be able to control certain details calmly and better, or in fights, where it would be useful to be able to have a certain view. In Silent Hill: Origins it is only possible to place the camera behind the protagonist by pressing the L1 key, but this does not always bring advantages since in certain areas you end up snookered by a wall, a piece of furniture and other visual obstacles. It was thought that on PlayStation 2 the controls would have been modified and adapted to the more performing pad of the Monolith, but unfortunately this is not the case. Another masterpiece by Akira Yamaoka But the differences between the PlayStation 2 and PSP versions are on balance to be found mostly in the graphics sector. Nothing transcendental, mind you, but in any case the changes are there and noticeable. Let's say immediately that if we wanted to make a comparison, perhaps the engine of this Origins recalls the one used by Konami in Silent Hill 2. So, compared to the PSP version, here we have some improvements implemented both in the creation of the models of the characters and of the creatures, the whose unhealthy look stands out better than its laptop counterpart, which in scenarios, where most of the original textures have been replaced by slightly better ones, and the graphics have managed to perfectly recreate that filthy, that ~rusty~, decadent effect Another masterpiece by Akira Yamaoka , of the first Silent Hill. Even the fog, then, appears more dynamic, enveloping and believable. Everything is enhanced by dignified real-time lighting and by that grainy effect typical of the saga that covers everything and masks everything when necessary. Certainly there are defects: in some moments there is an inexplicable drop in the quality of the details, especially in some elements characterizing certain areas, such as the bodies scattered around the hospital which are taken directly from the original, without a minimum restyling. And we still don't like the model used to create nurse Lisa, light years away visually from the sweet girl who appeared on PSX. Worth mentioning, at the beginning of the game, is the option to choose the display in 4:3 or 16:9. As for the audio component, there is little to say: once again the great Akira Yamaoka gave his best, giving us a splendid soundtrack worthy of his previous works, while as regards the effects during the game we are in line with those produced in the other chapters of the saga, even if at times there seems to be a slight asynchrony between an action and the relative noise. Comment It will certainly not be innovative, it will perhaps be too stylistically anchored to tradition, and yet, despite some programming and conversion defects, Silent Hill: Origins proves to be a fairly decent title after all. Not the best of the series, but certainly a product that can be played without problems and in an engaging way in some moments, thanks to its classic twisted and tense atmosphere. It's true, perhaps the developers could have done more, especially in this version, in terms of playability and graphics, but it's stillalways a Silent Hill that, in some respects, seems better precisely because of its fidelity to the original style of the first episode, of the ~different~ Silent Hill 4. Pros: Nice to be able to return to Silent Hill Twisted environments typical of the series Atmospheric soundtrack Cons: Uncontrollable camera Longevity limited Graphically average", "date": "2008-06-10", "grade": null}
