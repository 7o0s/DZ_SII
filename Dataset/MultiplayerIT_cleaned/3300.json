{"name": "Crime O'Clock", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crime-oclock-recensione.html", "text": "When in 2017 Adriaan de Jongh launched Hidden Folks on the market, the so-called genre of hidden objects, i.e. titles in which the objective is to search for elements camouflaged in the scenario, had existed for some time. In reality, it existed before videogames, given that many classic puzzle publications (take The Puzzle Week) even had dedicated competitions, spread across several issues, which challenged readers to identify some objects hidden inside full-page images (sometimes also double page) full of details. The fundamental innovations introduced by de Jongh were on the one hand stylistic, i.e. the adoption of an extremely peculiar and captivating visual style, which recalled precisely that of classic genre illustrations, and on the other target, with the typical mechanics of the genre revised just enough to free it from the casual band. So where the players' goal was always to find well-camouflaged objects in the scenarios, the game space had been expanded dramatically, so much so that it could not be concentrated in a single screen. It was also possible to zoom in and out of the images to reveal little visible details and enjoy the excellent work of construction of the scenes adopted by the author, which were (and still are) very alive. Hidden Folks has set the standard, with strong sales and very positive reactions from players. As often happens, many have taken up the formula in a slavish way, simply trying to follow in the wake of de Jongh's success, while others have tried to add more profound elements of diversification, to make the experience of searching for objects somehow more personal and interesting, as for example done by Labyrinth City: Pierre the Maze Detective or, as we will see in the review, Crime O'Clock by the Italians Bad Seed. Surveys over time Progress in the investigation is marked on the scenarios The time stream is threatened by some particularly aggressive artificial intelligences, with initially not very clear purposes, which are causing numerous accidents to try to alter the history of humanity. Guided by another artificial intelligence, with whom we'll be talking throughout the game, we'll have to stop them by solving the cases as they arise. Each case cannot be solved in a single moment of time, but must be reconstructed by moving between the past and the future to reveal the dynamics of what happened and try to put a patch on it, so to speak. Thus, for example, we will have to prevent a man from writing a furious letter to his wife making her commit suicide, reconstructing the salient events of the day for both of them and intervening where possible to avoid the triggering cause of the marriage crisis. Or we will have to prevent a gladiator from using a lethal weapon, discovering the path that ended up in his hands. It is precisely around the concept of investigation that the novelties of Crime O'Clock revolve with respect to Hidden Folks and clones. The gameplay is always composed of the search for hidden objects within large hand-drawn scenarios (five in total), but with the player who is somehow called upon to conduct real investigations, with the search for hidden details that it always follows a coherent narrative thread, underlined by the interface itself, which highlights from time to time what is discovered. To increase the involvement there are some simple mini-games that we will be called upon to solve from time to time and which simulate some analysis functions of the allied artificial intelligence. Thus, for example, to carry out a chemical analysis we will have to rearrange the elements inside the vials by moving them in the right order; to obtain someone's identity we will have to reconstruct their face by aligning their details; or to trace a signal we will have to follow it by clicking on the connection nodes as quickly as possible. I notify Reading the game credits we discovered that Simone Tagliaferri, the one who wrote this review, has been added to the special thanks. Please note that it is not affiliated in any way with Bad Seed Games and did not collaborate in any way in the creation of the game. The inclusion is probably linked to the fact that he has followed the game with some attention, dedicating space to it on the pages of Multiplayer.it on several occasions, including writing a preview article. However, it is still right to warn readers of this detail, for a matter of transparency. Hidden objects As we said, the focus of the experience remains the search for objects in the five large scenarios, each of which has a different settingerent, starting from today's Milan. We won't reveal what the others are, but let's say that four of us will act practically immediately, while the fifth will only become accessible after the middle of the adventure, with the variety that is guaranteed by the unlocking of some skills, such as that of seeing inside some containers , or that of being able to view the inside of some buildings, which gradually and intelligently expand interactions, always giving the player the perception of having something new to do and try, as well as having to face more complex problems. Also consider that the scenarios change according to the moment in which they are observed, i.e. according to the so-called time tick set by the AI (during the campaign it is not possible to manually select the ticks to be displayed) with the characters present all following their day making the scenes very lively and dynamic, despite the static nature of the individual ticks. Relax Crime O'Clock offers very simple mini-games Crime O'Clock is a relaxing experience. The game involves you with investigations and its mini-games, but avoids in every way to transmit you performance anxiety, giving you advice on where to look and, if necessary, helping you with an optional progressive solution revealing system, which avoids getting bogged down. Even the mini-games, although they become more difficult in the advanced stages of the adventure, never try to hold back the player, but appear to him as tools for diversifying the investigations, where however everything always remains very guided and, somehow, intuitive. From this point of view, the user experience appears well-kept and clarifies the development studio's desire to make the game truly for everyone, i.e. never to oppress the player, who is always given a way to get by and move forward, creating coherent narratives in which the various steps always have a logical thread, which must be followed to arrive at the solution. Each scenario must be examined in the smallest detail Once the scenarios have been unlocked, however, an extra mode is activated which allows you to replay them in a more traditional way, without any kind of help, that is, in which you have to look for characters hidden among the various time ticks, net of related investigations or other, so as to considerably lengthen the life of the game and to be able to look more carefully at the various drawings, which are discovered full of goodies and quotations, such as for example the presence of two Rick and Morty emulators around Milan. Ultimately Crime O'Clock appears to be a well-kept title that fully succeeds in what it sets out to do. Which is no small thing these days.", "date": "2023-06-30", "grade": "8.5"}
