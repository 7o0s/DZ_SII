Inspired by the mechanics of the well-known Magic the Gathering and the spectacularity of the catchphrase Yu-gi-oh! Sony managed to churn out a niche product with truly remarkable potential and, above all, not at all obvious. For the uninitiated, the main feature of the combination of The Eye of Judgment with PlayStation Eye was precisely the possibility of ~scanning~ the cards so that PlayStation 3 reproduced them in the game complete with a corresponding three-dimensional and animated creature, to give life to exciting online challenges against other players, perhaps expanding your deck of cards with packs that can be purchased in a real shop. Seeing an arcane creature come to life in the palm of your hand was incredible until The Eye of Judgment collapsed under the weight of its own innovative mechanics. Scam-proof The free ride lasted less than a week. In a very short time, less honest players began to obtain images of the most powerful cards and print them on simple sheets of paper to create practically invincible decks. The balance of online challenges was irreparably upset and shortly thereafter the game succumbed to its fate, remaining an even more niche product than it already was. Well, this sad story will not repeat itself with The Eye of Judgment Legends on PSP as, quite simply, there is nothing to scan: the entire concept and game mechanics have been fully transported to the Sony portable console, together with the hundreds of existing cards and also some unpublished ones in a totally virtual version. This is perhaps the greatest advantage of this PSP port: it is completely cheat-proof. The only ways to expand one's decks essentially consist in winning new cards by defeating opponents in Story or multiplayer modes or by purchasing them directly from the virtual shop accessible from the main menu with the money earned thanks to our victories. Nothing easier, or almost. The player is allowed to create and save up to sixteen decks of cards, providing some variety in the style of play, especially if you want to face random players or friends over an Internet connection. To embellish this PSP version there is also a Story mode, largely absent in the PlayStation 3 version, which through textual dialogues and artwork serves as a pretext for a long series of duels that will entertain the player and swell his virtual wallet and his collection of cards. Rules of the Judgment The game mechanics have remained as they are and fans of the original title, or of the card game, will immediately find themselves at ease with the typical 3x3 grid on which to summon the creatures contained in the cards. The game initially distributes five cards to the player and his opponent, also allowing them to be drawn again, and from that moment on it is a succession of alternating rounds in which one must make painstaking use of the Mana points, necessary to play the cards and recharged by only two per shift. Whoever wins the most boxes on the game board wins and until then it's war with spells, evocations and sneaky strategies. Going into detail is practically impossible: the basic rules of The Eye of Judgment Legends are quite simple but the peculiarity of each card and the hundreds of possible combinations make each game incredibly varied. As generally happens with this type of game, it is the end user who builds his strategy around his deck and vice versa; it takes time and patience to learn all the tricks of the trade and be able to assemble decks that are personal and free from weaknesses. To frame the excellent gameplay, although repetitive by nature, there is a technical sector which, unfortunately, is also a bit the weak point of The Eye of Judgment Legends: on the grid we will see reproduced the creatures that represent our cards with defined and well animated polygonal models but one of the most captivating features of the PlayStation 3 version, the short animation in the attack phase, is almost completely absent in this porting, limited to a few and rare cards. It is true that faster and more frenetic challenges follow, but the charm of seeing one's creatures come to life remains compromised and makes The Eye of Judgment Legends a much more ordinary and essential game.", "date": "2010-05-20", "grade": "7.5"}
