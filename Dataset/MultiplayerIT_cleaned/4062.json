In short, what is called an uphill start... Like the first...but worse The first thing that catches your eye about Bike Unchained 2 is the enormous stylistic gap between this title and its predecessor: having completely abandoned the cartoonish look, the bright colors and the emphasis on the story of the first episode, we find ourselves with a product that completely renounces the narrative component (and this can also be seen as a positive fact) and comes with an incredibly sparse and dated look, which aims for greater realism without obviously having the possibilities. Raw polygonal models, scenarios with an elementary composition and menus that seem to have been taken from a ten-year-old game are therefore the order of the day in Bike Unchained 2, testifying to an evident laziness in the development which unfortunately was not limited to the technical sector . Even from an exquisitely playful point of view, in fact, little or nothing has changed compared to the previous title, which is quite serious if we consider that we are not really talking about a flawless masterpiece. The bulk of the experience is therefore again represented by downhill races that offer little space for interaction: the cyclist on the screen follows the track independently, and the player has the only task of keeping his finger pressed on the touchscreen to make him gain speed downhill or to make him land on two wheels after a jump, as well as to perform quick taps in the uphill sections to make him pedal and thus not waste precious seconds. The winner is whoever reaches the finish line in the shortest possible time, with the opponents represented by three ghosts of real (or assumed) users with their respective performances. From time to time, slopestyle competitions focused on the execution of tricks also appear, an authentic weak point of the first Bike Unchained and which the developers have well thought out to keep substantially unchanged in all their very little effectiveness. Too bad, because the basis for a potentially pleasant title would also be there: the gameplay is perfectly suited to mobile use and the progression model is well studied, but everything else is simply too mediocre to be able to emerge in a crowded landscape like the mobile one. Also in its way of interpreting the free to play category, Bike Unchained 2 is one of many: there is the usual double currency model, the package reward system, the upgrades to improve your bike, the aesthetic accessories with which customize the cyclist, the weekly challenges and everything that has already been seen in thousands of similar titles. The good thing is that you can go on for free without too many problems, but where in-app purchases don't arrive, it is very likely that an inevitable and profound boredom will arrive - even well in advance.", "date": "2018-09-14", "grade": "5.0"}
