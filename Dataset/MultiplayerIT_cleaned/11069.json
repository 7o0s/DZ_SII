{"name": "LEGO Batman", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lego-batman_a.html", "text": "The LEGO series, which has been gaining widespread acclaim on all platforms in recent years thanks to the excellent work of the Traveller's Tales team, for its latest incarnation is based on one of the most famous superheroes in the world: Batman. Together with the inevitable Robin, the Dark Knight will have to deal with his most bitter enemies through a series of stages equipped with the mechanics that we all know by now. And on mobile? Well, in this case things change radically: the action is no longer a couple, but concerns Batman alone. Furthermore, the mechanics are different from what was seen on PC and console: LEGO bricks no longer play an active role, but limit themselves to characterizing the aesthetics of the characters and settings, without affecting the adventure. In short, LEGO Batman on mobile is a classic platformer, with practically no innovative elements. But let's go in order... Gotham City is under siege: some of the most dangerous criminals held in Arkham Asylum have escaped, and now threaten the city with a small army of ruthless henchmen. Batman is immediately notified, so he gets on board the Batmobile and tries to trace the fugitives, who in the meantime have stolen some precious memorabilia from a museum. In the role of the masked vigilante, who for the occasion sports a decidedly particular look (he's made of LEGO bricks...), we'll have to explore a series of stages and eliminate all the enemies we find on our way. The goal in each level is to collect as many ~coins~ as possible, as well as recover the stolen items. The control system is not that typical of mobile platformers, as we will be able to move and make the character jump by acting on the d-pad, but the other actions have been assigned to keys at least in an unusual way: key 5 to throw the grappling hook in diagonal, 1 key to fire the batarang (the only offensive manoeuvre, both from close range and from medium distance), 3 key to parry attacks by sheltering with the cloak. The game makes extensive use of platforms: in fact it can be said that the stages consist mostly of shelves placed at different heights, which can be reached using ~elevators~ or the same grappling hook. The standard action, which includes various exploratory phases, is replaced by direct confrontation with the bosses at certain moments, a confrontation unfortunately managed poorly and without particular ideas: the characters are there shooting at everything they have, moreover without variations between enemy and the other. The technical realization of this mobile reduction does not go beyond the sufficiency, unfortunately. The sprites are quite rough and uninspired in design, even if they boast a decent set of animations. The big problem is the locations, which ooze mediocrity from every pore and make this conversion look almost like an amateur product, especially for the use of colors. The sound consists of MIDI music that refers to the soundtrack of the Batman films directed by Tim Burton: the quality is what it is, but at least they are truly evocative songs. PRO MIDI music taken from the Batman movies Discreet animations Simple, perhaps suitable for younger people AGAINST Mediocre graphics, especially for colors Linear and uninvolving", "date": "2008-11-11", "grade": "S.V."}
