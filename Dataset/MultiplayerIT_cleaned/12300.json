{"name": "Solasta: Crown of the Magister", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-recensione.html", "text": "The electronic RPG genre was born with a very specific purpose: to replicate the beauty and fun of role-playing around a table with a group of friends on the screen. It's not for nothing that the first great series, such as Ultima or Wizardry, just to name a couple of the many possible names, were developed by people who madly loved the pen and paper experience. It is no wonder that most of the first RPGs had very strong references to rule systems such as that of Dungeons & Dragons, as well as to the atmospheres of genre literature classics such as The Lord of the Rings, Conan or Isaac Asimov's founding cycle . Not only that: the packages themselves contained preparatory material for the game, with manuals that sometimes exceeded hundreds of pages. Above it was information often vital to the adventure. Today such a solution, sometimes dictated by the limited space available in the game files, may appear blasphemy, but at the time those who played role-playing considered reading the manuals part of the experience itself and didn't complain much about it. In the Solasta: Crown of the Magister review, you will find that this game has that flavor there, so much does it seem eager to offer gameplay that we do not hesitate to define as ~classic~. Pure RPG The result of a successful crowdfunding campaign, Solasta: Crown of the Magister is the result of the work of Tactical Adventures, a studio founded by former Amplitude Studio Mathieu Girard. The objective of the game, faithfully based on the fifth edition of Dungeon & Dragons, is not to go up against Baldur's Gate III by Larian Studios or with Pillars of Eternity by Obsidian Entertainment, even though they belong to the same vein, but to offer a 'even more radical alternative to the same, by showcasing the dice rolls and providing advanced dungeon master tools, so that everyone can create their own adventures. Solasta itself is very similar to a Divinity: Original Sin, at least in the general setting: the view is in third person from above, although the game world is completely in 3D. You move by clicking with the mouse and, depending on the selected character, you can perform different actions with the interactive objects. In Solasta, even torches count At the beginning of Solasta, a party must be formed. If you want you can select four of the six characters already created, but in doing so you get lost along the way the excellent integrated editor, which allows you to choose classes, origins and freely distribute the available points among the various skills and characteristics. As you level up you will unlock subclasses - different depending on the class you choose - you will gain access to advanced skills, you will be able to register more spells and so on. The substance is that having reached the maximum level, the tenth, the party obtained can be very different from the starting one, in terms of skills and specializations, so as to pave the way for many unique solutions in terms of gameplay. The choice is completely up to the player. The only shortcoming of the editor is the lack of options for customizing the look. Surely Solasta doesn't aim to amaze visually, as we will see in the paragraph dedicated to the technical part, but something more could have been done on the variety front. game systems The character editor is very complete Once the gestation of the party is over, it's time for a tutorial: the adventure starts from a tavern, where our heroes, unknown to each other up to that moment, tell of the vicissitudes they faced to reach the place where they were summoned by a mysterious lord, that he has a job to entrust to him. The tales of the four correspond to as many very simple game sequences in which their unique characteristics and ways to make the most of them are illustrated. It is here that we discover how the chosen class not only affects the values in combat, as happens in most role-playing games of more modern conception, but allows different interactions with the environment and with the other characters. For example, a thief has all the tools to move stealthily and not be seen by enemies, so as to hit them from behind and a warrior can use his strength not only to fight, but also to make prodigious leaps with which to reach distant or hidden platforms . What becomes clear already after a few hours of immersion in the adventure is that the developers have worked a lot on the game system, trying to enhance each class and, as already mentioned, creating a complex progression, but which at the same time guarantees uniqueness to each party. The watchword is versatility and at its altar every sacrifice appears valid. At some point dn the main campaign you find yourself with the possibility of freely exploring the available places, encountering situations that must be understood before being faced. A group of enemies appear too strong for our party? When fighting you have to take into account the characteristics of the battlefield It probably is... best to come back when we've leveled up a bit or have better gear. A puzzle doesn't seem to be solvable because we are missing a certain object? It is probably located elsewhere, so it makes no sense to waste too much time. The player, who is left with a lot of space, is subjected to continuous choices, not necessarily vital, with personal initiatives that are often rewarded. Note that we finally have a game where torches make sense! Instead of being mere frills like in many other digital RPGs, they play a vital role here, because running in the dark isn't exactly recommended: there are enemies who take advantage of the darkness to attack the party and make them cannon fodder. There are opportunities to reply, but the initial disadvantage often involves a clear defeat or such a narrow victory that if you don't have a bonfire available to rest and recover, it becomes almost counterproductive. Combat system The graphic style is a bit anonymous The same ambition is also found in the strictly turn-based combat system, in which the individual classes are valued for what they are, leading the player to conceive the battlefield not as a simple chessboard, but in its entirety. Let's say that when, at the beginning of a fight, one is tempted to look around to find out if there is anything that could be useful (a hiding place for the stealthy characters, an elevated position for the magician, and so on), then one is faced with an excellent game system, which respects us and allows us to best express our style of play. The model followed by Tactical Adventure seems to be that of XCOM by Firaxis, of which some essential principles are also followed, but with the necessary differences. Beyond the functioning of turns, based on the consumption of two action points (one for movement and the other for attacks) in the order you prefer, many clashes offer different levels of depth, so much so that they are often lethal not for the strength of the enemies, but due to some planning error on our part. Many maps are built vertically In Solasta, to win, you need to consider all the factors in the field: opponent's forces, unit position, height of the battlefield, presence of ravines (into which enemies can be pushed) or objects of opportunity (drop a boulder to an opponent's head is often better than facing him directly), and so on. Underestimating these aspects leads to the sudden massacre of the party on more than one occasion, also considering the luck factor given by the roll of the dice. In principle, therefore, the combat system is excellent. The only drawbacks, if we want to consider them that way, are the random clashes, very bland and placed only as fillers, and the variety of enemies, not exactly stellar. These are trifles, but it is fair to mention them. Problems Solasta also has moments of rest Unfortunately Solasta also has some big problems. What stands out the most is certainly the lack of style: we are faced with an ultra-generic fantasy, with overall bad graphics, both for the details of the settings and for the models of the characters and their animations. Despite this, Solasta's main problem is certainly not offending the eyes, but how the narrative side was handled. The creation of such an open and multifaceted game system is not matched by the same care for the story told, as well as for the background of the game events. Incidentally, the non-player characters are often, indeed almost always, of few words, while the documents found here and there struggle to intrigue or at least be interesting. The quests themselves are introduced with very few words, as if they were a nuisance. A light in the dark Is it possible that peasants, nobles, guild members or whoever they all find it difficult to have a chat with the poor adventurers who have to save their lives? This lack of narration, let's call it that, is reflected a lot in the main campaign, which at certain times seems to have been conceived more as a stress test of the game system, than as a good adventure for the players to experience. We go around massacring enemies by following missions that we don't care about, because no one has managed to give him a minimum of pdepth. We specify that we were not expecting Tolstoy, but here we are at the minimum wage of the budding master.", "date": "2021-07-23", "grade": "8.0"}
