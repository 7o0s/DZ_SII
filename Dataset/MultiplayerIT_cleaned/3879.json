{"name": "RE:CALL", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recall-recensione.html", "text": "The screenshots in classic pixel art style frankly a little derivative could be misleading, but in the RE:CALL review we find ourselves analyzing a truly original game, based on a little-explored concept but full of potential for a character-driven puzzle adventure investigative. As the prologue already makes clear, with an even violent clarity, in this title we can manipulate memories, acting on continuous flashbacks to test alternative versions of reality in the present, until we find the solution to the puzzles through this progressive modification of the past. The idea is really fascinating and also excellently executed for at least half of the game, only to then dilute itself a little excessively in the second part, perhaps in search of greater longevity which, however, is harmful at a certain point. In any case , RE:CALL remains an interesting experiment that deserves to be tried, because there are not many cases in which one is genuinely displaced and intrigued at these levels in front of an original idea, even considering the variety of experiences provided by the rich panorama indie. Between teen drama, adventure with fantastic implications and crime story with thriller influences, RE:CALL never abandons a certain ironic spirit and often winks at the player in a constant meta-game that aims to break down the fourth wall, in the contents of the story as in gameplay situations. This is because we are always called into question both in the progressive construction of memories and therefore of reality through our choices, and as entities with which the protagonists feel they are in contact, even without fully understanding it, becoming part of the story. Crimes and memories RE:CALL, an example of the possible choices of a memory that change the present You immediately start as Dominik, a sort of gangster (or something like that) engaged in an infiltration operation in the hideout of a gang of criminals and already in the first minutes you understand how this game follows different rules from the standard ones. We are in a flashback, with the protagonist recalling the actions taken to come face to face with his rival, but with each mistake we return to the beginning of the scene, with the possibility of making different choices, modifying the memory and also influencing the situation in the present. The story then makes a clear break and presents us with the real protagonist, a very different character from the previous one. Bruno Gallagher is in fact a scruffy and lonely boy, always lived on the edge of the city's richest and most fashionable youth, who often mock him for his tendency to be overweight. For these reasons, Bruno finds himself at ease with rather strange and colorful characters , with which he finds himself involved in a mysterious crime that seems to be connected to a series of crimes that took place in the past, and in particular to a sad and disturbing story that has upset the protagonist's old school. RE:CALL, pixel art graphics are pretty standard Strengthened by the help provided by the ~ghost~ with whom he is constantly in contact and who guides his choices by allowing him to change memories and thus modify reality, Bruno must solve the complex riddle that seems to bind, in some way, the murder that happened in front of his eyes, the tragedy that marked his childhood at school, the deeds of the dark Dominik and the presence of the mysterious ~ghost~ who suddenly appeared in his life. Given the extremely simple staging, which recalls the style of 16-bit adventures, the narration takes place mainly through dialogues and close-ups on the portraits of the characters, with a good level of writing even if completely in English, all accompanied by the from a great original soundtrack. The manipulation of reality RE:CALL's characters are quite over the top The gameplay is largely focused on the mechanism of manipulation of memories, which consequently modify the reality surrounding the protagonists. The system usually includes a flashback in which the protagonist recalls what happened previously, but with the possibility of making different decisions from time to time, which intertwine and influence each other until the right path and solution to the problems is found. enigmas posed by contemporary reality. It is not a matter of wide ranges of choices but rather of crossroads or little more, centered on a pre-established interaction on a few objects, but the combination of these determines different ramifications which can have numerous different effects, which often must be thoroughly tested to start to see the solution of the puzzles. It is certainly an easier system to prove than by itselfbend, and the initial prologue probably represents the best possible introduction to this mechanism, immediately launching us into this web of possibilities. The seven chapters that make up the story follow an excellent narrative progression and it is easy to get caught up in the story thanks to the strangeness of the events and to the twists and turns present, although it is not really a very complex plot. RE:CALL, changing memories also affects those of other characters The characters, although based on fairly classic tropes, are still well characterized and easily push towards identification. The main problem of RE:CALL is rather the pace of the game and the way in which the excellent basic idea on which a large part of the gameplay is structured tends to dilute until it gets lost in the last chapters, leaving room for less inspired puzzles and sections stealth. It's true that a continued reliance on the mechanics of memory manipulation might have felt too stilted at one point, but more balance from start to finish would have been welcome.", "date": "2023-01-28", "grade": "7.5"}
