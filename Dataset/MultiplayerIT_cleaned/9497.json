{"name": "Hai paura del buio?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/84567-papa-sangre-hai-paura-del-buio.html", "text": "Abandoned houses full of undead, claustrophobic corridors or cursed forests populated by scary enemies ready to leap out of that shadow over there. Horror titles try in every way to terrify the player, often relying on a strong visual component, made up of disgusting-looking monsters, spooky environments and continuous plays of light and shadow. It's almost ironic that Papa Sangre, one of the creepiest video games to hit the App Store to date, has absolutely nothing ~video~ about, focusing the entire experience on other senses. The young developers of the Somethin' Else team have in fact wanted to touch the emotional strings of the player by challenging one of the most suffocated phobias of human beings: the fear of the dark. If being in a room in the company of a zombie isn't creepy enough, the inability to see the enemy or the game environment amplifies the sense of dread, claustrophobia and disorientation. The authors of Papa Sangre understood this well, and through sound effects alone they managed to create one of the most original horror experiences of recent times. Eyes closed terror Once they enter the Papa Sangre palace in order to save the soul of a loved one, the aim is to overcome different rooms full of obstacles, pitfalls and enemies, until the final meeting with the landlord. Put like this, the game may seem like a classic and uninteresting first-person survival horror, except that the player, as mentioned, will not see absolutely anything of what is happening: each room is totally dark, the player is devoid of his sense more trustworthy, and to orient himself within the building he can do nothing but concentrate on the sounds and noises that surround him. Precisely for this reason it is essential to have a pair of headphones, since the whole game is based on a binaural recording system, giving a surround effect and allowing you to understand the position of objects based on the origin of the sounds. The interaction takes place entirely through a few taps on the screen, thanks to which you walk, run or turn around: walking, for example, takes place by tapping rhythmically in the right and left corner, while the speed of the run varies according to the speed of touches; however, it is enough to abruptly lose the rhythm to stumble and end up upside down. A wheel at the top of the screen instead allows you to turn around 360 , although the lack of any gyroscope support is really felt, which would have allowed you to immerse yourself even more in the gaming experience, further shifting the attention from sensoriality tactile to auditory. Despite the total lack of visual feedback, the level of tension and anxiety always remains very high: each room is usually inhabited by a dangerous guardian, and is full of traps to avoid while trying to reach the exit. Important objects and exit doors are signaled with small acoustic effects, a small but obligatory compromise to make the passage from one level to another sensible and possible. In one of these rooms, for example, you have to collect a key placed exactly next to a ferocious sleeping dog. The player is thus forced to go around him a few times before being able to understand which of the two, at a certain point, is closest to him. More advanced levels add even more spice: the water on the floor will make a noise with every step, while a broken branch could wake up a guardian who promptly runs in the direction of the noise. On these occasions the best thing to do is start running trying not to trip and hoping not to step on other noisy objects in the room. And, again, some rooms are populated by opponents who move continuously, dramatically increasing the panic when the noises get louder and louder. Played in the dark and possibly with your eyes closed, so you don't even see the light emitted by the screen, the anxiety that is created reaches levels never seen before in a game for iPhone and iPod Touch, creating sensations of fright and helplessness that anyone played Amnesia should know well.
