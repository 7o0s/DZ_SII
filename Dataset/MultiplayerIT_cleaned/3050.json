{"name": "The Elder Scrolls Online: Greymoor", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-elder-scrolls-online-greymoor-recensione.html", "text": "It is not easy for MMORPGs to survive in today's market and those capable of retaining a good share of players can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The Elder Scrolls Online is certainly one of these, a title that has seen its community grow over the years thanks to a good amount of updates and the partial abandonment of the monthly fee. Bethesda therefore seems to have understood that this could be a good year to push on the accelerator and reach a new slice of nostalgic gamers, perhaps far from the massive online genre but very close instead to the settings and stories related to Skyrim. We have therefore decided to approach this review of The Elder Scrolls Online: Greymoor by playing the role of a complete novice attracted by the new expansion, determined precisely to take us to the snowy lands trodden by Dovakhin at the time, with a leap back of about a thousand years. You will therefore not find an in-depth analysis of the gameplay content or of the changes to the classes (vampires above all) since in this specific case the new players will take for granted everything that Bethesda will offer them. So does it make sense, in 2020, to start this adventure? Welcome back lizard! Having never taken hold of the title up to now, we launched ourselves headlong into choosing breed and class following what we had available and basing ourselves solely on our personal taste. This is how an Argonian Warden is born, ready to restore order with his scaly tail and a glittering amber crest. We chose the class among the six available but we were looking for something that was able to cause damage over a distance but also be able to heal in the rear since we had a craving to try the dungeons during our leveling phase, which later turned out to be the biggest and juicy source of leveling ever. After careful aesthetic research we arrived at a rather satisfactory result, only to realize later that the average height of the NPCs next to us was decidedly higher than ours and also in terms of muscles we seemed undernourished, in short, we had just created a lizard that had escaped from some vase in a garden of giants. Not bad though, this gave us rather unique appearances compared to the other players and above all, after spending at least half an hour in the editor, we didn't have the slightest desire to mess around a second time, we wanted to play! Apart from this small creative hitch, the entry into The Elder Scrolls Online could not be better: the new chapter of Greymoor immediately welcomes all new players with a cinematic that introduces the story by strongly winking at the initial cut scene of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, with our hero taken out of the game and imprisoned in an unspecified place in the region. This time, however, at our side we will find Fennorian, a vampire who by pure chance was traveling with us and whose investigations into a terrible den of witches were taking him right near Solitude. Escape from prison, with a few locks to pick through a minigame and the urge to collect whatever we saw on the tables and racks, almost made us forget we were inside an MMO, thanks to a story with some narrative limitations , that is true, but also particularly well thought out and engaging. In short, TESO, moving away from Korean MMOs and also from World of Warcraft, will make you feel almost as if you were in a single player game and during the thirty hours of our adventure we let ourselves be carried away pleasantly by the narration rather than by the desire to compete or climb furiously level. We therefore want to underline how good Bethesda's work has been in this case, capable of welcoming new players and not making them feel lost even for a minute. The credit also goes to the fact that we have found old Skyrim acquaintances such as Lyris Titanborn, here even with a much deeper profile and a better outlined character during the entire story than we had seen in the past. In short, the whole story runs on excellent tracks, accompanying us in the re-discovery of Western Skyrim with due calm, making us pass near known and well-recognizable places such as the Dragon Bridge and only towards the end dragging us towards the abyss of Blackreach, giving a new environment to be explored. The idea of inserting Werewolves, witches and Vampires in a single quest line is also excellent, so as to offer a good variety of enemies in a single chapter. Growing up, again, in Skyrim Our interest was to understand how valid TESO was as an experience in 2020 and we dwelt briefly, at leastno for the moment, on all those crafting skills that fill menus and statistics, focusing on the lighter and more playfully fun ones. For example, Scry brings a pleasant mini-game that will allow you to find artifacts to add to your collection but also mounts, pets and housing objects, a feature that we have only touched on in our journey. Instead, we relied on a guide when we had to level up since Greymoor, as well as the previous expansions, seems to take everything almost too much for granted. The three main stats - Stamina, Magicka and Health - are fairly self-explanatory but the whole system of unlocking skills and levels of active and passive skills differs quite a bit from Skyrim, requiring some commitment for new players before being handled with wealth. Fortunately, the build we opted for allowed us to try melee combat, but also to cast various spells and even become proficient in the use of the bow, which quickly allowed us to test all the peculiarities of the gameplay and choose then autonomously the way we prefer. This maturity arrives around the twentieth level, when you have become familiar with numbers, rewards and equipment and you will find yourself about halfway through your journey to the cap. The thing that most pleasantly struck us about Greymoor was the ability to keep us nailed to a single location for all those hours without ever getting bored, with a well-known panorama that is always able to surprise us thanks to excellent views and a visual quality that, even if not up to par with the latest releases of Skyrim, it still held its own, also supported by a minimalistic interface. One of the few flaws of Greymoor is hidden inside the rift of immersion caused by the other players, who arrive on fiery horses accompanied by exotic creatures at their side, with summons in tow and gleaming armor (perhaps bought through microtransactions in crowns) that clash a bit with all the Viking fantasy setting that we had really enjoyed in Skyrim. However, it is a tolerable and understandable situation, by virtue of the many years and the dozens of regions available in the world of TESO, an essential element of that still being a massive game. Getting to the title now after all this time since launch shouldn't even scare you though. The three alliances that indicate your faction are not relevant in the PVE sphere and the contents also automatically adapt to your level, so as to allow you to do any dungeon with extreme ease and join any group of already existing players. The entry from healer or tank is substantially instantaneous as always and only the dps take a few more minutes. Furthermore, for the first thirty levels, even a single healing spell will be enough to queue up as a healer and easily keep the party going, which allowed us to explore the instances quickly but also to throw ourselves into the two public dungeons without problems. Sociability will invest you while you will therefore try to complete the area 100% having to rely on three other companions to complete the dungeons or join groups of warriors to get the better of the bosses and Harrowstorms, rather basic but randomly generated public quests great reason to keep players busy given the succulent daily rewards. PVP is then added to a long list of things to do, with a classic construction divided into activities within the battlegrounds and related rewards, contents that have always been present on TESO and practically unchanged with the last chapter.", "date": "2020-06-08", "grade": "7.5"}
