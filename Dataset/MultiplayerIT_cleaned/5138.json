{"name": "Steep", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/177369-steep-spettacolo-ad-alta-quota.html", "text": "There don't seem to have been any particular hitches in the production of Steep, announced six months ago and anticipated by a generous beta, the Ubisoft extreme sports simulator has already been in stores for a few days and proves to be one of the most ambitious sports projects of the end of the year. The timing of the French house is commendable (the title is developed by the Annecy division), which managed to package the product in time for the Christmas holidays. Considering that Steep is entirely set in the Alps and characterized by tons of snow, this is the ideal title to keep us company on cold winter days. We took a little longer than necessary for the product review, as we tested the product with active servers. We have played a copy of the title for a long time, obtaining mixed but substantially positive impressions, if you are looking for a spiritual successor to exponents such as SSX, 1080 and Cool Boarders, you are in the right place and you should really keep reading. Ubisoft is not afraid to take risks and inserts four sports disciplines in Steep Christmas holidays The most surprising aspect of Steep is its innovative formula, capable of approaching the genre of extreme snow sports through a series of largely unusual ideas. The title is essentially an open world set in a gigantic map, which represents, as already mentioned, a transposition of the Alpine chain located between Italy, Switzerland and France. Once we have entered the game and connected to the Ubisoft servers, we are introduced without too many pleasantries to the necessary initial tutorial, essential and not very exhaustive. On this occasion we have the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with the four disciplines proposed by the title: skiing, snowboarding, paragliding and wingsuit. Through a dial menu it is possible to change them easily at any time, but also to decide whether to simply continue on foot, provided that the snow allows it. Exploration is an important component of production, as one of the purposes is to search and discover new places associated with specific challenges. But to get started in the sweetest and most painless way possible, the game offers a set of pre-set races following the on-screen instructions and the commentary (in Italian) that tells us what to do. The points of interest begin to light up on the gigantic map with an inexorable frequency, so much so that after just a few hours it is full of activities to be carried out, in the full style of the French house. The aim, if we really have to find one, is to complete the 100 challenges included in the game, but also to file our personal records by comparing them with those of the community. Finally, it is also possible to create real custom ones to play in the company of friends, a feature that best outlines the personality of Steep, a title that is not exclusively multiplayer, but strongly devoted to this component. In fact, all the real players are in full view and it is possible to involve them in our activities at any time. Skiing holiday As mentioned, the real protagonist of Steep is the overwhelming map, which can be recalled at any time by the player and which shows all the challenges and discovered places in real time. The numerous information on video is shown through the augmented reality technique, in this way the graphical interface essentially disappears, further favoring the legibility of the routes and the map itself. The only on-screen menus that we can call up, independent, respectively manage the choice of discipline and the customization of our character, able to wear numerous objects that can be unlocked during the game or purchasable with the internal currency (also purchasable with real money). The characteristic of presenting various disciplines was clear right from the presentation, so much so that Steep is not identifiable, like its illustrious predecessors, as a mere snowboard simulator, but a true sports multi-event. Of course, it doesn't mean that we are dealing with four games in one, but the diversity of the disciplines helps to make the experience varied and sometimes disorienting. Unfortunately, not all of them are completely successful. Snowboarding is certainly and fortunately among our favorites, representing a large percentage of the competitions and contemplating the execution of tricks - when required - to increase one's score, in full SSX style or, in the skateboarding sector, the SKATE series by Electronic Arts . The wingsuit is also exciting, protagonist of a series of events that can be completely assimilated to unbridled races along thrilling passages. At the bottom of our preferences is paragliding and the competitions associated with it, rather boring and frustrating otherwisen the maneuvers necessary to maintain the correct altitude are carried out with precision. In fact, in flying races it is essential to cross circular areas that represent the checkpoints of the route, skipping one of them involves the immediate cancellation of the race, an eventuality which unfortunately will often happen, also aided by physics that is not always understandable. The PlayStation 4 Pro version Steep should present several improvements on PlayStation 4 Pro compared to the base version, regarding resolution, frame rate and graphic quality. For the moment we have focused on the normal PlayStation 4 version, the subject of this review, but we are preparing a special to tell you all the differences for Sony's enhanced console. Follow us in the next few days to discover them! Playstation 4 trophies Many Trophies await those who will try their hand at the snow-covered slopes of Steep, with the first bronze medals that will arrive even if only completing the initial training, which is practically mandatory. But even after a few hours of play it will be possible to win your first silver, it will be enough to put a lot of effort into improving your personal bests. Happy skiing! Higher and higher Graphically Steep brings us back to what should be the standards of a true current-gen production. It is not only the impressive care taken in the creation of the snow and the scenery, with ever-changing passages that contemplate glaciers, villages, playgrounds and breathtaking views, but the technology that drives the entire production: the most sensational detail lies in the total absence of uploads, the entire game is able to remain in memory without apparent pauses, excluding those instantaneous ones that occur between actual races and map consultation. The PlayStation 4 version we tested adds native 1080p resolution to everything, albeit with a frame rate limited to 30 frames that is not exactly unassailable (there may be surprises on Pro, read the box for more information), and a soundtrack full of songs appropriate to the situation. The set is headed by Boomfunk MC's Freestyler, a piece that nostalgically takes us back sixteen years. Even if it represents a concrete, valid and even courageous production, we do not feel like recommending Steep indiscriminately, a product for many but not for all. The need for a permanent online connection, even if the Plus subscription is not mandatory for the solitaire mode, will not be a particular thing that everyone likes. There was no way to run the game without a connection to the Ubisoft servers, which could lead to some potential problems. The customization interface, not secondary considering the many objects available, is rather slow and imprecise on consoles, denouncing a setting probably conceived for PC. Finally, the absence of a real purpose and a story mode, which is an understatement to define essential, represents another element that should not be underestimated. The game offers some bizarre challenges and sequences where we find ourselves interacting with the spirits of the mountains, but it is of a really weak pretext from a single player perspective for a title that obviously looks elsewhere.", "date": "2016-12-07", "grade": "8.0"}
