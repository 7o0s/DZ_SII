Despite having great limitations in terms of variety of titles available, the SEGA platform represented the wet dream of every ~graphic whore~ (let's put it in English, it's better), who could admire arcade perfect conversions or even better than the hall counterparts. Soul Calibur was a shining example of this philosophy: released as a coin-op in 1998, it arrived on the Dreamcast the following year, strengthened by a series of technical improvements and equipped with extra modes capable of adding body and depth to the experience . It wasn't an absolute novelty, in the sense that the series was on its second date after its debut on PSone with Soul Edge, but it certainly constituted a confirmation of the quality of the franchise, capable of clearing weapons and a particular combo system in a genre such as that of fighting games, already inflated at the time. Reproposed in HD on the Xbox LIVE Arcade in 2008 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the series, Soul Calibur finally arrived on iPhone and iPad, with a conversion very faithful to the original arcade but lacking the features that made the Dreamcast version truly unmissable. We are referring in particular to the Missions Mode and the Team Battle: in the first mode, by selecting a character among those available, one moved on a map and faced fights contextually to the journey, gradually unlocking objects, costumes and artwork; in the second one competed in a direct elimination battle between teams made up of eight warriors. The most serious lack, however, is that of multiplayer, which is not present either locally or online. A big limit for the longevity of the game, as well as a contradiction in terms of the sales price on the App Store, among the highest ever seen: 11.99 euros, temporarily lowered to 9.99 to celebrate the launch, even higher than that of the XBLA version (which costs 800 Microsoft Points). Welcome to the stage of history Having exhausted the list of critical issues (hello, Tanzen), let's see instead what are the elements that should push Soul Calibur fans to buy the Namco Bandai fighting game in this portable edition. There are four modes available: Arcade Battle, which constitutes the core of the experience and sees us face a sequence of opponents until the final confrontation with Inferno, the personification of Soul Edge; Time Attack, in which each fight is timed and we must try to finish it as quickly as possible; Survival, where with a single energy bar we will have to defeat the largest number of opponents in sequence; Extra Survival, based on the same concept but in which one hit is enough to win or lose. Completing the Arcade Battle with each warrior allows us to unlock another one, up to a total of nineteen characters, or all those present in the arcade game and on the Dreamcast. It is a fairly large rose, which guarantees a certain variety in terms of gameplay. The latter is effectively supported by a fairly responsive and precise touch control system, with the keys that can be repositioned at will from the options screen. Even performing a tricky paper maneuver like the lateral slip is quite easy, and overall there are few uncertainties, so a great job has been done in this regard. The technical sector is also good, which however in some respects has not completely convinced us: the polygonal models are fairly detailed, but the fluidity is significantly lower than the original and there are also some cuts in the animations. Furthermore, the bitmap elements in the background, evidently children of another era, do not go well with the Retina Display and lack sharpness.
