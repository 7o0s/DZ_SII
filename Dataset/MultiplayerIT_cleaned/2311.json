{"name": "Tarzan Freeride", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tarzan-freeride.html", "text": "The ape man A few years ago, precisely in 1999, the Tarzan film was released in cinemas. After the success achieved, Disney has decided to bring its goose that lays golden eggs in the world of video games. Everyone was thinking of a simpleton game that would have followed the success of the film to make some money; but the game turned out to be a good platformer a couple of points above the sufficiency. Now the screamer in his long johns returns to PS2 in better shape than ever, ready to rock the screen again with his deadly screams! As I mentioned in the prologue, the game has many changes compared to the PSX title and I'm not talking only about the graphics, but just about the game structure. The game is divided into various levels which are mainly based on: jungle exploration, bunjee jumping, water skiing and winsurfing! Of course I'm speaking in metaphors. You won't find Tarzan on a latest generation American table but on an excellent leaf capable of performing who knows what missions. Graphics From the images that you find attached to the review, you will immediately realize that the Ps2 hardware has certainly not been exploited to the maximum, but despite everything the graphics remain very clean and settle on good levels also considering the type of game. Great water effects. Although the body of water remains unaltered by winds or other phenomena, it is still well done and as Tarzan passes by, the splashes created with enormous skill are wasted. The water perfectly reflects the surrounding figures which suddenly disappear when the protagonist glides over it. In particular moments such as bunjee-jumping and sliding on logs (remember the famous scene from the film) there is not the slightest trace of pop-ups. The textures are well made but often some elements seem rather angular The computer graphics movies are really excellent and manage to combine the 3D of video games with a cartoon style that manages to bring the adventures of the film to life by making them interactive with the help of the joypad. The story continues.... The story of the game is well designed and is always developed by the CG cutscenes present in almost every level. The protagonists are Tarzan (how strange), Jane and Prof. Porter, a scientist friend of the two protagonists. Naturally, there is no shortage of the antagonist who this time is Oswald Garner, another scientist who, to achieve his shady plans, locks up monkeys and other animals and subjects them to terrible experiments! It's up to us to free them and bring them back to their anxious mothers who await Tarzan, the hero of the jungle, with their little one on their shoulders. The game features two main modes: story and Terk's challenges. Both, even if well made, are not very long-lived. The first is the main one, the second is instead a gimmick that serves to increase interest for a while. It is nothing more than the usual ~Time attack~ or complete the levels previously made in the story mode as quickly as possible. Longevity, in itself, is a small thing but considering the target and the difficulty of some levels it settles on good levels, above all because if you don't collect some objects you have to go back to pick them up to continue the adventure. In the long run the game could start to bore as a bit repetitive but only towards the end. There are 15 levels divided into two screens. All levels are scrolling, meaning there will be mandatory directions to take and sometimes some crossroads. The controls in general respond well only a few times it will happen to fall for no apparent reason. Sound The sound is very good. The music that accompanies the levels, even if a little monotonous, is catchy as are the sound effects: roars, trumpets and so on. With a button you can even perform the famous scream that will attract the attention of the surrounding animals that will come to your aid. The dubbing is completely in Italian as well as the menus and everything else. The voices are well distributed characters and never feel mechanical. After all, Disney has always spoiled us with excellent translations and in the playground still present in our language, only this detail should make us think. To conclude Little by little you will get carried away by the speed of this game and you will jump from one liana to another very easily. You will find a certain satisfaction in sliding on a log, jumping, taking the vine, climbing and climbing. The game is well done and will definitely not disappoint old fans. A couple of games will be enough to feel like the king ofthe jungle! Pros: Clean graphics Great depth Good sound Quite precise controls Cons: Poor longevity if you get by with platformers Limited target Once finished you won't play it again From drawings to video games Who doesn't know Disney? Who didn't love Disney? We will all remember the times when we were accompanied by our grandparents to see these fantastic films born from the pencil of skilled and passionate designers. By now the years have passed and in the era of technology and videogame entertainment there is perhaps no more space for those cartoons, which now seem intended for children. Despite this, today I find myself talking about Disney Interactive which, with the help of Ubisoft, produces a game that we can improperly call a sequel to the previous PSX title, I say improperly because the genre has changed from many points of view. Here you are Tarzan!", "date": "2001-12-17", "grade": null}
