It goes without saying that the officially licensed racer Tourist Trophy, developed by the French team KT Games, aims to offer a driving experience that starts from these assumptions , where tension is always high, the slightest mistake can produce a disastrous fall and the barriers represent a death trap for anyone who bumps into them at over two hundred kilometers per hour. Gameplay The driving model of TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 2 uses a different approach to the usual, in its own way captivating, with the bike ~swinging~ at the bottom of the screen during the bends rather than always remaining in the center of the view. The scrolling of the scenario is also very fast, which produces a great sense of speed which, in combination with a sound design capable of emphasizing the noise of the wind (which changes depending on the camera we choose to use, realistically), ends up further increase the feeling of tension we mentioned at the beginning. At first the power of the bikes scares a little, especially because there is no rewind button that can make us recover from a fatal blunder, so you need to familiarize yourself with the controls and take the measurements of the tracks well so that you can be competitive. The result is a solid, spectacular and adrenaline-pumping system, which tends towards simulation while keeping the arcade elements of the experience in mind. It is therefore a pity that the Nintendo Switch controller systematically limits some aspects of the gameplay, not being equipped with analog triggers: it is impossible to dose acceleration or braking except by tapping the keys, and this negatively affects driving precision, making it difficult switching to more advanced and demanding settings. On the structural front, this new episode clearly improves the offer compared to the debut chapter, mainly thanks to the rich and multifaceted single player career, in which you start from the bottom with a team of few pretensions to aim for much more competitive teams and wealthy thanks to the results obtained on the track. However, these are not the only modes available: there is an interesting sandbox to explore freely to access increasingly complex challenges, as well as single events to face on each of the available tracks, timed races and a competitive multiplayer. The Nintendo Switch version We have so far painted TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 2 for what its merits are, even if unfortunately the Nintendo Switch version of the game does not have to deal only with the lack of analog triggers. The graphic differences compared to the other platforms are noticeable right from the motorbike selection screen, which have a decidedly flatter appearance, but are especially evident once the races begin. The outlines of the scenarios are in fact characterized by jagged lines that are impossible to ignore, which indicate a resolution certainly lower than 1080p in docked mode, and which ruin the visual impact of settings that we had found detailed and evocative on PS4 Pro (see review). At this juncture it was important to use a lighting system that we did not find on the Nintendo console, instead verifying numerous drops in frame rate that make some moments difficult to manage, especially when there are other opponents on the track and the race is therefore not conducted mainly solo. In portable mode the situation improves a lot, the small screen masks aliasing and the fluidity is certainly more stable. The uploads before each race, however, are too long: yet another of the elements that paint a picture of evident technical inadequacy.", "date": "2020-05-14", "grade": "6.0"}
