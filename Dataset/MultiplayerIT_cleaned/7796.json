The console version of the game comes out in July of 2012 in Japan, more than six months later in North America (February 2013, to be exact), and only mid-May in Europe, after a series of delays that made fans go on a rampage. The nervousness, however, was amply justified by two reasons: first, releasing a fighting game so many months after the original release means finding a much smaller and necessarily less competitive community; second, Persona 4: Arena was the first region-locked disc for the Sony console, which prevented the more enthusiastic and less patient gamers from importing the game in an American or even Japanese version. Apologizing over and over again through their Facebook page, the Zen United guys finally managed to bring one of Atlus's bravest bets to Europe too: to make a fighting game of the sequel to one of the most acclaimed jRPGs of recent years. Those who don't die see each other again In reality it is not the first time that the genre of jRPG and that of fighting games merge into a single entity: the most passionate will perhaps remember Ehrgeiz for PSOne, in which some characters from Final Fantasy VII appeared, and everyone certainly knows the Dissidia series Final Fantasy for PSP, in which the main heroes and antagonists of the historic Square Enix franchise give each other a thrashing. Persona 4: Arena, however, is something fundamentally different, because it proposes a plot that is not just a sleazy pretext in the service of the gameplay, but a well-finished and coherent story that acts as an official sequel to Persona 4 and probably also gives us some clues about the future of the saga and the infamous Persona 5 of which nothing is known yet. The story takes place two months after the ending of Persona 4, the 2008 jRPG for PlayStation 2 recently revived in a splendid edition for PlayStation Vita: Yu Narukami, the protagonist of the previous adventure (here characterized and dubbed based on the animated series), he's returning to the adorable little village of Inaba to spend Golden Week with the friends with whom he practically saved the world. Upon his arrival, however, two problems arise: first, some of his friends have disappeared into thin air; second, the Midnight Channel, that is the mysterious ~television~ dimension that had given him so many headaches, seems to be back on the air. Yu and the others are forced back into action to find out what's going on, and find themselves embroiled in a kind of knockout tournament that seems to have been set up by an evil version of the funny Teddie. As if that weren't enough, a mysterious power alters reality, forcing our heroes to face their worst fears. The battle is also joined by the robot Aigis, the glacial Mitsuru and the athletic Akihiko: three characters that those who have played Persona 3 will know well and who shed some more light on the Persona universe. The story is told to us through an endless series of texts, numerous illustrations and some cartoon cutscenes: the story mode is essentially a long visual novel interspersed with quick single-match fights, told in first person by each character. The events therefore tend to intertwine and repeat themselves, offering new points of view and further details on the intricate story, and there is no shortage of crossroads that lead to optional dialogues and alternative endings. Those who have played Arc System Works' Blazblues will know more or less what to expect, even if the progression in the campaign, in this case, is much more linear and less frustrating. To complete each scenario one hundred percent requires a very generous amount of hours, but we admit that reading and listening to hundreds of texts, however well written and spoken in English, can be a bit boring in the long run: better dose the experience little by little, and devote himself to the traditional Arcade mode in case you want to face a long single player session. Thou art I... and I am thou... The Arcade mode, the Story mode and the inevitable training option are certainly not the only possibilities available to solitary players. Score Attack, for example, challenges us to accumulate as many points as possible before losing a match. Lesson mode teaches us the basics of the game, step by step. Much more interesting, however, the Challenge mode: even here we are not faced with anything particularly original, it is the typical mode that requires us to repeat a certain sequence of normal and special attacks to form combos that become increasingly complicated and prohibitive . It is the classic component of piccmodern hiaduro that will delight geeks and cause a nervous breakdown for users less accustomed to the virtuosity of the joypad or joystick. It's still a great way to improve your playstyle and find out which character you enjoy using the most. In this sense, Persona 4: Arena apparently does not offer a huge variety: the characters available from the beginning are only twelve, practically half of what is offered by the most recent version of Blazblue, not to mention still other fighting games more popular. In reality, the fighters of Persona 4: Arena are so different from each other in terms of fighting styles and mechanics that it will take several hours to learn how to play them all perfectly; consequently, the need for a few more characters is felt very little, not to mention that the balance of the roster is practically perfect. No character appeared to us clearly stronger than the others, and each of them has something different to say than his battlemates. Arc System Works is once again confirmed as a master in designing interesting and peculiar mechanics that can be approached on several levels. In this case, the general mechanic that unites all the characters is, of course, the Persona. Those who have played the fighting game of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by Capcom can more or less get an idea of what awaits them: each character has four basic attacks, two physical and two performed by his Persona, a spirit that appears, strikes and disappears within a few moments. With a little timing it is therefore possible to trap the opponent in a grip of combos performed simultaneously by your character and his Persona, perhaps punctuated by special moves and super moves, here called SP Skills. SP Skills, as well as Instant Kills and practically any other offensive and defensive technique, consume the traditional gauge that fills up with each blow dealt or received. Thanks to the simplicity of the controls and the intuitiveness of the frantic combat system, Persona 4: Arena immediately appears to be a very user-friendly game; Arc System Works has even included a very simple combo that automatically ends with an SP Skill and requires a single button press, just to give novice players an advantage. A very simple and shallow fighting game, then? Yeah, for sure. Playstation 3 trophies The large list of Trophies includes 42 bronze, 5 silver, three gold and the final platinum. We're dealing with a fighting game, so unlocking them all won't be easy: we'll have to complete the various game modes with practically all the characters, or perform particular defensive and offensive maneuvers a certain number of times. It is not only skill that counts, but also perseverance! The barrel channel It is precisely the Lesson Mode, in forty-six steps, that reveals to us that Persona 4: Arena, with its limited roster, its automatic combos and its four basic attacks, hides a truly exceptional depth and complexity. The list of the characters' special moves, which are all a bit similar in execution, only scratches the surface: as we have said, each of them is played in a drastically different way from the others, and is characterized by a whole series of peculiar features that nod to the original jRPG. Almost every fighter is capable of inflicting a different anomalous state: this means that during the fights we will also have to manage conditions of poisoning, paralysis and more, which can prove lethal. What would happen if, in the middle of a fight, we find ourselves with left and right reversed? What if the opponent manages to inflict a penalty on us that prevents us from using special moves or recalling the Persona for a few precious seconds? Naoto, the masculine detective, can set invisible traps by keeping the enemy at arm's length with her gun. Aigis is unstoppable, but if he runs out of bullets, he's in big trouble. Yukiko seems like the weakest on the roster, but get her to level up her fire-based attacks, and all hell will unleash. And these are just a few examples. In addition to their unique characteristics, the various characters also have access to some offensive and defensive maneuvers, the knowledge of which can make the difference between victory and defeat. Between dodges, counterattacks, Guard Breaks, unstoppable blows and projections, there's truly something for everyone. And all of this, including the mechanics borrowed from Guilty Gear and Blazblue, has been redesigned to feel like an integral part of the Persona universe. There's even the famous All-Out Attack, complete with a skull-shaped speech bubble. In this sense, the work done by Arc System Works was formidable: already from the clear and modern style of the menus, logos and icons, it seems to be back to playing Persona 4. The backgrounds reproduce some of the most famous locations of the series, and the soundtrack offers us a valuable rearrangement of some of the most famous and appreciated songs of Persona 3 and Persona 4, among which a wonderful blues Aria of Soul stands out, the theme of the Velvet Room. The real protagonists, however, are the two-dimensional sprites, which once again confirm the exceptional talent of Arc System Works thanks to the quality and quantity of details and animations. In short, Persona 4: Arena is a real joy for hearing and for the eyes, and one of the most visually beautiful two-dimensional fighting games on the market. Persona 4: Arena is an excellent hybrid dedicated above all to those who love both fighting games and Persona 4.", "date": "2013-06-06", "grade": "8.5"}
