{"name": "Storyteller", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/storyteller-recensione.html", "text": "Developed by Argentinian Daniel Benmergui, Storyteller took a decade to wait, but the premise was too interesting to go unnoticed: the idea was to build a game of deduction - a real puzzle - on the mechanism of sequential narrative. It took Benmergui years to perfect his formula and to find a distinctive and immediately recognizable graphic style, but above all to look for a form of immediate and instinctive interactivity that would translate the abstraction that is the creative process into gameplay. We have completed the title of Benmergui and Annapurna on Nintendo Switch and in our review of Storyteller we will tell you if it was worth waiting all these years to play the storyteller. Tell a story Storyteller, a story inspired by the fairy tale of the frog prince Storyteller could be defined as a sort of Scribblenauts in reverse: if in the 5th Cell game the right words had to be chosen to solve the puzzles, in the Benmergui title the player has the right words immediately available, but to use them effectively he must first deduce the logic with which they were chosen by the author. Inspired by the stories of the great authors of the past, from Shakespeare to Conan Doyle, passing through the Brothers Grimm or Edgar Allan Poe, the 52 levels into which the thirteen chapters of Storyteller are divided tell short, disconnected and illustrated episodes as if they were comic strips of up to eight cartoons. The player has at his disposal a title, a certain number of spaces and some elements, which can be scenarios or characters, but which are actually real concepts, with which he must build an illustrated story. Although it is possible to choose in which order to play the various stages, the former perform a tutorial function that indirectly teaches the basics of the gameplay. There are no real instructions, nor didactic superimposed advice; Benmergui relies on the player's intelligence and deduction skills, which are basically the only tools available to solve the puzzles in the virtual book. It's a kind of puzzle game. The story that must be told - but sometimes there are multiple solutions to the same puzzle - must be deduced from the title, as mentioned, but also from the interactions between the protagonists and the scenarios in which it takes place. The way the characters react to each other, in different scenarios, suggests their character and the flow of the narrative, as well as a vague order of events. Examples are worth a thousand words and one of the first stages is right for us: entitled ~Seeing the ghost of a lover~, this puzzle offers us two scenarios/concepts (love and death) and two characters (Adam and Eve) . So the solution is quite simple, because in three vignettes we have to tell a story in which Adam and Eve are in love, one of them dies and the survivor sees his ghost. It's a story that pretty much resolves itself. In the following stages, however, things become enormously complicated. In ~Bernarno drinks poison~ we have three scenarios/concepts (forest, moon and poison) and two characters, Bernardo and Giulietta, who however react differently depending on the scenario in which they find themselves, alone or together, or on the lunar that changes depending on how many times we use the scenario in the six cartoons available. If we place Bernardo in a cartoon with the moon, we discover that he transforms into a werewolf: in the forest, before the full moon, Bernardo will love Juliet, but after the full moon, in the form of a werewolf, he will kill her. Storyteller, the puzzles become more and more articulated and complex As you can guess, the variables are many and the title of the story offers itself to different interpretations. Bernardo drinks the poison... why? And when? Does he drink it to commit suicide after unintentionally assaulting the woman he loved? It would seem the most logical solution - and tragic, a feature more or less shared in all the dark tales of Storyteller - but it is said that it is and in any case we must also order the story in a way that is visually logical. The control system relies on the Nintendo Switch keys and the touch screen, if you prefer, but as intuitive and immediate as it is, it must be said that the need is often felt for a mechanism that allows you to save the most articulated narratives in the event that it becomes necessary to change one or more elements while retaining the same number. Let's say that a good half of Storyteller is genuinely ingenious and fun to play: the puzzles test our deductive and logical skills, but also creativity and language properties. However, as the stage become more complicated and the variables multiply, one encounters truly frustrating moments in which one ends up proceeding with attempts, without applying oneself too much to finding the solution with reasoning. The sober but pleasant style of Storyteller Storyteller's short stories are often about love and death Storyteller is an absolutely single player game, but for the aforementioned reasons you have much more fun in company, racking your brains with someone else while comparing solutions and ideas. Benmergui's title has an understated but pleasant feel to it; the small, simple animations with which the characters express their feelings are expressive and manage to effectively convey the meaning of the scenes in which they are involved. This is certainly a not insignificant quality which, in a broader scheme, demonstrates the attention and ingenuity with which the Argentinian author has worked on this very particular game, carefully choosing also the sound accompaniment, which revises the great of classical music: perfectly fitting, considering the themes of the stories told.", "date": "2023-03-26", "grade": "7.5"}
