{"name": "Formula One Championship Edition - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/formula-one-championship-edition-recensione.html", "text": "The technical sector of the Formula One Championship has equally convinced us, even if with some reservations. The particle and atmospheric effects are beautiful, such as the rain, really convincing and incisive also in terms of gameplay, or the sun filtering through the trees, the reflections on the single-seaters and the lighting system in general, which makes everything a joy to the eyes. On the other hand, the trackside elements and the frame rate, anchored at 30 frames per second and equipped with a slight blur, which fortunately has little effect on the sense of speed, especially appropriate in the closer views, have less impact. Instead, in a rather surprising way, the replays disappoint, uninspired for shots and above all for the graphic creation, which makes us prefer, perhaps for the first time ever, the in-game graphics compared to the pre-calculated one. The game is translated entirely into Italian including the dubbing, which boasts the voice of Andrea De Adamich as commentator of the race, moreover in an absolutely non-invasive way, up to some goodies such as the vocal communication with the pits, or the post race comment. Comment We have to be honest, we started a bit biased on this Formula One Championship Edition, and instead the Studio Liverpool product proved to be a solid automotive simulation, with a large number of options and suitable for various types of gamers, thanks to the numerous settings present. We are still far from extreme realism or 100% credible artificial intelligence of the opponents, but we are certainly faced with a good compromise, enriched by a good technical sector and the presence of an online mode. Recommended, even more so if you are a fan of this sport that is always very popular in the beautiful country. Pros Good technical sector Many options and settings for your single-seater Career mode and online game Cons Still some flaws for the Artificial Intelligence Driving model subject to further improvements If there is one factor where the title is absolutely not lacking, it is certainly that of the options, present in large quantities and dedicated to all gamers who wish to embark on a quick game or a real tour de force with the game. In fact, it starts from the possibility of competing in a quick game, passing through the simulation of a grand prix (complete with pre-qualifications and qualifications), up to the choice of one of the twelve teams present, the driver and therefore taking part in the entire car season. If, on the other hand, you have delusions of protagonism or you are a failed driver, there is always the career mode, the true personalized fulcrum of the game, which allows the player to start from the foundations with the aim of stipulating a contract with the lowest profile teams and thus begin the climb towards the more noble ones. Once you have chosen your name and nationality, you have access to a very complete and clear interface in which you are in contact with your agent and with the team who, once you have proposed a contract, gradually present the objectives to be achieved during the big season rewards, such as reaching a certain position, finishing before your teammate, etc. In this case the simulation of the various grands prix is truly exhaustive and complete, think for example of the possibility of practicing in free laps to test times with particular sets of tyres, quantity of fuel, brake calibration, in such a way as to acquire data which your engineers will use it to propose the best race strategy and racing set-up. Yes, because the extreme completeness of options goes perfectly with that of the settings, which allow you to intervene on many aspects of your single-seater, such as tire pressure, braking power, traction, spoiler and so on and so forth. Almost all the configurations translate quite convincingly once you get behind the wheel of the single-seater. The distribution of braking influences the way in which corners are tackled, the spoiler on set-up management, the amount of fuel finally on the car's agility and the number of laps that can be done before the inevitable pit stop, which for the occasion it is proposed in an interactive way by pressing some keys, which will also affect the time required for its completion. Also the use of the tire trains and their wear will be widely taken into consideration by those looking for the maximum possible simulation. Neophytes or those looking for something faster and more immediate do not despair, in the game it is in fact possible to activate/deactivate someaids, above all to traction and braking, and even leaving a trail always active on the screen indicating the trajectory to be followed and, by means of a change of colour, the parts of the track on which to brake or decelerate. The driving model, once all the aids have been deactivated, certainly represents a good compromise between extreme simulation and purely arcade driving, which is often too unsatisfying. There are still some problems with the ~heaviness~ of the car, which in several cases gives a feeling that is too light, and with the artificial intelligence of the other cars, which often and willingly limit themselves to following their own trajectory, with rare excursions off the slipstream or slightly overtaking ' more reckless. Let me be clear, forget about being able to make murderous maneuvers to overtake your opponents and go unpunished, when you see a tire or spoiler blow up, you'll think twice before tackling the race in an unsuitable way. The last note we feel like making is the lack of Force Feedback as regards the supported steering wheels, a choice resulting from previous ~disputes~ with Immersion, owner of the technology, which have been sedated lately but not in time to see the Force applied. Feedback itself in the game. For the first time ever, Formula One also offers an online mode, which allows up to twelve people to compete against each other, while the remaining drivers on the starting grid are replaced by drivers managed by artificial intelligence. Of course, there is also a fairly complex system of online rankings and statistics, factors that increase the longevity and fun provided by the title. The 2007 F1 season has just begun, and it is the first without one of the drivers who have marked at least the last decade of the sport, namely Michael Schumacher. In fact, this year we find a Bridgestone that absolutely monopolizes all tire sets, a Ferrari that is redder and darker than ever, and a close fight for first place between Raikonnen, Alonso and Hamilton, with Massa and Heidfeld just behind. However, to evaluate this Formula One Championship Edition we need to take a step back, given that the game developed by Studio Liverpool, in its first incarnation on PlayStation 3, refers to the 2006 season, which saw the last appearance of the late (sportingly speaking, of course) German champion. The game boasts a long series of exponents that have followed one another over the years, and the memory of the first appearance on the PlayStation is still very vivid in the mind, which had left everyone speechless for the graphics that at the time seemed photorealistic, for the presence of all the licenses of drivers and teams and even of the same timing system seen on television. Water has passed under the bridge, but according to many, the title has not evolved adequately, especially as regards the driving model, often far from the concept of simulation. Listen, listen, a good part of perplexities in this sense, in this chapter, have been dispelled.", "date": "2007-04-18", "grade": null}
