{"name": "Sociable Soccer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sociable-soccer-la-recensione.html", "text": "It is with some difficulty that we approach this review of Sociable Soccer, because as fans of Sensible Soccer and Jon Hare in general it seems almost disrespectful to evaluate the work of the British game designer, therefore it is particularly difficult to separate nostalgia from actual gaming experience. However, Sociable Soccer is not necessarily a sequel to the mythological football game that made the history of this genre between Amiga, PC and 16-bit consoles in the middle of the 90s, so we shouldn't even get confused on this aspect: it is certainly to try to recover part of those atmospheres and that spirit that has largely been lost in current football simulations - as is also clear at the start, on the notes of the historic ~Goal scoring super star hero~ - but this is a rather particular project , which certainly does not arise as a modern answer to the major football games out there. For Hare it seems to have become a sort of personal mission to revive the old school vision of soccer games: the first attempt was made about fourteen years ago with what was supposed to be a real new chapter in the series, entitled Sensible Soccer 2006 and only partially successful, while Sociable Soccer, as the name also suggests, rather represents an update of the original concept in the era of social media and pervasive multiplayer. Talking about it already started a few years ago, a short distance from Dino Dini's failed Kick Off Revival experiment, an already evident warning of the difficulties inherent in the re-proposition of certain game mechanics in today's market. After a long period in early access on PC, Sociable Soccer has finally found its definitive form by deciding to move drastically to iOS and landing within Apple Arcade, in a move that seems particularly apt. In the meantime, the game has evolved and enriched with various interesting features that have made it more complete, while the proposal through Apple's subscription service has also eliminated the risks of finding yourself faced with the usual free-to-play problems, although a strange limitation on the amount of PvP matches that can be performed in the course of a day remains, however forcing expectations on this front. Sociable football The name could be misleading but Sociable Soccer is not really focused on social features, but rather on multiplayer, which in fact represents the foundations of the gaming experience, with the possibility of launching into online PvP matches to climb the rankings of players within the official league, although there is a limitation that forces a maximum of 12 games in sequence within a single day. In the game we find ourselves managing a club in both main aspects of football: the managerial one, with the management and improvement of the player squad, as well as the classic organization of tactical elements such as module and substitutions in the match, and that of the real game and own, with the action on the field. The gameplay is all about speed and intuitive action: control is done with a virtual stick and a few buttons drawn in the corner of the screen, allowing all the basic soccer actions including passing, shooting and lob in case you have control of the ball or player change, tackle (which occurs automatically by hitting the opponent carrying the ball) and tackle when we are in the non-possession phase. Considering the speed and dynamics of the action, these basic controls already represent a complete set of possible actions and are not even too awkward using the touch screen, which in itself is not easy to achieve. The best solution is definitely the use of a controller, as the Apple Arcade titles allow you to do in a standard way, a solution that we warmly recommend to anyone who wants to engage in the game, possibly also choosing the camera setting with vertical scrolling which allows wider view of the pitch and distinctly Sensible-ian vibes. The construction of the actions is inevitably a bit limited compared to the football simulations we are used to at the moment, but the essence of Sociable Soccer is deeply arcade, going to seek its origins in the legendary Sensible Soccer. However, the impression remains that the old classic was still (and still is, given that the game is still usable on PC and Xbox One) more technical especially in terms of rhythm and ball control. In this case we are dealing with a mixed system that keeps the ball attattached to the player except for any too sudden changes of direction, but in general the mechanics are simplified compared to Sensible. The limited width of the field and the speed of play tend to push too much on dynamism, so much so that attempts to set up a somewhat concerted action are often in vain, also due to not always understandable movements of the players without the ball managed by the CPU . On the artificial intelligence front, there is also a non-perfect balance of the goalkeepers, capable of incredible feats but also quite brandish mistakes at the same time. Similarly, team management is also extremely simplified, focused on the use of cards in a fairly direct reference to similar initiatives such as FIFA FUT. In this case, it is possible to conquer the cards by playing, winning matches and achieving particular objectives: each card represents a player of a different level, also capable of being enhanced by sacrificing other cards and with the application of further skills, which are then partially reflected in his abilities on the field. Sociable Soccer does not have official licenses, therefore collecting cards makes little sense since we are faced with invented players or with names mangled compared to the real ones and with few links to reality. The card system therefore has the sole purpose of simplifying the whole team management process making it more easily assimilable, even if it represents a decisive step backwards compared to what we were used to with the good old Sensitive World of Soccer, just to stay in theme of nostalgic references.", "date": "2020-02-24", "grade": "7.5"}
