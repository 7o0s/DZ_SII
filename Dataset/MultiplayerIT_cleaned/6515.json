We confess that we struggled a lot to recognize Afterfall Reconquest Episode I at the first start. The final version is completely different from the Early Access one we tried a while ago. In this case you can read the previous statement literally, given that the development team has decided to change the road along the art direction, abandoning the gloomy colors and the dark atmosphere for a more conventional black and white with red details. This is not a painless passage, given that in a video game such a decision involves big problems and black and white is not as easy to manage as it might seem. For example, the risk of a late and hasty implementation is to see the details of the scenario fade into a sea of gray, exactly as happens in Afterfall Reconquest Episode I. From a photographic point of view we are not dealing with an exceptional title to see, with the gray masses that dominate the image, and we find it hard to understand why the livid semi-horror atmosphere has been abandoned, which was one of the few strengths of the Early Access version. In addition to the problem of visual quality there is also that of the personality of the game, which in this way is largely compromised. Such a radical change of course returns the vision of a development team with very confused ideas about what it is doing and what it wants to achieve. Fortunately, the gameplay has also had many changes that have solved most of the problems encountered in the beta versions. It's nice to be able to write that there is no longer the wild spawn, i.e. that the enemies appear in a more plausible way, and that the difficulty has been calibrated much better, despite the permanence of some imbalances which involve really easy sections alongside other very difficult ones . Nothing comparable to the past, however, which leads one to wonder if we are not dealing with a case of well-exploited public relations, in which the early publication really served to improve a title otherwise destined for oblivion. Afterfall Reconquest Episode I is out of Early Access, amazing for the changes received. Better than before The game itself is a post-apocalyptic third-person shooter set in the same universe as the survival horror Afterfall: Insanity. The final version offers much more structured gameplay than the Early Access one, where you had to limit yourself to advancing and shooting. Here there are also characters to talk to, who can assign quests to be carried out by the player, going to tell a story that overall is not bad at all, thanks also to incredibly good dialogues, or at least better than expected. Solving the quests requires you to explore the levels thoroughly in search of enemies to eliminate and elements of the scenario to interact with. The missions are structured in such a way as to favor the complete exploration of the not very large maps, all connected to each other through various accesses (usually underground tunnels). The enemies are of two types: mutant beasts that attack the protagonist head on and anthropomorphic mutants capable of using weapons and far more dangerous than their quadrupedal friends. In fact they are the same seen in the old version, but here they are used much better and the absurd situations of the past have been resolved, with enemies of all kinds attacking at the same time, even in areas where theoretically there shouldn't have been. In short, the desire to improve the game was there and is clearly visible and, despite some problems, it is difficult not to be partly admired by the ability demonstrated by the development team. Too bad only for the choice of black and white and for some surrounding problems, such as the camera which on some, fortunately rare, occasions is enchanted making it difficult to manage the situation.", "date": "2015-03-09", "grade": "7.0"}
