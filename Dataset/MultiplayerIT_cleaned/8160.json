Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a cent. There is a train that runs fast and that no one seems to be able to stop. In fact, three terrible factions have taken possession of it: on the one hand the army of monsters, made up of zombies, vampires and werewolves; on the other, the robot army, which counts among its ranks armored and flying androids; finally, the army of ninjas, the most precise and lethal assassins in the world. In this chaos of dangerous stereotypes, only a group of special agents can set things right and save the world: Graham, Mason and Carrera. The former is the more balanced character of the three, while Graham is slow but tough and Carrera boasts great speed but is still a girl. However, all are armed to the teeth and during the mission they can change the service rifle with an uzi, a magnum, an assault rifle, a shotgun and other weapons, to be unlocked using the coins collected during each attempt to stop the train. Storm the Train is not a running game, although the images may suggest this kind of game, but a solid and fun action platform, characterized by a survival structure in which you have to try every time to get as far as possible, but dealing with situations decidedly more varied than the average of this type of production. In fact, our agent finds himself jumping from one wagon to another and therefore changing the type of enemy after having explored the roof of a certain number of wagons and eliminated as many opponents, in the meantime facing dangerous bosses or freeing hostages trapped in cages which must be opened by recovering two keys from as many creatures. Jump and shoot The gameplay of Storm the Train is very simple: you explore the carriages in search of coins, change weapons by coming into contact with red boxes and kill monsters by opening fire. Our character can perform a double rotating jump with an offensive value, but machine guns and rifles remain the best solution to get rid of the enemies, who are sometimes more resistant than expected and may be able to hit us. In this case the energy bar is managed visually with a progressive ~napping~ of our agent, who first loses his jacket, then his shirt and finally his pants when we are close to game over. The control system mirrors this simplicity with two buttons on the left side of the touch screen (to move left and right) and two on the right side (fire and jump), all of which can be repositioned from the options screen to be as comfortable as possible. There's also an icon at the far left of the screen which, when touched, opens up a menu for instant power-ups, which should be used sparingly as they consume some of the hard-earned coins. At this juncture we can resort to an attack drone, very effective but with a limited duration, or change character (and therefore enjoy a new energy bar) or even access extra equipment that can be unlocked in the usual way, i.e. using coins and by leveling up by getting new ~stars~. The latter are unlocked as we complete the numerous achievements that are offered to us, through a very interesting and well thought out system. There is also no shortage of special equipment, which, as in Jetpack Joyride, sees us using rotating devices, jetpacks and even armor of extraordinary power. The game action, so lively and immediate, is assisted by a technical sector characterized by an effective and pleasant style, with the animated characters as if they were paper puppets: the final effect is decidedly successful.", "date": "2012-11-24", "grade": "8.0"}
