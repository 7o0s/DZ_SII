{"name": "Yoshi's Universal Gravitation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yoshis-universal-gravitation.html", "text": "See how I rock The idea behind the title, as usual by Nintendo, is always rather simple and exotic: ~and if to continue in the level we had to move the center of gravity by rotating the GameBoy Advance screen?~. That's right, in Yoshi's latest adventure, in addition to using the classic platform control system, the player will have to rotate the GBA now right, now left, in order to perform various actions by altering the force of gravity that governs the world. At first it will not be entirely natural to perceive the influence of gravity in the game, especially in jumps the player will find himself displaced for most of the entire adventure, but continuing steadily everything will begin to turn (...) in the right direction! But what exactly happens when you tilt the console? Mainly altering the direction of gravity will change the way you can move around the level. If a wall blocks you to your right, turning the console to the right will make the wall an austere but scalable climb. For the same reason, a descent will increase its slope and can be skidded. A jump from a natural position obviously develops from the bottom up, but by rotating the gba the same jump is performed obliquely to accommodate the new direction of gravity. Yoshi's posture changes according to the tilt of the console, in order to help you perceive the current direction of the earth's attraction force. In addition to these basic ~rules~, by means of the rotation, you will interact with a good number of mechanisms that will allow you to reach the end of the level safe and sound. The first you will encounter will be bridges that will unroll depending on the position of the GBA, shortly after you will come across balls to roll, self-propelled platforms to slide, and more. The stages are made up of several subsections, and in some of these Yoshi will undergo one of his bizarre transformations as he had already accustomed us with Yoshi's Island: in these situations you will discover new ways to interact with the world and its gravity. Among these, one of the best is to tilt the plane of a body of water, so you can avoid obstacles and collect coins with your Yoshi boat. Always to make the interaction carried out by means of rotation as interesting as possible, at the end of each level, if you are lucky, you will be offered a challenge which, if concluded favorably, allows you to multiply your hoard of coins (100 coins are worth the canonical life). . These challenges are all about furious or reasoned rotation of the console. Not much stuff honestly, but better more than less. Not all that goes around is gold As much as the Nintendo designers have worked hard to make the levels as varied and elaborate as possible, the unusual game system has definitely cornered them. It must be said right away that the programmers have worked hard to offer players the best possible experience. The levels, even if rather linear, can be developed on several floors, obviously scalable by effectively tilting the console. Some allow us to reach some particular points of the level only following a certain action that is not too obvious, and which is up to us to discover. However the levels don't offer much of a challenge, right off the bat; the first levels for example will be little more than a tutorial. On the contrary, in the last two worlds in particular, things will become decidedly more complicated, not too much due to the particular difficulty of the passages, but due to the fact that every slightest mistake almost always costs one's life. Precisely because of the level of challenge contained, the programmers have decided to insert various challenges to be completed before the end of the stage. For example, in the first world we will have to eat a certain number of apples, in the next one we will have to collect a certain number of coins, and in the next one we will have to trot like madmen to reach the end of the level before time runs out. Each world, six in all, features a certain type of challenge as well as the combination of challenges (take X coins and finish the level before Y seconds). After successfully completing the levels you will get a medal (gold in the case of a good performance) and having reached the required number of medals, you will unlock the next world. Overall the game wears out in a couple of days of not too constant play. The levels are quite short and limited in number. The first world consists of only 3 levels, the following ones of a few more, up to the last ones which have a more than adequate number. Apart from the last few moments of the game, the challenge rate is generally low, and it won't take you too long to completethe various levels successfully. The recovery of gold medals and some simple bonuses to unlock will keep you busy for a few more hours, but the game will exhaust all its attraction within a few sessions. How does the game run? Technically the game is presented discreetly respecting the usual Nintendo canons, and what matters most is the sensor works effectively. The adventures of Yoshi since his first appearance on the SNES have always stood out for the particular graphic style. After the first memorable Yoshi's Island however, Nintendo decided not to fossilize at that certain and wonderful design, but always tried to vary slightly on the theme, while maintaining different points of contact each time. Yoshi's Universal Gravitation is no exception, here too we will find the pastel colored backdrops, and the warm and playful colors that distinguish the series. Some objects seem to have been drawn on plywood and applied to the background of the level, and more generally you always have the illusion of being in a set of a children's show. It's also true that the levels aren't particularly rich in details or particular effects, but are rather essential and clean, perhaps so as not to confuse the player too much with superfluous elements that would risk overshadowing the function of particular sprites. [...] and what matters most the sensor works effectively How does the game run? The sound accompaniment is in line with the rest of the game: the tunes that cheer up our stay in Yoshi's universe are sufficiently catchy, even if they do not reach the quality of other Nintendo productions, where sometimes after a short time some particular sound track is imprinted indelibly in the player's memory, like the unmistakable ~puppy~ verses of Yoshi, which are not lacking even in this new adventure for the GBA. I close the article reassuring you of the fact, if needed, that Yoshi's Universal Gravitation is perfectly compatible with the new Nintendo DS Yoshi's Universal Gravitation is a largely successful title. There are no major criticisms to be leveled at the game and the programmers. The level design couldn't be more elaborate than it is. The original game system inevitably clipped the hands of game designers who had to find the right compromise between the use of the sensor and the use of the controller, and at the same time make the game more fun than frustrating. Adding traps, millimeter jumps, and tougher enemies would have brought the player displaced by the game system to a perhaps too high level of pressure. At the same time, lengthening the broth with equal or longer levels would not have increased the value of the curious cartridge. The designers have gone as far as they could, or felt like it, creating pleasant levels, interspersed with alternative sections and mini-games that try to give the player the most enjoyable experience possible. However, comparing the structure of a classic platformer with that of the game in question, the latter certainly comes out penalized by actually simpler and more immediate levels. But Yoshi's Universal Gravitation doesn't want to be a canonical platformer. Pros: The sensor works and fascinates You are always looking for originality, here it is! Suitable for those who are fasting from video games and lovers Cons: Rather simple levels If you are looking for a more classic and challenging platformer it is not for you Not very long-lived and few incentives to resume the game After Wario Ware Twisted, now it's time to review another game that uses the wacky motion sensor. If with Wario Ware we have seen the sensor applied to a series of fleeting and fun mini-games in operation, in Yoshi's Universal Gravitation we see it cleverly integrated into a genre in which Nintendo has always given its best: the platform.", "date": "2005-05-06", "grade": null}
