{"name": "Medal of Honor: Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medal-of-honor-heroes.html", "text": "In search of lost peace Medal of Honor, for those not aware of it, is part of that line of first-person shooters (which also includes titles such as Ubisoft's Band of Brothers and Activision's Call of Duty) that set the exploits of their soldiers in times of war, and more precisely in the conflict resulting from the Second World War; in the game, structured as a first-person shooter, you will impersonate a soldier engaged in a series of missions useful for bringing the moment of liberation from enemy oppression closer. Medal of Honor: Heroes makes no difference, and set between Italy, Belgium and Holland, it will tell the story of a small group of soldiers grappling with military assignments halfway between infiltration (not in the term intended in Metal Gear) and guerrilla warfare, recovering items, tactically killing small groups of enemy soldiers and conquering hot spots in the city, all to help the bulk of the army ready to follow the advance group in case of success. Among the proposed modes, the campaign is the emblem of the single-player, representing the real adventure that in a succession of fast-paced missions will lead the player to a well-deserved leave and victory in the war. Each mission will correspond to a series of primary objectives (to be completed absolutely to successfully complete the level) and other secondary ones useful only to increase the evaluation that you will receive at the end of each mission; this evaluation may vary on the basis of elements such as, for example, the accuracy of fire, the number of Germans shot down and the recovery of ~delicate~ documents: the actual evaluation is depicted using the classic medals for valor (and if Medal of Honor, who else should...) of gold, silver and bronze. In addition to evaluating his work on the battlefield, the player will receive a whole series of prizes based on a series of extra objectives completed (and not reported in the mission) which will range from the classic ~completed the Italian campaign ~, going from ~killed 100 enemies with headshots~. These unlockable extras will be divided between medals for military valor and particular outfits to be used in battle (a single tip: the pink German soldier pajamas). In addition to the campaign, EA has decided to insert a kind of offline death-match where, within a pre-established map, each player can train in the art of the battle-ground against opponents (actually very dull) controlled by the CPU . However, one of the most pleasant surprises regarding this MoH comes by scrolling through the multiplayer mode menu which, in addition to the now very classic multiplayer game in ad hoc mode, will allow up to 32 players to challenge each other online on EA's servers thanks to the infrastructure mode. The count of the modes concludes with the page of tips to read before jumping into battle, and gutted for practically every single aspect of the firefight, highlighting strategies and tricks useful for getting out of the most intricate situations. Shoot him now (and after one shot shoot him again) Although Medal of Honor: Heroes presents itself with the best conditions on the card, it is when the console is challenged for the first time that problems will knock on the door. The first, most obvious and important is related to the question that many readers will have asked themselves until now: in this type of game you move using the two analog sticks and fighting practically only with the backbones, how does it work here? The answer is -unfortunately- only one: in the only possible way, that is by using the single analog stick and moving the camera (ie the weapon) with the four buttons circle, triangle, square and cross. The choice (although in the options enough different types of usable commands are given) is not the happiest, both due to the poor reactivity of the players who will find themselves pressing buttons to aim and shoot, and due to the precision of pointing the weapons. This element ~generates~ two other harmful considerations, the first of which is linked to usability: theoretically it would be possible to reverse the commands relating to movement and those for pointing, but in doing so the feeling with movements would be totally distorted with respect to the accumulated body memory playing all the FPS released up to now. The second fact is instead linked to the creation of a series of cascading problems caused by the imperfect (or better to say, botched) control system: due to the lack of precision in moving the weapon, the aiming system has been simplified allowing players to cto hit one's enemies even without actually taking them, as if there were a kind of sensitive area around every German present in the game, an area which, if hit, counts as a perfectly successful hit. The shooting accuracy problem also has repercussions on the scarce amount of enemies present in the game levels: the settings seem deserted, with a few groups of soldiers positioned only near the sensitive objectives, therefore the component linked to the sensations that games of this genre manage is affected to arise in the players; the real joker of this type of game is all about allowing the player on duty to totally identify with his virtual counterpart, to be tense in the moments immediately before the battle, the desire to cover his brother in arms who fights side by side : all this is missing and this absence partially collapses the castle of illusions created to transport us back in time 60 years. Shoot him now (and after one shot shoot him again) Graphically, the game is unassailable: it's incredible to discover game after game what developers can get out of hardware like the PSP, which seems to know no technical limit. However, the fluidity of the game is associated with a too evident slowness in the movement of the soldiers caused, once again, by the limits dictated by the game commands. The sound is attested to the excellent levels typical of Electronic Arts productions: the dubbing is of excellent workmanship, the films are accompanied by symphonic pieces worthy of the best historical film and the sound effects related to weapons are reproduced quite truthfully, or at least avoid excessive artificiality. Often and willingly the fossilization of the Sony portable catalog has been criticized on these pages, sometimes too busy proposing remakes of titles from the playstation generation down, EA has had the courage to specifically develop a new chapter of MoH on hardware that the way it is structured, it will hardly ever adapt to certain types of gameplay, first person shooters. The game, graphically speaking, brings out the muscles of the Sony laptop, but the absence of the second analog stick (of absolute importance for titles of the genre) deflates the gaming experience making it more frustrating than exciting at times. The vote is therefore to be considered the reflection of the game controls, not very suitable for the platform as it presents itself in the current state of things, perhaps in the future with a different structuring of the intelligent controls, it will be possible to re-discuss the goodness of first person shooters. Pros: EA's desire to jump into something new is to be commended Excellent graphics and sound sector Full-bodied multyplayer mode Cons: Unsuitable and very little intuitive controls AI of enemies not too developed The classic feeling linked to war games is missing War has been defined in many ways in the past: bloody, useless, tragic, heroic and primitive are just some of the adjectives associated with it. Today, thanks to Electronic Arts, a new adjective can easily be included on the roadmap of the word ~war~: portable, this is the experiment attempted by the Canadian publisher who brings one of his most successful sagas to PSP in an absolutely new and exclusive version , Medal of Honor: Heroes.", "date": "2006-12-14", "grade": null}
