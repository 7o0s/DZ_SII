{"name": "Omno", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/omno-recensione.html", "text": "The last decade has seen the proliferation of a particular type of video game adventure, based mainly on atmosphere and travel as an enrichment of the self. There are several examples, from those that have had enormous success, to others less fortunate. It is a type of game that is not excessively expensive in terms of economic resources, therefore very popular in the independent scene. Typically, these are adventures that feature a highly stylized protagonist venturing into a land full of mysteries once inhabited by a great, long-forgotten civilization. The player's task is to lead the protagonist on a pilgrimage to a place or source of primordial power, encountering various obstacles along the way, but also some allies with whom it is possible to communicate only through actions and gestures. We therefore find a basic incommunicability which, little by little, transforms into a friendship at the root, which sometimes turns out to be more important than the destination reached. Omno is positioned precisely in this vein, the first work of Jonas Manke (aka StudioInkyfox), a former animator who decided to venture into a solo enterprise, concluded thanks to the support of gamers through Kickstarter. The result is extremely interesting, but let's go into more detail in this Omno review. The usual adventure? Omno: anything new on the horizon? From the first seconds of the game, it is clear how much Omno draws from other productions that have managed to leave their mark in the memory of gamers in recent years (especially from the award-winning Journey and the more recent Sky). The aim of the player is to accompany the protagonist, an anthropomorphic being (equipped with a stick that we could define as magical) on a pilgrimage to the old and narratively abused ~light~, hidden behind a portal essentially on the edge of the world. During the journey, you meet a little green creature, which directs the player towards certain points of interest. A much appreciated detail is the initial distrust of the flying being, whose attitude changes more and more towards a mutual friendship (this too has already been seen, but very well staged). Omno: the flying creature that will help us during our journey Omno is evidently a derivative title, which, if you will, did not want to risk too much. However, despite its imitative nature, it somehow manages to feel unique, highly individualized and easily identifiable. Perhaps the merit goes to the conceptual and realization compactness of the title, which creates a very relaxing and particularly ~friendly~ general harmony. A gameplay between powers and creatures Omno: A world full of peculiar creatures Omno is primarily a linear adventure, but it also has a more open-ended platforming nature, as well as a fondness for puzzles. Everything remains relatively simple, nothing that keeps you more than a couple of minutes on the same puzzle. And it is perhaps precisely this substantial speed in identifying the solution that makes these sections quite enjoyable; you never get to a point where you feel frustrated or bored. The puzzles are located exactly in the space designated for these elements in an adventure of this type, which does not want to commit the player too much, but to make him relax and take him to a world without difficulties, where exploration is the real protagonist. Four ~upgrades~ for the staff can be found along the way, allowing you to sprint, slide (like on a snowboard), teleport to specific locations, and glide. Obviously, these powers are combined with the same number of regions in which they can be obtained (a forest area, a mountain area, a desert area and a celestial one), in which the new powers are exploited, but also amalgamated with those already available. In fact, it is not uncommon to find yourself in the circumstance of having to combine teleportation with sliding, or gliding with sprinting. Everything is very responsive and fluid, which is not a given when it comes to productions of this kind. Omno: the slip on the stick, a power that manages to fascinate Each region (or chapter) is made up of an initial area, in which the new power is attributed, and two or three larger areas, freely explorable, inhabited by different creatures, one more particular than the other. In addition to being cataloged within a bestiary, you can interact with them in such a way as to recover unspecified fragments (to which we will return in a moment). Each creature has its own particular response to our presence: there are those who hide, those who approach curiously, toowho follows in our wake as we glide with the stick. It is precisely this attention and characterization of each creature that pushes us to explore the title ever deeper, even if we soon discover that the adventure is certainly not endless. When longevity isn't everything Omno: each creature reacts differently to our presence To complete the title in its entirety, complete with Steam achievements, it took us just under four hours, which is not much by today's standards, but it is certainly right for the experience that the game wants to offer. In fact, if he had bet on a longer adventure, he probably would have started to feel the repetitiveness of the actions to be carried out, evident more and more in each new region. All the main areas are composed of three unpublished animals to add to the bestiary, four or five luminous globes (three of which are essential to pave the way to the next level), a column containing one of these globes (which can be activated through the fragments recovered from the aforementioned creatures), a place of meditation that unlocks the location of each globe and three manuscripts containing the memoirs of an influential individual of the lost civilization, probably corrupted by the power of ~light~. Omno: a short but significant experience To complete an area 100% you need to collect everything. The variables from map to map lie in the puzzles to be solved and the possibilities offered by the new powers. Having reached the end of the title having collected everything that could be found around, we were satisfied with what was proposed, without regretting a few more or less hours of play. For those who, on the other hand, do not feel saturated, a mode is available timed, which allows you to prove your mastery of the art of stick sliding. The map is only one (by the way, recycled from one of the game sequences), but it is an appreciable addition. Stylistic compactness Omno: a visual sector at times derivative, but functional Video games like Omno are almost always characterized by an amazing, extremely inspired artistic sector. We're a bit on the cutting edge here, as the visual style is also quite derivative, but still has its nice insights. Graphically, the title is very basic, with few polygons and a strong focus on color. If it is not from an artistic point of view that it manages to stand out for its uniqueness, it is certainly the animations that cement the adventure. Every action, interaction, series of movements is fluid, sinuous, capable of harmonizing with the technical limitations of the title. Perhaps it is precisely the graceful composition of these animations that binds the title that allows the title to be such a relaxing experience, also obtained thanks to the excellent optimization (at least on Windows PC). To accompany them in the arduous task we find, then, another element of excellence, the soundtrack, perfectly integrated with the nature of the game. The songs, between epic and dreamy sonorities, are further proof of the ideological compactness of the title, which perfectly knows its intentions and its limits.", "date": "2021-07-29", "grade": "7.8"}
