Like a real prodigal son, the aubergine man is now back where he started from, embracing Nintendo and taking advantage of the moment of great dusting of Switch with Rayman Legends: Definitive Edition: let's go, therefore, to find out if this umpteenth incarnation of the game deserves such appellation... The long road from Wii U to Switch As extensively recounted in our review of the Wii U original and in the evaluation of the subsequent PlayStation 4 version, Rayman Legends is a wonderful platformer, and neither the passage of time nor the transition to new hardware like Switch have affected this belief in the slightest: the Definitive Edition therefore only resurfaces the enormous qualities of the work of Michel Ancel and his team, capable of combining simple but incredibly satisfying gameplay with an amazing variety, a quantity of out-of-parameter content and an enchanting audiovisual sector in all respects. for all. Here we will focus mainly on the features of the port and on the innovations brought about by this new version, which in truth are not that many. Let's immediately clear the field from the main issue: despite the name, Rayman Legends: Definitive Edition essentially does not offer any valid reason to push an owner of the title on another platform to make the purchase again on Nintendo Switch. A first deterrent certainly consists of the applied price of 39.99, a figure that is not high in an absolute sense but which makes your teeth gnash a bit if compared with that of other versions (on PSN the current list price is 29. 99 while on Steam even 19.99) which paradoxically on certain details turn out to be even higher. Just a few days ago right here on Multiplayer.it we reported the comparative analysis of Digital Foundry, which had concluded how Rayman Legends: Definitive Edition presented in some cases longer uploads even than the Wii U and Vita versions, compared to which it is orphaned also of the asymmetrical multiplayer with Murfy controlled via touchscreen, which peeps out only in a separate section available in single player. Details that have been confirmed in our test and that certainly don't ruin the experience with the game, but still make Ubisoft's somewhat superficial approach in carrying out the conversion evident. To get some small satisfaction you must therefore look elsewhere, for example to a book of characters which in this edition can count on all the playable characters, including those so far exclusive to some of the platforms that have hosted the title. The Kung Foot mode was then slightly expanded, a nice mini-game available from the main menu in which two or more users challenge each other to see who scores the most goals into the opponent's goal by hitting a ball: it is now also possible to compete against artificial intelligence and organize multiplayer tournaments up to to a maximum of eight teams. For the rest, Rayman Legends: Definitive Edition behaves on Switch in a substantially identical way to the other console versions: the game runs at 1080p with the console in the dock and at a constant 60fps, while the very simple control system proves to be equally performing in all variants offered by Nintendo hardware.", "date": "2017-09-19", "grade": "8.9"}
