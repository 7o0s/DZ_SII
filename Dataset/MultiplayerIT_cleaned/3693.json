Never before, however, had we experienced an adventure in which the use and understanding of a lost language becomes the key to solving an intricate mystery. This is what happens when you embark on the singular journey of Heaven's Vault: Inkle's new title moves in this direction, offering the user a strong-willed narrative experience that leaves quite displaced. On the other hand, if there is one thing that Jon Ingold and his team are not lacking, it is precisely the desire to continue experimenting without limiting yourself to repeating what has been achieved previously. Interesting projects such as 80 Days and Sorcery! were born on these premises, and the same philosophy was also applied to the latest, bizarre creation of the Cambridge studio. With what results? Read on for our review to find out. A story to rebuild In Heaven's Vault you take on the role of Aliya Elasra, an archaeologist from the University of Iox, who we discover is the most prosperous planet in the nebula where the events told during the game take place. After being summoned by the director of the structure, the woman is instructed to go on the trail of Janniqi Renba, a scholar who has mysteriously disappeared into thin air for some time. With the support of the robot Six, the investigation pushes the protagonist to travel to the four corners of the game world in search of information and possible clues that allow her to trace the man's position, or at least to find out what might have happened to him . In order to unravel a skein that at first seems to be somewhat tangled, the player is tasked with carrying out a series of investigations on many of the moons that populate the Nebula. In these places it happens to come across other characters and it is possible to find information through normal conversations, while in other situations you have to limit yourself to exploring the surrounding area in search of objects that can in some way be of help for your investigation. A large part of the playful experience is therefore focused on the search for information, and one of the most practical ways to proceed is precisely to get in touch with some individuals through a system of multiple choice dialogues that can lead to different outcomes. This kind of interaction provides each time with three answers from which to choose, or alternatively to remain silent while waiting for the interlocutor on duty to continue his reasoning. Playstation 4 trophies Heaven's Vault Trophies are 45 in total, divided into 35 bronze, 5 silver and 4 gold in addition to Platinum. Most of them are related to learning vocabulary, performing translations and meeting secondary characters. Discovering a lost language However, the main peculiarity of the gameplay of the work is inherent in the presence of an ancient language to be deciphered. In this case Inkle has developed a real language that the player must try to identify one step at a time by trial and error. When one comes across some inscriptions one must try to assign a complete meaning to each sentence by choosing among some variants. Continuing on your journey, you will come across other symbols through which you can understand whether or not the interpretation of those signs can be considered correct. Basically any glyph in the game helps to tell a portion of the story, but the completeness and details of the story depend precisely on the ability to direct the interpretation of these signs in the correct direction. Some of them can be combined to form words and whole sentences, but a wrong reading can give rise to a completely wrong idea about a place or a particular object recovered during one's research. For most of the story, the information on Renba's assignment is reduced to a minimum and must be revealed little by little through the investigative activity and the clues progressively collected in the exploratory phases. An unexpected and undoubtedly interesting formula on a purely conceptual level, which nevertheless reveals some problems mainly due to a poorly paced narrative progression, which ends up involving the user only marginally, making him maintain a certain detachment towards the main characters of the story and the their stories. From this point of view, the lack of localization in Italian does not help, made impossible precisely because of the particular structure that rethroat the game. As we had already had the opportunity to explain in our trial, the experience offered by Heaven's Vault is linked to the structure of Anglo-Saxon grammar to such an extent that it does not lend itself to localization in any other language other than the original one. The other factor is related to the branches that the plot assumes on the basis of the choices made by the player, evidently not within the reach of a very small studio like Inkle. In short, in order to follow Heaven's Vault it is necessary to have a good knowledge of English, also by virtue of a rather sophisticated lexicon. The lines of dialogue appear and disappear rapidly, mostly without being supported by the dubbing, consequently a certain readiness is essential in order not to miss even a line of the details and reflections that the protagonist formulates during her research. Despite an approach that was not without interesting ideas, reading the glyphs proved to be less stimulating than it should have been. As you may have already guessed, the work offers minimal interaction, and for this reason the developers have tried to implement a movement system that alternates with the information collection phases. On board a ship Aliya and Six must cross the currents of the Nebula, which blow at high speed forming real corridors that can be traveled in one direction. In these situations, all you have to do is press the triggers of the pad to direct the aircraft correctly, taking care to follow the arrows which from time to time indicate the correct junction to take based on the destination activated on the map. These sections act as a filler but are completely unrelated to the main contents of the game, ending up being unstimulating and almost annoying to deal with. Unfortunately Heaven's Vault also shows its side from a purely artistic point of view, with truly anonymous character models and a general look that tries the uniqueness card without really being able to convince.", "date": "2019-04-26", "grade": "6.0"}
