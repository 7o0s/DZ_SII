In that case, in fact, the question had been very simple, as Capcom had re-proposed to the old and new generations six titles that had made the history of Mega Man and the genre it represented for years, before the indifference of Capcom itself and the antics of Comcept with his Mighty No. 9. The new Legacy Collection, on the other hand, includes only four games that have however been published between various generations and on different consoles: although characterized by a discreet qualitative ups and downs, the Mega Man seventh to tenth are still extremely valid platforms that tell us about the evolution of the blue android over the most recent years. The pursuit of happiness In 1995 Capcom had already released the first Mega Man X, so the comparison with Mega Man 7 was simply a must, also because it was the first time that the original series had landed on the SNES and, above all, that it did so with a new look at 16-bit. In this sense, Mega Man 7 came out of the clash with broken bones. Despite being a good title, characterized by huge and colorful sprites, the new adventure of the Blue Bomber seemed to desperately seek its old identity through an uncertain level design that could not recall the previous platformers and that made some important passages a little more clumsy . Mega Man 7 has aged better today than one might think, in light of these observations, and offers a first glimpse of Mega Man's transformation in the generational transition from SNES to PlayStation. It was in fact the first Sony home console to host Mega Man 8: in reality, the game was also released for SEGA's Saturn, but the version included in this compilation is precisely the PlayStation one. The visual style changes slightly between the seventh and eighth episodes, preferring even more cartoonish and stylized features. Mega Man 8 is perhaps one of the most talked about titles in the history of Capcom intellectual property: there are those who hate it and those who love it, but it was actually an important moment in the development of the franchise, thanks also to the inclusion of dialogues and animated sequences that , although badly dubbed, served to immerse the players even more in a universe that up to that moment had been described through images and short texts. We are with those who loved Mega Man 8, also because it was a challenging platformer the right way, full of colors and beautiful ideas that gave the gameplay an edge, thanks also to some of the most creative and surprising weapons of the series . Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10 complete a package that, in its entirety, seems almost schizophrenic: we pass from the cartoonish and detailed graphics of Mega Man 8 to the old-school 8-bit sprites, in an abrupt dive into the past which, on balance, dates back to 2008, or twelve years after the release of the eighth Mega Man for PlayStation and Saturn. Capcom had entrusted the rebirth of Blue Bomber to the developer Inti Creates, who had decided to get rid of practically every mechanic added in the series after Mega Man 2, such as the slide and the charged shot, to focus solely on level design. Mega Man 9 is a platformer of exceptional quality that many fans consider among the best in the series. The judgment against Mega Man 10, the last episode to come out in 2010 before the franchise retired, is much colder. Although it introduces the possibility of controlling Proto Man and Bass instead of Mega Man, exploiting their peculiar abilities, it is immediately clear that the spark of originality is missing in Mega Man 10. Some traps are all too predictable, the Robot Masters among the craziest ever: it is still a good platform for the brand's canons, despite being less refined than its predecessor. It is worth noting that the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 includes all the DLC of Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10, unlockable by completing the games or through a good old secret key combination. What is there and what is missing The Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 carefully retraces the steps of the previous compilation, albeit with some small differences that you may or may not like. In this case, it is interesting to note the transition to a simple checkpoint system that could make the experience more frustrating for novice players: the latter, however, will appreciate the possibility of activating a sort of ~shield~ that halves the damage taken and which makes some sequences marginally easier, but always at the discretion of the player. Then all the features already implemented returnemented in the first Mega Man Legacy Collection, and therefore the museum full of illustrations and information, the jukebox to listen to the music tracks, the ~training~ stages against the various bosses, the timed challenges and so on. What is missing, however ... are the games. It's a somewhat complicated speech that only marginally affected the final evaluation, let's be clear: although it is obvious that Capcom wanted to dedicate these two compilations to the main original series, excluding any spin-off, it is also evident that the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 offers two fewer titles than the first. The quality of the individual games can be debated - we believe that Mega Man in the first compilation are the best, for example - but at this point, considering the price, it might have been appropriate to include a few more games such as Mega Man & Bass in the compilation as well , the excellent platform developed for SNES in 1998 and then converted for Game Boy Advance a few years later. Some spin-offs are also linked to the main series that Capcom could have included in the compilation as free mini-games, for example Mega Man for Game Boy, the two fighting games The Power Battle and The Power Fighters, the soccer game Mega Man Soccer or the driving game Mega Man Battle & Chase. Inferior titles, without a doubt, but which would still have closed the circle of the Legacy Collections in beauty, allowing old and new fans to finally have each game in their hands.", "date": "2017-08-16", "grade": "8.8"}
