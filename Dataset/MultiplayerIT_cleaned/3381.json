{"name": "Resident Evil 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-5-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Although it cannot be considered exactly the best exponent of the series nor the most memorable one, we return with particular pleasure to this game by facing the review of Resident Evil 5. It was a controversial chapter, but above all because it emerged in a middle period in which it was thought even that it was possible to make the classical structure re-emerge in some way. In truth, the identity crisis of the series was well and truly consumed and the fifth chapter was practically the only possible outlet for Capcom survival horror at the time, after the original setting had essentially exhausted all its chances with the splendid remake of the first Resident Evil (perhaps still the best expression of the series) and the tired Resident Evil 0. There is no doubt that, after the enormous effort in terms of production and conceptual lavish evolution and total reconstruction of the brand with Resident Evil 4, Capcom have worked more to save money for the sequel, focusing on the technical evolution and filing of aspects of the gameplay but remaining firmly anchored to everything that the predecessor had introduced, yet Resident Evil 5 proved to be a very solid game, able to continue to sell millions of copies over the course of several years, demonstrating how in the end the public has well appreciated the famous ~turning action~. Practically the most appreciated, from a commercial point of view: Resident Evil 5 is currently the best-selling chapter of the series with over 11 million copies registered, at least according to data from the beginning of 2019. The game returns, after ten years, on current generation platforms and on Nintendo Switch in particular, in the extensive re-release work that has now characterized the series for years now, finding a possible privileged application on the Nintendo console, given the its setting strongly based on cooperative multiplayer. Back to Africa with Chris and Sheva The story sees the return of the historical protagonist Chris Redfield, ex-S.T.A.R.S. now become B.S.A.A., or member of a new international force for the fight against bio-terrorism, on a mission in Africa in the company of Sheva, an agent of the local forces. In short, the threat that started from the mountains of Arklay, through the Raccoon City incident has spread throughout the world and has become global. The story is probably known, in any case we refer you to the review of the PS4 and Xbox One versions to which this edition refers for information on the plot and all the basic features of the game, which is essentially a third-person shooter. The main problem of Resident Evil 5 is its being halfway between a real classic shooter and a survival horror, remaining tied to the latter as regards a certain general cumbersomeness of the control system, still remembered today in particular due to the impossibility of moving while shooting, but abandoning certain typical characteristics of the series such as the presence of puzzles and more metaphysical horror moments to embrace a style and rhythm that is now distinctly action. To tell the truth, his combination of suggestions works and returns a game with a certain identity, in many respects with a more elaborate gameplay than previously seen, only that now it can seem easily dated, above all because of those elements that served to tie it still clearly to Resident Evil 4. Then emerges even more clearly what is the true vocation of Resident Evil 5, or rather the multiplayer game, the central nucleus around which its entire structure was studied and another topic of scandal for the historical fans of the series. This is probably the winning element that has allowed the game to sell so many copies over the course of ten years: beyond the too sunny atmosphere and a certain lack of variety in the situations, Resident Evil 5 still remains one of the best action shooter experiences to be tackled in cooperative multiplayer and perhaps this new edition can also focus mainly on this, particularly on Nintendo Switch which allows ~double~ on the fly with split screen at any time, as well as the possibility of using the online connection or in LAN with system link. Even in single the game can give great satisfaction, with a lot of those horde assault moments that had already made the fourth chapter famous, but the historical defects of the companion's artificial intelligence have remained more or less intact, who tends to get into trouble, waste bullets and healing herbs like there's no tomorrow and also grab the bonuses scattered around with considerable diligence.The Nintendo Switch version Being a game of ten years ago, which at the time focused a lot on the spectacularity of the action and its graphic system, the test of time can be merciless and in fact Resident Evil 5 shows a certain aging, if considered to third-party shooters modern person. However, starting from a base that was in any case cutting-edge at the time and having been enriched by a subsequent general remastering that brought it closer to the best modern standards makes it a game that doesn't look too dated, even if the work of adaptation does not seem to have been very thorough by Capcom. To tell the truth, the upgrade to 60 frames per second that characterizes the PS4 and Xbox One versions does not even seem to have been applied on Nintendo Switch, given that the frame-rate appears rather variable and usually positioned below the quota that had been imposed for other consoles. The game is offered in its Gold Edition, i.e. the complete edition of all the contents released after the original edition, with DLC concerning new single and multiplayer game modes and two additional chapters of the story of considerable interest within the overall economy of the game, focused above all on Jill Valentine, a figure who also appears in the main story but who in this way obtains his right deepening, given the importance of the character. Between the two expansions present, Nightmare without exit is particularly interesting because it precisely recovers the settings and atmospheres of the first Resident Evil, while the other additions are much more action-oriented. Among these we find some multiplayer modes such as Mercenaries and Versus, very interesting variations on the theme to experience, especially in pairs, providing a really large amount of content between single player, cooperative and competitive multiplayer. The Nintendo Switch version can count, as we have said, on additional options for starting a multiplayer: in addition to relying on online, an extremely comfortable presence in any case, you can make a LAN connection with other consoles in the area or start a session on the screen shared using each one joy-Con, which also allows you to start a game on the move in any situation and place, even the control system is obviously a bit limited by the presence of a single stick. Another peculiar feature of this version is the support for the movement controls present in the Joy-Con, which, as far as tested, seems to work quite well compared to other solutions of the genre seen previously.", "date": "2019-11-12", "grade": "7.5"}
