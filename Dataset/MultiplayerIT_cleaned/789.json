{"name": "Recensione Call Of Cthulhu Dark Corners Of Earth Xbox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-earth-xbox.html", "text": "A mysterious world As tradition dictates, the ideal setting for a story linked to the cults of Cthulhu is Anglo-Saxon, 20s, immersed in the thickest of mists. In this already mysterious world, Detective Walters, in command of a police operation, collides with something dark and so alien as to upset his conscience. Years later, now a private investigator and former inmate of a mental asylum, Jack Walters, plagued by doubts, finds himself once again on the front lines, involved in something that transcends human understanding. Dark Corners Of Earth, after the playable introduction, takes us to Innsmouth, a town familiar to Lovecraft fans, where a cult linked to the god Dagon enjoys absolute and disturbing power. Strange beings populate the streets of Innsmouth and most of these creatures do not like any interference and are decidedly allergic to the curiosity of foreigners. With an extremely small number of citizens willing to help us we are forced to make our way through the mysteries of a city populated by hostile humans and transfigured by a horror that we are not yet allowed to know. The characterization of the environment is up to the most ardent fans: posters and details, as well as objects and weapons that we will find in the game, are made with obsessive care and the films take on the mellow tones and defects of period films. Obviously there is a good dose of tension surrounded by sudden shots, ghostly voices and a good dose of raw violence awaits us. As icing on the cake, the uploads are full of quotes and photographs which in turn tell something about the world we are preparing to explore. More than just a game The greatest peculiarity of Dark Corners Of Earth is certainly that of following in all respects the dictates of the Cthulhu universe and with this premise the four years of realization can all be seen. The intrepid Jack Walters, in fact, is forced to face both his fears and his enemies and must deal with his mortal nature and his fragile body. To better identify ourselves with the difficult situation in which we are placed, the guys from Headfirst have resorted to a meticulous design of both the maps and the situations that will gradually guide us towards the epilogue of the story. There is therefore no shortage of breakneck escapes and sections in which acting hidden is vital, but in both cases no game session turns out to be anonymous and no detail is left to chance. During the first escape, for example, we find ourselves hunted by a good number of enemies, and we are forced to perform each action with a minimum time lag and with the need to act with coldness and precision, but the task is made much more difficult for us by the aforementioned limits to which Jack Walters must submit. These limits, which represent the heart of the title, are the meticulous representation of fears, phobias and wounds of all sorts that translate into direct effects on the game action. fears, phobias and wounds of all sorts translate into direct effects on the game action More than just a game Just to give an example, rushing to the edge of a roof will cause an attack of vertigo followed by blurry vision and uncertain step, obstacles not to be underestimated during a feverish escape. Even when we have a weapon we will have to deal with wounds and phobias capable of destabilizing the aim and slow down the movements and we will find ourselves dosing medicines and bandages with the aim both of surviving and of keeping us fit enough to face situations that are always tighter and more difficult. NPCs (non-player characters) movements are always believable and it's incredibly difficult to shrug off pursuers; in fact, once identified, to avoid an unpleasant end, we will have to get out of the enemy's visual range and then find a hiding place dark enough to hide completely. But Dark Corners Of Earth doesn't just simulate the most eventful and disturbing aspect of Lovecraft's stories and season it all with a believable world, with pitfalls, mysterious inscriptions and puzzles of all sorts. The title will slowly guide us through the facets of an age-old nightmare and it is a delightfully disturbing pleasure to unveil the trail of misfortunes, guilt and catastrophes that the cult of Dagon has left behind over the years. It is therefore profoundly wrong to think of being in a first-person shooter characterized by adventure elements, because Call Of Cthulu: Dark Corners Of Earth is a real adventure that integrates action and first-person shooters into its structure, binding them doubly with their own peculiarities. The representation of the nightmare The title of Headfirst has hadto a rather long gestation but this factor has guaranteed him an optimization that transpires from every detail. Large spaces full of objects and details are immersed in plays of light carefully studied to create a unique atmosphere. The models, although not too varied, are detailed and soft, the heat distorts the air, the liquids reflect the environment in real time and there is no shortage of graphic effects of all sorts to underline wounds, phobias, vertigo. The town of Innsmouth is full of ravines, stairways and from the street it is possible to observe cellars, corridors, passages, terraces and interiors with a result capable of giving incredible depth to the environment that surrounds us. Even the interiors enjoy incredible care, both as regards the houses, literally full of furniture, cabinets, bookcases, boxes and common objects, and proceeding through tunnels, catacombs and the dark caverns of the cult of Dagon which show aberrant sculptures, lights aliens and crazy architectures. Unfortunately some models intended for monsters are more spartan than others, but the overall result is to be rewarded without any doubt. the town of Innsmouth is full of ravines, stairways and from the street it is possible to observe cellars, corridors, passages, terraces and interiors The representation of the nightmare On the auditory side Dark Corners Of Earth is extremely rich in sighs, sound effects, screams, crunches and the musical theme, albeit made up of rather monotonous environmental themes, is able to very well support the tense climate of the game. The speech is in perfect harmony with the atmosphere of the title, surrounded by inhuman screams and sometimes sincerely disturbing visceral voices. Comment Dark Corners Of Earth is a peculiar title that mixes adventure, first person shooter, horror and role-playing and does it in an excellent way by proposing itself on the market as the real surprise of this period. I found myself faced with an elaborate, well-finished and optimized product as rarely happens and I can only praise the amount of details and peculiarities that it is able to offer. Up to now, in my opinion, only Blade Runner had managed to re-propose cinematic and literary concepts with similar intensity in a playful form. The Headfirst-branded creature is a title that I warmly recommend to all categories of gamers and, above all, to those looking for a new experience, on the other hand there is no doubt that it is intended more for Lovecraft and Cthulhu fans, who are able to fully grasp the structure and the details that distinguish it. All the others should at least give it a chance, given the excellent marketing price. Pros: very rich and well-finished four genres in one with very few smudges exceptional transposition Cons: partly dedicated to Cthulhu fans arrives ~slightly~ late Cross-platform Call of Cthulhu is available for both PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game remains substantially identical, with the differences, now known, due to the different hardware. The Xbox version, therefore, is distinguished by a greater cleaning of the image and texture definition. Most likely Fear and Call Of Cthulhu definitively consecrate the horror genre in the first person, but if the first uses technology to create its atmospheres the second, whose birth lasted as long as the entire life of the Microsoft console, aims to rebuild a world where terror is at home and where escape is the only effective weapon. Dark Corners Of Earth immerses us completely in the universe created by Lovecraft, where man is an infinitesimal and fragile being trapped by the limits of his own conscience, and as if that weren't enough deluded by a divine chimera that hides the dark darkness of the universe .", "date": "2005-10-25", "grade": null}
