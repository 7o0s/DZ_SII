In the videogame field, the most interesting experiment in this sense is certainly that of American McGee's Alice and its sequel, a variation on the theme of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in which the protagonist is indeed a girl able to access an alternative world, but far from ~wonderful~ and probably the result of his madness. GRIN, a small Belgian team made up of just five people (two programmers, two graphic designers and a writer), tried to create a similar project inspired by the tale of Little Red Riding Hood and successfully financed the operation on Kickstarter. In narrative terms, the result is undoubtedly fascinating: Riding Red Hood is not a clueless child, but a shrewd and courageous girl, determined to avenge the mysterious death of her father, a scientist at the service of Woolfe Industries, with axes. Chaired by the evil B.B. Woolfe, the company has gradually replaced all its employees with automatons and has even equipped itself with an army of robots to control the streets of Ulrica, a city in which it has now become dangerous to walk. Our task, in view of a 2.5D action platform structure, will therefore be to explore the scenarios, solve a certain amount of environmental puzzles and eliminate any enemies in our path, in order to find out what really happened and stop Woolfe's folly once and for all. Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries is a charming fairy tale reinterpretation, but with a few flaws too many Like a fairy tale The atmosphere of Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries is enhanced by a musical accompaniment that is very reminiscent of the works of Tim Burton, as well as well-made English dialogues (the localization in Italian, at the moment, is completely absent). The design of the scenarios is also effective and convincing, ranging from the curious architecture of the city to the pitfalls present in the subsoil, passing through the premises of Woolfe Industries and finally arriving at the improbable geometries of a ~dreamlike~ forest with fairy-tale connotations, between platforms suspended in the void and menacing brambles to avoid. An excellent work which, however, does not extend to the characterization of the enemies, which in addition to the successful ~tin soldiers~ offers very little: the mice are animated badly, the ~fairies~ have a generic appearance and the same can be said of a of the bosses that we will face, the Pied Piper. The protagonist herself boasts a fascinating appearance, with long platinum-colored hair and the inevitable red cape, but even in that case the quantity and quality of the animations leave something to be desired. They are all limitations of a production that has built around itself perhaps too high expectations compared to the independent nature of the project, so much so that the developers had to explain well on Steam what is legitimate or not to expect from their title. In fact, the experience boasts enormous potential, which however is not best expressed also due to the reduced duration of the adventure, which can be completed in about two hours. The sensation, having arrived in the phase of the final confrontation, is of a sort of ~early closure~ which refers to a possible sequel, the realization of which will however depend on the response obtained at the onset. Between lights and shadows The shortcomings attributable to the production value of Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries are quite evident in terms of direction and use of effects, with the depth of field that often misfires and sequences that end with a sound or an image out of place. The work carried out as a whole, however, appears solid and convincing, even more so if we consider the issue of the atmosphere that we have addressed previously. In short, these are edges on which it is easily possible to turn a blind eye, but which unfortunately are accompanied by far more relevant problems which, in this case, concern the gameplay. It is not a question of challenge or linearity of the experience, although these factors are difficult to ignore, but of a couple of specific defects: on the one hand, the difficulty of identifying the position of the protagonist during the jumps, which take place in a three-dimensional space and are often subject to chasms that lead to game over (although the abundance of checkpoints saves goat and cabbage); on the other a yield scflying and ethereal of impacts, which makes fights much less fun than they should be. At this juncture there is then the question of a very basic artificial intelligence of the opponents, so much so that in the presence of dangers we will eventually be able to move away behind a corner and wait for the partial restoration of vital energy and then return to the attack, exploiting both normal maneuvers (fast and heavy attacks) and special moves, the latter regulated by a special bar. GRIN therefore tries to give a happy ending to his fairy tale, and the commitment made by the small Belgian team must certainly be recognized, even if the results are controversial.", "date": "2015-04-05", "grade": "6.5"}
