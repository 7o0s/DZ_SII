{"name": "Krispee Street: la recensione dello strano gioco di ricerca oggetti di Netflix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/krispee-street-recensione.html", "text": "Netflix continues to offer mobile games within its subscription and also demonstrates that it has interesting selection criteria, putting together truly special playful offers, as we see in this review of Krispee Street. The title in question is rather far from the standard trappings of a well-structured video game and rather appears to be a sort of pastime more akin to simple puzzles, supported however by an artistic direction of considerable impact, thanks to the use of the drawings by Krispee Comics and the care with which these are presented and packaged in this bizarre ~adventure~, if we can call it that. To be honest, it is practically the digital transposition of the good old ~Where's Wally?~, the series of illustrated books by Martin Handford which has established itself all over the world, focusing on intricate drawings to be observed centimeter by centimeter looking for the funny striped knit character. Similarly, Krispee Street leads us to explore large miniature illustrated tables on smartphone screens in this bizarre game that falls under the ~Hidden Object~ classification, i.e. an adventure based on the search for hidden objects within various screens . We saw something similar - in terms of concept and artistic elaboration - a few years ago with Hidden Folks, but in this case the game is even more basic. We are practically at the antipodes compared to Arcanium: Rise of Akhan, the other title reviewed in the past few days by the Netflix catalogue: while that is a solid card-based RPG and endowed with a considerable thickness, this is a small pastime supported by a splendid graphic style and the likeability that he manages to arouse from his drawings. However, both combine to form a decidedly varied play offer, which bodes well for the future of games on the famous streaming video service. Explore the drawings Krispee Street offers very detailed illustrations The concept is very simple, deriving in fact from the one used for children's illustrated books: it is a question of observing the proposed drawings and finding a certain number of objects and characters for each one, passing from one to the other in a progressive way. The initial endowment is 6 tables, but these are probably destined to increase in number since there are already at least a couple arriving in the next few days, so we can expect an increase in possible choices in a short time. Not that the initial ones offer little content, in any case: the designs are large and extremely rich and complex, overflowing with elements that fill every square centimeter, so much so that finding the required characters is truly a challenge. The lens remains fixed in superimposition, within a circle that can be positioned at various points on the screen so as to always have it under our eyes as we wander among the thousand elements of the drawings. It seems strange, but there is so much stuff on the screen that finding the required characters can become a major challenge, even frustrating in some cases. The skill required is exclusively that of discerning the subject within Krispee's intricate drawings, with the possibility of scrolling on the table and zooming in or out of view, but at certain levels some skills in analyzing and reading the image are also involved . Krispee Street, three images taken from some plates Looking closely at the subjects to look for, it is possible to detect some elements, perhaps around the main figure, which can help place him in the setting, obtaining small but fundamental clues on where to look. This, in addition to the glance, is in fact the only ability required by Krispee Street, which for the rest does not count on a properly structured gameplay, limiting itself to offering a small entertainment on mobile platforms that can work well as a quick portable pastime .On the other hand, the strength of the ~game~ lies entirely in its artistic contents: Krispee's graphic style is clean, strange and funny at the right point and immersing yourself in these illustrated tables is really a pleasure. They are also supported by a good ~contextual~ sound design, which highlights some sounds in correspondence with the closest elements in the frame, which makes the paintings more ~alive~.", "date": "2022-02-17", "grade": "7.0"}
