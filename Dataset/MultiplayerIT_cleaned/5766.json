{"name": "We can be Zheros", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/162229-zheros-we-can-be-zheros.html", "text": "Playing Zheros makes the mind travel to rather distant things over the years, and not just because the not exactly brainy action leaves room for an alternative use of neurons while pounding on the keys. The continuous repetition of situations, the game's tendency to put you in difficulty simply by throwing a hallucinating amount of enemies at you, the level design that serves just to prepare you for the next battle, the difficulty of some sections and the need to restart (often) from the start of the level with the consequent loss of all the progress made in the last long minutes of the game, these are all sensations that make you go back in time, to when the scrolling beat'em ups rolled unchallenged. At the time of Streets of Rage you could have imagined what the chapters following the third could have been like, with even more stunning and finally photorealistic graphics, incredible animations and increasingly complex scenarios... But no. It would not have been easy to foresee, at the time, that the summa of the genre was precisely what was being experienced in those years and that the magic was hidden precisely among those large colored pixels, in the charisma of those 16-bit graphics which today can to be honored at most, aped, but no longer achieved. It's a matter of technology, taste and business, of the mix of these elements which in fact define the eras of the videogame market and which have sanctioned the inexorable conclusion of the scrolling fighting game in its most classic sense. Already in this generic discourse we can recognize the problems in which a game like Zheros necessarily stumbles, wanting to recall certain historical dynamics even though it is evidently the son of the current videogame generation and thus resulting in a sort of genuine tribute well appreciated by lovers of the genre but also a game clearly out of time, in absolute terms. Its focus exclusively on wild and largely unruly clashes, the barely sketched system of character evolution and the game design flattened exclusively on successive brawls highlight an uncompromising classicism that clashes with current standards. This in itself does not represent a necessarily negative element, indeed for the nostalgic it can be a real boon, but the repetition of the same situations and button mashing to exhaustion may not meet with everyone's favor. Zheros is a fascinating dive into a past that doesn't seem to be able to return Star Wars There is no need for great premises to stage continuous fisticuffs, but the Catania developers Rimlight Studios still had the excellent idea of going down the road of parody, telling the very simple story of Mike and Captain Dorian through funny scenes intermezzo practically devoid of dialogue, all played on gestures, expressions and small but hilarious comedy. The pretext is very simple: the evil Dr. Vendetta's robotic hosts are conquering planet after planet and only the aforementioned couple of space heroes can stop the threat, obviously with blows. The two characters are practically equivalent, with Mike more prone to powerful blows and Dorian faster and more agile, resulting in marginal stylistic variations in the combat system, which is classic but with some interesting introductions: the combos are mainly based on the alternation of attacks light and fast or heavy and slow, charged shots, jumps and dodges, but in addition to these there is a ranged attack to be carried out with the firearm and a practical directional shield. The firearm obviously comes in handy for keeping enemies at a distance but has a limited duration, while the shield has the particular characteristic of being able to reflect the bullets back to the sender, but only if it is extracted in a precise window of time, rather short but still able to insert a further variation in the rhythms of the standard combat. Enemies come in various types within the approximately twenty levels scattered across the two main settings of Zheros, and require slightly different approaches and fighting styles, even if the game's tendency to throw thick swarms of enemies around the protagonist often frustrates strategic ambitions, pushing more than anything else to button mashing, but on the other hand this too is an element that refers to the tradition of the genre. On the other hand, the combos are numerous and pleasant, which as you advance in levels become more and more complicated by including jumps, shots from a distance and projections. The characters can evolve through a basic growth system based on the application of experience points in the three main areas of strength, firearm and shield, whichreflect in power increases in the respective sectors and in the unlocking of new and more powerful combos. The problem with this embryonic role-playing implementation is that experience points are awarded only at the end of the level and only if a minimum required score has been reached, otherwise we have simply thrown away an opportunity and are forced to continue without receiving any increase, unless you want to replay the level you just finished. It is a rather severe system that undermines the sense of continuous progression with each game which has now become a sort of videogame standard, especially since the leveling of the characters becomes practically mandatory as you progress through the game. Xbox One goals Zheros contains 20 achievements for a total of 1000 points to add to the gamerscore, so not many achievements to collect but all quite rich. Some are unlocked based on cumulative performances (killing a certain amount of enemies, performing a certain amount of times or finishing a level without being hit, for example) but even the simple conclusion of the Campaign will make you accumulate a good amount of points. Scrambled superheroes The levels, distributed in the two main macro-areas (one set between industries and futuristic cities, the other more devoted to wild and alien ~nature~), offer very few distractions from the fighting. The level design has the only function of making us move from one fight to another up to the end of the course, with some elementary platform-style sections with traps and obstacles to avoid but without offering particular solutions to detach from the mechanics of the fighting game, while also maintaining in this a firm coherence with the canon of the genre. However, where Zheros redeems itself from this lack of originality is in the graphic characterization, which manages to give a certain particular identity to the game world. A rather mature artistic direction, despite the relative inexperience of the team, has focused on the creation of caricatured characters in the style of Pixar's Incredibles, for example, and the cartoonish tone is also evident in the representation of the enemies, despite a certain aseptic cut of the scenarios, more laid out on classic sci-fi standards. The result is a game with a certain character, from an aesthetic point of view, able to stand out in the current chaos of indie titles while choosing to fully adhere to consolidated genre mechanics. Everything is so clean and pleasant as to overshadow the various technical flaws that are detected already in the first game, between drops in fluidity, not excellent resolution and in some cases perceptible micro-blocks in the passages between cut-scenes and action or between different sections of the game. Overall, the feeling is that there was a bit of a lack of optimization, perhaps due to the need to stay on schedule and the small size of the studio. Finally, we point out that Zheros, like any self-respecting beat'em up, gives its best played in multiplayer, in this case in two-player cooperative mode, with both protagonists active on the screen. In this way the game is much more enjoyable but for this very reason the lack of online multiplayer is a pity: certainly the physical presence of the gamemate at your side is also an important element of this hymn to the videogame times that were, but expanding the possibilities of using the cooperative with the implementation of online could be decisive for fully exploiting all the potential.", "date": "2016-01-20", "grade": "6.5"}
