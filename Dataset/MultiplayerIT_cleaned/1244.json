Go around galaxies aboard your own spaceship, not having to look at anyone, or rather look at everyone in search of some familiar face; haunting the slums, triggering gunfights, and periodically delivering interplanetary scum dead or alive, it's not a job for everyone. But Jango lives on this and much more, so how to resist the call of the largest bounty placed on someone's head? Impossible. So here we are, ready to leave for this exciting adventure, with our pocket arsenal and our experience on our shoulders, which will take us to travel far and wide in a world full of...full of..a moment. Where have the colors gone?! There at Lucasarts they must have probably forgotten that they made that wonder for the eyes called Rogue Leader, because if there is an adjective that best describes BH's graphics, it is: flat. Flat and dull to be exact, both in terms of structure and for the coloring of the levels that touch peaks of three or maximum four colors simultaneously on the screen. All right, it's not a classic Nintendo game hyper-colored like Mario Sunshine, it has to reflect urban atmospheres, slums, dark and distant space. But that all the buildings are of the same color or its shades of two or three degrees and that the NPCs that populate the schemes are all shades of gray or yellow, it's definitely too much. The level design is very bare, not at all inspired and the atmospheres of this fascinating world are only recalled by the name of the place. What really leaves us perplexed is the construction of the levels, decidedly bad; it should be remembered that this is an action-shooter game where the jumps are not the fulcrum of the action. Someone then explain to me why very often you have to juggle Mario-style jumps whose mistake inexorably leads to Game Over! But the most painful note is undoubtedly the absence of a map that would help the unfortunate player not to get lost around these levels, which, despite being ill-conceived, are certainly not short. Ok that exploration is interesting, but wandering aimlessly, especially when you don't know where to go, is inconceivable. As are the checkpoints scattered throughout the missions, placed without knowledge and with the result of making the action frustrating in having to start over from the beginning of the level in most cases. The model of the character controlled by you is functional, faithfully recreated from the film model, not too detailed, but being the third person view it does its duty. ~Alive or dead... you will come with me!~ All in all, the weapons at your disposal are numerous: Jango starts with the two legendary Westar-34 in Dalloriana alloy, his jet pack on his back, the dart launcher, the flamethrower and the rope to capture all housed in the wrist and the scanner with which ... look round. Continuing with the mission, his armament will undergo a frightening increase, making our Bounty Hunter a real wandering war machine; melta bombs, sniper rifles, missile and jetpack cluster missile, heavy cannon, grenade launcher and blaster rifle stolen from some hapless trooper. To all this armament is added the function of the scanner, which will be used to identify the wanted people who blend in among ordinary people; they camouflage precisely since it is possible to cross two IDENTICAL npgs but one of which is wanted and the other is not. Once we find a criminal we will be able to choose whether to take the engagement and therefore having to capture him dead or alive. This is a bit mechanical, since to do this you will have to keep it well in the center of your scanner visor without being discovered... and be close enough to be able to tie it like a salami; pity that while you are in scan mode you will not be able to move your character, but only the view and the lag between mode changes is often felt. Especially in the most agitated situations where it won't be difficult to get a bullet in the head, thus making the coveted prey escape. Speaking of animations, the brave Mandalorian behaves like a worthy pupil of Lara Croft: jump, roll, climb, hang, swing, fly with the jetpack as long as the batteries last and through the lock on the enemy he has the ability to shoot multiple targets simultaneously in different directions. They do their duty, neither too woody nor too realistic but they make the idea and don't make Jango look like a single piece of scrap metal. So we will havea canonical control system: one button for shooting, one for jumping, one for actions (such as activating levers or opening doors), one for locking the enemy, one for dodging/rolling, one for the jetpack and finally one with which recall the inventory and change view. The sound is perhaps the strong point of the game, made in a truly commendable way by Skywalker Sound, it boasts one of the best soundtracks, in perfect style with the SW saga. The speech as well as the screen writings are totally in Italian, the acting is sufficient in the valuable cut-scenes not made with the game engine. ~My Name is Fett, Jango Fett~ Longevity is closely affected by playability in a title like Starwars: Bounty Hunter. This is because the real difficulty often lies in coping with situations in which you don't know where to go, with controls that don't respond perfectly, with poorly designed levels and with a camera that is sometimes unbearable. The levels, 18 in total, are huge but all the same in their mechanics which can dissatisfy the player looking for a varied title; which BH sure isn't. Other than that the AI isn't well programmed, the enemies will just shoot you on sight by shooting in unison and approaching you; the bosses will have their own attack pattern which, once learned, will be very easy to evade. Ultimately, the difficulty lies in finding the exit of the pattern without wandering around in circles and without unknowingly returning to the beginning of the pattern. A pity because with a little more attention it would have come out a captivating title. Comment From start to finish this title is a huge Deja-Vu, nothing new under the sun both in terms of gameplay and game mechanics. A real disappointment because it could count on an evergreen license and a captivating character. The graphics are saved in sporadic cases with some points of merit but are often below average in terms of color and construction choice. The controls do their duty, but the camera in most situations ruins the action with improbable and confusing shots. The poorly calibrated difficulty delivers the coup de grace. It's not a title to throw away completely, it always gives fun and being accompanied by such a soundtrack is a real pleasure; it's quite long and full of extras even if a little frustrating to unlock. Recommended if you don't have too many pretensions and you can't stand without Action games, but a try before buying is mandatory. Pros: There is Jango Fett Cinematic soundtrack Captivating protagonist characters Cons: Levels poorly conceived both graphically and structurally. Camera issues Repetitive and monotonous A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away when Luke was yet to be born, his father was still a pretty boy and Yoda was making jumps at which Peter Parker shivered, not all was rosy. Obviously. The power of the Sith was threatened by a new Cult unknown before then, to eradicate this menace there was a need for the bravest, boldest, most ruthless, most violent man in the solar system. The best, from which to clone the perfect army. So Bruce Willis? ... NO, unfortunately it's your turn.", "date": "2004-07-23", "grade": null}
