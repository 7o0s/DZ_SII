{"name": "Chicago 1930", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chicago-1930.html", "text": "The interface The game system is simple and intuitive, regardless of the faction we decide to control. First we will have to choose which mission to carry out among those proposed (at most two, but in many cases the choice is forced), by selecting the relative Chicago district. Each district contains one or two special characteristics that allow access to certain resources, such as more men to choose from for squad members and better weapons, but also perks such as increased popularity (which seemed useless to me anyway), reduced sentence in case of arrest, or a gymnasium in which to teach new skills to their men. At this point it is necessary to select the four members of the team to support our alter-ego (Beretto for the mafia and Nash for the FBI) among those available and decide on the equipment. These phases are very important for the success of the mission, given the limited number of men and the small inventory space. In fact, every man has five skills (shooting, throwing, melee, first aid and charisma), so it's important to choose the right men and assign each one the tasks he can do best. Once on a mission, the view and the game system are the same as already seen and tested in almost all RTS, i.e. the usual 2D isometric view with select-point-click interface. The way of approaching the various assignments is somewhere between Commandos and Syndicate (I couldn't find two more different titles), in the sense that in the game there are numerous firefights, especially in the last missions of each campaign, and the enemies are often placed in strategic or at least favorable positions (such as three one meter from the door with their machine guns leveled, ready to riddle anyone who enters). So the head-on attack is 90% of the time a suicide, while it is much more advisable to go around them, analyze well how they are arranged and strike where they are most vulnerable; at the same time, however, once in the middle of a shooting you have to move and give the right orders quickly. The problem of time therefore arises: a PC can make billions of calculations in one second, while the reaction time of a human being to an unexpected situation is 1.5 seconds (CSI docet), furthermore we must bear in mind that we have to direct 5 men, not one. To overcome this handicap, without however inserting the pause already seen in far too many games, the programmers of the Wanadoo team have opted for a slow-motion effect, which allows you to give orders relatively calmly, but still obliges you to be careful and not leave plenty of time to think. The effect is very immersive, in perfect Matrix style, with afterimages following the characters and distorted sound effects, also during the slow-mo it is possible to assign each man a target, which they will continue to shoot until he dies or at the end of the bullets, while normally it is necessary to press the button for each single shot. It goes without saying that in this way most of the shootings will be tackled with the use of slow-motion, the important thing however is not to abuse it, since it has a time limit, after which it will automatically deactivate and you will have to wait for it to ~reload  before using it again. Mafia vs FBI If from a technical point of view there are no differences between the two campaigns, there are instead, and in abundance, from a practical point of view. In fact, between the two campaigns the way of managing the missions changes radically. Apart from the obvious, the mafiosi will be able to make good or bad times having to worry only about the witnesses (and if there are, they will either be bribed or killed), while the agents will have to be certain of someone's guilt before using the strong ways, there are certain situations that border on the paradox. Let me explain: to be able to arrest someone, the handcuff symbol must be above his head, and to shoot him that of the viewfinder, otherwise you get ~warnings from the FBI~ and the tenth agent is arrested. Incredibly, however, while it is logical that it costs more for a criminal to kill a policeman than a civilian (5 warnings against 1), why if an agent kills a mafioso before the crosshair symbol appears, are they counted 5? Is the life of an armed guy worth more than that of a helpless bystander? Also, when you aim a weapon at a criminal there is a chance that he will raise his hands, and it will be possible to search him. However, the paradox arises when an arsenal (machine gun, shotguns, knives, etc.) is found on the picciotto on duty and despite this, the symbol does not appear and it cannot be stoppedare. The same happens when you meet someone with his weapon already leveled, you can't hit him until he takes some hostile action (and what did he want to do with that machine gun, clay pigeon shooting with flies?). The only way to resolve these stalemates is to holster your weapon in order to entice the enemy to point his weapon at you (thus performing an action that identifies him as a criminal), then quickly draw it and hit him before he does. Truly inconceivable as well as risky. Final comment It is difficult to define a title like Chicago 1930. The settings are very rich in details and the interaction with the environment is almost total, so much so that by shooting at plants or newspapers you will see leaves and paper fragments flying, furthermore you can effectively exploit the covering tables, walls, objects or even other people to reduce the chance of being hit. The slow-motion idea is excellent, as is the effect obtained, and the plot is intriguing up to the final twist. However, some not insignificant defects remain, such as those I listed in the previous paragraph or the excessively limited range of weapons (8m for a machine gun, 10 for a pistol and 12 for a rifle are a bit short) or of the same visual range (less than 10m and without obstacles in between a sentry stood still like a cod). Even taking all this into account, Chicago 1930 remains a good game and, if one were willing to turn a blind eye to some imperfections, it can really be considered an excellent title, recommended for all lovers of the genre. Pros: Strategy and action perfectly mixed Engaging and effective slow-mo Extremely detailed environments and with an incredible level of interactivity Cons: Vision and weapon range far too small Solo 20 missions between the two campaigns make it a bit too short Gaps in criminal recognition system in the FBI campaign The City of Corruption The game begins in the moment of maximum development of criminal activities, 1928, when an all-out war broke out between the gang of the Irishman Hank O'Neil who currently held control of the city and that of the emerging Don Falcone, boss ambitious and ruthless, who had no intention of letting slip the ~goose that laid the golden eggs~ that Chicago had become after the advent of prohibition. A war that the authorities were neither ready nor able to face, both due to the lack of resources and the corruption that was rampant everywhere. After the short but evocative introductory film, we will have to choose between two possible campaigns: that of the mafia set in 1928 and that of the FBI which takes place in 1930. If we decide to follow the plot (it is however possible to play them independently), we will find ourselves directing a handful of Don Falcone's picciotti, led on the field by Jack Beretto, known as ~the Executioner~, right-hand man of the boss and called to the city to do the dirty work. Our task will be to conquer the entire city, neighborhood by neighborhood, wresting it from the hands of the Irish and the police through ten missions. After the first campaign, we will have under our control a small group of federal agents of undoubted loyalty, commanded by Edward Nash, with the task of regaining control of the city, from the clutches of Don Falcone, who in the meantime has assumed complete control .", "date": "2004-01-12", "grade": null}
