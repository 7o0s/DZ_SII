Let's take a team like Sumo Digital for example: active since 2003, the English studio has had franchises such as OutRun, LittleBigPlanet, Hitman, Forza Horizon and the various Sonic-dedicated racers in its hands, collaborating with many important companies to assist them in the creation of games triple A or dedicating himself to important conversions. Well, it is clear and evident that commissioning a team of this kind to create a mobile game for the Apple Arcade platform is an operation with a guaranteed outcome, from which only one can arise great product. Spyder, in this case, is a play on words that combines the words ~spy~ and ~spider~ to tell the amazing adventures of the tiny Agent 8, a robotic spider that can sneak in everywhere and thanks to this peculiarity it becomes the point of reference for a government agency that often has to deal with high-risk missions. The campaign currently includes six of them, including the tutorial, and it is possible to tackle them using the touch controls, which however, as we will soon see, are not always very simple to use, or a Bluetooth controller, perfectly supported. Gameplay: environmental puzzles to the whole The interesting thing about Spyder is its ability to exploit the characteristics of the protagonist, specifically its small size, the ability to adhere to any surface (or almost!) and a series of devices that mimic the functions of a real spider, useful to grab objects or move from one hold to another, to create a very pleasant and stimulating gameplay. In any case, don't expect a great challenge: the experience that Sumo Digital has packaged is almost completely free from frustration, yet manages to involve you right from the start thanks to a series of effective solutions. After the long initial tutorial, for example, you find yourself inside an airplane that is about to drop a bomb, with the task of tampering with the systems and ensuring that it is dropped where it can do no harm; and later you explore the inside of a space probe to ensure that the astronauts who pilot it can return safely to Earth. In short, the references to the great spy films are all there, and the handful of hours necessary to complete the campaign is always in the name of the curiosity to see what's next, in what situation the agency wants to put us and what we will have to do to complete the task on duty. Perhaps the visual aids are all too evident, between indicators and arrows that make it really difficult to make mistakes or even just waste time, but in the end the experience works like this. It's just a pity that the touch controls are a bit cumbersome to use due to the management of the camera, which is not assigned to a virtual stick on the right side of the screen but must be adjusted by dragging two fingers on the touch screen. The controller is therefore much better, although even so there are situations in which the view becomes complicated to position and can give rise to some madness. From a technical point of view, an excellent job has been done: net of the blunders just mentioned, Spyder boasts a good personality, Agent 8 is very nice and a certain care has been placed in the creation of the scenarios, even if the quality moves in this case between ups and downs. Let's say that there are some details accompanying the central elements (see the astronauts) that give a very clear idea of the production value of this small but fun adventure, which also in terms of sound keeps faith with the own cinematographic vocation, accompanying us with retro-style music which, however, does not remain in the head.", "date": "2020-04-07", "grade": "7.8"}
