This is an important detail to specify before starting with the actual game review, because it is the node on which the charm of this small but overall successful game is based. Strategic gameplay Counter Terrorist Agency (CTA) is the name of a fictitious supranational agency that is responsible for tracking down terrorist cells scattered throughout the planet and, possibly, preventing their actions. The player plays the role of an operator of the agency itself who, faced with a map of the world that can be enlarged at will, must use the tools available to the CTA to identify suspects, define their role and move to render them harmless. Basically, CTA is triggered when a suspicious conversation is intercepted between two individuals, or when a person takes some traceable action that raises concern, such as doing a lot of online gun searches or contacting another suspect. Once a person at risk has been identified, it is necessary to act within the given time to discover his intentions and profile him. To do this, his conversations can be intercepted, or his social network can be accessed or his emails can be read and so on. Each of the individuals profiled may be complete strangers or active in a terrorist cell. In the first case you stop tracking him, while in the second you need to define his role within the organization, be it a simple member with functions that are not perfectly defined, or a soldier, or even one of the leaders, perhaps also with organizational duties. Once a terrorist has been identified, he can be arrested, to render him harmless and to be able to carry out other actions, such as for example interrogating him, to arrive at the unveiling of the cell to which he belongs. When an operation is completed, we are awarded points based on the accuracy with which we have profiled the various individuals tracked and the demonstrated ability to prevent terrorist acts, perhaps by arresting a suspect who, if left on the loose, could become dangerous. Management gameplay The points received from operations serve a specific purpose: to give more tools to the CTA. As in a sort of role-playing game, in fact, it is possible to spend them on skill trees that increase the actions available to us and improve our relations with world governments, the latter being the only ones able to provide us with the resources necessary to transform our investigations into field actions. Basically everything we do requires the use of resources, be it police officers, computer operators or the friendship of entire nations (in the beginning we only have access to a few territories). Having more resources is vital to act effectively in the most complex situations, those involving a large number of people scattered over different territories and whose investigations require the use of many men. In fact, each action has a success rate that increases or decreases based on the resources used. The gameplay of Counter Terrorist Agency is therefore formed partly by investigations and partly by managing relations with states: losing the trust of a nation means losing key contacts and resources, making us blind in some situations. Don't worry, because the game mechanics are much less complex than they seem and the tutorial is enough to understand most of the dynamics reproduced by the developers. To make everything more complicated is the intertwining of cases and the increase in their scope. Here, however, a precise limitation of the game appears: some simplifications translate into a certain basic repetitiveness which, after a few hours, can get tiring. It is true that there are many cases and, until all the unlockables have been unlocked, it is played with great pleasure, but Counter Terrorist Agency arrives at the ten hours of play with a little shortness of breath, that is, having shown almost everything it had to show off. The substance is that when you become infallible, i.e. you manage to profile suspects with great precision, there are few incentives left to continue, such as to play again. However, the title of Play2Chill is an interesting and original idea, which partially recalls the Orwells, albeit with less dystopian tones and more tending towards realism. From a technical point of viewinstead there is little to say: Counter Terrorist Agency is made up of a silent map of the world on which ultra-stylized planes move and a series of non-animated pop-up windows whose most important part are the texts, certainly not the few graphic elements such as portraits and small illustrations. Overall the Secret Service terminal style isn't bad, but it's pretty classic and doesn't say much. Let's say that the game points to something else to entertain. Something more could instead be done at the interface level, with some buttons that are not exactly obvious and waste a few moments. You get used to it, of course, but we've seen better.", "date": "2019-12-02", "grade": "7.5"}
