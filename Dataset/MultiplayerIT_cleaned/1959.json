{"name": "Sega Soccer Slam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-soccer-slam.html", "text": "Like in a cartoon In Soccer Slam, 2 teams each made up of 3 players, plus the ever-present goalkeeper, take to the field. The resulting ~sport~ is something similar to five-a-side football but which actually draws more inspiration from the actions of 11-a-side football, even if the players will hardly be recognizable as footballers. The teams are in fact made up of wrestlers, athletes of different disciplines, extraterrestrials, women, men of the most disparate sizes (ranging from small to XXXXL size) and physical characteristics. Each formation has peculiarities that differentiate it from the others and I am not referring only to the technical data (speed, shooting, technique...) but to real and highly spectacular special moves that can be activated during the matches. What is striking at first glance is the incredible characterization of the characters. Each of these, in addition to being made with great detail, comes to life with its own voice, its own personality, always different facial expressions and celebrations. The impression is that of being faced with a cartoon in which each character plays his or her role in the story and that would really be the case if we weren't instead on the green grass of a soccer field. The only rule is that there are no rules... Perhaps at this point it will be clearer to you that we are dealing with a title that has a very particular relationship with football, since in Soccer Slam the humorous, cartoonish component is much more important than the realistic-simulation one. If we add to this that the only valid rule is that there are no rules, it is easy to imagine that the matches take place with no holds barred, marked by violence and special effects. Between killer tackles, back-heel strikes and improbable overhead kicks, special shots sometimes make their appearance and are displayed in ~slow motion~, a detail that gives a Matrixian aspect to the actions. There are five game modes available: Arcade, Quest, Challenge, Tourney, and Practice. While the classic single player modes have to offer nothing different than other football titles, something different comes to us from the ~Quest~, in which we will find ourselves entangled in some tests, mostly timed, which will put the our skills. For example, we will have to achieve a certain number of goals, special shots or collect the highest number of points by performing spectacular actions. By successfully completing the tests, you will have the opportunity to unlock numerous extras including new teams and stadiums. Bullet time is back Moving on to the actual game, it is important to underline how Soccer Slam is a game of great immediacy and easy to understand. Even newcomers to console gaming will already be able to perform almost all the most spectacular game actions after 2-3 games and learn the secrets that will lead them to success. The more experienced players can instead try to complicate their lives by choosing a higher level of difficulty or by increasing the speed of the game using the appropriate option in the selection menu. However, immediacy is not the only quality of Soccer Slam which is above all fun and, in some cases, exciting. What is surprising is the considerable variety of actions that can be created and the simplicity of their execution. By simply pressing the pass key (A by default) it is possible to reach an unmarked teammate with passes from before, or to cross (holding down the same key) in an attempt to find the center forward's header. If headers seem too common, you can also try to pierce the net with an acrobatic shot, a scissor or with a back-heel or one of the special shots available. The latter are accessed with the left trigger thanks to which the selected player will transform into water, fire or the typical element of the team he belongs to, gaining incredible speed and increased ability to score. Other power-ups instead give us the possibility to defy the laws of gravity, making leaps worthy of the best Sergey Bubka (without the rod though) and kicking the ball from dizzying heights, taking advantage of something similar to Max Payne's ~Bullet time~, effect which makes the unfolding of the actions even more spectacular. 4 controllers and 3 friends... However, Soccer Slam is not perfect and, despite its undoubted advantages, it is not able to offer an infinite level of challenge, thisor at least in single-player. If you have 4 controllers and at least 3 friends, you may instead find that you have one of the funniest multiplayer titles in your hands among those released in recent months. Between blows, screams, special effects and goals that seem to be taken from the best episodes of ~Holly and Benji~, you can spend hours and hours of healthy and intense fun without realizing the passage of time. Beautiful to play but also beautiful to look at, Soccer Slam features colorful graphics of undoubted artistic quality. The design of the characters is really fantastic and each of them surprises with its originality and sympathy. The construction of the stadiums is also good, finally overflowing with a cheering polygonal public, and of the playing fields which are not made simply of static textures but of clods of earth that will rise during the matches. Much of the success of this game is also due to the beautiful animations that differ substantially from team to team and from character to character: clumsy and heavy runs, certainly not worthy of a footballer, alternate with others that are decidedly lighter and stylistically elegant. The sound is equally convincing thanks to always lively and perfectly inspired music and sound effects that make the game atmosphere festive. Alone or in company... Soccer Slam is the classic game that is in its own genre. For this reason it will be rather easy to love him, just as easy to hate him. Despite this, it is undeniable that we are dealing with a crazy, original, fun title like few others. It is probably not a game capable of offering depth and interest for a long time, but certainly a valid alternative to the serious way of playing that our consoles offer us in an increasingly massive way. I therefore feel like recommending the purchase lightly to all XBox owners, football enthusiasts and not, and above all to those who prefer the single-player game to the one shared with friends. In the latter case, you will probably have found an almost definitive solution to the boring days that the approaching winter will force us on. Pros: Easy, instant, fun! Good number of actions available Graphics and animations promoted with full marks 5 game modes Amazing in multiplayer... Cons: ...in the long run repetitive in single-player Sega reinvents football To the delight of 56 million Italians, more or less football obsessed, yet another football title has arrived on XBox, the result of a perfect conversion from the original released a few months ago for the GameCube. This is Sega Soccer Slam, and I announce that it has no rivals of its kind! Fans of Pro Evolution Soccer and Fifa don't worry, because this game has very little to do with its illustrious ~colleagues~ going far beyond both the concept of simulation and pure arcade. Would you like to know more? So put on your boots, equip yourself with a helmet and maybe a healthy dose of videogame wickedness, because the game is about to begin!", "date": "2002-11-01", "grade": null}
