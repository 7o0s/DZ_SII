Developed by a group of Canadian guys under the Stolen Couch Games label, Castaway Paradise before breaking the bank on Steam Greenlight and arriving definitively on the Valve platform, was conceived as a ~freemium~ product for mobile devices, where the reception from part of critics and public was generally positive. The transition to Windows systems was not completely painless, nevertheless it is an interesting product also by virtue of the various innovations introduced. Here because. Also arrives on PC Castaway Paradise, a clone of the famous Animal Crossing A dream shipwreck For those who have never tried the Nintendo series, which arrived in 2005 (in Europe) also on the GameCube and more recently on other systems of the Japanese giant, it is conceptually a simulator of everyday life, where the player interacts with the surrounding environment and a whole series of anthropomorphic characters who live in the same village. Fishing, growing fruit and vegetables, beautifying the landscape, customizing your home and catching insects, just to name a few, are all tasks well known by Animal Crossing fans, which translate into simple and totally relaxed gameplay, also suitable for sessions hit and run to be extended over a very long period, perhaps to follow certain events (such as Christmas) that take place in a specific season. Some of these mechanics, also derived from Natsume's Harvest Moon ~simulator~ of rural life, also published by Nintendo on the Super Famicom (our Super Nintendo) back in 1996, have successfully merged into modern casual gaming on Facebook and devices furniture, of which Zynga's Farmville represents the playfully best known and closest exponent. Castaway Paradise, as specified several times in the promotional material and by game designer Eric Diepeveen, does nothing to hide its source of inspiration and although it is practically on the verge of plagiarism, it offers some peculiar characteristics that differentiate it. It all begins with the shipwreck of our character on the beach of a tropical island, where as soon as he arrives and still covered in seaweed, he discovers from the mayor Viktoria (an anthropomorphic cow) that the storm has also involved this corner of paradise; without mincing words, the diligent mayor offers us makeshift accommodation (a tent) in exchange for support in repairing the damage. To become good and active members of society, it is necessary to get acquainted with all the bizarre inhabitants of the island, among which we find, for example, Gustave the baker moose, Amelia the postman goose, Angus the baboon and many other anthropomorphic characters. Just like in Animal Crossing, each of them has its own character and profession, and continuing in the game they will provide us with very simple missions useful for unlocking new objects and earning experience and gems, or the island's currency. An interesting aspect of the PC version, unlike those for iOS and Android, is the total absence of microtransactions and additional costs to obtain VIP status: objects, in fact, are made available simply by gaining experience, although, as we will see in the short term, the origins of a freemium product remain evident until a certain level is reached. There is no real purpose to mark the progress in the game, and beyond the quests proposed by the various characters, with the possibility of following a maximum of three at a time, the player has almost total freedom over his own actions. The ~missions~ assigned to us range from bringing messages to someone to renovating buildings, passing through the purchase of particular embellishment objects, planting flowers and trees, eliminating waste, capturing rare animals and so on, all with the same childish spirit that permeates the Nintendo work. Leveling up also unlocks new tools that allow the player to interact in various ways with the world of Castaway Paradise: among them we find the rake, the spade, the pickaxe, the fishing rod, the net and others, common objects in many products (such as the beautiful survival Don't Starve) but which here have the sole purpose of entertaining us lightly. In some cases, as specified, the inheritance of freemium dynamics emerges, which for example is reflected in waiting times for plants to grow or infrastructure repairs, actionswhich on mobile devices can be accelerated by paying for gems with hard cash. Beyond this aspect, jobs such as breaking rocks, cutting trees, fishing or watering consume stamina and after a certain number of executions it is necessary to spend gems to speed up the recharge process. On PC, once the so-called VIP status has been reached, without having to pay anything other than 15 Euros to bring the game to the hard disk, the various tools no longer consume stamina, significantly increasing the fluidity of operations. Simplicity and lightness Despite having a rather basic gameplay, the main problems of Castaway Paradise derive from the original conception for touch screens, which has resulted in a control system through the mouse and keyboard that is sometimes unresponsive and wooden. Fortunately, the developers are very attentive to community feedback, and with the latest updates the situation has significantly improved compared to the debut. Even the interface betrays the origins of the production, however thanks to the large colored icons you get used to it rather quickly. Unlike Animal Crossing, there are no circadian rhythms and the action takes place only during the day, a detail that somewhat limits some dynamics appreciated by fans of the genre, such as the appearance of animals to be captured in a specific time slot. Among other things, it is not possible to visit the islands created by other players and the only element of contact with the community are the rankings relating to fishing and catching insects: in fact, every week, the results are updated with the names of those who have conquered the largest preys. To aspire to certain species it may be necessary to resort to special feed, furthermore, once captured, the animals can be donated to the Harold squirrel museum, located in the northern area of the island but not immediately accessible. At the beginning of the adventure, in fact, some areas are not reachable due to the damage caused by the storm, however the bridges can be quickly repaired by conquering or buying so-called jigsaw pieces. The possibility of buying the various objects directly from the catalog in the menu is interesting, without necessarily having to go to any shop: as you level up, the number of objects and accessories to customize the island and character becomes practically endless, and the developers continue to offer new ones for free, even related to specific events such as the recent Mother's Day. From a technical point of view we are faced with a simple and colorful game, characterized by very few graphic options: in fact, in the launcher, only the resolution and a generic level of quality can be set (from ~fastest~ to ~prettiest~ with V-sync) , while the sound accompaniment is delegated to a nice melody, pleasant but a little repetitive in the long run. Castaway Paradise is a title designed primarily for those who need a light pastime and for the little ones, and for this reason we are sorry to report the absence of Italian subtitles, although all the actions are accompanied by comfortable and very clear colored icons.", "date": "2015-05-29", "grade": "7.0"}
