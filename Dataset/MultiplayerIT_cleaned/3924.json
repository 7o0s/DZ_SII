{"name": "Just Cause 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/just-cause-4-recensione.html", "text": "Just Cause 4 is a toy for gamers, a real virtual amusement park made of vehicles, explosions and extreme chaos. From this point of view, the developers have not denied themselves, delivering to the fans of the series exactly what they expected: a large sandbox in which they can indulge themselves by blowing up anything, launching themselves from incredible heights, gliding dizzyingly between the mountains and facing for the first time a scenario, the South American but fictitious one of the island of Solis, characterized by four different biomes that present truly peculiar meteorological conditions. In fact, the large game map alternates areas with a mild climate and places subject to sudden tropical storms with thunder and lightning, desert lands where very strong winds blow up and raise the sand and valleys where the power of gigantic tornadoes is unleashed. The unusual presence of such variable situations is somehow linked to the (not exactly irresistible) plot of Just Cause 4, which sees the protagonist Rico Rodriguez engaged in investigating the past of his family and the work done by his father in relation to devices designed to control the weather. After a first impact that is anything but friendly with the bizarre climate of Solis and with the troops of the Black Hand, the private army that controls the territory, Rico manages to prevent his friend Mira and his companions from being killed, giving life to the yet another liberation front: The Army of Chaos. The contribution of the rebel forces to the completion of the campaign will be fundamental, given that to follow the main missions of the story, linked to four specific operations, we will first have to advance our army by conquering the various regions of the map after having freed the relative bases. Gameplay It only takes a few minutes to get familiar with the gameplay of Just Cause 4, which does not differ from what was seen in the previous episodes of the series except for the addition of some elements, in this case the new gadgets for the grappling hook and the fire function secondary of the many weapons that we will happen to challenge during the adventure, with a view to a gunplay that we found light-hearted but fun. Rico sets off immediately with full gear, allowing him to move quickly using the aforementioned grappling hook, parachute, and wingsuit together; and, likewise, the new grafts are introduced during the first few hours: the Lifter, the Retractor and the Booster. The first device works in a similar way to the Fulton system of Metal Gear Solid V, allowing you to place balloons that can lift any object or person with more or less energy, activating automatically or on command. The Retractor allows you to use the hooks of the grappling hook to pull away a panel or to open a bashing door, while the Booster is a thruster that also provides variable thrust. It's possible to imaginatively combine up to ten of these gadgets at once, and we're sure we'll be seeing insane sequences on YouTube soon, with people lifting huge tankers in the air and dropping them on the head of a group of enemies, unleashing a hell of flames. In fact, the doubt arises that these innovations have been introduced with social implications in mind: an intelligent move by Avalanche Studios, which however collides with a reality in which many of these possibilities are not really exploited during the action in -game, simply because it is more practical to resort to traditional maneuvers between weapons, grappling hook and any reinforcements. The quests in which the exploitation of the new mechanics is mandatory, moreover, often turn out to be inconsistent and hasty. In any case, our character has three setups that can be recalled via the d-pad, with adjustable settings for each appendix in terms of power and activation system. By completing the missions related to the characters of Sargento, Javi and Garland it is possible to add further functions to the equipment, therefore it becomes possible to modify the maximum altitude of the Lifter and its behavior in various situations, change the speed of the Retractor and the length of the cable, add directionality, duration and acceleration to Boosters, and so on. In short, many facets that marry with the sandbox vocation of Just Cause 4 and with the desire to indulge any whim users want to indulge in using the tools that the game makes available to them. Much publicized aspects such as the highly variable weather, however, turn out to be simple gimmicks, found a bit for their own sake, ladapted to specific situations and subsequently adjustable with a limited degree of freedom. Missions and structure The Just Cause 4 map is very large and there is no doubt that observing it from above represents an evocative spectacle, especially during certain hours of the day, but in addition to the wild nature of Solis there isn't really much to explore. The bases that we will have the task of freeing and the urban areas of the scenario have in fact a generic aspect, with an obsessive repetition of the assets that goes hand in hand with gameplay mechanics in which the same situations always alternate: activate consoles and wait for the system hacking, reaching a series of devices within a time limit, freeing prisoners and escorting them to the exit, destroying or deactivating generators, or defending positions from attack by hostile troops for a certain period of time. In all cases the variable is represented solely by the quantity and types of enemies sent to stop us, and this can only create very repetitive situations, which artificially increase the duration of a campaign which is completed in about twenty of hours proceeding straight ahead and thus leaving aside the challenges and side quests. Although the latter try to introduce a minimum of experimentation, they fail to divert attention from the fact that narrative-type missions are in fact few for a title of this size and with the ambition to push the franchise to new heights: a task that Avalanche Studios fails to successfully complete, contenting itself with remaining in the wake of an experience that nevertheless boasts a certain following. Those aspects that could have changed things but unfortunately do not reside in an often basic artificial intelligence, which leads enemies to unreasonably expose themselves to our barrages, with very few exceptions (see soldiers equipped with a camouflage system , who jump around as we try to hit them). In the end it is more than anything else the exorbitant number of opponents, between units on foot and vehicles, which makes the difference as we proceed to the liberation of Solis, but the progression itself manifests itself in a controversial way, giving the sensation to already have all the necessary requirements to be able to complete the game and adding advantages (the seven unlockable pilots who transport us quickly to the areas already visited, or download weapons, vehicles and so on a few meters away) that do nothing but cut the legs off a slower and more reasoned exploration of the locations. After all, why travel by car if you can immediately use a helicopter or an airplane? Problems on PC? Our test of Just Cause 4 on PC was plagued by a long series of frustrating crashes, with or without error messages, and this inevitably affected the experience with the game. Since we had never experienced anything like this with the many other titles we have recently tried, we spoke with some colleagues and discovered that the phenomenon was quite widespread. Disabling the motion blur and the bokeh effect from the graphic options seems to make the software more stable, but the problematic state of the Avalanche Studios production is clear and evident: the day one patch will have to fix things. Graphics and sound Also in terms of technical realization Just Cause 4 focuses on performance and on the implementation of complex physics, although to say the least implausible in many of its facets, which the Apex graphics engine seems to manage without particular problems. Featuring astonishingly fast loading on PC, especially considering the size of the map, the game offers breathtaking landscapes and a convincing rendering of the elements, but looking a little closer, there are plenty of concessions to an old-generation design between textures blurry, materials arranged a bit haphazardly and, in general, an artistic direction not exactly in step with the times, very distant from the most famous productions. The fact that some elements of the review build were still work in progress, and of which it therefore seems right not to talk about, unfortunately suggests a very hasty development in the final stages, which would have needed a few more weeks to be able to present itself at its best. That said, for practical purposes everything works well: the explosions are spectacular and challenging effects such as screen space reflection have not been spared, both for the sea and for simple puddles. On the test configuration, Just Cause 4 runs at 40-45 frames per second with all settings maxed outmo and at 2160p resolution, while remaining consistent even in the most chaotic situations, with many enemies and large-scale climatic effects. To get the stable 60 fps you have to go down to 1440p or give up some adjustments, even if from this point of view the options are not many: resolution, only two types of antialiasing (FXAA and MSAA), texture and water quality, tessellation of the ocean, detail and shadow quality, ambient occlusion, motion blur, edge blur, global illumination, screen space reflections, bokeh depth of field, anisotropic filtering, and v-sync. Good news regarding the audio sector: the soundtrack of Just Cause 4 does not boast a huge personality but it can be listened to, the effects seemed good to us and the dubbing in Italian is excellent, entrusted to highly experienced actors.", "date": "2018-12-03", "grade": "7.5"}
