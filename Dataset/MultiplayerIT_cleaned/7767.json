{"name": "Ravenous Devils", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ravenous-devils-recensione.html", "text": "Two successful young entrepreneurs from the restaurant and fashion industry, Percival and Hildred, of those who fill social networks with motivational messages and complain about not finding employees who want to work for them for free, are forced to often change their headquarters company because of the originality of the ingredients used to make their dishes. Unfortunately the bigoted and backward society in which they live, immersed in a hypocritical and limiting political correctness, does not understand the beauty of grinding or bagging human beings, to then serve them to their unwitting fellows, always hungry and uninterested in wondering about the origin of the their meals. Our aim is therefore to turn the review of Ravenous Devils into an act of protest against the censorship of this couple's self-made art. Meat and clothes Percival and Hildred are a beautiful couple With Ravenous Devils, the Italian software house Bad Vices Games, to whom we owe Hippocampus: Dark Fantasy Adventure and the more particular Sexual Void, has decided to create a decidedly disturbing experience, supported by the designer Mirco Pierfederici, who oversaw the artistic direction, and by Troglobytes Games. On paper we are talking about a management game in which we have to make Percival's tailor shop and Hildred's restaurant fruitful, but in reality we are faced with a story strangely full of feelings, however perverse, in which the two lovers support each other for better or for worse. Especially in the bad. In fact, the whole game takes place in a single building divided into four floors and framed from the side: on one floor there is the tailor's shop where Percival works, on another there is the kitchen where Hildred works and on the third, placed in the middle at the other two, there's the restaurant where Hildred or a waiter serves meals to customers (who obviously don't know what they're made of). The fourth and last floor is an attic in which there is a greenhouse, useful for growing some ingredients for the restaurant (guess what they will be fertilized with?), and a luxury corpse room (let's call it that). The turnover of the dynamic duo is very simple to explain: Percival sells clothes and kills people with scissors for Hildred, sending them fresh corpses through a trapdoor that connects the inner room of the tailor's shop to the kitchen. Here the woman can grab the bodies and use them to produce ground meat, sausages or steaks, which are the basic ingredients of the restaurant menu. Hildred must therefore take the ingredients and combine them with others on work tables, and then put the dishes in the oven to cook them, before serving them in the shop displays or at the pub tables. Initially the ingredients are not all available, but they must be unlocked by purchasing improvements for the kitchen, so as to be able to create dishes of greater complexity. The more complex a dish is, the longer it will take to cook, the more customers will pay to eat it. However it is not only the restaurant to take advantage of the death of some customers, because the clothes of the victims are an excellent raw material for tailoring. In fact, Percival can use them to sew completely new clothes and then display them on the shop mannequins, for customers to use. History The game takes place in the single environment In reality, at the beginning of the game, the restaurant and the tailor shop are very poor, but by spending the money accumulated during the working days it is possible to improve all the premises, buying the aforementioned new ingredients, adding displays and tables to the pub, increasing the mannequins on to display Percival's clothes and improving working tools to speed up production. For example, you can buy more tables for cooking or a more efficient sewing machine that makes clothes in a flash. In addition to equipping the rooms, it is also possible to buy new clothes for Hildred and Percival, just to give an extra touch to the scenario. Given the theme of the game it was inevitable that the player would also be told a story. In reality, the narrative side of Ravenous Devils is very discreet in terms of how it intersects with the gameplay, managed as it is through cutscenes and letters. Hildred's Cookbook: The Main Ingredient is Love The story focuses on the work of the two and on the fact that, despite their ability, someone has come to know their real business and wants to exploit it in a rather perverse way. In addition to the main story, there are also secondary ones, useful for revealing the more human and inhuman sides of the couple. These are moments that are not invasive at all, which do not distract from the management part, given that they occur betweento working days and are not linked to particular mechanics. Once the story is over, in about five hours of play (not very few, considering the very low price), you can still continue to manage the business. Gameplay The romantic duo in the moonlight In terms of gameplay, Ravenous Devils is paradoxically relaxing. The game does not include game over and, although sometimes there are excited moments due to the overlapping of the various tasks, which are almost all managed directly by the player, at most you can disappoint some customers by not serving them anything so as to receive fewer fame points for the club at the end of the day. So the progression is constant and, even in the face of some errors, there is no risk of losing something along the way or failing. That said, the gameplay soon turns into a well-oiled mechanism, where the player rushes from one character to another during animations to give orders and keep the economy going. It doesn't take much to understand how to manage the ingredients and make sure you don't run out, even using unconventional systems to optimize everything, such as exploiting a kitten who, in the face of a few cuddles, is willing to go hunting of mice to serve to customers: a good quick meal that costs practically zero and is also quick to prepare, as well as being free-range. Ravenous Devils is graphically simple, but effective Of course, after a few hours the system starts to get tired, especially when there are no more improvements to buy and the formula starts to get repetitive, but right at that point the ending comes to close everything and to satisfy the bloodlust of our two protagonists and us players. From a technical point of view, the title of Bad Vices Games is made with great competence. Sure, it's very simple, considering that it represents only one environment and that some narrative sequences are entrusted to comics. Be that as it may, the artistic direction is excellent and the animations do their duty, especially those related to killing and processing raw materials. The few visible environments are well modeled and offer delicious details, which enrich the scene. Perhaps the background music is a little too monotonous, but at the same time it is suitable for the type of game, so in the end, little attention is paid to it. The sense of so much death Ravenous Devils also tells a story At the beginning, mincing human beings to serve them to other human beings conveys a certain uneasiness, also considering the details of the animations (the one of slaughtering for steaks is particularly disturbing) but soon you get used to it and it becomes a relaxing, almost pervasive practice in its cruel beauty. When one has entered its ganglia and let oneself go, Ravenous Devils becomes a mirror of the contemporary world, in which one can sink gently, transforming the massacre into an economic practice, aseptically mechanical, in which the growth of profits corresponds to the increase of our ruthlessness. Playing we felt at peace with ourselves and we understood the greatness of a system that sends some to pulp, for the serenity and satiety of others. We imagined the ladies entering our shop to buy a meat pie, politely wiping their mouths after eating it, burping silently after having digested it not knowing they had just ingested their neighbor, the one who politely greeted all the mornings and of which they knew nothing. Percival is great with scissors We dreamed of a caravan of budding influencers entering the shop ready to photograph the fruit of so much effort and make it go viral, then we remembered that the era represented in the game had no social networks and we were saddened. Be that as it may, we felt like true entrepreneurs, those who sacrifice everything for the well-being of their company, even their private life, and we began to reflect on reality, asking ourselves where in the food chain we are and if, in the end , we are on the side of those who grind, or on that of those who are minced. The fact that we kept turning the crank on the mincer without giving it much attention was a pleasantly revelatory response.", "date": "2022-04-29", "grade": "8.5"}
