{"name": "Sword Art Online VS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sword-art-online-vs-recensione.html", "text": "For the tenth anniversary of the series, Bandai Namco has seen fit to launch a new mobile game dedicated to Sword Art Online, but obviously declined according to the gacha RPG structure. The publisher's scheme is now quite clear and as we see in this review of Sword Art Online VS, it is reiterated in this case too: it is a matter of taking the most appealing names in its catalog, putting together a story that can justify a strange mix of characters taken from different chapters and situations, and apply the same structure of paid quests and summons (in virtual and non-virtual currency) to them. Again, the story starts from a simple premise and opens up to further digressions, having to make room for banners and special events, but the particular meta-game setting makes such an interpretation easier than in other cases. of Sword Art Online Variant Showdown (officially abbreviated to ~VS~) tells of the introduction of a new game within the virtual world told in the anime, which however has threatening and unknown elements. The launch of Cross Edge, this is the name of the new software on everyone's lips, immediately attracted a large number of users within the new parallel dimension, with the attraction offered by new challenges and new settings to explore, but something seems go wrong: players fall prey to attacks by mysterious creatures and, as a result, lose parts of their memory in the real world. Once again, it's up to Kirito and Asuna to go and investigate, in a journey that turns out to be a succession of clashes with increasingly powerful enemies. Fortunately, there are also many companions to support the protagonists, who will offer to accompany them on their journey and take part in battles, provided of course you intend to open your wallet for summons. Action RPG gameplay Sword Art Online VS: Kirito in action As we have said several times, games of this type are essentially based on two pillars: the combat system and the game world, with the latter aspect often referring to already known franchises, as happens in licensed games. Bandai Namco's gacha RPGs usually work as a complement to famous series that develop more deeply on other platforms, leaving to these mobile operations the task of offering a sort of fanservice based on collecting the most loved characters, precisely as happens in Sword Art Online VS. The structure of the game sees us face quests made up of single arenas full of enemies, to be defeated by respecting some objectives set at the beginning of the mission in order to obtain the highest possible ranking and richer rewards, to be invested in the evolution of the characters. combat system is at the center of the gameplay and is essentially action, with the 3D representation to increase this sensation but with the classic cooldown applied to special moves, which balances the button mashing with a minimum (but really a minimum) of strategy. On the battlefield we have free control of the main character, with the possibility of changing at any time between one and the other of the three components of the party and in this way exploiting the different skills alternately and in some cases combined, as in special attacks. Sword Art Online VS, the boss fight The clash is quite fun and is probably the best element of the whole production, even if the repetitiveness is maximum for the standard phases of the quests. Where Sword Art Online VS demonstrates a bit of panache it is, however, during the fights with the bosses, which in some cases can be quite demanding and require a minimum of choice in positioning and attack timing. Talking about a challenge is perhaps excessive, but if nothing else, in these cases, a little emotion emerges during the fight, which also offers rather spectacular moments. Characters and progression Sword Art Online VS, the possible results from a summon (or ~Scout~) x10 The main problem remains the progression system, as is often the case with this genre of games, since they are essentially based on a somewhat perverse mechanism. Here too it is a matter of increasing the power of the party as much as possible by finding the rarest and most powerful characters and applying to them the ~cards~ that increase stats and passive skills. Everything is concentrated on the gacha system, here called ~scout~, which has an extremely low drop rate and forces you to focus exclusively on 10-pull packages which are the only ones able to guarantee a minimum chance of successI know, but which of course are also the most expensive. Soon, between running out of energy to take part in quests and increasing the level of enemies, one inevitably runs into a sort of paywall that forces us to resort to microtransactions. It is a normal thing for this genre of games, but to aggravate the matter there is also a system of evolution of the characters through the cards which is rather boring, going to modify only some passive characteristics through various buffs, frustrating a bit the surprise and the exaltation of the progression. The graphics of the game are at excellent levels, with a high-profile 3D representation for a title of the genre, especially as regards the main characters and animations. On the one hand, this supports the gacha system in the best possible way, making the fighters particularly sought-after rewards, but it also benefits the clashes, which can be quite spectacular also thanks to the special moves with group choreography. The flip side of the coin is the enormous weight of the game in terms of resources required from the system: on older devices, performance drops dramatically and, in general, smartphones tend to heat up a lot and consume the battery consistently.", "date": "2022-12-02", "grade": "5.5"}
