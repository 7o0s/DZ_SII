Although he has always tried to recycle himself into titles that go beyond simple remakes of the original format, and while not forgetting the beautiful Championship Editions for XBLA, the yellow ball created by Tohru Iwatani has never gone too far, on the contrary: and how if that weren't enough, that waka-waka which until some time ago immediately brought to mind the typical sound effect of the original coin-op, is now only compared to Shakira's song of the same name. But Pac-Man is one who doesn't give up, and instead of drowning his sorrows in alcohol, here he is back with a party game obviously reserved for the Nintendo home console. My kingdom for a cookie By carefully placing originality in the drawer, Pac-Man Party does not differ from other interpreters of the genre, offering the possibility for users to play the 45 different minigames individually or to try their hand at a main mode that recalls the mechanics proposed by the (very forgettable) Pac -Man Fever dated 2002. Here, a maximum of four players compete in a sort of board game in which the objective is to accumulate the greatest number of biscuits, subtracting them from the opponents or building castles in the free spaces of the board. If we can safely postpone the absolute lack of coherence between the various elements just described, it is certainly unforgivable that an unnecessarily complicated play structure like that of the Namco title is not adequately explained by the tutorials that accompany the first games. Putting yourself in the shoes of the product's target audience, i.e. strictly casual users, it becomes difficult to understand what the rules of the game are, and you are forced to proceed by trial and error until the general picture becomes a little clearer. In short, not exactly the best start for a title that should make immediacy one of its greatest strengths. In any case, Pac-Man Party is somewhat reminiscent of Monopoly, given that if a pawn lands on an opponent's castle, it is forced to face the owner in single combat in a randomly chosen minigame: the winner gets control of the box and a quantity of biscuits subtracted from the loser's count. It goes without saying that for the first few rounds of the board the game is boring, given that the clashes between two users are statistically improbable and one is reduced to observing one's alter-egos building castles here and there, with the only active entertainment consisting of the roll of the dice, here replaced by some simple games of skill. Things obviously improve as the boxes on the board fill up, but Pac-Man Party still suffers from some too much downtime and in general from a basic structure that would have benefited from greater dynamism and simplicity. Better badly accompanied than alone It goes without saying that Pac-Man Party is a title to be played strictly in company, and which offers literally nothing to anyone who has the unfortunate idea of wanting to consume it in solitude. Evidently aware of this fact, the Namco Bandai developers have not blocked any content, making every single element of the product available from the start. The best things can be seen on the front of individual minigames, which manage to prove themselves amusing and in some ways even original: this is the case of a scenario -for example- in which users are asked to throw skewers at various rows of moving chunks of meat, trying to stuff as much of it in one go. However, there are several occasions in which you can have fun, with sections ranging from platformers to shooters and which generally make good use of the Wii controller, even if they obviously tend to get bored soon enough. However, most of the mini-games present follow scripts already seen in a thousand other party games, so the risk for those who are already familiar with the genre is to perceive a very strong feeling of deja-vu. In the clumsy attempt to level the competition between users, however, the developers have inserted special cookies which, if used, guarantee disproportionate advantages for the duration of a single round, effectively eliminating the fun factor for the other participants in the game. In terms of the playful offer, the picture is completed by the inclusion in the package of the original versions of Pac-Man, Galaga and Dig Dug: a gem for nostalgics which, to tell the truth, goes badly withot the catchment area for which the product is intended. Moving to a more technical area, historically the Achilles heel of every party game, Pac-Man Party does not escape the rule, showing off a cartoony graphic of absolutely average quality and a sugary musical accompaniment that leaves a lot to be desired.", "date": "2010-11-24", "grade": "6.0"}
