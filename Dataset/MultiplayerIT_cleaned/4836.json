{"name": "Laguna blu", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/183760-trackmania-2-lagoon-laguna-blu.html", "text": "Almost six years after the debut of Trackmania 2, Nadeo wanted to show that the project is still alive and well by publishing a fourth scenario, Lagoon, set within a huge tropical island. In many ways it is a recognition of the many users who in this period of time have perpetually populated the servers of the ManiaPlanet platform, often and willingly proposing their own vision of the historic arcade racer thanks to an increasingly refined editor, simple to use but characterized by instruments of great power and precision. All elements that come back with arrogance in the new package, using the inevitable ~easy to learn, hard to master~ approach as a glue that will see us try and try the tracks again in search of the best time, first by comparing ourselves with the records set by the traditional three medals (bronze, silver, gold), then with the ghosts of the best players in the world. A mania, it should be said, which is now feeling the weight of the years but hasn't lost its edge yet. Once again! The single player campaign of Trackmania 2: Lagoon is made up of a total of sixty-five tracks, divided into five different and increasingly complex categories: white, green, blue, red and black. The more you advance, the more it becomes necessary to make achievements, in the sense that the last tracks require a certain amount of gold medals to become accessible. Reaching that point, in any case, is quite easy and immediate: the very connotation of the game leads to launching at full speed on the tracks and instantly retrying the stint in case of error, thanks to a couple of buttons specially assigned to reset the entire race or partial; this whether you play using the arrow keys on the keyboard, or you opt for a controller, the latter choice only advisable after adjusting the sensitivity of the levers, given that the steering tends to be excessively sensitive with the default settings . In any case, once the setup has been developed, everything boils down to a question of memory, reactivity and perseverance: conquering a bronze or silver medal on the first attempt is not impossible at all, indeed it will happen several times; but to grab the gold you will necessarily have to familiarize yourself with the track, choose the best trajectories, manage the jumps so that the landing does not slow you down and obviously avoid falling into the void. The characterization of the tracks doesn't find much comfort in the new setting, which in the end is limited to being the background to the typical Trackmania action, but there are some elements that make us turn up our noses a bit: on the one hand, the improbable ~bounce~ that our car performs when it touches the water, almost like a pebble, and which is placed as an integral part of certain circuits based on aerial manoeuvres; on the other, the presence of unpaved areas with small but very annoying obstacles on which we often get stuck, sections where our car, accustomed to the precision of the asphalt, will unjustly make us suffer. For the rest, there is no shortage of loops with magnetic or non-magnetic sections (and automatic transition to the first person view), the ~stairways~, the long thrilling coils suspended in the air, the ~obstacle courses~ and a huge abundance of ramps from which to literally take flight. It's better in company If the gameplay and philosophy of Trackmania 2: Lagoon appear unchanged, the package tries to innovate in terms of multiplayer modes by adding a new option: Chase. It is a team mode in which players must synchronize their maneuvers, since the last pilot to cross the first checkpoint must be the first to pass the next one and the others will therefore have to wait for him. A feature that adds to the already present and tested Round, Team, Cup, Laps and Time Attack, although only the latter presented lobbies populated during our tests, perhaps a sign of a certain shyness towards the novelty or of the unwillingness to give up to well-established practices. We will see if in the coming weeks it will be possible to observe a change in trend from this point of view, but as an initial impact seeing the new mode completely snubbed was not pleasant, on the contrary. Only positive and well received features, however, as regards the powerful integrated editor, which allows you to create any type of track from scratch using a simplified or advanced set of tools. As per tradition we will be able to try our creations at any time, so as to regulate distances, jumps and so on according to the experience we have in mind to create, forr then propose our tracks in the context of online multiplayer, challenging other users to keep up with us or perhaps to do better than us. Once again a very fast experience, at times spectacular, strong in graphics that are not particularly advanced in terms of effects, indeed in many ways a bit dated, but nevertheless able to perform their task well and to be easily scalable to depending on the configuration in your possession, guaranteeing the stable sixty frames per second. Too bad for the interface which even today, years after the game's debut, is sometimes confusing and poorly organized.", "date": "2017-05-31", "grade": "7.8"}
