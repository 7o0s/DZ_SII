Directly derived from the unforgettable Baldur's Gate, you will hardly find adventures like this around on the various physical and digital shelves, at least until the arrival of the third chapter of the aforementioned series. Just who is taking care of the new Baldur's Gate, Larian Studios, also represents the only other bulwark left in terms of development studios capable of giving stories and worlds of this magnitude and the recent Divinity: Original Sin were direct proof of this . Remaining on Pillars of Eternity, a project funded through Kickstarter several years ago now, Obsidian has returned to creating what it cares about most and that is closest to its heart. While we await the arrival of the second chapter on current generation consoles, Nintendo Switch now welcomes the complete edition of the first chapter. Let's see in our review how the Nintendo hybrid fares. Pillars upon pillars We won't even try to summarize the plot of a game like Pillars of Eternity. It would be like asking a dungeon master to briefly tell us about the Dungeons and Dragons campaign written for him and his friends. What is enough to know is that, after a very careful editor, we will wake up as an integral part of a caravan stationed for the night. Following the search for water and a member of the missing group, we will notice the ambush against our companions and from here a series of events will set in motion which will lead to the discovery of a cult and the consequent powers deriving from the having attended one of their rites. Stop. Let's not go on because it would be useless to discuss the dozens and dozens of hours of main and secondary quests that open after this brief introduction. Anyone accustomed to the genre, paper or video game, is well aware of the slowness and depth with which a title of this type deals with every single detail of the narrative. Pillars of Eternity does it as it hasn't been seen for decades and does it with a mastery that only the great are capable of demonstrating; the same parts told through splendid pages of an illustrated book, would be enough by themselves to deserve the attention of any self-respecting gamer. Although in recent years the presence of a character like Chris Avellone in the screenplay has become almost an Internet meme, his hand is also present in this case and we don't struggle to believe that it is one of the few projects on which he worked with great fervor . Not based on pre-existing rules and considering the originality of the world, of its races and cultures and of each setting, Pillars of Eternity contains within it a real original and layered underworld, which we are convinced you will be able to appreciate. A CRPG with the pad It is not the first time that a title like this has been adapted to a pad control scheme. Recently the most unthinkable of games have received adaptations that are considered small masterpieces. The same Diablo of Blizzard and Divinity: Original Sin of Larian, represent two clear examples of how it is possible to manage a game designed for mouse and keyboard, even with a pad. In the case of Nintendo Switch, the use of this input device is mandatory and we cannot fail to praise the characteristics already seen a couple of years ago on the other consoles, as well as declaring the critical issues that it is just not possible to digest. The whole phase of resource recovery and exploration management work so well as to be almost preferable to the double use of mouse and keyboard. Clearly different as regards the choices in the combat phase and the management of the menu and the inventory: an attempt was made to solve the problem by adapting all the controls within two radial menus that can be recalled with the ~triggers~ of Nintendo Switch. On the one hand, all the choices concerning the inventory, navigation of the map and the complete management of the actions and characteristics of our character. On the other hand, a wheel useful for equipping and using skills. For those not accustomed to Pillars of Eternity and more generally to this type of adventure, the game uses a combination of real time and tactical pause in combat. In practice Pillars of Eternity can be considered a real-time RPG, but the very existence of the break derives from the need, based on the situation, to study a strategy to get out of the unedifying moments. At first this may seem almost superfluous, between underpowered enemies and a still small party; but when it comes to high level quests and having six componentsi in the group, paying attention to every single move will be essential to survive. On the one hand, the different levels of difficulty help this, ranging from the one suitable for those who just want to enjoy the splendid narration of the game, to those who even want to play with permanent death; on the other, the management of classes and level advancement. Before starting your adventure you can in fact choose your gender, your race among eleven different ones and a series of details such as your background (a fundamental element for building a character sheet in a paper role-playing game). These elements will lead to building the personality and characteristics of one's alter ego, as well as the management of growth points, upon passing the level, will allow you to decide in which direction to evolve our hero. Forget the possibility of accumulating any existing skills and characteristics, here we are in the realm of Western RPGs, where you can't have everything and you can't become everyone. For this reason, we advise you to first familiarize yourself with how these elements work, so as to avoid finding yourself displaced in which case you have never played a game of this type. All this goodness is combined with a crazy amount of content, which in the complete edition is also enriched by the two expansions The White March I and II released later. A package therefore unmissable for those who live on bread and rpg. A strange port Let's come to the question that is causing us the most problems on the judgment of the game. The premise is that, in the hours during which we were able to test this port, no particular problems arose. On the contrary, after a series of truly dancer adaptations seen in recent months, Pillars of Eternity is really nice to see on Switch, with its well-finished graphics but still free from the obligation of heavy textures and strange technical frills. Both in portable mode and on the dock, the game even almost completely eliminates aliasing, the real drama of Nintendo's hybrid. A few frame drops here and there and a strange black screen during the run have proved to be the only real flaws found so far. This does not mean that we also spoke with several other colleagues, who on the contrary found a series of bugs and glitches in this version for Nintendo Switch which in the end led them to abandon the boat. Between continuous crashes, texts in an incomprehensible language and impossible-to-complete quests, it would seem that the title may suffer from some save corruption problems, which can obviously be overcome with patches. After careful analyzes and having made an estimate of the incidence percentages of the problem, we decided that it was right to remove something from the final grade, but not to bury a game of such high value, which among other things worked well for us. We hope the same applies to each of you. To close the examination of the port, a word of denial for the total lack of touch screen support. The possibility of touching or dragging something in Pillars, as well as choosing targets and skills, would have been a great incentive for a version that in any case stands at very high levels of which we should all be extremely satisfied in any case.", "date": "2019-08-13", "grade": "8.5"}
