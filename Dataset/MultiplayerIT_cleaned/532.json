We understand right away that the differences with the first chapter of the saga are substantial. What struck us in the first Spellforce is totally absent in this case. In fact, the creation of the character leaves no room for the customization of the characteristics or for the formation of a real class background, leaving us only the possibility of creating the character from an aesthetic point of view, leaving out many frills and limiting ourselves to providing a series of interchangeable faces, the choice of gender and name. Having said that, we choose a profile as aggressive as possible, we assign a name to the character, male, inspired by the first song that comes to mind looking at this grim face. It will be Till Lindemann, well done. The game is not to be desired and starts immediately with a fascinating introduction that brings us back with mind and heart to the atmospheres already known in Spellforce. We witness the fall of the Dark Elf civilization and the expulsion of Nightsong, an old acquaintance, from the homeland. Before succumbing under the blows of the army unleashed by the Shadow, The Shadow, we see Craig Un'Shallach, father of the elf, deliver the order to give the alarm to all populations threatened by this new calamity. the game does not let itself be desired and starts immediately with a fascinating introduction that takes us back with the mind and heart to the atmospheres already known in Spellforce In the wake of this apocalyptic vision we leave poor Craig, now doomed, in the hands of the Shadow hordes. The game kicks off immediately by introducing us to the character created just now grappling with the growing threat of the forces of evil intent on destroying his beloved people. We discover that we are part of the Shaikan tribe, the godless, guardians of the secrets of ancient traditions and of the atavistic pact made with the dragons themselves. In the early stages of the game we see the nucleus of what will be the center of our command group form. By making the acquaintance of a desperate Nightsong, the initial party is formed, completing the set-up with the powerful and faithful Bor and his sorceress sister Lya. Ready for adventure, we take on the enormous responsibility of blocking the advance of darkness on our territories and of avenging the death of Craig Un'Shallach, the last great hero of his people. RTS & RPG all in one At first sight we could consider the differences between this new title and its predecessor irrelevant, already enhanced by the presence of two expansions, which preceded the release of this new chapter. The visual impact, full of sparkling colors, the change of light due to the passage of time, the gameplay and the interface bring to mind the first Spellforce. Yet it only takes a few minutes to realize that the subtle differences open a gap with the past, immediately placing the level of our attention at a higher stage. Spellforce 2 is a game that claims to unite two philosophies united by a close family bond, but very distinct. the project seems to have finally taken the right track, finally focusing on one of the fundamental imperatives of those who make entertainment a rule of life: to produce something that is both innovative and entirely enjoyable by the public RTS & RPG all in one In fact, party oriented RPG and RTS touch each other until they merge into a risky and at the same time compelling union. Attempt not at all easy, not fully focused, for example, from the first chapter and related expansions. Usually the rule that applies is that of ~doing something well~, and we are already lamenting the long-standing absence of valid supporters of both categories. Yet the project seems to have finally taken the right track and to have reached a more than decent compromise, finally focusing on one of the fundamental imperatives of those who make entertainment a rule of life: to produce something that is both innovative and fully enjoyable by the public . It is therefore useless to get lost in frills and useless insights; in this the first Spellforce had not shown that he could get away with exaggerating some secondary aspects of the game and not giving due weight to others that were even more important. Let's take camera management for example. You say, a trivial thing, and instead for a game like this, camera management is everything. SF1 made available to the player a management that was spectacular, but not very useful, if not a hindrance, when the game got into the heart of the action; in fact, the zoom led us to switch from a close-up with high detail quality to a third-person view focused on the main hero if he was in theviewing area, often making you lose orientation in the most agitated phases. Result: a wonderful interpretation of the inner meaning of RPG with your hero in the foreground of the battle and the total rout of the rest of the party for the fatal lack of control over the other members of the group. The solution this time is given by the classic egg of Columbus, with a detailed zoom that avoids this ~waste~ limiting itself to an impersonal but very effective interpretation. New dress However, the new styling is not limited to the graphics sector, but also to deeper aspects related to the very nature of the gameplay. And also in this case the leaps and bounds have been made not only with respect to the previous chapter, but also with respect to the beta version. First we notice an improved management of the party in every aspect. The navigability of the inventory, spell management and character advancement screens has definitely increased and is now more readable. This is linked to the new concept linked to the evolution of the characters. As already highlighted, unlike SF1, the player does not have to choose the orientation of his hero's skills a priori, but can evaluate a more gradual hybrid growth, balancing the growth under two parallel aspects, those related to magical abilities and those related to the fight. depending on the strategic choices or the type of preferred game, it will be possible to build an ad hoc character without necessarily having to preclude one aspect in favor of another New dress Depending on the strategic choices or the preferred type of game, it will be possible to build an ad hoc character without necessarily having to preclude one aspect in favor of another. The huge range of objects available adds an element in favor of this aspect, as we will be able to choose to specialize a character in a certain discipline. Furthermore, each object confers certain characteristics capable of conferring bonuses on each type of attack or magical ability. Another renewed aspect is that of spells and special attacks, reachable from the character selection interface and ~expendable~ from time to time during fights. Each special action has a certain mana cost and a cooldown that prevents the ability from being used continuously. The improvements have also affected the strategic sphere, radically changing the management of the units in the field. Taking advantage of a more versatile AI, the characters involved in a fight automatically arrange themselves according to their skills. Those who can count above all on ranged weapons and magic will prefer a backward position compared to those who can count on a type of attack based on the violent impact of melee weapons; the same thing applies to those characters who may have magical skills related to the healing of wounds and the management of the protections of their companions. The fact that the arrangement takes place in a completely automated way saves the useless task of managing it manually and wasting precious and often fatal seconds in organizing the ranks, of the ~everyone in his place~ series. However, this does not exclude the important aspect of combat control which, if left to fend for itself, may not always resolve itself in the hoped-for manner; the strategic action of the player within the battle takes place with regard to small measures, such as moving an important unit in difficulty from the fray to the rear, or exploiting the handful of seconds that the battle takes to end to cast ad hoc spells or take advantage of certain special skills, a choice that can often make a real difference. RPG the column, RTS the structure As we know, Spellforce can count on the peculiarity of merging the role-playing game, represented by the presence of the characters and heroes, with the strategic game, of greater breadth and openly fielded aspiration. To make this possible, the game combines two completely heterogeneous ingredients under the same graphic guise. The role-playing game stops where the characters arrive, with inventory management and level advancement, to give way to the more classic RTS approach, with the collection of resources and the management of units, troop, for quantity and not for quality. among the available units it is worth mentioning the presence of the imposing Titans, real mastodons that make up the point of breakthrough in melee being able to count on an exaggerated power compared to the common units RPG the column, RTS the structure The workers, classic pocket-sized insiders, collect rresources and build (or repair) buildings; the buildings increase the skills of the characters and generic units and allow you to recruit ever more powerful troops to join your party to face battles more impressive than the simple skirmishes that only the party of heroes can withstand. The game situations, excellently balanced (much better than in the first chapter) ensure that the union on the field between heroes and troops is such as to make each component indispensable for the survival of the other. Among the units available, it is worth noting the presence of the imposing Titans, real mastodons that make up the tip of the breakthrough in melee, being able to count on an exaggerated power compared to the common units. Finally the eye of the technician Technically Spellforce 2 does not mark a real turning point, but confirms an excellent trend that began with its predecessor by smoothing out the edges and refining certain aspects. We have already had the opportunity to talk about the graphics engine and the renewed management of the camera, but it seems appropriate to spend a few words also for the general realization of the models of the characters, buildings and structures and above all for the creation of maps so rich in details and complex to be even difficult to navigate on certain occasions. The light effects, the play of transparency provided by the water and a color palette full of full and ~comic~ tones finally give a touch of magic to the atmosphere full of pathos that permeates all phases of the game. Tested on a machine equipped with an Athlon 64 3500+ processor, 2 GB Ram and GeForce 6600 GT video card, the game did not show any significant slowdown, bringing the level of graphic detail to the maximum scale. However, we believe that the game can run on more modestly configured machines without presenting any particular problems. Final comment We can end on a high note by re-evaluating a title capable, for once, of surprising us positively without having to wait so long, and you know, these are the most pleasant surprises. Spellforce 2 brings order to the hodgepodge of good ideas thrown into the cauldron from the first chapter, giving a complete meaning to the game in its entirety, without imbalances, with the sole aim of entertaining without sophistication of any kind. Finally the union between RTS and RPG that we were waiting for, without astronomical pretensions and all the trappings of the case. Very welcome, Spellforce 2! Pros Lively and effective graphic section Management of character growth greatly improved Improved camera management Good management of unit deployment by the AI Cons Very complex maps Thickness of dialogues not always up to the plot Unique inventory for all characters, unlimited capacity, unrealistic We had left Spellforce 2 in an embryonic, incomplete state, which lent itself badly to an analysis that went beyond the simple acknowledgment of some slight changes compared to the original title and which certainly could not honor the efforts made to bring a excellent idea in terms of gameplay and concept to the glories of a mature and stable title. Once the game has been launched, we immediately notice the differences with the copy sent to the editorial staff for hands-on. Complete from every point of view, Spellforce 2 offers different game modes, depending on the type of experience you are looking for: you can start a game as a simple skirmish, in multiplayer or in the single player campaign. We decide to take this route to see how solid the title can be in every aspect, including that of the plot and content.", "date": "2006-04-20", "grade": null}
