Why is it important to remember this? Because it is the main reason why this analysis will not have the classic evaluation, neither in tenths, nor in the recommended or not recommended format that we use for most additional content. We will therefore limit ourselves to telling you about our experience on the Isle of Armor, highlighting its positive and negative elements while waiting to give a complete evaluation of the package after the release date of the Snowy Lands of the Crown, scheduled for autumn. our journey to the new setting. The Dojo Master: the endgame that was missing? Just as we saw during the presentation we told you about a few days ago in the preview of the DLC, the first few minutes on the Isle of Armor allow us to immediately get to know the new characters who will accompany us during the short campaign in the new setting . After the update of the Pokdex for the capture of the approximately one hundred new ~old~ species of the island, the story introduces us to Sofora in Spada, expert trainer in the poison type, or Savory in Scudo, specialized in the psycho type: they will be the new rivals of the protagonist, even if at this point of the adventures few coaches will really find themselves in a crisis to challenge them. In fact, a progressive difficulty is confirmed in line with that seen in the Wild Lands of the base game and which reaches its limit by calibrating itself on the average situation at the end of the main campaign: the opposing Pokmon thus settle around level 60, with maximum peaks up to 75 and, in a single, bizarre case, 80. To give an idea of the general level, a 100 Zacian, which practically everyone uses to farm raids in single, manages to overcome any opponent without worries. Apart from this important general balance problem, which can only be circumvented by self-imposed limitations (such as, for example, the choice to keep only Pokmon native to the island in the party and to avoid the use of experience candies), training within the Dojo Master highlights several positive points. First of all the characterization of the characters, amusing and well diversified, even if not very numerous, nor unforgettable; then the structure of the missions, with tests that are not very articulated but which lead to often surprising and absolutely new assignments for the series. Without anticipating anything so as not to spoil the surprise, one gets the impression of having to do with an expanded version of what was seen in the challenges to the various Galar gyms, but with a progression of the tests that has the flavor of those seen in the anime . A situation that increases the regret for the inadequacy of the challenge level and which collides with another intrinsic defect of this eighth Pokmon generation: the level design. Wildlands of Desolation On the other hand, what the fans asked for from this DLC has not been granted: that great Savage Land which is the Isle of Armor does not make any leap in quality to the open world of Sword and Shield, highlighting even more, if possible, how the new graphic design struggles to adequately support the expectations towards the first real traditional chapters on Switch. The scenarios are largely empty, and the more the size of an area increases, the more the desolation and repetitiveness of certain environments stands out. It is true, the sense of direction is often lost, but not due to an actual complexity of the scenario, but due to the absence of truly distinctive identification marks: in short, one feels the lack of a real map that indicates the player's position, even just to understand in which direction it is going. Not that miracles were expected over the low-res textures seen in the base games, but exploration remains unsatisfactory in the larger, more open sections of the island. It is no coincidence then that the most successful areas are the woods and the narrowest areas, where the increase of the elements is however inversely proportional to the freedom of movement. Some caves take steps forward, with alternative routes and a multi-level layout, but it's nothing transcendental or that requires in some way to sharpen your wits to proceed in the dungeon. Thus continues the evident contrast between the internal environments such as the dojo, full of very accurate details and particulars that over time can even increase thanks to the support of the player, and the external areas, characterized by few totrees all the same and the continuous popup of wild Pokmon while traveling. But let's get to those who are the real protagonists of the game: Pokmon in fact. After the not always shareable criticisms for the now infamous ~Masudian genocide~, Game Freak has decided to run for cover by adding support to a hundred creatures from past generations absent from the Galar Pokdex: the Isle of Armor has in fact the its specific Pokdex and allows you to meet and capture little monsters not present in Galar; players who do not own the DLC, however, can still trade or import them from previous chapters through Pokmon Home. We are talking about much loved creatures such as Scyther, Abra, Fletchling and Dedenne, but also many others who will be able to bring a breath of fresh air to the eighth generation competitive scene . The new features And it is precisely the competitive who could benefit most from the release of the DLC. Since its presentation, the Isle of Armor has in fact appeared as a content more aimed at improving the PvP experience, as opposed to a Corona Land which should (the conditional is a must) emphasize that element of exploration and discovery that has so far been somewhat lacking. In this regard, one cannot fail to start by immediately quoting Urshifu: the evolution of Kubfu, a new legendary that always remains at the center of the DLC story, has two forms, both with a lot of potential for inclusion in different types of teams . If facing the towers did not guarantee the demanding challenge that could be expected, at least it gave the possibility of obtaining this truly unique Pokmon and accessing the return of a function closely linked to the fan service (which we absolutely do not want to reveal to you here). The Soupmax is then another fundamental element introduced with the DLC since, unlike what could have been imagined from the first information, it will allow any Pokmon to obtain the Gigamax form that can have one, regardless of its individual characteristics. Provided you have the right amount of ingredients to prepare it of course. The Cramobot, on the other hand, is more controversial: this strange technological discovery that allows you to recycle unused objects is still being studied among enthusiasts, but the ~recipes~ to obtain the most useful tools appear rather expensive in terms of ingredients. In the coming weeks, however, there will be a way to understand which are the most convenient. Even for the new moves that can be obtained in exchange for Rock Armor it will be necessary to wait a bit before expressing oneself, because until the meta is stabilized it is difficult to understand which ones will have the greatest impact. What is certain is that, on paper, they are certainly interesting. Less advertised, but no less useful, is the addition of the experience charm, to increase the experience points obtained after battles, and the introduction of a new non-player character to the Battle Tower: a distinguished gentleman who, without asking for anything in return, will remove the prohibited moves from the ~memory~ of pokmon from past generations, allowing them to have space in the fights where it's serious. The endgame of the endgame An undoubtedly positive aspect of the Isle of Armor is that the handful of hours necessary to finish the Kubfu-related narrative line does not lead to the complete exhaustion of the DLC contents. In addition to the customizations to the bicycle and the new selection of clothing items obtained in the early stages, we add the aforementioned enhancement of the dojo, the inevitable hunt for the new Dynamax raids on the island, the meeting with new trainers that allow you to obtain variants regions and interaction with visiting old acquaintances. Challenge lovers will be happy to know that some raids, including that of Zeraora active until the end of the month, can be really challenging, while the hitherto mysterious Limited Trial can be a valid diversion to try out new combinations and teams. It is in fact a challenge that puts you almost in the shoes of a gym leader, forcing you to use Pokmon of only one type in 3-on-3 battles: an alternative and fun way to get Fight Points to spend at Goalwick.", "date": "2020-06-19", "grade": null}
