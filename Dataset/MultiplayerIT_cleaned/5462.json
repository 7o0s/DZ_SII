{"name": "Super Robot Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/169535-transformers-earth-wars-super-robot-wars.html", "text": "Over the years we have witnessed various reinterpretations of the Transformers, not least the cinematic one by Michael Bay, but the charm of Generation 1 is unrivaled, especially among those who grew up with the animated series of the 80s. Making video games based on the original design of the various Optimus Prime, Ratchet, Wheeljack, Megatron and Starscream therefore represents a winning bet, even more so when the project starts from a very well-tested concept in the mobile sector, that of Clash of Clans-style strategy games. Transformers: Earth Wars is just that, that is a clone of the Supercell blockbuster, with Autobots and Decepticons instead of warriors, archers and wizards. The structure is practically the same, with a faction to choose at the beginning of the game, a base to build to thwart possible invasions by other users, according to the mechanics of an asynchronous multiplayer mode, and a single player campaign consisting of four different chapters , at the end of which we will be able to obtain as many characters. Few differences also as regards the in-game action: once a mission is selected, we will be asked to place our units in the underlying part of the map, according to the objectives that we believe must be eliminated first, with the ultimate aim of destroying the central device of the base. Everything is regulated by frankly permissive freemium dynamics: the energy of action necessary to grapple with a mission abounds, and in the same way you receive large quantities of Energon, metal and even gold coins by completing the stages, defeating opponents humans and unlocking numerous achievements related to progression. Transformers: Earth Wars is a simple, fun and free strategy game, full of iconic characters Sentient robots Just like in Clash of Clans, the protagonists of Transformers: Earth Wars move automatically once placed on the battlefield, identifying the closest threats and attacking them without the need for our input, except for special abilities. The latter vary according to the class: the armored robots will transform into vehicles to break through the enemy defenses and hit the target, the flying ones will take off to bombard the selected area, while finally the Transformers equipped with long-range weapons will rain down a fire on the lens. The interesting thing is that these special maneuvers are activated using the energy of action and not the hard currency, as happens in other freemium products, and this only confirms the lack of particular limits and impositions, always welcome. Of course, as far as the construction phase of the base is concerned, we will inevitably have to wait for the construction of upgrades and new buildings, with the possibility of speeding up the work by spending a little gold, but even on this front the situation appears legitimate and hardly you will find yourself in the position of not being able to continue and having to wait a few hours to make progress. The downside of such a friendly setting lies in the duration of the campaign, which with a little effort can be completed in a matter of hours, leaving only the asynchronous multiplayer matches (although gradually more interesting thanks to the introduction of clans ) to provide some entertainment, at least until the developers add new missions. The technical realization of Transformers: Earth Wars is excellent in terms of the polygonal modeling of the characters, it is no coincidence that it is also possible to admire them in a sort of ~garage mode~ and observe their transformations from robot to vehicle and vice versa. Once on a mission, however, things become a bit anonymous as far as the scenarios are concerned, while on the audio front there are original sounds and voices to support an adequate soundtrack and in line with the atmospheres of the game.", "date": "2016-06-11", "grade": "7.7"}
