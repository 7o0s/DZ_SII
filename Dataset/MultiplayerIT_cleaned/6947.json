You would probably also have had a healthy laugh, lovingly stroking the cases of Tales published in America and bought on import, crying bitter tears for those that, on the other hand, had never been localized even in English. A lot of water has passed under the bridge, and now Bandai Namco seems to have finally recognized our continent all the attention it has always deserved, and to the Hideo Baba series the popularity that he had always believed limited to the land of the rising sun. Here we are, then, talking about Tales of Xillia 2, sequel to the homonymous Tales of Xillia released last summer. It is not the first time that Baba's team has ventured into a real sequel, breaking the tradition of the main ~unrelated~ Tales: it had originally done so with Tales of Destiny 2 (one of those Tales remained confined to the Japanese, unfortunately) and then he tried again with Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of a New World. The popularity of Tales of Xillia could have pushed the producer down this path, of course, but also of the machine that made it run exclusively, i.e. PlayStation 3. After playing and finishing it, however, let's venture a somewhat ' More Malignant: Tales of Xillia 2 cost the team much less time and resources, allowing Bandai Namco to serve up a ~new~ jRPG to fill the long wait for the next Tales of Zestiria. And unfortunately it shows. It was nice to be back at Rieze Maxia, even if Bandai Namco could have definitely tried harder Deal with it Expressing oneself on the plot of Tales of Xillia 2 without stumbling upon any advances is certainly not easy, but we will do our best. The problem is that this sequel thrives on twists, reversals and shocking revelations that follow one another for about forty-five hours of gameplay: that's how long it took us to complete the sixteen main chapters plus the various extra chapters dedicated to deepening the characters and a nice a few side missions, followed by a satisfactory and complete ~post game~ experience, unlike what happened a year ago with Tales of Xillia which, on that front, left enough to be desired. These few lines should already hearten the fans of the original, but the reality is a little different and reminds us how a good story can't live only on surprises and beautiful characters. Long story short, the story of Tales of Xillia 2 is just a big mess. The first ten hours seem written by a schizophrenic screenwriter, so chaotic and confusing are the events that establish our heroes' mission and what is at stake. Hideo Baba has chosen the path of the silent protagonist (well, almost, since he also speaks from time to time) to put the player in his shoes: his name is Ludger Kresnik, a surname that will not sound new to players of the first Tales of Xillia and which in fact will prove to be hand in glove with the mythology established a year ago. Ludger, having failed the entrance exam for the prestigious company his brother Julius works for, ends up as a cook at Trygliph station, and that's where he meets Elle Marta, a slightly naughty little girl with a very special mission. , entrusted to her by her father: to reach the legendary Land of Canaan, where wishes come true. As it is, as it is not, Ludger, Elle and Jude, the protagonist of the first Tales of Xillia, end up together in trouble that will force them to work for the Spirius Corporation: Ludger, in fact, possesses a very particular power that allows him to cross the boundaries of parallel dimensions. We can't tell you how and why all this happens, but one thing is sure: the team hasn't put much effort into drafting a plot that seems to make coincidences, the ~deus ex machina~ and the most science-fantasy haunts his scapegoats. The characters do... things, say... things, and often without dwelling more than a few moments on what is happening, thus accepting it as it comes in total contrast to that cast we met a year ago and who were desperately looking for a alternative solution to every problem. Let's just say that Ludger will find himself making some morally questionable choices, but their weight will prove to be practically nil on the shoulders of our heroes, which however has created a certain unease considering the situation: Tales of Xillia 2 is, hands down, one of the darkest and most dramatic episodes of the historic franchise, despite the verve of the nice playable and non-playable supporting actors, to which are added two old acquaintances - Gaius and Muzt - with explosive results in the case of dialogues and the inevitable optional skits. In all of thatthis chaos, between characters that seem to come out of an episode of Kamen Raider, superpowers sprouting from all sides and practically incomprehensible lucubrations on the technology, philosophy and politics of the world of Rieze Maxia, stands out what seemed to us to be the true protagonist of the game: no, it's not the divine Milla with her melons, but Elle herself, the delightful little girl who conveys the only topic that Tales of Xillia 2 manages to deal with excellently and with great emotional impact, and that is the acceptance of death both ours and that of our loved ones. It is a theme that the game tackles thoroughly and with great sensitivity, even in its frankness, and it is a real pity that it risks drowning several times in a sea of absurdity and narrative forcing. The suspension of disbelief is fine, but here it has been exaggerated: no Tales, a series known for its cartoonish imprint, has ever made us roll our eyes so much. Playstation 3 trophies Tales of Xillia 2 offers 49 trophies, including the platinum one: 38 bronze, 7 silver and 3 gold. Needless to say, paying off the debt is a way to unlock some of the most important trophies, but also to see the different endings, defeat the strongest enemies, win in the arena, find the hundred cats... well, there's a lot to Do! The Kresniks always pay their debts One of the most controversial aspects of Tales of Xillia 2 is certainly the debt system, a real ~gating~ designed to slow down the player's progression in the story and make the most of the areas and maps that are gradually unlocked while explore the world and continue with the storyline. In fact, in the very first minutes of the game, poor Ludger contracts a debt of twenty million galds: an astronomical figure that we will have to pay ~step~ by contacting our friend Nova using the L2 key. You can pay all or part of it at any time, but once you reach the next threshold Nova will start bombarding us with calls, and we can only delay paying up to a certain point. After that, we will be forced to weld. The game takes into account our wallet, but it is indifferent to what remains in our pocket after paying: it is up to the player, therefore, to balance the debt payments and the purchases of weapons and objects in order not to remain broke and without jelly beans. apple or new weapons. It's not as bad as it sounds, mind you: at the same time as the debt, we are also introduced to a new system of missions that can be accepted at any time from a dedicated NPC located in each city. It goes from the methodical elimination of a certain number of enemies in certain areas to the recovery of materials, to which are also added the bounties on special and fun mini-bosses that roam the world. By completing these assignments, you accumulate a generous amount of money and improve your prestige, thus unlocking even more lucrative assignments. If it is true that it is not necessary to trouble too much with money, in short, it is equally true that these assignments soon turn out to be anything but optional: most of the chapters of the story, in fact, can only be unlocked after paying a certain threshold of the debt. This means that between one chapter and another we will actually be forced to spend a few hours hunting monsters and materials in maps that we already know inside out, both because we explored them in the first Tales of Xillia and because we did it again - even several times. .. - in this sequel. Fortunately, this strong sense of repetitiveness is mitigated by the usual, excellent combat system and by the search for kittens, a sidequest that puts us on the hunt for a hundred cats scattered here and there throughout Rieze Maxia. From a special screen it is then possible to send them in search of materials, some of which are exclusive and necessary for the completion of the missions that would otherwise force us to wander around the map interacting with each sparkling object, chest or saddlebag. Don't despair, however, because paying off the debt, in addition to rewarding the player with skills and items in profusion, towards the end of the game will no longer be mandatory: we have completed Tales of Xillia 2 with approximately fifteen million still to be paid, but we also have found that later thresholds reward only with accessories and costumes that do not affect the gameplay in the slightest. Those who decide to be honest to the end, even after finishing the game, will be able to enjoy a cartoon skit that is as hilarious as it is perfectly useless. The recycling cycle The outstanding combat system of Tales of Xillia returns with great fanfare in this sequel, losing something and gaining much more. Anyone who played the prequel won't need to readmost of the tutorials, but will need to get used to Ludger's ability to switch weapons on the fly, switching between his dual blades and a pair of pistols, and finally a massive warhammer. Each of them has its own arts (for a total of about sixty arts to be assigned to the joypad combinations) and allows you to approach the fight in a different way: the double blades allow you to attack quickly in melee; guns, needless to say, allow you to strike from afar; finally, the hammer is slow but easily breaks through the defense of the enemies. In addition, practically every enemy is more or less vulnerable or resistant to Ludger's weapons and/or to the natural elements that distinguish the arts and spells, consequently it is necessary to study the target before choosing which weapon or art to hit him with. This solution therefore requires a minimum of strategy but also a good knowledge of the party members, which it is no longer possible to change on the fly and which, on the contrary, are often decided by the game according to the main or secondary chapter of the plot. There's almost always room for a healer, but luckily each character has a variety of arts and passive abilities to unlock and set up through the all-new ~allium sphere~ that replaces the illium (fantasy!) from previous Tales of Xillia . The new system is decidedly less imaginative, but it works in its own way: it is possible to equip each character with a kind of rune that will earn him more or less points against a certain element, allowing him to learn the related arts and skills. These points are earned by fighting, of course, but it is also possible to ~collect~ them around the world as objects or accumulate them by completing optional tasks. It's actually simpler (and simplistic) than the illium sphere, and veterans will immediately recognize most of the unlockable arts and skills, plus some brand new ones. For the rest, it's just Tales of Xillia: you can bind to one character at a time to carry out combined attacks and enjoy particular strategic bonuses while facing enemies in real time, almost like an action game. Unfortunately, however, the news ends here. Starting with the models of the characters (who initially only dress differently) and enemies, passing through their animations or scenarios, dungeons, cities... everything has been completely recycled from Tales of Xillia and over the course of forty hours or so we happened to explore maybe three or four new areas, and that's it. A somewhat depressing solution, which makes Tales of Xillia 2 feel more like an expansion than a brand new title, especially when most of the scenarios have to be replayed in the context of the optional story chapters. Teleporting and sprinting, which you learn relatively early in the game, only helps to a certain extent since many areas exist to be visited only once, perhaps in search of cats or loot, and then ignored forever. At one point in the game we will board a ship absolutely identical to the E.S.S. Zenethra explored a year ago, and a character will justify the similarity of the two dungeons by claiming that ~they are the same because their purpose is the same~.
