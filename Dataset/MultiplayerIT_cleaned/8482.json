The quantity of gadgets with which to interact in the narrow cabin of our VT is in fact disproportionate, and on balance it was possible to do without a little stuff (or to arrange it differently, or to assign its activation to the many unused physical keys) to meet the well-established limits of the Microsoft peripheral, which also gave proof of precision and versatility but in decidedly more casual areas, where a wrong detection did not imply game over. Because that's all the point: in Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor we often find ourselves in the middle of really complicated situations, with hordes of enemies opening fire on our bipedal vehicle and armor that can only withstand a handful of cannon fire before to give in. Provided that the cabin does not end up being invaded by smoke, a lateral gash does not cause the death of the soldier in charge of loading the ammunition or the bulletproof glass of the front slit is not damaged so much as to compromise the view or even broken through completely, leaving us with few alternatives other than to close the security ~gate~ and navigate (badly) using the periscope. The international press has so far expressed almost in unison a resounding rejection of the title of From Software, guilty of having not only underestimated the problems relating to the failure to recognize certain gestures by Kinect, but also of not having provided any alternative to the control by motion detection. But what is the truth? Let's find out together. global war The story of Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor is also one of its strengths. After a viral attack that effectively halted the technological evolution of the world, China has led a devastating attack on the United States, a faction to which our character belongs, a sergeant who must lead a handful of soldiers to the rescue through seven campaigns. each composed of a variable number of missions. Soldiers die if the missions are not well managed, the Mech irreparably deteriorates and the game becomes progressively more difficult, requiring a painstaking study of maps and tactics to follow. Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor requires the simultaneous use of the controller and Kinect and, although the former must be held in hand for the entire duration of the game, one can only take advantage of the analog sticks, the triggers and the back buttons, which are used respectively to move the Vertical Tank and open fire with the front and rear weapons, once unlocked by obtaining rankings ranging from C to A, in a series of missions that can also be played cooperatively (see relevant box). Not only must navigation inside the cabin necessarily be carried out by moving the arms, pushing a virtual swivel chair with the hands and possibly interacting with our three adventure companions, but the hands must also operate, as already mentioned, a large number of devices, almost all concentrated in the central part of the interior of the passenger compartment. While playing with Steel Battalion in an ~ideal~ situation as regards the correct functioning of the Kinect, therefore in a well-lit room, without objects that could confuse the sensor and being at least two and a half meters from the device (which translates into need for a sufficiently large television, given that the game is only subtitled in Italian and that the indications of fellow soldiers are essential to survive), we had great difficulties. From the options screen it is possible (but we would say more than anything else that it is necessary, if you want to limit the problems) to disable certain functions of the interface, such as for example a sort of automatic ~hooking~ - such as the assisted aiming of a FPS, for clear - when the hand passes over a device or a lever. Despite this, experience requires the player to understand what the right range of movements is, as well as the timing, given that the tutorial represents little more than a hint in this sense. In short, the controls are already complex, plus those who play must be able to master them and at the same time take care of the right setting and the preparation of the room, in the absence of which there is inevitably episodes of frustration. One of the most frequent actions is the one that requires you to bring both hands forward to bring the view closer to the central porthole/slit to actually drive the mech and the same gestureit must be done to move away and interact with the passenger compartment: this simple interaction alone requires a lot of practice to be sure that it is not misunderstood, for example, with the lowering of the shutter that covers the porthole itself during firefights and, given the difficulty of the game, this leads to a good number of deaths. Above all because, when hit from the front, the view is reset and you find yourself away from the porthole or periscope, having to recall it; and if everything doesn't go as it should, you find yourself waving to put things right. After completing a couple of campaigns, the basic movements can be said to be controllable, but the obstacle at the entrance is considerable and requires a dedication that only the most willing will be willing to lavish. The cooperative mode One of the most interesting features of the game, which however has a complex structure, is the presence of a series of missions, along the campaign, which can be played alone, with the help of CPU-controlled mechs, or in online cooperative mode. These are open missions where you have to eliminate a series of enemies or targets within a time limit and in an ~open~ map. We found the code to be good, with no signs of latency or signal delay, and it's fun to coordinate with the other three team members to get the pens home. When you die you are not reborn (too easy!), but you find yourself like ghosts sitting on the hull of one of the mechs. These missions are also fundamental, because at the end of each one, even when playing alone, we are given a score which determines the purchase of upgrades and customizations for the mech Xbox 360 goals The fifty Objectives present in Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor must be unlocked by completing the seven chapters of the game, eliminating a certain number of enemies (both ground soldiers and VTs) and obtaining half or all of the mechanical components for vehicle customization. There are, of course, more complex challenges, such as finding a particular object or completing missions without suffering any losses, in single or in co-op. It won't be a short task, that's for sure. Try again, Kinect The progressive damage of the mech and the death of one's companions (who must be saved from assaults by Chinese militias inside the cockpit itself, as well as from accidents or explosions that can occur during a mission) brings to the fore the typical difficulty of the Steel Battalions, a factor which requires you to study every single mission, memorizing the position of the opponents to implement the necessary strategy. Once the enemy troops have been identified, in fact, you can proceed in the scenario with caution, avoid exposing yourself, and score shots from a distance using the periscope, as well as the various possibilities offered by the available arsenal. Even this element, however, comes into conflict with the problems related to Kinect which, even after a long playtest, never make you feel completely in control of what is happening. The result translates into a long series of missions, some very short, which you have to repeat several times, until you understand what exactly to do. It goes without saying that the confusion of some moments of the battle does not help in this sense, and risks making the experience the prerogative of a few, determined players. There is definitely more under the hood: over twenty mechanical parts to unlock for upgrading the VT, the cooperative mode via Xbox LIVE, the trust system that affects the efficiency of our companions and therefore the vehicle's performance , the particularly bloody vision of this war set in an alternative 2080 and a good number of chapters (seven in all), each composed of a variable number of stages. The appeal of the product, however, is influenced by the desire or otherwise to overlook a series of evident limitations of the gaming system, which could be streamlined by entrusting a few more commands to the pad buttons (the most obvious being the one relating to the choice between two different types of missiles to be launched from the right cannon: this feature, even after hours of play, will never let you sleep peacefully). Finally, a few words for the technical sector, which shows off well-made graphics as regards characters, mechs and settings, and which above all never shows the side to drops in the frame rate. Different speech for the sound, which boasts discrete music, accompanied, however, by dialogues that do not shine in quality and which, being only subtitled in Italian, must be followed carefully on the screen, since it is through these that the need to intervene is signaled to us to save the life of one of our soldiers, possibly wounded dto a shrapnel of explosive that must be extracted with the use of the hands.
