In reality, it soon became clear how Rayman Jungle Run was instead something different, with a formula specifically designed for the smartphone environment to which the title is dedicated. A far from easy job for Pastagames, a small and semi-unknown French team that has enjoyed some (deserved) popularity thanks to the handsome Maestro! Jump in Music for DS dated 2009. Far from easy, yes, but definitely successful. For an extra lum Rayman Jungle Run, we said, takes the platform mechanics but simplifies and compresses them, transforming them into speed runs within 40 short levels divided into 4 groups; the main objective is simply to reach the opposite end while trying to avoid all kinds of obstacles. This concretely means that the heroic aubergine runs autonomously, from left to right, limiting user interaction to the use of the skills that are gradually introduced and which are running, flying, wall running and punching. However, this should not be seen as a debasement or an offense to the series created by Michel Ancel, which on the contrary would have suffered more from a more direct porting inevitably made difficult and imperfect by touch controls. Instead, Pastagames' choice is intelligent, because Rayman Jungle Run appears to be a product perfectly cut and sewn around the capabilities and possibilities of the system it runs on; crossing the levels, in addition to being a pleasure in front of a graphic sector that takes full hands from Origins and is therefore wonderful, is also a pleasure above all for the ~multilayer~ formula studied by the programmers. Nothing revolutionary, mind you, but a further demonstration of the care taken in carrying out a well-done project. In practice, one can very well simply limit oneself to reaching the end of each level, without caring about anything else; with this approach Rayman Jungle Run turns out to be a rather simple game, accessible and enjoyable even by those with little experience with video games. If the casual user, captivated by the aesthetics and pampered by the gameplay, is therefore perfectly satisfied, even those who need a greater challenge can find at least one point of interest in the Ubisoft production. This is because each level is populated by 100 lums, distributed both easily along the ~main~ path and hidden in a less trivial way; being able to collect them all and get the ~perfect~ one is necessary to unlock the tenth stage of each group, as well as to gain access to the artwork (obviously splendid) that can be saved and used as wallpaper on your device. Since the gameplay - as mentioned - imposes the automatic management of Rayman's run, thus determining the impossibility of retracing one's steps, the collection of all 100 lums is directly subordinated to the trial and error, which in fact requires learning memorize the structure of the individual stages through numerous repetitions of the same. Although this operation is facilitated by a quick restart button, those who do not appreciate this kind of solution will certainly not change their mind thanks to Rayman Jungle Run. Finally, the synchronization of the games between the different devices and the presence of 3 save slots should be appreciated.", "date": "2012-09-25", "grade": "8.7"}
