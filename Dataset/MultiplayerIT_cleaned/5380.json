However, a few months after its release, the Creative Assembly have not sat on their laurels, and after the Chaos and some technical tweaks they have decided to release a new expansion dedicated to the fearsome Beastmen; perhaps a race not as appreciated as elves and other illustrious absentees, but undoubtedly full of interesting ideas and closely related to the Chaos just mentioned. There were many doubts about the Beastmen, and the most concrete one concerned the considerable price of their DLC (17.49 euros), but we weren't discouraged and we tested them thoroughly, to see if they are actually worth shelling out. higher than the cost of some of the best past Total War DLC for just one extra army and its campaign. Giving an answer, we assure you, was not easy. A horde of beasts invades the battlefields of Total War: Warhammer. Here is our test! Law of retaliation Call of the Beastmen puts you in the shoes of Khazrak the Monocle, legendary lord of the beasts imbufalito for having lost, in fact, an eye in battle against the brave Boris Todbringer. The purpose of the campaign is therefore only one: to take revenge on Boris by massacring all the human factions in the vicinity. Certainly not an elaborate military operation therefore, which requires a real massacre to be carried out and does not last very long, but it is more than adequate for an aggressive and mobile faction such as that of the Beastmen (designed to have enormous diplomatic malus and survive by force of battles). The Beastmen are after all children of chaos, a violent and instinctive race, which is based on the horde mechanics that Total War fans have already been able to appreciate in Attila (or using Chaos). Their armies are not replenished at the outposts, as it is not possible to conquer and settle them; Beastmen camp temporarily to boost their armies, they move with structures, and their best source of income is raiding the regions where they stop. However, it is not only the horde mechanics that distinguish this new race: the camps of the Beastmen are in fact hidden, and their armies move in ~ambush mode~, a pose that allows attacks to sometimes take the opponent by surprise in maps structured to favor a brutal charge of the opponent. This kind of clashes usually do not last long, because this feral faction specializes in melee, has very fast units capable of breaking the enemy ranks, and lacks effective ranged or special units. This does not mean, however, that the race necessarily always starts at a disadvantage, as many of the Beastmen units can be moved forward in battle, and suddenly strike enemies from closer together. These characteristics make them fearsome opponents in the hands of those who are good at moving their troops effectively in real time (although it is reasonable to expect some additional units in future updates). The stench of corruption Offensive dispositions and ambushes aren't the only mechanics that set Beastmen apart, either. As a faction in constant conflict, the player will have to manage a ~Beastly Fury~ gauge practically identical to the WAAAGH! of the Orks, complete with a summoned army at full gauge and internal conflicts if you remain passive for too long. Beastmen can then move underground and exploit the corruption of Chaos to gain advantages in the regions they are in (they can increase it after destroying an enemy outpost, for example, with the ~defil and plunder~ option). However, these listed are all mechanics already seen, merged into the most aggressive and unpredictable race in the game's campaign; the real novelty is the Chaos Moon, a dark star with which the Beastmen have a strong bond, which periodically offers great advantages in exchange for a heavy price to pay. For example, you could get bonuses in the experience gain of the troops, at the cost of not being able to replenish them after a battle, and so on, for a series of choices that could both guarantee you victory and put you in serious difficulty. In short, the Beastmen are an interesting race, which not only offers a new map and a unique campaign, but also a way of playing that will undoubtedly be greatly appreciated by those who love the mechanics of the horde. However, recommending the DLC without hesitation is impossible for us: we understand that, with Games Workshop out of the way and the due percentage of earnings, Creative Assemblies have found themselves having to raise the price of downloadable content, and we are also aware of how it is not easy to animate and model unique fantasy units (although some recycling from Chaos armies c 'And). Almost 18 euros are really too much, however, and the addition of the Amber Mage among the usable heroes - combined with some due changes to the balancing of the campaigns and various technical tweaks in the last patch - does not seem to us a point in favor significant enough to convince all fans to buy. So let's promote this expansion, since we really appreciated the mechanics of the new race and we enjoyed the campaign, specifying however that only for those who love ~horde~ armies will it be worth spending the money necessary to install it. If you prefer more ~classic~ factions, you can safely leave it alone and wait for the elven armies.", "date": "2016-07-29", "grade": null}
