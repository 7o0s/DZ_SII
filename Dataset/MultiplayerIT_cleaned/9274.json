The realm of fantasy is in trouble and in danger of falling apart. Oberon instructs the revived to find out the causes of the troubles, starting from the assumption that those soft, wicked and somewhat imbecile human beings certainly have something to do with it (how can you doubt it?). The first mission of the sweet fairy, capable of using magic like not even that nerd Harry Potter, will be to find two travel companions and convince them to follow her, also because she can go around all alone in a world full of trolls, wild animals, ghosts and Terrifying Demons is not recommended in any travel guide. Faery - Legends of Avalon is a strange Japanese-style RPG that creatively exploits the characteristics of the protagonist. The adventure is divided into small worlds that can be navigated by flying at high speed. Each world has different areas of interest where it is possible to find characters or access to dungeons. For example, in the first world, King Oberon's Isle, you can hover over a village, reach rocks, and visit a cave occupied by hostile goblins, where dragons once lived. In a later world, set on a ghost ship, it will instead be possible to visit the ship's deck, the hold or go to the rocks where there are a couple of friendly characters and sour sirens. In short, more than levels, these are structured environments to allow for micro-adventures. East wind As already mentioned, Faery - Legends of Avalon is a Japanese role-playing game, at least in terms of combat, inventory management and character growth. The clashes take place in turns, with party characters and enemies having one or more action points each round to spend on attacking, defending or healing. The attacks available to the protagonist are of two types: the shots fired by the wand or the spells. The only variant offered by the other characters (actually only by one), apart from the variety of offensive tools, is the possibility of summoning animals. By winning fights and solving quests you get new pieces of equipment, divided into five categories. Each object obtained, apart from potions, is linked to a sign (fire, water, iron and so on) which gives different effects. Obviously it is advisable to wear armor parts that link with the choices made during the growth of the character; incidentally, if you have chosen fire magic, it doesn't make much sense to put on a suit of armor linked to water. Speaking of character growth, let's say right away that Faery offers a rather classic type of progression: by fighting and carrying out missions you get experience and by accumulating enough experience you level up, obtaining new (automatic) characteristics and a skill point that can be spent to buy or improve powers. Annotations We dedicate this box to a couple of important details that should be underlined. First Faery - Legends of Avalon is only the first part of the game. Even so, the duration is good (about ten hours), but the truncated finish leaves no doubt. Secondly, although we have spoken throughout the article of ~a protagonist~, we specify that it is also possible to select a male character. Get your beep out of my face However, combat isn't the focus of the game and with a bit of exploring and talking to characters, you can often get through quests without hurting anyone. The exploration phase is perhaps the best part of the game, with the possibility of dashing from one part of the maps to another in search of clues, characters or objects useful for solving missions. It's just a pity that in closed environments, fortunately not very many and not very large, things change considerably. Not that exploring a cave is a disastrous experience, only the camera, evidently designed for larger spaces, doesn't help and makes it painful to look around. Also, teammates don't help. Throughout the game they will be placed behind the protagonist and will not hesitate to cover the shot with their cumbersome presence. Not bad when fluttering in large spaces, since they don't cause any discomfort, but in closed environments having to constantly move the shot to get them out of the way is quite boring. From a technical point of view Faery - Legends of Avalon does not excel. In general, despite the beauty of the worlds as a whole, some detail is missing in terms of textures and three-dimensional models. Nothing catastrophic, but more could have been done.", "date": "2011-05-19", "grade": "7.0"}
