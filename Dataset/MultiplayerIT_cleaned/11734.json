Going off track produces harmful effects. Even if there are many titles that superficially reveal strategy and freedom and are instead forced by invisible tracks, the matter, in this case, is too visible and evident. By improvising and detaching a contingent from the army corpus it is very easy to get yourself into frustrating situations that leave few escape routes. Even if the opposing troops are not too smart and almost always remain on the defensive, a high number of opponents represents a dangerous situation which unfortunately presents itself punctually if the player dares to get out of the pattern that takes him from outpost to outpost, straight up to the settlement to conquer. It follows that the best way to conduct a battle is to respect the basic rules of the game, cavalry against infantry and so on, and conquer the opposing bases one after the other, keeping the troops tight. A structure that becomes the only one possible from the moment in which the only way to heal one's troops is to place them safely within the walls of an allied base. Another negative note, or rather a rather evident discrepancy, consists in the break between the visual system, the setting and the arcade structure. Let's start with the assumptions. Bladestorm is a title that sacrifices graphic detail to set up a gigantic battle, fought in the French hills, in full medieval grandheur. Yet the battle is governed by a time counter that nails the fight as soon as the sun touches the horizon. This, in addition to destroying the atmosphere of the fight and tearing us away from the game in a bad way, means that we will have to repeat the conquest of the base from scratch even if by now our troops were about to sit down at the winners' table. Representation of a battle Big maps and more than a lot of opponents. All this costs dramatically in detail and the judgment becomes worse considering that the graphics engine is certainly not one of the trivial ones that seem to squeeze the machine. Indeed, in more than one situation it almost seems to be witnessing a nice title from the previous generation. Furthermore, numbers and words flutter around the screen in full arcade style regardless of the graphic style which is decidedly incompatible with numbers and yellow writing. Considering the genesis of this genre, these are understandable choices but they cause an ever greater loss of impact of the geographical setting, which would like to recall the Middle Ages of the French countryside. The opponents represent the best characterized element of the game. Unfortunately they appear only in the interludes while anonymous generals and lieutenants represent the only line of command in the defense of the opposing bases. Finally we find ourselves in front of anonymous woods propped up with trees identical to each other, stretched textures and a little too much fog when the number of buildings increases, not so much for reasons of engine heaviness, one presumes, but to hide obvious flaws. Luckily, under the sound side, the music changes. After the impact with the graphic indicators that constantly remind us of the arcade nature of the game, battle cries, metallic clangs and the whole range of sounds that one would expect from two sides in battle finally reach the ear. A good job underlined by an apt melody, even if too short, able to recover the atmosphere of the game put to the test by other elements of the game. Bladestorm: 100 Years War is available for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The version tested is the Xbox 360 version. Comment Bladestorm attempts to increase the strategic rate of a genre hitherto decidedly linked to action, introducing conquest points and a deeper management component. Unfortunately it binds the novelties to a structure that is still clearly arcade which ends up limiting the room for maneuver. Technically insufficient, it fails to enhance even from a choreographic point of view. Recommended for lovers of the genre who wish to follow its evolution, but with some reservations. Pros a lot of units on the screen finally a structured management component introduces some novelties in terms of playability... Cons ...unfortunately bound by the simplistic mechanics of the title simplified and rigid strategy technically not very satisfying some texts appear in Spanish, I hope it is a limited defect to the promotional copy Xbox 360 - Goals Achievements are unlocked through special books that are worth 50 points each. The former are unlocked almost automatically, the later ones are occasionally found as battle treasureslie. Bladestorm belongs to a genre with very high potential, unfortunately abused and superficially exploited both in the East and in the West. A genre that until now has embodied, at least in part, an evolutionary possibility for scrolling fighting games but which, in this form, seeks to become a more dynamic and playfully satisfying way of integrating action and military strategy. In Japan, the queen of this action branch of the strategic vein is Koei. Dynasty Warrior has been the main series of this genre for a long time, but Kingdom Under Fire and other emerging franchises have provided public opinion with a more complex yardstick that has produced the need to change an overused recipe. Koei is thus forced to take the field with something fresh both to keep its name linked to this kind of title, and to try new paths that rejuvenate the mechanics in order to generate future prospects. It all starts with a tavern and some contacts. The protagonist is a mercenary general about to take a dangerous road that will lead him to challenge arrogant lords perched in their possessions. Game structure Bladestorm attempts a change of course compared to its predecessors by reducing the importance of controlling a single character and placing it as a means for direct control of a team, introducing everything into a great battle. In practical terms, once you have acquired control of a group of archers, infantrymen or knights, our character is represented by the entire handful of mercenaries selected at that moment and the whole team fights in unison. The battle is more complex and rich than we are used to by enriching the map with troops positioned in defense of ramparts and control points that can be lost or conquered. In contrast the gameplay is grounded to the bone and the main objective of a mission is ultimately the only relevant one, but we'll get to that later. Fortunately, Koei has introduced some strategic elements with firm blades. The story comes to life among beer-soaked tables where rumors and possibilities continually intertwine. Our alter ego, just built with a comfortable and simple editor, appears in this place which will become a real headquarters where you can decide which side to take and how to get better and better contracts. In fact, in the tavern, in addition to the possibility of finding information and military engagements, it is possible to buy equipment and take care of our mercenaries perhaps by purchasing temporary upgrades to be used in battle or disposable special troops. The best equipment increases damage dealt or defense but the changes are never visually reflected on the game action which continues unchanged regardless of the peculiarities acquired by the characters. The same works for the skill increase obtainable with books found in battle which increase combat skills but do not add anything to the gameplay. Foot soldiers in chain mail attack automatically, archers and other troops attack with the press of a button. Another allows you to carry out mass actions against a target and another launches the special attack typical of a fighting class, such as jostling, mounted charges, quick attacks and special effects that are able to lend us a hand in precarious situations. Sadly it all boils down to considering what type of troop you command to throw it at the relatively more vulnerable enemy. Daring attack maneuvers with cavalry to mow down archers, for example, is absolutely inadvisable and this is one of the first clear examples of Bladestorm's rigid and simplistic structure that will never allow the player to perform ~Napoleon-style~ maneuvers. Winning then becomes a mere matter of timing in attacking or wisdom in knowing how to portray one's troops. The possibilities to act are reduced to the bone and consequently limit both the variety of possible situations and the danger of the opponents.", "date": "2007-12-14", "grade": null}
