How many Western children today can say they have interacted with a cow, a hen or have ever seen a farm up close? Perhaps only those lucky enough to have a house in the country or special educational programs. They probably know how to use a touch screen better than us but they don't know how what arrives on their tables every day is done. Work in the fields is a tough job, which machines have made less tiring but no less simple and Farming Simulator 15 is amply able to demonstrate it to you. The first question that may come to the neophyte is: ~Why a game like this?~ The only sensible answer is, ~Why not?~ We are perfectly capable of simulating an intercontinental flight Rome - New York, we can manage entire civilizations, the career of a football player or a playground, why shouldn't we be able to manage a farm? Fire up the combine and don your overalls, Farming Simulator 15 has arrived on consoles! Farming & Furious During these three years Farming Simulator has gone from a bet to laugh at to a solid reality, from seeming a parody title to a colossus capable of placing 500,000 copies on its launch day, presenting itself for this new console edition more beautiful and dazzling that never. As usual, dozens of vehicles return in this edition, all original. A range made up of simple or complex machines, ranging from the Lamborghini tractor to the fascinating potato harvester, which is undoubtedly the country cousin of some Transformer. In addition to the cultivation of maize, potatoes, hay and other seeds, we will also be able to dedicate ourselves to the breeding of cows, sheep and chickens and to the great novelty of this year: forestry, or rather the cutting and trade of timber. For each task you will need specific tools, although in some cases a machine can be used to collect multiple types of product. To cultivate a field you will need a plow or cultivator, a spreader, a fertilizer machine, a thresher, a container for transporting the material and a tractor. If you also want to make hay bales, you will need a special machine and a fork to lift and move them. Each material produced can be used in multiple ways. You can sell the potatoes, corn or wheat, you can use the hay to feed animals or you can sell the bales of it in the market, there is always something to do and each step can open up more possibilities for income. The hay produced can be mixed with feed and used to feed cows, whose milk you can sell, or sheep, from which you can make wool. You can buy hens and sell eggs, or you can completely change your sector and become lumberjacks. In this case you will have to learn how to use the chainsaw and cut the wood as straight as possible, you will have to learn how to use the loading crane and decide whether to sell the wood as it is or chop it up to then sell the chips, being careful not to drain the resources that the woods can offer. Just another way to farm Each machine is equipped with specific commands that allow you to activate blades, pincers, plows and which fortunately are always displayed at the top left, otherwise it would be practically impossible to remember all the possible variables. However, this doesn't make things easier, especially when there is a crane to operate or dozens of bales of hay to be unloaded without having to chase them down the street. Not to mention when we will have to operate the crane to move the wood; the amusement park games where you have to catch the stuffed animal with the mechanical arm are simpler. Come to think of it though, what's the point of complaining if a simulation is efficient? In theory we shouldn't, pity that the physical model sometimes takes a vacation and allows us to drive flatbed tractors as if they were very light cars, to then prevent us from climbing slightly steeper slopes with means that, again in theory, would have all the power to do it. On a strictly technical level, the game is fluctuating. The world around us alternates evocative panoramas with incorporeal passers-by, cars as hard as granite with extremely detailed and precise agricultural vehicles in every mechanism. Also, don't expect realistic handling of seeds, grain or other objects when they are moved to bins or unloaded into depots, because the animations are very crude in this respect. On the other hand, the way in which the vehicles get dirty as they are used is very nice, so much so that after a good few hours of work they will have to be cleaned to remain in perfect working order. In its own way, Farming Simuator is a very educational game because it makes us understand how complex the world of modern farms can be and because it teaches patience. The pace of the game is slow, thoughtful, some might call it boring, while for others it might be as relaxing as watching the corn ripen at sunset. Talking to some long-standing players, it is evident that its main attraction lies above all in being a title devoid of strong emotions, absurd challenges and frenzy, which requires reasoning and careful managerial management. Which then, despite being full of repetitive tasks, can we perhaps say that other very famous games aren't? We're always talking about ~farming~, right? Fortunately, when wandering the fields begins to seem too tedious, we can always entrust everything to a farmhand, whose price will be largely compensated by the burden of work he will take off our shoulders. Playstation 4 trophies Farming Simulator 15 has five gold, thirteen silver and eight bronze trophies. They tend to all be unlockable cumulatively, therefore not complex to obtain: it just takes the patience to play long hours carrying out the various assigned tasks. Platinum is unlocked by completing all other achievements. Lost in the fields However, the real problem of Farming Simulator 2015 is not boredom, but loneliness. Apart from a few meager tutorials that teach us how to plow a field, how to fertilize it and how to cut and move wood, the game smiles, gives us a nice pat on the back and leaves us completely alone in the face of the vastness of things we have to do to manage a of the three farms available. Sure, we know more or less how to grow wheat, but how do you manage the whole cycle of the farm? Where should we take the hay bales? How to manage the fields in the most efficient way? Why not explain to us that there are message boards where we can do small tasks to get some extra cash? The economic management of the farm is a meticulous work, in which it is necessary to carefully calculate the yield of the seeds, the cost of using the means and their wear. Furthermore, the pace of growth is very slow, it will take quite a while before we can repay the debts of the loan with which we will start the game, let alone if we want to buy the most efficient and expensive machinery. Fortunately, the game has a robust online community that will be ready to explain everything you need to know with videos and articles (a pity that mods are totally absent for the console version) and that you can also put into practice online. Well yes, you read that right Farming Simulator 15 will allow you to manage a multiplayer farm with friends and complete strangers, so you can chat amiably about this and that. In particular, the German community seems robust and organized, as we wanted to demonstrate. Too bad the netcode isn't very efficient and spends most of its time lagging or kicking you out of games. And don't you think of playing dumb and ram the others with your tractor, you'll be thrown out instantly. To appreciate Farming Simulator 15 well, therefore, it takes patience, a lot of patience, however we do not hide the fact that following the whole procedure that takes us from a plowed field to transporting a bale of hay has its charm and is an experience that every player should have at least once.", "date": "2015-05-28", "grade": "7.5"}
