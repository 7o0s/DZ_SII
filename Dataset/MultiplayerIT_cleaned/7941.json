After three years and a painful production, which led to multiple delays and the change of the graphics engine, finally here is the second episode, which aims to improve the good things achieved by the previous one. The game is still divided into three parts, but instead of playing different characters it was decided to focus the whole story on the figure of Cole Anderson, already seen in the first chapter. In fact, the plot of Sniper 2: Ghost Warrior picks up right where it left off and still isn't the focal point of the production. We still find ourselves in a series of situations typical of genre clichs, with our heroes busy fighting the terrorist organization of the moment. However, Cole is a very particular hero, a soldier who prefers the silence of nature and the solitude of a dilapidated apartment to the roar of battle, while patiently waiting for the target to enter the field of his viewfinder. The moments dedicated to pure sniping are probably (and rightly so) the most successful, even if there are others that are more spectacular and noisy, very much in line with the typical productions of the genre. Be prepared for numerous moves throughout the game's campaign. Globetrotting snipers As we have written, the Sniper 2: Ghost Warrior campaign is divided into three acts set in different locations, for a total of ten chapters. The intention is to give a certain variety both visually and in situations, and we must admit that City Interactive really does its best not to bore the player. Each act has a structure that alternates solo sessions with others in the company of the Spotters, these sections are used to become familiar with the environment and game mechanics. These are followed by markedly stealth parts where the error is not particularly tolerated, up to the observation points to be reached for the elimination of the objectives. Here the game turns into a pure shooter finding its best form. Just to give an example, in the first act set in the Philippines we see Cole cover the landing of allied troops in a highly spectacular and entertaining section, enriched by the infamous bullet camera effect, already seen in Sniper Elite and which translates into a shot that shows the impact of the bullet on the target. Later we find ourselves forced to cross a disastrous Sarajevo facing a traumatic series of events, including witnessing a genocide and the inevitable sequence of betrayals and twists. This part deserves particular applause for the presence of invisible snipers who force you to carefully scrutinize the seabed. The tension created is truly staggering, finding yourself reversed under the influence of a deadly eye, floundering through the dust and civilian corpses is just a taste of the horrors that war represents. Fortunately, City Interactive's is a video game, which is rather fun when everything works at its best, unfortunately these successful moments collapse under the weight of the defects, which are not few or negligible. Xbox 360 goals Sniper 2: Ghost Warrior has 49 objectives, it is not difficult to conquer almost half of them simply by finishing the campaign, an operation that will not take you much time. The rest could be a problem, especially the one that requires the killing of a hundred opponents in online multiplayer. The question is, will you be able to meet that many? Or eat soup... Titles of this type live by virtue of an elaborate artificial intelligence routine and accurate level design, especially as the player has the constant need to hit from a distance and move using evasive maneuvers. The problem is that Sniper 2: Ghost Warrior is built on the logic of an FPS along the lines of Call of Duty, that is extremely linear and anchored to the scripts that follow each other with each progress. The behavior of the soldiers is totally subordinated to pre-established mechanics that take away the pleasure of interpreting situations. In other words, refusing to carry out the instructions constantly given by the game is equivalent to a certain death, and in the City Interactive title, being rightly geared towards a simulation aspect, you die with a few shots and it is almost impossible to get out alive with Rambo-like solutions. A system of paradoxical rigidity, exacerbated by a questionable implementation of checkpointsts, it is not uncommon to have to repeat entire sections several times, losing the concentration necessary to get out of it without throwing the pad out the window with each passage. The opponents' AI is deficient, if the presence of two levels of alertness and individual reactions that prevent all enemies from throwing themselves like ants on Cole is appreciable, it is less so the presence of smudges and ingenuity in behavioral routines. We have happened to pass in front of the eyes of the guards without causing any alarm, or to see someone fleeing and then circling waiting to be shot down. The maps are then all extremely linear, limited and difficult to explore, if we exclude some secret objects to collect. Even the fire mechanics, although generally satisfying and equipped with a good level of customization (you can decide whether or not to activate the ballistics), are affected by the excessive vibration of the viewfinder and a hit spot so approximate as to seem from the previous generation. Even the bullet camera seems made in a listless way, without the bloody spectacularity admired in Sniper Elite V2. Graphically, the game uses the CryEngine3 engine, a feature widely heralded by the developers but which has not been adequately exploited. Certainly no one expected the beauty of a Crysis, and some glimpses work, but it is difficult to digest the graphic glitches, the uncertain framerate and the poor quality of the foliage, a particularly serious mistake for a sniper simulator. The low production values also affect the brevity of the campaign and the inconsistency of the multiplayer, reduced to a single mode and two maps. City Interactive has guaranteed support for this mode through the use of DLC, but it could be too late even for a title sold at a budget price.", "date": "2013-03-20", "grade": "5.6"}
