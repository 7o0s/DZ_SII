But it also makes little sense to talk about it, in fact the FPS has become a sort of playful platform within the particular playful platform defined as a video game, a kind of sub-code that always allows new expressions, which however, there is little to do , they all start to look a little alike. At least from this point of view, the Operation Flashpoint series tries to do something to stand out from the crowd, presenting itself as an extremely tactical and realistic first-person shooter, a sort of slightly more structured and well-packaged version of ARMA, or something in between between the latter and Ghost Recon, if possible. Alone, without the contribution of Tom Clancy, and strange to say it is no small matter. While the road taken by Call of Duty, Battlefield and Medal of Honor is that of extreme spectacularization, in a fight to the sound of millions of dollars between graphic constructions and Hollywood scripts, Codemasters takes the field deploying its four dirty and scurrilous marines in in the middle of a dusty and boundless undergrowth, to fight the Chinese without paying too much attention to the history of the characters, the international intrigues and the jaw-breaking scenes. The watchword is ~realism~, a principle on the basis of which we are required to abandon expectations of scripts treated to the millimeter and cinematic action scenes (and many people expect nothing else), because real war seems to be decidedly a else. All this implies a second watchword, or tactics, the element on which the gameplay of Operation Flashpoint: Red River is entirely based and which distinguishes this game from many others in particular. Military and militarists It is not clear how the general tone of this game should be taken, what is certain is that starting from the initial presentation we find ourselves in the midst of the most typical militaristic stereotype with a realistic declination, with pounding foul language and classic marine comments and points of view . The initial sequence, in particular, summarizes all the international chaos in a few minutes from the Cold War to the clash with Al Qaeda with a style that could leave you dumbfounded, if it has not been intended as deliberately self-ironic. Indeed, all of Sergeant Knox's nonstop rant that accompanies the game action, interspersed with comrade-like commentary from the soldiers, takes on a bearable character if understood as a deliberate caricature of the marine spirit that pervades all Codemasters' representation of warfare. , but even so after an hour of swearing and digressions on Chinese, Taji and motherfuckers in general it's easy to get tired. The first consequence of the developers' bet on realism at all costs is that, not wanting to indulge in scripted, overly spectacular and ultimately unrealistic scenes, the game unfolds as a ~simple~ invasion carried out by American troops in a territory hostile, with the typical mission to take us from a point A to a point B with various intermediate digressions in the liberation of points of interest or in the protection of the convoy, offering a convincing representation of a real military action, but also a story essentially little interesting and an extremely flat level design. Another ambivalent point of this production is the choice to base the entire game on a gigantic map of 240 km of land, which also in this case represents a remarkable coherence with the realistic intent but brings with it the problem given by the excessive monotony of the scenery, largely dominated by immense prairies, largely impassable mountains and stone villages. In short, from every point of view Operation Flashpoint: Red River clearly appears as a product not suitable for all palates, but rather as a niche shooter designed for fans of military realism. Let's specialize Once the necessary screening of the public has been done, the game can begin to be enjoyed without too many reservations, because the innovative scope of Operation Flashpoint: Red River in the panorama of current FPS cannot be denied. It's about controlling a team of marines made up of four elements each specializing in a role between rifleman, scout, grenadier and assault riflemen, each with its own equipment and its specific approach to the battlefield, of course. The progression in the game allows the acquisition of further skill points to be distributed in the various stfighter stats and the ability to change slots for weapons and special abilities. The typical tactics of the game action is evident from the first minutes on the soil of Tajikistan: it is possible to move around the map with enormous freedom but if you don't act in a coordinated way with the others and don't take advantage of the scenario covers, a dose of bullets is guaranteed, on the other hand the first missions of the campaign in this sense represent an excellent game school by indicating with a certain continuity the points to reach and the best ways to exploit the commands for team management (a rather disconcerting maze of possible options) and possible air or ground support for the hottest moments. The enemies are many and often well covered and sometimes a well-aimed blow is enough to put us out of action, therefore the support of the companions, with their indispensable indications on the positions of the enemies sighted (automatically issued by the artificial intelligence) is fundamental. The management of wounds, however, is rather particular, representing in a certain sense a deviation from the general realistic system. Once hit, in the event that the wound is not fatal, we can heal ourselves (or heal the companions) by holding down a key for a certain amount of time to stop the bleeding, and for a further period to completely heal the harm. Obviously, while this is happening we will be unable to move and shoot, therefore it is not an operation to be carried out lightly and also in this case the coverage of fellow soldiers can be fundamental. Cooperation first of all Operation Flashpoint: Red River is a game practically designed to be enjoyed in cooperative multiplayer, that's clear. Both the main campaign and Team Engagements can be played together with other human companions, always in cooperative form. Given the team nature of the game, with its tactical structure that makes coordination and participation between the fighters its fulcrum, it is clear that group use is the privileged way to fully enjoy the various modes. The entire system is based on ~drop in/drop out~ access, ie we can choose at any time to access a game in progress in any mode, collect any points and awards and exit the game without problems with extreme fluidity. The game possibilities are many and have already been explained during the preview, going from the classic Horde (Ultima Forza) to escort missions (Thunderclap), from controlling areas of interest (Military Action) to rescuing comrades in the middle to an enemy territory (Combat Search and Rescue). Beyond perhaps Ultima Forza, which poses the particular need to decide when to recall the helicopter for the extraction in order to end the game (thus calculating the technical times for the operation), the other modes present playful moments in good part already present within the campaign, which therefore probably represents the option of main interest within the offer present in the game, but one cannot however complain about the variety of choices proposed, which will be necessary once concluded more shooting the 10 missions that make up the main story. We note the complete absence (at least for the moment) of competitive multiplayer modes, a choice that pulls Red River out of a decidedly dense field of competitors but which could represent an important limitation for several players. Xbox 360 goals The achievements are 50 for the usual total of 1000 points to unlock, distributed fairly equally between the campaign (divided into its chapters) and the various cooperative game modes. The objectives related to the normal progression of the game are unlocked without problems, while those related to the player's performance, in some cases quite advanced, require more effort. In any case, an accessible challenge. In between flows the river (red) This is clear from the first minutes of the game: Operation Flashpoint: Red River does not have that graphic impact that other games, such as Call of Duty and Battlefield, can currently boast. The relative simplicity of the scenarios has several explanations, there is no doubt, considering the enormous extension of the playing area, the possibility of traversing the map following different paths and the prevailing call for realism which, effectively, requires that Tajikistan both made in the shape of Tajikistan and on this the work of the developers has been commendable. Despite these legitimate reasons, the graphics sector remains a rather weak element in this Codemasters production, demonstrating that the engineetario Ego has perhaps better applications in racing rather than first-person shooters. Various imperfections that characterized the test versions have been resolved, but some indecisions remain on the animations of the characters, on their relationship with the surfaces (some problems of interpenetration and ~skating~ detected), on the uniform coverage of the textures and the complete lack of some movements of the soldiers, such as the moment of boarding the means of transport, which also occurs several times during the campaign. A marginal issue but which can prove to be important in contributing to identification. It is a functional graphic system to the structure of the game, there is no doubt about this, with the construction of a vast single environment that can be used entirely online without uncertainties, but one cannot help but notice how it looks rather spartan and monotonous . The particular lighting intervenes to improve the situation, which creates suggestive glimpses of the valleys of Tajikistan and characterizes the entire game with that reddish sunlight that perpetually recalls that red river reported in the same title.", "date": "2011-04-21", "grade": "7.5"}
