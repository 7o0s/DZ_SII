The news of a game with this same formula dedicated to the Smurfs, therefore, was well received by hordes of nostalgics and younger gamers; after all we are talking about a franchise with a long history, also capable of making the leap from cartoons to cinema in relatively recent times. The Smurfs Epic Run comes with a widely tested structure, one that eliminates the ~endless~ concept in favor of random stages in the composition, but with a beginning and an end. All with a view to a map full of missions, which develops along a path capable of guaranteeing a certain duration to the experience. The model chosen for this title is the freemium one, which means that we will be able to play for free and without particular constraints with respect to the unlocking mechanisms of the new Smurfs, subjecting however to the now traditional ~action energy~, which is expended with each new run and recharges after a certain number of minutes. The Smurfs Epic Run is a running game that's really nice to look at, but not particularly engaging Two apples or so The first thing that catches the eye of The Smurfs Epic Run is the excellent hand-drawn graphics, this yes daughter of the experience made by Ubisoft with the Rayman franchise. The rendering of the Smurfs Village and of the various settings, quite different in terms of chromatic choices and situations, is really excellent, the shades are delicate and the design of the characters reproduces in a very faithful way the drawing style we are used to with ~the strange little blue men~. The second thing you notice, however, is the particularly bland pace of the action, which unequivocally reveals how the production was made with a very young target in mind. We proceed from left to right automatically and we have to jump to avoid chasms and traps, as well as to collect the elements that will allow us to obtain the usual three stars useful for progressing in the campaign, but in fact the scrolling is slow and the gameplay has no nothing to do with the frenzy of the already mentioned mobile games dedicated to Rayman. An interesting factor is represented by the presence of a large number of different Smurfs, which must be freed during the missions in order to then be selected on the basis of their peculiar abilities, and some nice variations on the theme (see the Flappy Bird-style one), but there is little else to hold the court and the experience therefore proves to be a little too limited and lackluster.", "date": "2016-01-30", "grade": "6.5"}
