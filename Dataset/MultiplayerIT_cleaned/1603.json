We are obviously talking about 3 out of 10 Season 2, made available through the Epic Games Store in free format starting from April 8, 2021 (and until April 15, so claim it before it becomes paid!). After an interesting but inconclusive first season, what do we think of this second part? Here is our review. On the previous episodes 3 out of 10 Season 2: The main cast 3 out of 10 Season 2 picks up right where we left off in Season 1. Without giving too many spoilers, the plot revolves around a ramshackle development studio, Shovelworks Studios. This team, in its entire career, has never been able to offer the public a quality game. In fact, every game developed has been rated no more than 3/10 (3 out of 10, from which the title derives). However, things could change, because Shovelworks is working on a new game, ~Surfing with Sharks~, a classic endless runner with a maritime theme. The work is in fact promising and could even get a 4/10. Well, this absolutely doesn't have to happen. A mysterious agency then sends Midge, a young animator, to join the development team, with the secret intent of sabotaging the game. 3 out of 10 Season 2: Nothing weird, just a giant tentacle In between, Midge will have to deal with some of the most absurd characters in the world of development. In fact, the style of 3 out of 10 is comical and often non-sense: just to give you an idea, a giant octopus lives in the refrigerator of the studio and human sacrifices are held in the basement. Anyone who has played the first season knows that realism is not the goal at all: Terrible Posture in fact wants to use their game to criticize the videogame industry in a light and amusing way, attacking the crunch culture, the obsession with the latest technological advances and so on. 3 out of 10 Season 2 continues this mission, with five more episodes that focus on various themes that we don't want to anticipate to avoid spoilers. As mentioned in the opening, the first part of this series didn't particularly care to advance the general story: why is it so important that Shovelworks doesn't create a quality game? What is the secret agency that drives Midge's actions up to? Again we will not find out. 3 out of 10 fails to carry the narrative forward, continuing to focus on individual episodes, which have their ups and downs. At best they'll elicit a few small laughs from you, but you'll soon forget what happened because it really doesn't matter. Even the characters do not evolve: the surprise effect of the first season is over, moreover, so many exchanges between the characters have lost some of their charm. On a purely narrative level, in essence, there is too little meat in the fire. We don't know how many seasons have been planned by the developers, but we sincerely hope that the whole story won't drag on too long and that the next season will be able to cut to the chase and turn the whole story around. Minigames what a passion Season 2 3 out of 10 Season 2: A classic music minigame Also from a playful point of view, 3 out of 10 Season 2 continues on the path outlined. Between one intermission scene and another we will be challenged with a series of mini-games of various kinds, from a soccer game with exploding balls, to a first-person shooter and a turn-based dungeon crawler. Just like in the first season, however, we are talking about disposable, unoriginal and absolutely ignorable sequences. They can in fact be skipped without penalty. On the one hand it is good, because probably every player will find some mini-game that is not to his taste and will be able to avoid getting bored. On the other hand, it is undeniable that ~you can not play~ is not the best way to present your video game. 3 out of 10 is in fact conceived as an interactive sitcom, rather than as a pure video game. The playful side is dedicated to collecting Stars, collectibles that can be obtained as a reward from mini-games or through environmental exploration. Hardened completionists may want to play and replay each mini-game to ensure they complete the season 100%, thus also increasing longevity. Everyone else, however, expect about 30 minutes per episode, for a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes for the entire game. 3 out of 10 Season 2: battle on four wheels Finally, we remind you that the first season is still now available in free format on the Epic Games Store. Also until April 15, 3 out of 10 Season2 will be free. Basically, for the moment the whole package is accessible without any expense.", "date": "2021-04-13", "grade": "7.0"}
