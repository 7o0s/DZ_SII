Here, Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery is really a product dedicated to true gamers, who will be able to enjoy an authentic little work of art smiling at those who think that with those things there, with the touch screen and no buttons, expensive toys for children spoiled, it's not even worth wasting your time. The beauty of a pixel Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery is basically a graphic adventure in various respects similar to the historic point and click genre, in this case in an obviously modernized and revised edition based on the touch interface. The protagonist is The Scythian, an adventurer of whom very little is known exactly as little is known of why he is in a sort of magical forest populated by animals, people and mysteries. While offering some more dynamic elements, such as fights during which it is necessary to rotate the device (iPad or iPhone) vertically, for the most part Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery is a reflective game, not to say contemplative, and heavily focused on puzzles. Pleasant, sometimes excellent and ingenious, other times a little too abstract and difficult to understand, slightly repetitive but never cloying, they compose a gameplay that coldly analyzed is probably the least brilliant part of Capybara Games' production; however, this does not want to be a criticism of the mechanics created by the Toronto-based team, but rather an exaltation of how exceptional the other aspects that make up the final product are. Playing Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery is a particular, engaging and fascinating experience, capable of transporting you to a world that seems to have personality for every pixel that composes it. And there are many dots, because the artistic style adopted is precisely that ~pixel art~ which is based on the basic component of digital graphics; an exciting choice, not to mention exciting, capable of striking anyone who has the slightest sensitivity towards this type of aesthetic solution to the heart. From this point of view, the Capybara game is a wonderful, melancholic and evocative journey, which due to its whispered and barely hinted sensitivity is very reminiscent of a masterpiece such as Another World by Eric Chahi; and the personality of which the characters made up of a handful of colored squares are totally full of is sensational, a clear sign of how special the result achieved by the team is. Yet despite the incredible work done on the aspects described above, Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery would not be what it is without the contribution of Jim Guthrie, musician author of one of the most incredible soundtracks that have ever graced the world of video games, and which therefore makes the use of headphones absolutely essential during game sessions. It is fortunate that the Canadian artist's project has also found the way to extended publication, with an album available on iTunes at this link and on vinyl (limited edition) which guarantees even greater dignity to his exceptional work. What stands out most in Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery, however, is the extraordinary cohesion of the elements that compose it, such as to form a seamless whole; graphics, sound, gameplay become abstract and malleable concepts, which interpenetrate and which are impossible to separate from each other. Too bad only for the rather reduced overall longevity, between 4 and 5 hours of play.
