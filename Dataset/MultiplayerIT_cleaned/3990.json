{"name": "Bravery and Greed", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bravery-and-greed-recensione.html", "text": "Bravery and Greed is a 4-friend Dungeons and Dragons campaign turned roguelite dungeon brawler beat 'em up in 2D and pixel art. The art style, characters and environments have been designed to evoke a nostalgic videogame atmosphere in the player, all with a very solid architecture and technical sector. As with all roguelites, the magic of this game lies in its replayability, and between modifiers and allies to compete with, we can tell you that this game won't bore you. Developed by Rekka Games, Bravery and Greed sees a wizard, a paladin, a thief and an amazon (you can easily imagine them thanks to their respective DnD classes) collect four magical gems from as many dungeons to be able to enter the realm of the dwarves and steal their treasure. During the journey you can choose to ally yourself with one of the four deities of this narrative universe, that of darkness, that of life, that of order and that of chaos. A bit like in Hades with the gods of Olympus, the more you enter the four dungeons the more powerful the gifts of these entities will become. Where Bravery and Greed departs from the usual fantasy adventure is in the fact that greed is at the heart of many mechanics, especially cooperatives. Gold, potions and equipment are not shared: at the end of a room, when the chest is opened, it is first served, first served. Will you be selfless or will you let greed eat you up? In this review of Bravery and Greed we're going to analyze the 4 classes, settings and mechanics that make this game a little pearl to have fun alone and in company. Four classes, four styles Choosing which deity to devote yourself to in a Bravery and Greed adventure will determine the playstyle to be adopted throughout the game The beginning of the adventure of Bravery and Greed looks like a joke: a wizard, an Amazon, a thief and a paladin enter a tavern and decide to steal the dwarfs' treasure, obviously it's the thief's idea. These are the four characters with whom you can venture into the levels of BaG alone or in company through the online functions. The Wizard, at first glance, is the trickiest to use: he has a main attack with a medium-short throw, a charged shot that creates a Dragon Ball-style ball of energy, and a special ability that transforms his magic wand into a minion that fights for you. With this ability, however, you will lose your primary attack so it must be dosed well. The paladin has a fairly standard throwing sword and shield with which to parry blows or charge enemies to knock them down and stun them. The thief is equipped with two very short-range blades but can count on a bow and arrow while the amazon (the strongest class in our opinion) has a greatsword and a boomerang that deals a lot of damage when launched with its charged shot. Each character has a life bar and a stamina bar which is depleted with each strike and when dodging. The mage has the best dodge because it consists of a small teleport that allows him to pass through enemies, to have the same effect the other classes must devote themselves to darkness and hope that one of the talents to choose from is dedicated to this skill. However, all characters have a very small window of invulnerability to damage while dodging, but it ends an instant before the end of the animation. Each hero can also find equipment in each chest of the dungeons he explores: there are boots, gloves, magic wands with special abilities and necklaces to obtain passive benefits. The rest of the HUD is made up of potions in your possession that heal a fixed amount of health points (about 800 or one third of life) and restore the stamina bar. Four deities, four upgrades The bosses don't shine for their unique attacks and graphic style but they do an excellent job in the nostalgia sector In Bravery and Greed putting together your own build to face the dangers of each dungeon is really simple. At the beginning of each adventure, after choosing the class, an altar will ask you which of the four deities of the game you want to join, a choice you will have to remain faithful to until your death. If you decide to devote yourself to darkness (in our opinion the best combo to complete the game is amazon + darkness) you will get bonuses and powers that will steal the life of your enemies to give it to you. There are bonuses that increase damage, but only for the first 10 seconds of each room encouraging an aggressive playstyle and power-ups that at the cost of your health points exponentially increase the damage of your weapon, being bad is very cool in BaG. Whowill decide to follow the path of the divinity of life, instead, will receive bonuses that increase the base health of his character, enhance the dodge, replenish the hero's life points if he has been injured and increase the chances of finding potions. Another set of fun power-ups is the Chaos power-up which is all about setting enemies on fire and receiving massive damage bonuses when low on health. It's risky but incredibly rewarding and perfectly in line with the rogue spirit of this game. The God of Order buffs are undoubtedly the dullest because they only slightly increase damage or mobility by rewarding a consistent, risk-free playstyle. In addition to the bounties you receive during your dungeon explorations, you may also come across tomes behind an environmental puzzle or after a secondary room full of enemies. Browse them to receive a passive bonus that will accompany you for the rest of the game. Among the corridors of the procedurally generated maps, then, there are also merchants where you can buy potions and equipment and wizards to upgrade your equipment with extra features. Tarot and greed Bravery and Greed is a great single player title but in multiplayer it is at its best Accumulating gold during an adventure will not only give you access to the riches of the merchants but it will be how progression will be measured when you beat the last boss or die trying. Each level will unlock a random resource among the many items in the game. In addition to increasing the chances of finding certain powerful objects in a chest, in this way you will also be able to unlock a series of tarot cards, i.e. passive modifiers to add some spice to the game. There is no limit to how many you can activate at the same time and each of them has a negative and a passive effect: the mad, for example, will allow you to come back to life once you run out of life points but at the cost of almost all your gold. The single player adventure is a nice challenge that takes some training but is ultimately quite simple to complete. Where Bravery and Greed gives its best, however, is in the multiplayer sector. With four players allied when it comes to defeating enemies but competing to grab the gold, this game is capable of providing plenty of laughs especially if you're all on the same couch. The controller is practically a must for playing, even on PCs where the game, unfortunately, suffers from some technical problems (drastic drop in framerate) when other apps, such as Discord, are working in the background. There is also a PvP mode which however fails to reach the heights of PvE adventure dungeons.", "date": "2023-01-21", "grade": "8.0"}
