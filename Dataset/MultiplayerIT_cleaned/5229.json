{"name": "Al lavoro!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/175219-job-simulator-al-lavoro.html", "text": "Born on PC as one of the flagship titles of the SteamVR platform and therefore exploited properly for the launch of HTC Vive, Job Simulator was found ready and in pole position during the arrival on the market of PlayStation VR, Sony's viewer for the acclaimed PlayStation 4. Even if there is an abysmal difference between the two helmets in terms of quality and precision of player detection, it must immediately be emphasized that the game, exactly as it happened with the Valve peripheral, is the product that most exploits the movement of the player and his limbs also on PlayStation 4. With all that follows in terms of space needed to fully enjoy the experience and inconvenience caused in the event that you are unable to accommodate yourself as required. Let it be clear that when everything runs smoothly, the satisfactions are many and the fun is perceived immediately, especially when you decide to let someone who has never tried virtual reality play and who in Job Simulator can immediately understand what to do and what actions to take. In fact, the game attempts to recreate a series of routine activities within four distinct scenarios. We have the mechanic, the chef, the cashier and the clerk. Each of these settings offers sixteen tasks (thirteen only for the mechanic) of increasing commitment and well explained by a robot that also acts as a narrative element. In fact, in terms of history, the game attempts to recreate a dystopian future in which humanity is practically extinct and all that remains are floating CRT screens equipped with intelligence and a minimum of sense of humor. We are just one of these robots visiting a museum dedicated to the work done by humans and for this reason we will be able to relive these ~magnificent~ daily life experiences. Once completed, each scenario can also be tackled in free mode by carrying out tasks without interruption but it is assumed that after about an hour and a half, we will have seen everything that the product is able to offer us and it will be difficult to remain the desire to put the viewer back on to make yet another smoothie or change the pistons of a small car. Job Simulator takes full advantage of PlayStation VR and Move but we'll need to have plenty of space to play it Playstation 4 trophies Job Simulator contains 12 trophies. Excluding the inevitable platinum, we find eleven all in gold. Five are related to completing the game and various scenarios, while another five are related to specific actions that can be performed within the environments. Finally, there is one last one, very easy to collect, which simply asks you to read the credits from start to finish. How to play? Job Simulator requires a full Sony headset setup to play. So in addition to PlayStation VR and the PlayStation Camera, it forces the player to have two Moves. There is no way to make it work with one or more DualShocks. During the game configuration phase, it is immediately clear that it is necessary to have a completely free space around the player at 360. It must be possible to extend one's limbs to the maximum and furthermore the title must be faced standing up since it will be necessary to move even a few steps sideways and frontally to reach all the tools and buttons with which you can interact. At this point you enter the game, choose one of the four scenarios and begin to carry out elementary actions of common life with our robot operator who will assist us in the course of the tasks as if it were a single long tutorial. Job Simulator is, for all these reasons, a really simple title to play: it doesn't offer any challenge rate as you won't be able to make mistakes or lose, you don't die or have a score, the mission simply doesn't proceed until you the task that has been assigned to us has been carried out correctly. All the elements that can be interacted with can be destroyed or thrown outside the workbench but they will promptly reappear at our side to be used so there is also no possibility of getting stuck. Except for some unclear instructions that forced us on a handful of occasions to try everything with everything to complete the mission. In fact, the operation to be carried out is not always indicated on the screen (fortunately) and furthermore the game is entirely in English with the robots who often speak in the form of a metaphor. In terms of concrete gameplay and activities to be performed you can expect exactly what you can imagine. In the kitchen scenario we will have to deal with the use of grill, pots, condiments and cleaning dishes; in the pansAt the cashier's office we will have to provide visitors with food, newspapers and various furnishings; as a mechanic we will have to deal with air filters, fuel and tire changes; while as an employee we will have to carry out a series of very basic tasks such as making coffee, making photocopies or interacting with a computer equipped with a keyboard with just two keys and a mouse. As we have already said, the strength of Job Simulator is all in its ability to make a whole series of movements credible and natural in the virtual space that perfectly recall those that can be performed in real life. And this, in fact, makes the title immediate and perfectly playable even for those who have always had little in common with video games. We close this review with some technical notes. The game has very cartoonish and colorful graphics but decidedly sparse. While maintaining its very precise stylistic coherence and in line with the narrative aspect, it is obvious that we are dealing with a title that does not make the technological aspect one of its strong points. The objects, robots, scenarios and elements with which it is possible to interact are all represented with a low number of polygons and with a very basic and very geometric design. Furthermore, it is not actually possible to move in the recreated environments outside of the few steps necessary to reach levers or furnishings more external to our workbench. Obviously the flip side is given by a perfect fluidity that reduces any phenomenon of nausea and motion sickness to zero even after long game sessions thanks to the perfect cleaning of the scenario. Wanting to nitpick, we noticed a very pronounced effect of the LoD, the level of detail, which causes most of the writing on objects to lose sharpness as soon as you move away from them by a few centimeters. We recall again that Job Simulator is entirely in English, including texts, while the audio aspect is really bare bones with some music tracks that can be heard by acting on the radios and CD players scattered throughout the game environments.", "date": "2016-10-16", "grade": "7.0"}
