{"name": "Strong Bad Episode 2: Strong Badia the Free - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/strong-bad-episode-2-strong-badia-the-free-recensione.html", "text": "Less than a month after the release of the first chapter, we are once again talking about Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People which, having achieved good success with the public and critics, seems to be able to guarantee an interesting qualitative level and, as happened with Sam & Max, a certain growth with the succession of releases. In this Strong Badia the Free, players return to the role of the by now famous Mexican wrestler who, after protesting against an absurd tax on emails and spending a small period of time under house arrest for this, decides he has had enough of the King of the City and to create its own independent state. A crazy starting point to say the least that will develop in an even more absurd way when every single character present decides to follow in the footsteps of the protagonist, segmenting the small playing area into a multitude of different countries, each with unique characteristics and very often based on hilarious princes that will get many laughs. Longer and more fun Click, talk and solve small puzzles: Strong Badia the Free offers the same gameplay as its predecessor with the usual tendency to favor the narrative rather than focus on the puzzles, however present but practically always linked to the use of collected objects and almost never real. own puzzles; here, to find a possible big limitation of the series, one could say that what was initially only a sensation is finding confirmation: one is literally dragged from the beginning to the end, with almost no possibility of getting lost and nervous, with less frustration than the average of graphic adventures but, perhaps, even less satisfaction in completing it. The level of difficulty has therefore not changed and will allow anyone to complete the work while the good habit of not sewing the events on those of the web-cartoon has remained, presenting some references but hiding them so as not to confuse the uninitiated. The extra front is very good, which is now even ungenerous to define in this way, in which the presence of the new mini-game Math Kickers: Algebros shines - a sort of scrolling fighting game in full 80s style in which, however, to win you must also do of account, simply brilliant - but inside which dozens of collectibles have been placed, small bonuses and initially secret surprises that help to grow a longevity that is already more substantial than in the past. You will hardly find yourself in the presence of the playful experience of life, but overall what is offered is very well blended and as always at TellTale we have thought of fun without worries and frills, a sort of alternative to an evening at the cinema. Strong Bad Episode 2: Strong Badia the Free is available for Nintendo Wii and PC. The tested version is the PC one. Comment Strong Badia the Free is on balance longer, more detailed and richer than the first chapter released last August, confirming the validity of the idea and the implementation skills of the team behind it. However, the definitive leap in quality is still lacking and perhaps the expectations dictated by TellTale's past are excessive in this sense, suggesting that you take this product for what it is: a handful of hours without thoughts with a beautiful writing of texts and brilliant intuitions. Pros Fun story Mini games and extras are quality Longer than in the past Cons Too easy Technically see-sawing PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: 1.5 GHz RAM: 256 MB Video Card: 3D 32 MB Disk Space: 240 MB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core QX6700 RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 8800 GTS 320MB No frills The first episode had highlighted the functionality of the graphic style that behaved well without surprising. Now several new environments will be introduced and some of the old ones will return, guaranteeing more variety albeit with a somewhat fluctuating quality. It will be difficult to see big steps forward on the visual front during the releases, if not precisely by continuing on the side of adding details and in any case always in favor of all those who do not have particularly demanding PC configurations and less use of space on the Wii. The audio is always beautiful: the music is a now consolidated tradition while the dialogues shine for dubbing and writing, with absolutely memorable passages in terms of madness and fun. The problem remains of the English language, which must be known at least to a level that allows you to read the subtitles.", "date": "2008-09-19", "grade": null}
