{"name": "LittleBigPlanet - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/littlebigplanet-recensione.html", "text": "Comment From a purely qualitative point of view, Sony has done more than right to focus on LittleBigPlanet, a splendid jewel that offers a somewhat mistreated genre lately, that of platformers, crafting it artfully and in a new way, if we want, compared to what has been seen up to now. to date. It's incredible how much fun we had in the various single and multiplayer sessions, thanks to the ingenious gimmicks and the dozens of different situations that arise every time you hold the pad in hand. But the game also has many universal qualities, starting with an exceptional level design in the story mode, moving on to a superb soundtrack and an online game integrated perfectly in all its aspects, with an editor that marks a breaking point on consoles. The title is certainly not free from imperfections nor can it affect all gamers in the same way, but Media Molecole has opened a gap, has expressed a different and innovative way of making video games, has put a plethora of winning ideas into the cauldron and has amalgamated to create his magnum opus, which all PlayStation 3 owners (or aspiring ones) should take into consideration. If he then manages to keep interest high with new content (there is already talk of Disney levels rather than some themed ones with other famous video games), LBP's longevity could be truly infinite. We fell in love with the Sackboys, also because each of us can create his own in his own image and likeness! Pro Great multiplayer and online/offline integration Unmatched level editing and sharing on consoles Excellent style and level design The Sackboys! Cons Some camera issues in multiplayer Sometimes unstable online servers However, many still wonder what exactly LittleBigPlanet is, and as a starting point we could say that it is a pure platformer, a game in which you have to show off your skills with the pad to reach the end of the level, facing jump, evading dangers such as flames and spikes, finally solving some puzzles. The protagonists of these raids are the Sackboys, rag puppets who cannot fail to inspire deep tenderness and which, we must say, we would very well see them as the official mascot of the Sony console, equal and more than other attempts tried in the past. But what's so special about these Sackboys? Their characterization, their movements, the fact that they can be ~dressed~ in thousands of different ways (but we will come back to it later), in short, they have extreme charisma, different from the ~adult~ one of other characters, but equally able to take root on a vast array of gamers, from the most ~hardcore~ to the most casual. The basic controls are the classics of the genre, you jump with the X, you cling to ledges and materials that allow it with R1, stop. With the lower backbones you begin to make these puppets more ~captivating~, in fact by pressing R2 with the right analog stick you control the right hand, the left hand instead with L2 and the left stick. With the motion sensor of the PS3 pad, however, you act on the head and body, while finally with the digital cross you control various types of facial expressions, such as those of joy, sadness, anger, to give rise to the most disparate expressions. Before delving further into the heart of this production, it is good to start with the single player, which although representing only a part, not even the majority, of the title, already denotes excellent quality. The story that connects the levels produced by Media Molecole (about fifty) sees many different dreams with different settings, connected to each other by a thin common thread, and by different equally amusing characters who speak through vignettes seasoned with sounds. The platform levels provide, as mentioned, to overcome some obstacles, reach raised platforms, operate some gears and so on, to then unlock the next ones. Everything is heavily based on physics and offers a satisfying experience in this sense, where moving objects, blowing them up, interacting with the levers will always lead to change the surrounding environment; the Sackboy jumps themselves involve an inertia in the push and landing, which especially in the beginning involves a period of learning to master them and to avoid falling easily. The level design developed for the story is extraordinary in complexity, composition and calibration, each of them is a pleasure to play, shines in variety and has an exceptional realization, made of pure 2D on three different planes, in order to increase a minimum the complexity of the levels themselves, and from a pleasant style andmodern at the same time, for a work that from an artistic point of view is impeccable in our view. Even the soundtrack stands on a very high quality, with songs that range in various genres and that blend perfectly with the setting, and with an excellent dubbing in Italian for all the tutorials. In each level there are different objects to collect, first of all some keys needed to unlock the mini-games connected to each setting, some of which are absolutely hilarious such as jumping rope (revisited in a ~Sackboyish~ key) and the push-car race. For the rest it is possible to find spheres located in the most unthinkable places, in such a way as to increase one's score, and other bubbles with decorations, stickers, materials, objects of various kinds inside them which increase those at one's disposal for the editor, which we will discuss shortly. To reach the canonical 100% it is therefore necessary to face the same pattern several times, and there are also some puzzles that require resolution with at least two or more players. Why yes, LittleBigPlanet is a title that also focuses heavily on the multiplayer phase, both locally and online for up to four people, where tackling the levels in a cooperative becomes even more fun, sometimes hilarious. Not to mention the fun of sharing the same experience with other people, taking a picture thanks to the tool present, mocking that of your partner with your Sackboy, perhaps slapping him with the appropriate possibility made available by the control system. All in an almost indistinguishable way both offline and online, thanks to the presence in the second case of voice and text chat, always useful for increasing identification and shortening distances. Each level is also equipped with an online ranking, there is also the possibility of inviting users from your friends list, managing who to introduce into the game and so on, according to a perfectly integrated scheme that is becoming more and more popular (finally) also on PlayStation 3 In reality, the gaming experience always and in any case starts from the so-called pod, a sort of transparent room in which it is possible to decide what to do, and perhaps host three other people to organize themselves. It is also the right place to smear your environment with the most disparate objects and decorations, or customize your Sackboy with the thousands of possible combinations for head, eyes, skin, accessories and so on, accessible from the menu that appears superimposed by pressing the square button, and from which you can also access all the remaining options of the title. Obviously it is possible to create random combinations for the clothing, often already beautiful in themselves, and save the ones you like best, in order to recall them at a later time. Find your level! To date, there are already about 100,000 levels created by users and, despite having different tools and search filters available, it is not always easy to juggle those that really deserve (and we assure you that there are some fantastic ones!) or among the clear examples of what should never be in a video game. In this regard, various sites/blogs/forums are proliferating with lists of the most interesting and amusing ones, perhaps unknown, or of one's own creations. As a starting point we point out the special topic maintained by the users of our forum, while on the foreign side there are interesting things about Neogaf and Ugo. A good starting point to explore the infinite facets of the levels developed by the most creative gamers! We edit everything! The editor is the other focal point of the game, the forge from which to start to give full rein to your creativity and, why not, immerse yourself as a protagonist in the community that revolves around it. LittleBigPlanet's one falls under the classic heading ~easy to learn, hard to master~ because it offers an impressive set of tools to create levels in which only the time that can be spent rather than ideas can act as a limit. A plethora of videos act as tutorials for each feature or function, and by viewing them all you are already able to create something interesting. In fact, the creation mode allows your Sackboy to hover in the air to quickly reach all points of the work area, first of all you choose a background (among those unlocked in the story or a background color), with parameters such as brightness, contrast, fog and so on, at this point you can start throwing something down by choosing a material from those available and starting to shape the desired shapes, applying decorations on them, smoothing corners, gluing various gears together, and so on. All placed objects remain suspended as long as you remain in the menu, but it should be remembered that the game is entirely based on physics, and therefore each of them interacts with gravity and with adjacent objects. With the editor it is possible to create just about everything, with jumps, gears, levers, explosive charges to detonate and everything available in your bag, also made up of pre-packaged objects (including rockets for example) and those that are also acquired by schematics posted by other users. To make everything more ~alive~, there is also the possibility of inserting music tracks, sound effects in certain passages or after some actions (on passage, impact and so on, also choosing the activation range) or even create objects and ~sentient~ characters able to speak (setting the written text) and to interact with the player, perhaps to create up to four levels with their own story and reachable only after completing the previous ones. We edit everything! In any case, it is impossible to explain in a few lines everything that the LittleBigPlanet editor makes available, to instantly understand its power, just think that all the levels created by the developers were created with this same tool, and it is therefore to be commended how Media Molecole has managed to make the same possibilities of action available to the end user. There are obviously limitations, such as the impossibility of importing any image from a USB stick or hard disk, rather than inserting new external music files (both things for copyright reasons) but we can say that, as far as we have seen up to now in terms qualitative and numerical, there are dozens and dozens of levels that are absolutely worth trying. The developer has also ensured that in the near future it will be possible to create levels directly online together with three other players, and we can already imagine what the positive effects of this introduction could be. To complete the interactive package around the levels, we point out the possibility of stamping some labels to define them, vote them according to a five-star rating, leave a text comment and assign a heart to add them to your favorites, and then access them faster later. Hearts that can also be attached to users, to then find all their creations. In this sense there is a convenient search function with various filters and also specific text, we must say however that in this case the results are not very accurate, even by entering the exact name of the level to be searched, in fact dozens of results are returned, with the desired one perhaps not even immediately accessible... be careful of the names you give to your creations therefore, ~XXX of Doom~ will be very difficult to make famous! Someone will wonder if LittleBigPlanet has flaws or imperfections and, especially in the second case, God forbid that it doesn't have them. The control system, as mentioned, requires a period of learning to master the inertia and physics in the jumps and to get used to the three depth levels of the levels, the camera in multiplayer games sometimes acts bizarrely. In fact, the concept is that the four players, for example, can remain on the screen up to a certain range, after which those outside have five seconds to be able to return within the view, on pain of death and rebirth at the next checkpoint. Well, sometimes it's not clear which player the camera is fixed on, and you risk making a mess especially in levels that are not perfectly structured. As far as online is concerned, especially in the first few days there have been several problems with the servers and disconnections, problems which in any case are gradually decreasing. During our tests, with a Fastweb connection, most of the time we didn't encounter any, while sometimes we happened to start a user level with discrete jerks and accelerations, to synchronize after a few seconds with the other adventure companions. LittleBigPlanet is therefore a package that owes its high-sounding rating to the perfect mix of all the elements that characterize it, those who do not have the possibility to take advantage of the network connection or to play together with other people, even locally, would be faced with a single excellent player (but little more than enough longevity), but also an unfinished work, which it would be a shame not to appreciate in its entirety and in its captivating ideas.", "date": "2008-11-19", "grade": null}
