Many times these are titles bordering on educational software, which focus so much on the message that they lose sight of their game structure. In rarer cases, these productions manage to find a balance between historical and cultural reenactment and a real videogame offer, carving a functioning gameplay in a scenario steeped in traditions, civilizations and history, as we see in this review of Raji: An Ancient Epic . The work of Nodding Head Games, a development team from Pune, India, exploits the magic of Indian legends and philosophies to build an interactive story that is also a good action adventure. In this case, the charm of the background is fundamental in the construction of the game, but it is not the only element that characterizes its identity. The scenario, which derives elements from ancient Indian mythologies and makes evident its adherence to this imaginary, is pervasive and characterizing but it is not overwhelming compared to a game structure that in any case works regardless of the search for the exotic. In this sense, the idea of Nodding Head has been well developed, managing to create a title that not only pays homage to local traditions and can also work as a way to promote them in the world, but does so without forgetting to be first of all a good video game. The title was released two and a half years ago on PC and console, also passed through Xbox Game Pass and similar services, but now also arrives on mobile platforms within the Netflix catalog, representing another excellent choice from the service. which proves to be decidedly well cared for. Raji's Big Adventure Raji: An Ancient Epic transports us to scenarios inspired by Indian mythology Young Raji is, as is often the case in this genre of stories, humanity's last hope against the overwhelming evil. The story of Raji: An Ancient Epic is ancient and not ashamed of it, since it is a sort of narrative archetype connected to Indian and mythological traditions. The fight between demons and gods is a sort of immortal topos that always works optimally to serve as the premise for a great adventure: in this case, the demons have decided to invade the Earth, threatening the very existence of humans for a moment of vengeance against the gods who had defeated them centuries ago. In a civilization now too accustomed to peace, which has abandoned the ways of alchemy and combat, all hopes are focused on Raji, the only one who still seems able to dominate magic and special abilities. In a magical context, which recalls ancient texts such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, we find ourselves controlling Raji in a classic action adventure in the third person, in which the ability between platforms is fundamental, but also the skills in combat and in solving puzzles. There is something of Tomb Raider and classic platformers in the interaction with the scenarios, which requires us to jump between handholds and platforms to advance between natural wonders and ancient architecture inspired by Rajasthan. Raji features combat, puzzles and platforming action The gameplay is composite and iridescent, also modifying the framing when it comes to focusing on tactical combats that require careful use of the different spells, or when the puzzles to be solved are put in the foreground. The problem is that, precisely by virtue of this mixture of styles, the game basically fails to excel in any of its components and especially in combat. Despite a not exactly ingenious level design, moving around the scenarios is still pleasant thanks to the beauty of the settings, facilitated by the mystical sources of inspiration. However, the clash with enemies is probably the element that can be more easily clumsy and less developed than the components more related to platforms and interaction with the environment, even in terms of puzzles. These defects are amplified by the virtual stick control system on mobile platforms, although the response to the commands is still of a good standard, compared to the standards of this solution.", "date": "2023-04-16", "grade": "7.5"}
