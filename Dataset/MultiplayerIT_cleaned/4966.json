This time it's a sort of stealth with RPG elements, but everything still tied to the use of cards to be placed on a sort of ideal table. We therefore find ourselves having to move our main card (the thief, in fact), following a path to try to get out of the table, thus fleeing from guards, traps and various enemies, possibly also carrying the loot with us. This is the classic example game that is much more difficult to explain than to play, as always happens when dealing with strict rules and variables to take into consideration. To be honest, the first impact is rather disorienting and unfortunately the tutorial fails to dispel the fog that covers the contours of the game rules, proving to be a little too hasty in introducing the main elements. The only way to figure out what to do is then to commit yourself and try, in this way the first minutes of the real game will be a considerable chaos, but when you begin to learn the deep dynamics of Card Thief something clicks, and the attraction due to its so rigid but also stratified structure it emerges with arrogance. In short, there is a first period of acclimatization to go through which may not be congenial to everyone, before being able to appreciate it: the hermeticism that characterizes Card Thief, its almost esoteric symbolism does not make it a welcoming game for everyone, but the particular characterization can help to captivate the less patient user, giving an additional chance to this title, which it certainly deserves. Stealth action and cards: a possible combination, it seems Cards and thieves In short, we find ourselves operating on a table where nine cards are laid out, one of which is represented by the thief who is the protagonist of the action. The other cards can be represented by guards, enemies of various types, traps, treasures and elements of the scenario. The aim is to reach the card that represents the exit by composing paths with the thief, who will have to try to move from one position to another on the grid by stealing as much as possible and avoiding clashes with enemies. A numerical value indicates the level of protection of the thief from sight, and decreases according to the disposition of the visual cone of the guards, proximity to sources of light (always represented by specific cards) and traps or situations that force you to make noise. The sense is therefore to keep this level higher than that of the guards in order to win battles and conquer new treasures, trying to sneak up to the exit of the level by studying the best routes to take to maintain the stealth approach and without being able to cross the drawn trajectory. To provide a further element of variety, there are also the cards (up to a maximum of three) which can be used to change some of them on the table and which determine new possible solutions. Said like this it seems to make little sense, but as reported above this is a game that simply requires to be played, otherwise it is practically incomprehensible, an impression which, moreover, can persist even after having played more than one game. Once you understand the basic mechanics, which certainly could also have been explained a little better during the introductory phase, it is very easy to get carried away by Card Thief and its particular medieval and stylized world.", "date": "2017-03-30", "grade": "8.2"}
