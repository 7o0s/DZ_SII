{"name": "Star Wars: The Clone Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-the-clone-wars_a.html", "text": "Recently released in Italian cinemas, ~Star Wars: The Clone Wars~ is an animated feature film that is placed chronologically between Episode II and Episode III. The story takes up the most famous characters of the saga (therefore Obi-Wan, Anakyn, etc.) and sees them fight the splinter forces who want to blame the Jedi for having kidnapped Jabba the Hutt's son. In reality, the new title developed by THQ Wireless is presented as a tie-in only on paper: the various missions in which we will be protagonists will have nothing to do with what is told in the film, apart from the forces in the field represented by the army of the Clones and the droid army. At the command of the former, we will find ourselves moving within a series of locations to complete fundamentally simple missions, which involve reaching a point on the map or eliminating all the enemies present. Once the game has started, we will therefore find ourselves controlling an entire team of Clones using the d-pad of the mobile phone. The controls are relative to the screen and are relatively innovative: we will see an indicator around the group and we will be able to rotate its direction by pressing the d-pad left and right, while pressing it up or down the characters will move forward or backward. The combat system works mostly automatically: as soon as enemies are within range, our team will start targeting them until they are all eliminated. A variation on the theme is represented by the grenades, which can be collected within the stages and launched when we deem it most appropriate, by pressing the 5 key: an ideal maneuver when the opponents are really numerous. Although the range of action of the Clones is greater than that of the Droids, during the clashes it is advisable to reach cover to suffer less damage, with our group that will automatically crouch and lean only to shoot, at the right time. As mentioned above, the missions are mainly based on moving from point A to point B on the map, with an indicator on the screen that will show us the direction in which we need to move. The technical realization of the game alternates ups and downs: on the one hand we have a good design of the characters and above all excellent ships, as well as a discreet use of colors to differentiate the locations; on the other hand, the graphic elements in the background repeat themselves too often, and the maps in general don't shine, indeed they have a generally mediocre appearance. The scrolling of the screen is well made, even if not very fluid, and the effects of the weapons are discreet: if you expect a spectacular visual impact, you will be disappointed. As far as the sound sector is concerned, as usual, the Star Wars tie-ins enjoy a natural advantage represented by the music of John Williams, present here in a MIDI version of acceptable quality. The controls respond promptly to inputs, and the particular layout of the commands is assimilated rather quickly.
