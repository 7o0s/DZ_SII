{"name": "Kickbeat", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/128058-kickbeat-un-tono-marziale.html", "text": "Kickbeat is a swirl of kicks in time with the music. In the Zen Studios title, our character is at the center of the stage and is ready to fight strings of enemies who come forward from four directions to attack us to the rhythm of the song on duty. Our task, or rather that of the pseudo Bruce Lee who plays the role of protagonist, is to hit the enemies at the exact moment in which they assume the attack position in order to neutralize them. For each successful hit, points accumulate while otherwise our vitality bar decreases until Game Over. This is a rather atypical mechanic for a music game but although KickBeat mixes fighting games and rhythm games, the controls are quite simple. The four directional arrows allow you to launch an attack in the respective directions while the space and the shift, for those using the keyboard, respectively activate the chi power and the power ups that we have collected by beating opponents marked by symbols that indicate the type of bonus obtainable. Music and martial arts mix again in the revised PC version of Kickbeat A swirl of blows The primary aim of Kickbeat is to get alive to the end of the levels, each of which is bound to a specific song and graphic style, and achieve high scores in survival mode. The ultimate goal, the one that really matters, is to ring in the longest possible combos in order to maximize the score in each frame. After completing the game with Lee, the main character who recalls Bruce Lee contaminated by the myth of Elvis, it becomes possible to complete it also with his female counterpart, a graceful but unfortunate damsel forced to face a higher degree of difficulty. And Kickbeat is not easy, even on a normal level. The relative poverty of the gameplay and the simplicity of the control system are counterbalanced by the very tight timing required to deal blows to enemies who are in the right position for only a fraction of a second. Wrong time means receiving a blow and losing vitality while each empty blow generates fatigue even going so far as to incapacitate our fighter. Also, Kickbeat is designed to confuse our senses. Unlike other music games, only part of the rhythm translates into gameplay while part of the song becomes a distraction and the basic rhythm, although recognizable, is not that easy to follow while the focus is on the enemies about to hit us. Furthermore, to complicate matters further, there is also the mode of approaching enemies. In fact, these arrive in quantity and take a few steps around us before attacking us, making it difficult, when the screen fills up with henchmen ready to strike, to understand who will attack first. And finally, there are also the enemies that attack at the same time and you need to have near perfect timing to avoid the attack of one of the two while taking down the other. The result is a title that is by no means simple, especially at the beginning, which becomes quite complicated as the difficulty level rises and which becomes almost a nightmare once the second character is unlocked. Kung Fu Fighting Thankfully, there's a light in Kickbeat to guide us through a mess that includes awkward camera switches implemented to confuse us. The order of attack of the enemies and the possible need to hold down the arrow key to deliver a blow, are signaled to us by clearly visible colored indicators even if, as we said, everything happens in a fraction of a second and, at high difficulties , it is practically impossible to finish a painting without studying its specific pattern. A not particularly fresh setting even if mechanics of this type are the basis of the longevity of rhythm games and, although incorporating them in a rather simplistic way, Kickbeat enriches them with martial arts which also include character fatigue. Furthermore, we must consider the chi power and the power ups that further enrich the pot allowing us to eliminate many enemies together, as happens with the shock wave, or to erect a protective shield that can be very useful in case of mistakes made when the number of enemies lining up to slap us is quite high. It is clear that these are not revolutionary ideas but the mix is fresh and works adequately while also incorporating a fair degree of challenge. The picture, in essence, is positive and the Steam version of Kickbeat is better than the one for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita thanks to the addition of aesthetic refinements, six extra songs, cloud saves and a general balance of gameplay. Novelty certainly not explodedsive but welcome even if they make up for all the shortcomings of a title which is certainly not perfect and which lacks above all in terms of variety. Furthermore, even if the animations are good and the cartoon style isn't bad, the cutscenes are rather dull, they don't enhance the martial component and lack bite, thus resulting incapable, despite this being their task, of breaking the monotony inherent in the title gameplay. The music, on the other hand, isn't bad, especially considering the low price, and the playlist is rich even if there is a feature of the title that makes this type of consideration superfluous. The simplicity of Kickbeat, in fact, has a significant advantage and that is to allow the import of any song. The gameplay of the game, on the other hand, is based exclusively on the rhythm and this is extrapolated automatically for each song entered by the player. In short, if you own Kung Fu Fighting you already know what to do even if before having access to importing the songs you will have to successfully face the first four levels of the campaign.", "date": "2014-02-03", "grade": "S.V."}
