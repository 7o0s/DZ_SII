The most important element of this umpteenth freemium for iOS and Android naturally lies in the roster, which thanks to the expedient of space-time anomalies provides us with various versions of the robots originally produced by Takara but transformed by the American Hasbro into a global phenomenon. We will therefore begin our journey at the controls of the classic Optimus Prime, but we will gradually be able to unlock many other characters, both with the traditional design and with that, frankly not irresistible, of the films of Michael Bay. Our team, initially composed of three elements, will therefore see the presence of Autobots such as Mirage, Sideswipe, Ratchet and of course Bumblebee, but also of ~alternative~ Decepticons, coming from dimensions in which they are not devoted to evil, such as Starscream, Megatron and even Motormaster, the very badass leader of the Stunticons. In short, the developers have winked as much as possible to the nostalgics and fans of the Transformers, developing in this case a freemium system that allows you to play for several hours without having to worry about the energy of the action (which is consumed with each fight) or grinding, a factor inevitably present during the more advanced stages. In addition to the clashes, there is also room for an interesting management phase with a view to possible invasions between users, with a base made up of joints that we can have as many robots supervise and improve in various ways, making life difficult for those who decide to challenge us. Transformers: Fighters is a solid and fun gestural fighting game, with many iconic characters Rise of the Robots So we come to the core of Transformers: Fighters, namely the one-on-one fights. The long single player campaign, while enriched by a good outline of alternative modes, will see us explore a series of maps and face increasingly stronger opponents relying on the elements of our team (freely modifiable and upgradeable in individual robots through the use of the loot and traditional coins) and on the respective energy bars, which can only be restored through the use of specific objects. A ~survival~ approach not new to this kind of product, but which can count on more advanced fighting game mechanics than the aforementioned Marvel: Challenge of Champions and its multiple clones. The attack combinations that are performed by touching the right side of the screen and dragging your finger horizontally are in fact assisted by spectacular transformations into a vehicle that allow you to break the enemy's guard, as well as shots with a firearm where our character is in a certain distance from the target. There is also no shortage of lateral discards, which literally add depth to the gameplay, and the specials, regulated by an indicator located in the lower part of the screen and fills up as we fight. The degree of challenge grows progressively, but without jolts or nasty surprises, so as mentioned you can play for a few hours without making big problems about the power of your characters. An excellent job has been done by Kabam also as regards the technical aspect, with an excellent design for the Transformers and a good set of animations which, however, seem to suffer from the general heaviness of the graphics, losing a few too many frames even on devices of last generation: we hope that the next updates will smooth out the action a little more.", "date": "2017-04-12", "grade": "8.0"}
