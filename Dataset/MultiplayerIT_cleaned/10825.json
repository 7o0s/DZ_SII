{"name": "Nerf N-Strike - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nerf-n-strike-recensione.html", "text": "Nerf N-Strike is part of the new line of software wanted by Electronic Arts born to meet the needs of the public who has recently approached the world of video games, especially made up of the little ones. Nintendo Wii is obviously the platform that has brought about the greatest commercial ~revolution~ in the field of video games in recent years, and it is precisely on this console that the major efforts of the American manufacturer are concentrated with its line called ~EA Casual~. The Hasbro franchise of NERF guns is very popular in the United States, and someone has well thought of creating a virtual version for the Nintendo home console. Virtual, but not too much, since the full-bodied game package also contains a real NERF Switch Shot EXE-3 gun capable of shooting foam bullets! Nerf N-Strike is a meta video game, in two senses. First of all, it is made for playing with friends, all together, with the console off: the NERF gun included in the package is real and contains three bullets (soft and harmless) to be loaded from the front, but once you get tired of using it for lawns and living rooms, it is It is possible to detach the upper part of the weapon, insert the Nintendo Wii remote control and continue to challenge each other in the virtual world, through the television screen. The same game narrates the deeds of some NERF-loving kids who are recruited to fight the forces of evil, thanks to their particular skills as snipers developed by playing with toy guns. And this is the second reason why Nerf N-Strike is a video game within a game (and vice versa, given the narrative plot). The story is merely a pretext to start shooting aliens and futuristic robots, within well-choreographed, automatic camera-driven levels. Nerf N-Strike is a big Luna Park sideshow: in fact, it resembles a sort of pre-established route to be faced with a gun in hand, just like some fairground attractions sometimes offer. The view inside the level, in fact, is not free but guided by the CPU which frames, zooms and advances freely, leaving us the task of shooting and shooting down enemies before they hit us and lower our defense shield. The game action is limited to firing with good aim and timing, nothing else. A bit limited, but on the other hand the EA title doesn't aspire to be a classic first person shoot'em up. All on the Luna Park train, but armed to the teeth The view, in fact, is the one common to all Doom-style shooters, with the character's hand and weapon clearly visible in the center of the screen. The movement of the gun is well coordinated with that of the hand holding the remote control, mapping the aim and movements of the wrist in near real time. It's easy to aim at enemies, but also because you never encounter major difficulties as you progress through the adventure. The game is calibrated for a rather young age, it is never difficult or too complicated in the situations to be faced, resulting very linear and easy. During the various schemes to be faced it is possible to recover many NERF models, which are gradually added to our personal collection and remain selectable for subsequent missions. The collection of various rifles is another fundamental component of Nerf N-Strike. The various models, all with different functions and with adjustable rates of fire, must be known to choose according to the level to be faced. The challenges are quite varied, proposing different situations that go beyond the mere destruction of the enemy. There are levels where you have to hit only certain colors, saving the rest; others in which buildings have to be demolished, with even convincing physics; still others where you have to eliminate the highest number of robots in a given time. There are more than 25 different shotguns to choose from, and each one has distinct characteristics that you need to know how to exploit. Of Aliens, Boom Blox and Doom Nerf N-Strike boasts a respectable technical achievement, considering the range of audiences to which it is dedicated and its intentions of unpretentious rail shooter. The futuristic and well-detailed levels have an Alien-style 80s sci-fi movie look, recalling the good old Doom on several occasions. More than one effect is appreciated on the screen: excellent explosions, very well made shadows on objects and walls, transparencies, smoke, particles and finally a convincing and fun physics that is well applied to the gameplay of some missions and sometimes recalls the good Boom Blox, also by Electronic Arts. The polygonal count is fair, even if the definition of the image leaves something to be desired with little textureco various and many playlists (they are very noticeable on a high definition TV, with a console connected in component. Much less with Scart RGB on a cathode ray tube). In Nerf N-Strike there is obviously also a full-bodied multiplayer mode, in which up to 4 participants equipped with remote control and gun can be challenged. Through a good selection of levels (even if the variety of settings leaves something to be desired, resulting almost all similar) you can challenge each other until the last shot of NERF. The interlude scenes are not particularly brilliant, which, although they are well acted by the voice actors (it is in English, in the tested version), are drawn with a very unattractive style, reminiscent of amateur productions and B series cartoons. The sound sector is anonymous, and apart from some looped music that is well suited to the sci-fi atmosphere of the game, sounds and soundtracks are few and repetitive. Finally, there is no online mode, rankings or multiplayer via the internet. Comment Nerf N-Strike is a video game purely dedicated to the little ones, who will find lots of fun in the Electronic Arts product, challenging friends both on and off the TV screen thanks to the substantial packaging that also contains a real NERF gun. The game itself is well done but gives in to the overly guided structure that leaves the player with almost no other choice than to aim and shoot. Nerf N-Strike is designed to be played by both those who are passionate about NERF rifles and those who don't have much experience with classic shooters and want an easy-to-use game with immediate fun. The technical realization is excellent, a pity for the monotony of settings and sound sector. Pros Easy and immediate, ideal for little ones Lots of guns to collect in the game The package contains a real NERF gun Cons Little variety in the environments and enemies Too easy for the most savvy players Anonymous sound compartment", "date": "2009-03-13", "grade": null}
