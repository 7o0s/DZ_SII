{"name": "God of War: Betrayal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/god-of-war-betrayal.html", "text": "If you are reading these lines, and you have never played a title in the God of War series, you should immediately turn off your computer and run to your trusted dealer. The franchise created by Santa Monica Studios and produced by Sony has in fact been unanimously acclaimed as an authentic masterpiece of the action genre, as well as an obligatory addition to the collection of every Ps2 user. And so, while the brand is expanding with episodes awaited for Psp and, more prospectively, for Ps3, the protagonist Kratos has chosen our beloved cell phones as the scene of an exclusive episode specially created for this gaming platform. Yes, because God of War: Betrayal is a completely new title that is placed chronologically between the two chapters that appeared on Ps2, thus filling the plot hole immediately following the defeat of Ares. The structure of the gameplay obviously abandons the rich three-dimensional component to rely instead on a more manageable 2d; moreover, the exploratory phase, although still present thanks also to the good level design, has been put into the background thus shifting the balance towards a more platform game mechanic, which in some respects brings Betrayal closer to a 16-bit console product than few years ago. And so controlling Kratos means running from one part of the level to another dodging traps, jumping from platform to platform, grabbing onto ledges and, of course, taking out hundreds of enemies. In fact, if the God of War saga has reached its current popularity, it is also and above all thanks to the brutality of the fights, enhanced by a refined control system and absolutely exhilarating combo management. On mobile phones, the programmers have tried to do everything possible to maintain the same sensations, but inevitably the compromises they had to make took away a lot from the final result. In fact, the battles are practically reduced only to the repeated pressure of the attack button, an operation that is more than enough to get the better of most of the enemies present. Once weakened or rendered harmless, they can also be killed in a bloody way by pressing the arrows indicated on the screen; even if, it must be said, the small size of the sprites (including Kratos) make the various mutilations, slaughters, beheadings and cruelties with which the protagonist is guilty less enjoyable. The management of one's inventory of weapons and spells is questionable, which instead of using two separate keys for their selection, refer to a single button; being able to extract the right magic in particularly crowded situations thus becomes practically impossible, and at the end of the matter you will find yourself always and only using the Athena Blade, or the main weapon. From a technical point of view, as we wrote just above, the field of vision rather far from the action if on the one hand allows you to have a greater awareness of the surrounding environment, on the other it reduces the size of the characters thus removing detail and spectacularity from the fights; also disappointing is the absence of bosses of considerable size, as is the tradition of the series, since they all appear to be slightly larger than the protagonist. To compensate for these aspects, the animations contribute at least partially, really rich and fluid especially for Kratos; nothing to complain about the settings, however, well made and with an excellent variety. The sound is all in all good, even if with the terminal we used (Nokia 6290) there were annoying slowdowns in the action that forced us to have to deactivate it. Finally, the dozen levels available guarantee at least sufficient longevity. PRO Fun Good graphics component Faithful in some respects to the series... AGAINST ...but very little for others Limited combat system Awkward management of weapons and spells", "date": "2007-08-13", "grade": "S.V."}
