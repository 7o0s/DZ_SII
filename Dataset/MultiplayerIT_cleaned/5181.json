{"name": "Un'avventura in VR", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/176139-loading-human-unavventura-in-vr.html", "text": "More than a year has passed since we had the opportunity to get our hands on the visionary project by Flavio Parenti and his very Italian Untold Games for the first time. It was E3 2015 and on that occasion Project Morpheus, the peripheral that would later become PlayStation VR was starting to timidly appear next to the much more famous Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. From that moment on, the game has returned to hiding in the back of development with only a few scraps of information distributed through official channels until the announcement of its release date capable of making it one of the launch titles for Sony's headset. In reality, the game is also compatible for the other two peripherals dedicated to virtual reality but in recent months it has undergone an important transformation as regards its narrative arc. From a complete and self-contained video game it has turned into an episodic product whose commercial implications are not known, much less the timing or more concretely the number of chapters that will make up the project. We only know that now it is correct to talk about Loading Human: Chapter 1 and that by paying out the  39.99 needed to download it on PlayStation 4 or PC we will have access only and exclusively to this first part. But calm down because it is a fairly complete experience: the final cliffhanger is obviously present but it will not leave you hanging with that typical style of Telltale Games productions (The Walking Dead and the very recent Batman - The Telltale Series for example), but you will feel satisfied with what you were told during the scarce three hours needed to complete the adventure. And above all you will perceive that you have had enough because unfortunately Loading Human combines a rather banal story with a control system that is at times devastating for the gaming experience in VR and above all a gameplay that, despite some interesting ideas, is mortified by very few interactions and from a chronic lack of enjoyment. Loading Human is a graphic adventure for VR with some good ideas but bad gameplay What happens, happens badly The incipit of the narrative is as pleasant as trite. The game is set in a sometimes dystopian future: human civilization has progressed at a dizzying pace thanks to some of your father's discoveries who, among other things, managed to increase man's longevity beyond all known limits. One fine day you will be invited by him to his base in Antarctica and you will discover that his research has gone far beyond what you would have ever imagined and that in a very distant place in the universe there is hidden an inexhaustible source of energy, the Quintessence, which it could allow the man to solve all his energy problems and your father to pass the threshold of 120 years of life. Your task will therefore be to assist for two years in the construction of a carrier rocket that will take you into space and then make a very long round trip, asleep in cryogenic sleep. Obviously between saying and doing there is the sea, in this case represented by a girl, Alice, who will share the cramped living space of the polar base with you. The story is narrated through a long flashback and we will be able to influence its development simply by moving within the structure, given that Loading Human, rather than being a classic graphic adventure, is part of the so-called ~walking simulators~ with the variant of the first view person linked to virtual reality and the interactions that can be performed through the pad or the devices for detecting movements. In fact, there is no inventory and all the objects that can be collected or with which we can interact can simply be transported from one place to another or at least combined with each other with the help of the protagonist's two hands. There are also a couple of really basic puzzles but for most of the game you'll just move from one room to another according to the requests of your father, Alice or the artificial intelligence that runs the place, in these very long walks that they often result in tedious and toothless backtracking where you can't even courier. The main problem of the game lies in the management of the commands. Loading Human can be played either with the DualShock 4 (or any other joypad on PC) or with the PlayStation Move or, in the case of Vive, with 3D controllers. These last two possibilities are highly recommended for a matter of involvement but in all cases we will have to deal with a really embarrassing control system. In fact, the title should be played sitting downi and will force us to make a whole series of unnatural movements to move in 3D space with the controllers to be raised, lowered or oriented around and behind us and with the teleportation mechanism already seen in several other titles. In practice we will only be able to turn around by a very few degrees by moving our head but to make larger rotations we will have to point the Move and press the upper button to teleport the character to the new visual angle. It is easier to see than to explain and in this sense we strongly advise you to see the Games Room featured in the article to get a more precise idea. This control ploy is usually used to minimize even the motion sickness typical of experiences (badly developed) in VR. The problem is that nevertheless Loading Human is among the games that most made us feel nauseous thanks to often ~automatic~ movements and this control system that really separates the player's brain from what happens on the screen. And it's a shame given that the title offers a handful of situations in which what we can do with our avatar is really believable and well recreated and there are also moments of wonder despite making banal gestures such as lighting candles, beard, insert a record into a record player or kiss a person. Playstation 4 trophies Loading Human: Chapter 1 offers sixteen trophies. Three are silver and are linked to completing the game, collecting all collectibles and watching the sex scene which can be unlocked with certain actions. The other thirteen are all bronze and relate both to the completion of the various chapters that make up the plot and to specific actions that can be carried out at certain times. A beautiful world does not await us in the future Also on the technical front Loading Human presents important uncertainties. Outside of a truly basic aesthetic sector made up of environments with simple geometry that still have their own consistency with the concept of a research station lost in the Antarctic, there are obvious limitations in terms of textures of objects and characters. In particular, the latter have robotic animations both in the body and in the face and give back a too old-fashioned feeling. More generally, this Chapter 1 catapults us into the previous generation of consoles from a graphic point of view and the justification of a PlayStation VR or any other virtual reality viewer that necessarily reduces the graphic performance of the console (or of the computer) is of little use ) and therefore forces the usual compromises to have a perfectly fluid rendering. Aliasing is also very visible and sometimes, moving the head too much, there is a noticeable pop-in effect. During our review session we then noticed a tendency for the game to lose its positioning calibration. Nothing serious is clear since it can be solved with the press of a button, but during longer games having to constantly set the center of the observation point because otherwise the main character does not move correctly in a straight line can be annoying. The audio sector takes care of saving the technical aspect thanks to an excellent soundtrack made up of rock and electronic songs, also sung and a well-interpreted dubbing in Italian.", "date": "2016-11-08", "grade": "6.0"}
