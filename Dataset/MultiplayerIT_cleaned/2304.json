{"name": "Dal tramonto all'alba", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dal-tramonto-allalba.html", "text": "Nobody touches Seth Cain Fom Dusk Till Dawn is nothing more than a third-person arcade (with the alternative of subjective view that can be activated at any time) set in a prison-fortress ship. Even if the first impression is that of a title with adventure features, after a few minutes of playing you realize that you are dealing with, as mentioned, an arcade. In the game you will play Seth, protagonist of the film of the same name, 3 days after his (apparently) unjust execution due to the advice of an unfortunate lawyer. Nobody touches Seth Cain It all begins just as Seth is having an animated discussion with his lawyer Bruce Keinfeld, inside the cell; the sympathetic lawyer doesn't seem to have much at heart about our hero's future (if not the payment of the fee) and everything suggests that Seth won't see the sun rise for much longer... but the unexpected is lurking... In Rising Sun (this is the name of the prison ship) executions are the order of the day, and just today in fact Scott Wilson, apparently one of the many bad guys of the place, is about to be executed without pity. In reality, luck is smiling on the young Scott: in fact, a new load of prisoners apparently equal to all the others arrives on the ship, and the director is intent on pleasantly warning them that from that moment on, their rights as human beings will disappear. completely... Nobody touches Seth Cain What the good director can't know is that the load of prisoners is actually a group of vampires, quite angry and bloodthirsty (could it have been otherwise?). In a few minutes the shady types, led by none other than Scott's brother, Clarence Wilson, operate a mutiny second in the history of the Navy only to that of the Bounty (quote from the original manual), but luckily our Seth, who manages to escape from the cell thanks to an explosion, has already had to deal with vampires at the Tweety Twister and can perhaps be frightened by a group of bloodsuckers? Of course he can... but he still has no other way than to try to escape to freedom. Vampires, what a passion The enemies you will meet are sufficient in number to be considered quite ~various~, even if much more could certainly be done. We start with the classic vampires, former prisoners with 2 holes in the neck, very easy to kill. Then we have Guardians, Mechanics and Claws; right the latter could create some problems for you due to the speed of movement and the middle finger turned into a sharp and deadly blade. Unfortunately, even later the level of the monsters will not improve except in rare cases, such as for example the toothed predators due to their invisibility, and it cannot be said that, except at the highest levels of difficulty, they will create great problems for you. However, you will have already guessed what the first big problem of FDTD is.. the extreme ease combined with a really poor longevity.. the game won't take you more than a few days of even intense gameplay, and it's really a shame because it makes it a extremely limited play. This limitation is unfortunately not only in the length of the game, but also in the game itself. In fact, for most of the game the only thing you have to do is give yourself up to the merry massacre of bloodsuckers, i. abound (albeit within limits). Vampires, what a passion In fact, we must add graphics that are not convincing at all and really give the idea of having been created in a hasty and superficial way without paying attention to the details. Leaving aside the problems that the engine sometimes encounters (especially when Seth and a vampire are very close) the characters themselves (and monsters) are of rather mediocre quality; ee animations themselves often make you shiver and not for the electrifying tone of Seth's voice.. A little better let's go with the ~general~ movements, especially those of the monsters, which have their own credibility; the characters are instead unwatchable while they run or gesticulate, made really badly and animated even worse. The sound deserves a separate discussion, which, if we exclude some passages, generally does not disappoint and contributes, if nothing else, to increasing that feeling of continuous precariousness. Hearing a clawed grunt (editor's note: what direction does an aclawed?) before it pops out from the ceiling or from behind a door it manages to transmit those sensations it should, and therefore fulfills its task, even if the variety of sound effects leaves something to be desired.. But perhaps the worst aspect of FDTD is undoubtedly linked to the gameplay. Let's start from the objects that Seth will find on his path: they are very few, both in terms of general number and categories. In fact, they are limited to refills for the various weapons, and to the (very few) medical kits that will take our hero out of a critical situation several times. Vampires, what a passion Let's move on to another crucial aspect in games of this type (although usually more sought after in RPGs): the linearity-nonlinearity of the plot. Reluctantly I must admit that I have never seen a plot as linear as that of FDTD; the actions are always obligatory, the path already defined and it often seems to be in a story that would go on almost by itself, even without our digital alter ego of George Clooney. Let's move on to the variety of situations found in the game; as already said before, practically NOTHING. FDTD is a long journey from Seth's cell to freedom that goes from vampire slaying to vampire slaying, occasionally interspersed with vampire slaying. , but honestly there is a limit to everything and the frustration comes shortly .. The only touch of diversity you will face in some sections, no more than 3-4 in the whole game, in which you will be at the ~commands~ of a machine gun rather than a sniper rifle and you will have to, for a change, slaughter enemies who arrive en masse. Vampires, what a passion In short, nothing particularly innovative .. but the worst of itself is the game in the ~quests~; the ease of the latter is really embarrassing (I often thought it was a trap or something like that given the elementary nature of the thing) and lets you understand the obvious approximation with which this game was made .. and believe me, it is really a pity.. Three clues, one proof: the conclusions All these structural flaws lead us to think that the game was made in a fairly superficial way, and without paying attention to those (many) details that would have transformed what it is, a good game, into a Max Payne-esque masterpiece. Unfortunately, the judgment on FDTD can only be this, namely a wasted license with a truly approximate and above all very, too limited title. FDTD doesn't live only on flaws, mind you.. if you like vampires, games of this genre and don't pay too much attention to graphics&sounds that are not of the highest quality, this could be the game for you, given that in terms of emotions that crea (very often) doesn't have much to envy to games like AVP2 (and that's no small thing) and will certainly keep you busy while having fun for a few afternoons. Otherwise, if you're looking for something more complex and well-finished (as well as long) or you're too used to Max Payne forget it .. George Clooney's vampires are not for you! A dawn that never broke I'm not a huge fan of anything surrounding the Vampire universe. I don't like Buffy (editor's note: the actress instead has her own charm) and George Clooney in ~From Dusk Till Dawn~ didn't drive me crazy.. however, it cannot be denied that this title, and in general the whole world of cainiti, is surrounded by a certain aura of charm. You can understand my excitement when this FDTD fell into my hands; the idea of a new Max Payne with such a fascinating setting immediately popped into my head; alas, unfortunately it was an illusion..but first things first..", "date": "2001-12-20", "grade": null}
