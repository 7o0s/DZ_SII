After having churned out Until Dawn: Rush of Blood at the arrival of PlayStation VR and having returned to work more recently on the viewer with The Inpatient, the guys from Supermassive Games make us experience an adventure in the first person on PlayStation 4. with a pinch of desire for redemption in addition to the last occasion, after The Inpatient was received in a somewhat chilly way upon its release a month and a half ago. Unlike the adventure set in Blackwood Sanatorium and Until Dawn in general, Bravo Team completely abandons the distressing atmospheres, to move on to the naked and raw action of a pair of soldiers engaged in an almost impossible mission. To get out alive, it will be necessary to use all our skill in aiming. Two against an army The setting of Bravo Team does not particularly shine for its originality, providing more than anything else an excuse to immediately launch the player in the middle of the first of the many shootings he will have to face. In fact, the game opens with a brief introduction, in which the protagonists of Bravo Team are introduced to us: together with the president Toma, head of an unspecified Eastern European nation, we find the special forces that make up his escort, headed for the presidential palace. While the convoy crosses a bridge, an explosive attack spoils the return plans: the woman is taken away and only two soldiers survive, finding themselves without a means of transport but above all exposed to the chaos of what has all the connotations of a State. Without being able to count on other aids than his partner and a voice connected via radio, the player must thus make his way through the lines of an entire enemy army with bullets. Even without distinguishing itself in a particular way with who knows what gimmick, the plot of Bravo Team manages to keep curiosity alive until the end, also leaving room for a branch (also useful from a Trophy perspective) towards the final bars. Although the story is not the main aspect of this title, we will not go further to avoid ruining the experience, instead quantifying the duration of the main mode of the Supermassive Games title in about four hours. A small amount of time when considered in general, but to which we are now accustomed when it comes to titles related to virtual reality. In favor of Bravo Team we can say that there is still a large margin of replay value: first of all, the mission can be tackled by choosing between three different levels of difficulty, both in single mode and with a friend connected online. It was not possible for us to try Bravo Team with another human being as the game servers were obviously not populated yet, thus making us accompany by the artificial intelligence which, except on rare occasions, behaved flawlessly. Once the main story has been completed, it is also possible to face a second mode called Score Attack, in which to try to get the best possible score between the various levels that make up the game. Let's cover each other The game dynamics of Bravo Team are based on its cover system, which makes it so similar to a rail shooter. Similar but not the same, because despite not being able to move freely, the player has the right to choose where to take cover to face the enemies, thus giving each encounter a tactical aspect that should not be overlooked. In fact, by throwing yourself into the midst of opposing forces, you risk finding yourself surrounded and not knowing which way to turn, while vice versa, the best solution often lies in interacting with your partner (even the one controlled by the CPU, thanks to the commands we can give him) to try to circumvent and scatter the enemies. The mechanics work well, even allowing the player to retrace his steps to the previous position in case he realizes he has made a rash move. The compatible control systems are all those provided by PlayStation VR, although obviously a wink goes to the Aim Controller with which, among other things, Bravo Team is sold in a bundle. With the aiming peripheral the game undoubtedly offers the best chance of involvement, but we must say that we also found ourselves quite well using the pair of PlayStation Moves: in this case, Bravo Team foresees that the two ~ice creams~ are used in line towards the framing of the PlayStation Camera, thus simulating the double grip of the rifle on duty, the typology of which is divided according to the needs between an assault model, one with a wide short-range rose and a sniper one. Who forforce of things can only use a DualShock 4 still has the possibility to aim it as if it were a weapon, even if in the latter case holding the controller in front of the face ends up actually seeming a little strange compared to the other two solutions. Confirming Supermassive Games' skill in juggling PlayStation VR technology, Bravo Team's pointing system leaves very little room for smudges, indeed offering a rather valid way to perform headshots and other actions that in general are capable to give full satisfaction after a firefight. Playstation 4 trophies Bravo Team brings with it a total of twenty-two Trophies. In addition to the platinum obtainable by hitting all the other objectives, there are seven of the gold type, nine silver and five bronze. Most of them can be obtained quite easily by completing the game at least once, but to get to one hundred percent of the collection it will be necessary to return at least once to make your way through the sea of enemy bullets. Well done, team From what has been written so far, you will have understood that the work of Supermassive Games has quite satisfied us. Also from a technical point of view, making the most of the limited graphic possibilities of PlayStation VR compared to the images displayed on traditional screens. The heavy blur to which we were accustomed in the first releases of the virtual reality viewer now seems to be able to be mitigated in favor of a graphic rendering that undoubtedly appears acceptable, without particular smudges and with good attention to detail. Both in the external and internal environments, which Bravo Team alternates with good ease, also introducing a certain variety in making us move between narrow alleys, roofs and corridors of buildings of various types. In terms of variety, perhaps something more could have been done with regard to the enemies, divided between simple soldiers and other armored soldiers equipped with shotguns, in addition to the inevitable snipers. The sound allows us to hear the whistle of every bullet that passes over our head, but above all to be able to enjoy a complete dubbing in Italian. The only flaw, with regard to the latter, is that sometimes the sentences of the voice that guides us are cut, as if the time available to pronounce them was calibrated on the English-language version.", "date": "2018-03-06", "grade": "8.0"}
