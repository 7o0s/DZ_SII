{"name": "Little Orpheus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/little-orpheus-recensione.html", "text": "The Little Orpheus review leads us to relive the period of the space race between the USA and the Soviet Union, but telling us the story of an expedition that aimed to discover something much closer than the Moon: what is hidden under the earth's crust. The new adventure developed by The Chinese Room, available for Apple Arcade subscribers, is narrated by the voice of the small but shrewd Ivan Ivanovich, who somehow survived the difficult mission that led him to visit unimaginable places, where every plant and every creature were gigantic. The plot of the game, openly inspired by works such as The Land That Time Forgot, Flash Gordon and Sinbad, which in turn refer to the novels of Jules Verne, undoubtedly represents the strong point of the title, in combination with an artistic direction and a high-class technical achievement, very rare to find in a mobile production. Divided into eight episodes lasting about 25 minutes, each with a vintage cinematic-style conclusion, the Little Orpheus campaign will lead us to explore fantastic scenarios, on the run from monstrous and enormous creatures through very simple, often trivial platform mechanics: in fact this is the only big limit of the experience. Gameplay Characterized by fairly precise and responsive touch controls, but also by support for Bluetooth controllers, the gameplay of Little Orpheus always remains simple and immediate, with sections that can be completed by simply walking and taking a few jumps, unfortunately without introducing a minimum thickness during the episodes. There are new mechanics, it's true: devices to activate appear, you have to hide from the gaze of dangerous creatures that can literally strike us with their eyes, find the right timing to jump from one liana to another and solve small environmental puzzles, but we won't find no concrete threats along the way nor will we be slowed down by more complex stages. The feeling, towards the second half of the campaign, is that the developers have somehow wanted to create a sort of platform-based walking simulator, limiting interaction to a minimum and proposing a trivial challenge to keep the experience accessible to anyone and tell them a story almost completely devoid of episodes of frustration. The absurd thing is that interpreted in this way the game makes perfect sense, and as mentioned we are talking about a project with a very high production value, also with attention to detail. However it would be silly not to wonder what Little Orpheus could have been like with deeper, more multifaceted and challenging gameplay. A new Flashback, maybe. Technical realization As mentioned, Little Orpheus boasts an inspired and engaging storyline, in which we will be able to visit incredible places. Well, the technical realization does not lose sight of the goal and gives us a nice and very well animated protagonist, with many contextual movements to show off depending on the situation, as well as suggestive and detailed settings, embellished with light effects and valuable touches of class In short, if we consider the new title of The Chinese Room as an adventurous journey, there is no doubt that the artistic direction and the care taken in the realization amply justify the ticket price, which, moreover, in this case is null if you have a season ticket at Apple Arcade. There really isn't a single element of this production that gives back some feeling of approximation, indeed it is possible that the developers have set new quality standards for a mobile game which however, certainly, in some time we will also see arriving on other platforms. The speech also extends to the soundtrack, which accompanies all phases of the action in an epic and convincing way, helping to create the adventurous atmosphere that the game needed. The dialogues in English are less brilliant, perhaps a little forced and scholastic due to the Russian accent, possibly subtitled in Italian but with huge and invasive subs at the top of the screen: better to deactivate them and just listen.", "date": "2020-06-19", "grade": "7.8"}
