{"name": "Salt and Sanctuary", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/165912-salt-and-sanctuary-un-piccolo-grande-successo.html", "text": "There is no doubt now that Mister Miyazaki - and all From Software - have brought to light that concept of hardcore gaming that seemed to have been partially lost. The idea of ~difficult game~, the one that scares the novices and cuts the legs even to the so-called ~professionals~ of the joypad. Leaving aside all these trivial names, the only certainty is the birth - or rebirth under another name - of the so-called ~soulslike~ genre. A mix of very skilful design, with a pinch of sadism in its sometimes illogically punitive nature with the player, a sprinkling of trivial programming and a creamy heart of very rich and satisfying gameplay. Ska Studios with Salt and Sanctuary borrows each of these features and adapts them to their own world, the one they too helped to solidify: the next generation ~metroidvania~. Before delving into the maze of the realm masterfully designed by the artists of the American developer, it is important to say that, in case you are not a supporter of Miyazaki-san's work, it is still advisable to give the title in question a chance. You may find yourself in front of one of the best two-dimensional action RPGs of the last two decades. Salt and Sanctuary is yes a soulslike in two dimensions, but also much more At the Saltborn's Quest in Cook Class We assure you that the title of the paragraph is exactly what we intended to give: we refer you to the box which explains the reasons and vicissitudes of the hilarious location of the title. In this space, however, we deal with the narrative premise of the game: as you approach the consecration of your wedding by sea, a member of the crew wakes you up and, in the very short time available before dying, informs you that the ship has been boarded . From there on it's all uphill. You won't even have time to figure out what's happening before a boss - evidently not within your reach - will attack you and slice you in a couple of hits. Don't worry, just a couple of moments and you find yourself on a splendid (so to speak) beach, with your trusty weapon in your hands - assuming you have chosen a class that provided for it - and a series of ready-made deformed creatures to use as a snack. This is the incipit of a very unclear narrative plot, which will require an in-depth study of the descriptions and very few lines of text of the various non-player characters you will meet in order to be distributed. The certainty is that we are talking about a campaign that will keep you busy for no less than twenty-five hours, keeping relatively close; times that are now difficult to find even in million-dollar and so-called triple A productions. possible translations The translation of the game deserves a separate box for its absurd ability to be so aberrant that it has become a small cult. It is obvious from the first moment, when choosing the class of your character, that you are faced with a title localized by means of an automatic translator, which in some cases has proved to be even worse than the well-known Google Translate. It is enough to read Chief as a specification of one of the classes in the game and see how the character is equipped with parannanza and pan, to understand how Chef was mistaken for Chief. It is clear that the sympathy and cheerfulness of things soon leaves room for the impossibility of understanding almost all of the narration and explanations of the game. All this, combined with the need to change the language of the PlayStation 4 system (for now exclusive, but also expected on PlayStation Vita and PC within the year) to switch to the more understandable English, make it a not indifferent flaw. The desire of the founding spouses of Ska Studios to bring their work to as many public as possible is to be commended, but the result is sad, both in the language of the Bel Paese and in several other languages. Playstation 4 trophies As for the trophies of the game, nothing too different from what we know well. The count is 38, of which 20 in bronze, 13 in silver, 4 in gold and the coveted platinum. In addition to a recognition for each boss defeated, we find those that require the total upgrade of a skill or a weapon. Collect all the various mods or take an oath to each of the deities. At the end of the campaign, if you are among those who like to explore these titles in depth, it will not be difficult to find yourself with a good 75% of trophies already acquired. More Castlevania or more Dark Souls? In purely playful terms, it is something very similar to the idea we all have of plagiarism. During our search for the betrothed, we will find ourselves traveling through a realm made up of the most disparate creatures, both in terms of pure artistic design, but also in terms of approach tothe fight. We will go from ultra-known skeletons to giant winged eyes capable of making others of their kind immune. Then there will be enchanters and cyclops; passing through giant dogs and spiders with an insatiable appetite. Everyone will find themselves satisfied by the study of the creatures and the impeccable level design. Even the latter is a clear heir to Miyazaki's creature and from which they were inspired to create a totally interconnected world. A unique map, entirely open to visitors and full of shortcuts and secrets, such as dark tunnels and invisible walls. Note absolutely not to be underestimated: the care in the creation of the bosses. We are talking about twenty main enemies, also cared for in aesthetics and attack patterns and another three or four optional ones, to be found and defeated for one's personal satisfaction. Each of these will take up the style of the area you are in, and will have to be tackled with a specific approach. Our character's progression is governed by the collection of halls (the equivalent of souls in Dark Souls, or Bloodborne's Blood Echoes). Whenever you find yourself near one of the sanctuaries that give the title to the game (which also act as covenants with various deities and as a central hub for sellers and blacksmiths), it will be possible to spend a precise and increasing quantity of this salt to perform the level up. Each of these advances will then be given a black pearl, to be set in a skill tree which, for those who already have fifteen years of video games on their shoulders, will remember the wonderful and never forgotten Spherography of Final Fantasy X. Easier to do what to say. Once you have overcome the initial disorientation in the face of the total lack of tutorials on how to grow, you will immediately find yourself faced with an incredibly intuitive progression method. And situations in which you will wonder why you have not chosen one skill over another will not be rare, finding yourself one step away from the skill that could now save your life. Other stones will also come to help - this time white - capable of eliminating the skills already obtained and recovering the corresponding black pearl (or pearls). Increased stats, weight, flasks that you can carry around or the ability to wield some specific types of weapons or wear some particular armor, are all skills to be unlocked. In this lies the very deep customization of Salt and Sanctuary, which incredibly manages to give in some cases even greater satisfactions than the title from which it derives, with goodies, such as the skill tree, which impose a further level of reasoning. Alongside all this good things, there will certainly be the classic ~loadouts~ with equipment on the right and left hand, armor, rings, shields; as well as spells, prayers and status effects. All upgradeable and transmutable into types with different effects. In short, there is what devourers of the genre would expect and probably something more, including the much-infamous New Game +. We are undoubtedly faced with the best of the derivative soulslikes and it is incredible to believe that all this is the merit and effort of two single people. How I draw you a world On a purely technical level, Salt and Sanctuary proves to be a little gem in terms of visual rendering and pure artistic taste. Passing over the inexpressiveness and paucity of the characters' faces, what is striking is the care with which the various game environments are created. Yes, they are repetitive in the textures within the individual locations, but with a level of detail and variety that should not be underestimated. We are talking about about twenty different game areas, each with its own color choices and artistic inspiration. We go from the beach to the castle; from an arabesque palace to a seabed; from a dungeon full of traps to a real suspended city. Another note of merit for the construction of the weapons (about six hundred... yes, six hundred) and the armor: each one different from the other and able to get dirty in real time based on the blows inflicted. There is very little that one cannot be satisfied with in Salt and Sanctuary and we are undoubtedly talking about the translation - which it is not even possible to call it such (but which in its own way is making it an international phenomenon). Furthermore, crazy to say after having praised its praises, its proximity is so important to the progenitor of the genre that it really seems like a copy. Obviously, in the total calculation, in the light of the magnificent ability to ~steal~, Ska Studios has won in the choice of slavishly re-proposing the same identical characteristics; but you can't not fto notice the lack of real novelties, if not in the choice (also successful) to apply some classic dictates of the metroidvania. Thanks to a 2D world that is fun to explore and full of places to rediscover, following the acquisition of some exploration skills.", "date": "2016-03-30", "grade": "8.3"}
