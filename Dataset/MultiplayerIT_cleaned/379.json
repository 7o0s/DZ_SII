{"name": "Syphon Filter Dark Mirror", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/syphon-filter-dark-mirror.html", "text": "Snake? No, Gabe The protagonist is also in this case Gabe Logan, a rough special agent always ready to embark on impossible missions without any fear; in this case it is a question of dealing with a terrorist organization that is focusing its activity on attacking chemical plants. The story unfolds step by step within the different settings crossed by Gabe, with a handful of twists which, however, do not contribute in a particular way to raising a discreet but rather banal script. On the other hand, in an action game of this type the story is certainly not the fundamental point, and fortunately the programmers of the Sony Bend team seem to know this well; what is needed in such a product is above all a nice arsenal of weapons, seasoned with a series of ultra-technological gadgets capable of making a difference on the battlefield. In this sense Siphon Filter does not disappoint at all, thanks to a series of Sam Fisher-style glasses for night vision, heat sources and ~sensitive switches~ or points where it is possible to perform particular actions. The weapons, on the other hand, range from simple pistols to full-bodied automatic rifles, without forgetting the beloved sniper rifle with which it is also possible to shoot explosive, tranquilizer or electric bullets. The game structure, as already mentioned, mixes sneaking and pure action in equal parts, with a really good overall formula; the missions, articulated with different objectives that are updated in real time, offer a good variety thanks also to a particularly spot-on level design. Although the progression is absolutely linear and one-way, one hardly feels forced to take a pre-established path, thanks also to the considerable size of the rooms themselves. We only regret that the single player mode is rather small, which stops at less than 10 hours of total play, even if there is no lack of secrets and extras to unlock to significantly increase longevity. The control system is also another aspect of great value that can be found in the Sony production; with a mapping of the keys perfectly studied around the PSP, the programmers have brilliantly managed to circumvent the absence of a second analog stick for managing the camera. But in general managing the protagonist proves to be comfortable and natural after just a few minutes of play, a factor that should not be underestimated especially in the context of a 3D game of this complexity on a portable console. Just think of the result obtained with Splinter Cell Essentials... Nice to see The impression one gets when playing Siphon Filter Dark Mirror is that of a product with a high general thickness, created with the PSP hardware in mind and trying to take care of every single aspect. And this is the case not only with regards to the control system and level design, but also from a technical point of view since the American team's fatigue is undoubtedly one of the most visually impressive games released on the Sony laptop. The complexity of the structures and the level of detail are truly exceptional, always making everything clear and clearly visible; the environments appear alive, well-finished and realistic, with an extreme variety that leads to passing from snow-capped mountains to small South American towns from one level to another. The same quality can also be found with regard to the characters, well modeled and animated in a satisfactory manner; the greatest care was obviously placed in the protagonist, capable of showing off the high variety of moves with credible and well-connected movements. If it weren't for some slightly subdued textures and for a frame rate that is sometimes subject to some drops, Dark Mirror could undoubtedly be transported to Ps2 as it is without raising any kind of scandal. The sound is also excellent, both for the music and for the Italian dubbing almost always at the level of the original one. As if all this weren't enough, Siphon Filter on PSP also offers a juicy ad hoc or online multiplayer mode, where up to 8 players can challenge each other in different modes ranging from deathmatch to the need to complete specific set objectives. Too bad only for the small number of maps present, just a handful, which contrast with the complex system of lobbies, rankings, friends list and even the possibility of voice chat via the headset-microphone to be purchased separately (or included in Socom, for example). Comment Siphon Filter Dark Mirror does not struggle to establish itself as one of the best games currently available on the PSP, despite the long period between its American and European launch. ThereSony production is in fact an excellent example of how to exploit the beautiful handheld in the ideal way, both in terms of the technical component and in terms of the truly natural and well-studied control system. In general, Dark Mirror gives at all times the impression of being a game of high quality and great value, with a care placed in every single aspect that is typical only of games of class. The only weak points can be found in a rather short single player mode and in a game structure that is undoubtedly not particularly original; but it really is about nitpicking a game that no PSP owner should pass up. Pros Technically excellent Great control system Great variety and good level design Cons Reduced longevity in single player Few maps in multiplayer Not very original and slightly lacklustre storyline The Siphon Filter series owes its discreet fame above all to the first episodes, born on Psx when Metal Gear Solid was the undisputed master of the Sony platform. Riding the wave of the Konami masterpiece, the American programmers created a product that had a stereotypical ~alone against all~ special agent as its protagonist, but framed in a much more action key than Kojima's effort. Precisely for this reason, together with a well-studied mechanics and a good-level aesthetic component, Siphon Filter managed to carve out considerable success both among critics and among the public, a fundamental factor for the subsequent birth of sequels. Unfortunately, however, the transition to Ps2 turned out to be traumatic, due to a chapter that was not able to effectively transport the franchise by expanding it on the basis of the greater potential of the console. However, after a long period of silence, the name Siphon Filter finally reappears on the videogame scene thanks to a completely new episode for PSP, subtitled Dark Mirror.", "date": "2006-09-05", "grade": null}
