A place on our planet like many others, known by lovers of literature for being the starting point of the Pequod ship in Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick. A work that has entered the collective imagination thanks to its fearsome white whale, from which our compatriots at Picaresque Studio drew heavily to give life to their debut effort. Before going into the review, we can anticipate that Nantucket was among the first games to amaze us in this year that has just begun, giving us a few hours of fun around the seven seas. After all, not only Dragon Ball FighterZ and Monster Hunter: World lives man, right? I'm the captain As we said, Nantucket draws inspiration from Moby Dick, placing itself in detail after the end of the novel published in 1851. The player is called to take on the role of Ishmael, the only survivor of the misfortune of the Pequod after having been in the service of Captain Ahab, obsessed with desire to kill the white whale. A monstrous creature, on whose trail at the beginning of the game Ishmael also sets out, in order to unravel the mystery behind the curse that, after condemning the crew of the Pequod, seems to follow him too. At this point, let's imagine that your greatest curiosity is to know which genre this title belongs to: the answer is that inside it is possible to find a bit of everything, starting from a role-playing system on which the evolution of our Ishmael is based and his companions. In fact, the gaming experience revolves around a system of quests, to complete which you have to cross the length and breadth of the seven seas, collecting the missions in the ports present on the various continents. For example, it may happen that we have to transport goods from one place in the world to another, or that we are asked to discover a new area where to hunt whales, or even to kill a specific creature that infests the seas. Completing missions allows you to accumulate experience to level up, spending points in the four categories provided by the developers: hunting, navigation, science and crafting. While the first two are pretty self-explanatory, science allows you to heal other crew members and crafting proves to be especially crucial in making improvements to your ship, as well as offering an interesting ability to reroll dice in combat. We will talk about the latter shortly, first let's complete the discussion on the role-playing component of Nantucket by remembering that Ishmael can develop his own personality traits, in a similar way to what we saw in Crusaders Kings II: while we are navigating a series of random events puts us in front of to some choices, whose final outcome in influencing the progression of the character is often linked to percentages that also offer material-type bonuses and penalties. Around the seven seas Even an expert sailor like Ishmael needs a crew to steer his ship, especially when the latter grows large and the activities to manage it grow accordingly. In the taverns present in the various ports it is possible to recruit one's own crew, choosing from people who are more or less expert on the four subjects listed above. The only element that must be taken into account to ~hire~ the crew is one's prestige: completing jobs and killing whales makes Ishmael increasingly known within the environment, thus allowing him to be able to count on the services of a larger crew and expert. However, it is also possible to hire hubs with no experience, thus deciding which specialization to have them take starting from scratch. Each crew member is then entrusted with a task on the ship, also in this case trying to best fit the various skills to obtain bonuses relating to navigation speed, recovery of health points or other. The world of Nantucket is full of adventure but also danger, so combat is the order of the day. The fight phases give life to the strategic component of the title, allowing the two sides to choose the moves to implement in their phase of the turn among those made available by a roll of the dice. The ~c factor~ thus plays a rather important role in this phase, forcing the player to come to terms with the possibility of not having the skill he needs most available for several rounds. We do not deny that this mechanism can be frustrating when the condition just described occurs, but especially in the more advanced stages of the game it becomes possible to choose the arrangementposition of the elements of the crew participating in the battle, ensuring a fair balance between attack and defense that can also protect against bad luck with the dice. The skill of the crafting experts we mentioned earlier allows for example to choose an element of the crew to have the die re-rolled, while the more expert scientists are able to revive the companions who died during the battle. Finding Moby Dick Sailing the seas of Nantucket there is certainly no shortage of things to do. Even if the player intends to follow the main quest line, he must deal with a number of elements that force him to consolidate his position for the most important events. Being at sea for months and months without seeing land requires, for example, having on board one's ship a series of basic necessities, the quantities of which must be planned properly before embarking on a long voyage. In the initial stages of Nantucket all this might seem complicated, but after the first few hours it is almost natural to take care of supplies, immersing yourself in hunting sessions and economic exchanges with which to secure your crew. The initial hours are also those that put us in front of phases that are a little more repetitive with each other, but we imagine that it was an obligatory step in the design of the game. In this way, in fact, you have the opportunity to try firsthand to implement what is described in the initial tutorial, thus acting as an additional guide while waiting to be able to track down creatures of particular strength and abilities after the first levels. The idea of knowing every handkerchief of the seven seas is out of the question, as winds and other particular conditions can significantly affect navigation on routes traveled over and over again, not to mention the constant danger of having to deal with pirates. From a technical point of view, the guys from Picaresque Studio have paid almost obsessive attention to every detail of Nantucket: all the scenarios appear hand-drawn, including the map to be discovered piece by piece in search of hunting areas and migration routes of the whales. The menus offer a fairly simple interface, always putting everything at hand especially in the navigation phases. The graphic quality is accompanied hand in hand by that of the sound effects, which accompany the calm and windier phases with the noises of navigation, allowing us to hear the frightening cries of the cetaceans on our skin during the clashes. Going from one port to another you will occasionally hear your crew sing some of the most famous songs among those sung on the decks of the ships: the first occasion in which the choir will start will leave you pleasantly surprised, leaving you later with the desire to hear the crew sing more frequently. By completing the quests of the main story, you access small animated sequences, dubbed and subtitled entirely in English like everything else on Nantucket.", "date": "2018-01-30", "grade": "8.5"}
