{"name": "NEO: The World Ends with You", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/neo-the-world-ends-with-you-recensione.html", "text": "Fourteen years ago, The World Ends with You hit the JRPG landscape like a hurricane. It was a fresh, original title, innovative in every respect, with a soundtrack full of energy and a truly daring story. And for some reason it didn't see a sequel for a very long time, perhaps also because the game ended with a near-perfect ending. That was until Square Enix resurrected it first in 2012 and then in 2018 with the mobile and Nintendo Switch conversions that they added new pieces to the narrative, suggesting that a sequel was actually in the works. This review of NEO: The World Ends with You should reassure fans who have been waiting so long. Square Enix has thought about it, and has thought about it far more than the trailers so far have suggested. It is no coincidence that the game came out a few weeks after the conclusion of the animated adaptation of the first title, late but appreciable, as well as an excellent point of reference for those approaching this ~wonderful world~ for the first time. A new game If there is something that unites the two titles in the series, it is the propensity to amaze the player with sensational twists and turns that the screenplay slowly concocts and always displays at the right moment. For this reason, we will try to keep any information on the narrative to a minimum, in order to avoid too many anticipations. You should know that the game has a new protagonist, especially if you have followed the news or played the demo released a few weeks ago: his name is Rindo Kanade, and he is a Japanese high school student like many others who loves to visit the picturesque Shibuya district with his friend Tosai ~Fret~ Furesawa. One fine day, however, the two end up catapulted into a reality parallel to ours in which the Game of Demons is held, a great challenge orchestrated by as extravagant as powerful entities who force the deceased to overcome all kinds of adversities for an entire week. Why this game is held, which has very little fun, is a real mystery, and at the beginning both Rindo and Fret take it for a kind of joke, used as they are to the absurdities of Japanese life, to LARPs and so on. NEO: The World Ends with You, Rindo is the new protagonist. Only it's not a joke, but by no means. At stake are their very lives, in the hands of ambiguous and unreliable characters. There is also a novelty, compared to the rules of the Game of Demons in which Neku Sakuraba participated in the prequel: this time it is not played in pairs, but in teams. This means that the cast is exponentially larger, since it includes not only the members of the opposing teams, but also the Demons of Shinjuku, a city that no longer exists and of which no one remembers. NEO: The World Ends with You therefore seems like a whole new story, marginally inspired by the previous adventure, but it's not like that. It is a full-fledged sequel that in the space of a few hours resumes and continues the storylines left open after A New Day, the extra content added at the end of The World Ends with You: Final Remix. For this reason it is difficult to recommend it to those who have never played the prequel or even watched the animated transposition. At a certain point, the references to the 2008 title become more and more important and the summary explanations of the various characters are no longer enough to enhance the complicated relationships established in the first game and the way this story reverses them, just think of the introduction of Sho Minamimoto in the playable cast. For newbies, some narrative junctions may even seem ordinary, while for old fans they will be sensational twists that will push them to continue in an adventure that is not a little lacking in terms of pace, but which closes with a great ending. NEO: The World Ends with You feels like a visual novel at times. There are tons of dialogues to read, and in some chapters, characters may stop to discuss each time the player loads a new screen. The problem is that not all of these dialogues actually serve to characterize the characters, and many times one gets the impression that the writers wanted to lengthen the broth, repeating the same concepts. A vice, moreover, quite typical in Japanese productions. NEO: The World Ends with You, Sho returns from the previous episode. The narrative slows down and breaks the flow of the game, therefore, in a title that does not understand how much it wants to focus on the gameplay, understood as a combat system. The dialogues, fortunately, are smooth and serve to better characterize the cast. Every single character expresses himself in his own way, representing the absurd variety of languages to which the Internet, above all, has accustomed us over the years. It is a choice that helps to delineatebetter especially the supporting actors who appear less often, but which in the long run tends to be cloying, especially when the cast - which appeared to us significantly less interesting than the previous protagonists - expresses itself with text message abbreviations or as teenagers grappling with their very first private chats. All in all, we feel like rewarding the care with which the Italian dialogue writers have represented this aspect of the modern generation, and perhaps this peculiarity could even represent a strength rather than a weakness for some. Fights and pins NEO: The World Ends with You, Pins still play a vital role. As we have said, NEO: The World Ends with You is not a title specifically focused on fighting, so much so that in some chapters you will be able to continue facing just the obligatory battles that the story imposes, while in others you will spend all your time colliding with Noises and opposing teams to conquer the blocks of Shibuya in the so-called Scuffle and Scuffle mode. The Square Enix title certainly lacks acrobatics, but fortunately it offers the possibility of customizing the level of difficulty right from the start through a series of modifiers that reward even the most warmongers. Those who played the previous The World Ends with You can expect a fairly similar structure. The story is divided into chapters, or days, and each time you have to pass a test or achieve a goal that becomes more and more intricate. If you initially have to fight a few Noises or so, at some point you will also find yourself solving puzzles that will challenge your powers of observation. NEO: The World Ends with You, exploring Shibuya. Rindo and the others then acquire a series of additional psychic powers that will be used simultaneously. In these cases, a kind of autopilot takes over, in the sense that it is the game itself that suggests using them. You will therefore find yourself recovering the lost memories in the memory of the characters you meet, invading their thoughts to defeat the most annoying Noises or imprinting the keywords learned while wandering around Shibuya in the most susceptible minds. The most interesting power, however, is called Replay, and it plays an active role in the story. At one point Rindo learns to rewind time and NEO: The World Ends with You makes excellent use of a hackneyed ploy which, however, works really well in this case, above all because the screenplay immediately establishes some very precise rules and then respects them until the end . Time travel therefore serves to untie some critical nodes in the story and becomes one with the story, rather than a simple gameplay mechanism. Some days you'll find yourself jumping from one moment to the next to discover the valuable information that will help prevent a dramatic turnaround, for example, and although the procedure is completely guided, you get the feeling that you still maintain a fair amount of control over the actions of the protagonists. NEO: The World Ends with You, Nagi is a quirky nerd who joins the team. Fights, psychic powers and exploration also serve to solve the side missions that some NPCs on the streets of Shibuya will sometimes offer us. Completing these tasks, but also consuming the dishes in the restaurants - which improve the characters' statistics - and shopping in the fashion shops all around is not only important for micromanaging the RPG component of the game, but also for developing a network of relationships , called precisely Social Network, which serves to improve the most varied aspects of the experience. Each new contact in the network represents a goal to be achieved, after which it will be enough to spend the Friendship Points earned to unlock the corresponding bonus, whether it is a new level of difficulty, additional clothing or food in shops or expansions of combat mechanics. The latter are particularly important because the combat system remains quite unchanged from the beginning to the end of the game: the Social Network enhances some aspects, for example by prolonging the window of invulnerability during dodging or the period of time in which it is possible to ring a combo. NEO: The World Ends with You, a fight. The fights of NEO: The World Ends with You are very different from those of the original title, but still revolve around the Pins. Each of these little objects represents a specific skill that we can assign to a character and that we can call up by pressing the corresponding button on the controller. On the battlefield, the team shares the health meter, but the player moves a character in real timeThu only and changes it by simply activating the Pin associated with another party member. The idea is this: using the abilities of the Pins - which belong to different categories and work in different ways - you attack enemies, and when the circular Groove indicator appears on the screen, you have a few moments to activate another Pin and continue the combo. By successfully chaining the skills of the Pins, the synchronicity indicator is also charged which, once the maximum percentage is reached, allows you to use a sort of devastating super attack on one or more targets. NEO: The World Ends with You, you can read the thoughts of passers-by. It's a simple, intuitive and fun combat system, but a bit poor, especially as it evolves marginally throughout the story, except for the aforementioned improvements that the Social Network offers. It has some important qualities, but also angularity of a certain weight. The variety of Brooches is certainly remarkable - many are obtained by defeating Noises, others can be bought - but after a few hours you realize that most of them are similar and only change the effects or power. The player is encouraged to try them all and find the best combinations, especially since the Pins gain experience points and improve, or transform, plus they also increase the influence of the associated brands, a returning mechanism from the prequel. Learning new combos, timings, and tricks every time you switch Pin setups is part of the game; on the other hand, the commands end up being reconfigured all the time, and this can get annoying, especially if the equipped Pins involve some awkward mapping. A technical picture NEO: The World Ends with You, the story is told through these comics. As we said though, the combat system isn't exactly the focus of NEO: The World Ends with You, although most of the optional content focuses on it. The search for all the Pins and the clashes with the most powerful Noises and the inevitable secret bosses represent the most important part of the contents that are unlocked after completing the game. In fact, the main adventure lasts about thirty hours, but it takes several more to really see everything that the Square Enix title can offer. It is an ideal duration, also because the exploration remains limited to the Shibuya map and at a certain point it begins to become repetitive because the blocks to discover run out. In this regard, we can confirm the initial impressions made by the trailers and the demo. Director Hiroyuki Ito may not have had a hefty budget at his disposal, and NEO: The World Ends with You is certainly a decent title in terms of technical achievement, but it leverages an inspired artistic direction that works best with what's at hand. disposition. The bright colors of Shibuya, the stylization of the outlines of the buildings that seem to close in on the protagonists, framing the chaotic Japanese urban life, return a cartoonish image full of energy. Tetsuya Nomura's character design appeared to us a little more contained than his historical exaggerations, but not all the characters fully convinced us and perhaps we would have preferred some more cinematics in the crucial moments: the story is in fact told through illustrations and comics , moreover not always dubbed in English or in Japanese. Nothing to say, however, on the impeccable soundtrack by Takeharu Ishimoto who, despite having left Square Enix a few years ago, has returned to compose the melodies of the series, ranging from rock to hip hop and embracing an enormous variety of genres that represent the chaotic and composite reality of Shibuya.", "date": "2021-07-26", "grade": "8.0"}
