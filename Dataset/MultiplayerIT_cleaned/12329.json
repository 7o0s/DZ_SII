{"name": "Space Empires V - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/space-empires-v-recensione.html", "text": "The infinity of space Strengthened by a more than ten-year tradition and extremely solid and tested game mechanics, the fifth chapter of the series can afford the addition of numerous and often unexpected details which, overall, do nothing but offer the gamer a game environment as detailed as it is free and practically infinite. Just like space. Even just starting a first game in Space Empires V is no small matter. On the contrary. Having to choose your own race with a lot of culture, government system, morphological characteristics and much, much more, can even put you in difficulty... and think that we are only at the beginning. Once we finally get to the screen of our first solar system, everything becomes - at least apparently - simpler and, perhaps, obvious. Starting from our small and insignificant home planet we will have to expand our civilization through space travel, the colonization of new galaxies, the research of new technologies, the management of relations with other alien peoples and, ultimately, with the excessive use of force. In Space Empires V, each of these aspects is analyzed, detailed, stripped and offered at the mercy of the gamer with a level of depth that is sometimes even excessive. Especially for all those for whom Civilization IV is too complex and perhaps complicated a title. For starters, colonizing a planet isn't as simple as one might expect. Not all planets are initially colonizable and, even if they were, other variables such as size, climate, the resources present and the type of atmosphere could make the colonization of a planet practically useless. Space exploration in search of rich and hospitable planets will therefore prove to be one of the first priorities. The universe offered by Space Empires V appears to be decidedly generous in size and, even in the case of the minimum setting, the slowness of exploration and the pace of the game, combined with the fact that in space we will feel alone for several rounds will represent, after the definition parameters of the game, the second important test to understand if Space Empires will do for us. the fifth chapter of the series can afford the addition of numerous and often unexpected details The infinity of space Fortunately, even in the solitude of exploration, in Space Empires V we always have plenty to do between turns. Such as the ability to define the design of our own starships. Depending on the degree of research achieved by our culture we will have a more or less wide choice of weapons, shields, engines, scientific devices and other various trinkets to be placed on one of the different levels of the hull. The possibilities available to the player are virtually endless. Or almost so. And then the fights are not a simple mathematical exercise: the designers of Malfador Machination have seen fit to offer the possibility of following the battles in first person (complete with a free view in 3D) and, perhaps, of taking the reins of our fleets. Both in space and in the case of assault on planets. The technological research itself is not managed as we are now used to for a classic turn-based strategy game, i.e. with a tree of choices which, as one progresses in the game, puts at the player's disposal one or more options from which to decide which new technology develop. In fact, in a decidedly more likely but - at least from certain points of view - even more demanding way, the player will be able to carry out several searches at the same time, deciding what percentage of the total budget to invest in each of them. And then, for each single technology, we will be able to have other levels of knowledge available from time to time, thus placing ourselves in front of a technological tree that is nothing short of immense. Once the famous First Contact with an alien race has taken place, we will then be able to implement a vast choice of espionage (and counter-espionage) operations by deciding how many and which resources to invest in each civilization. At a diplomatic level, the options available are endless and allow you to carry out the management of the initial relationships first and then of the negotiations in a way that is difficult to reproduce by other titles of the genre, both in the single player and multiplayer fields. Lots of power, difficult control We must not forget another of the cornerstones of the game: customization. We recall with pleasure the numerous games via email (at the time only the 33.6 Kbps modem existed) carried out with a ~customized~ version of Space Empires II which involved Ferengi, Klingons, Cardassians and many other cultures taken atto from the universe created by Gene Roddenberry. Here, as if the immense freedom in terms of game mechanics were not enough, Space Empires V allows the customization of the entire game, thanks to the native support for the development of MODifications capable of changing both the appearance of the spaceships, as well as the elements of the graphical interface or even the behavior of computer-managed empires. Since we are talking about traditions, we come to the least welcome among those proposed to players by Malfador Machination: we are talking about a certain series of bugs and imperfections that can undermine the gaming experience here and there. After all, since the first chapters, the developers have never skimped on after-sales support and, also thanks to the help and field testing of the community, the individual chapters of the Space Empires series have always evolved over the years. We don't know how much this is actually a defect, however, at least in the current state of things (at the time of writing we have arrived at the v1.33 patch) the game seems to have reached a more than sufficient degree of maturity and stability. Someone may be wondering about the level in the graphics and audio fields. The screenshots scattered throughout this couple of pages should already be explicit enough: even considering the type of game, we are a little more than the minimum wage. On the audio front, there are a handful of tracks that are really not bad and quite in line with the game atmosphere. Some might even give up opening their favorite MP3 player. At least for the first few hours. Speaking of symphonies we conclude, and we are sorry to do so, with one last sour note: the user interface. There is a lot of data to manage, even more information to read and the control system offered by the game doesn't help that much. Even after several days of play, you will often stop wondering how to get to that information screen or how to access that other section of the game. Too bad, because a more user-friendly interface would probably have made the title more attractive, even to all those players who certainly don't live on bread and shifts. System requirements Minimum requirements: Windows 95 with DirectX 7 Processor 500 GHz Disk space 500 MB CD ROM reader Unless you have a PC from the last millennium, you won't have any particular problems running the game. Comment In the turn-based strategy genre, Space Empires V can seriously aspire to define itself as the most complete and deepest, however it fails to boast itself as the most fun. Not even in the field of strategic space (palm that currently belongs, at least if we exclude Master of Orion 2, to Galactic Civilization 2). The user interface, difficult and not very intuitive. The game starts slow. The general bewilderment and the non-immediate feedback on the effect of one's actions only make Space Empires an elite title which however will not fail to satisfy all purists of the genre. Perfect for the ~sick~ of the genre, a little less for neophytes and Sunday strategists who are ~settled~ for Civilization. Here, let's say that Space Empires V lacks that innate gift of giving game depth without introducing complexity of use. After all, you can't always have everything. Pro Proven and deep gameplay The top of the genre, in terms of proposed choices and freedom of action Virtually infinite customization possibilities Also suitable for now old and obsolete PC configurations Cons Difficult user interface For some it could be too complex and wordy Slow pace of play For many, the Space Empires brand and, above all, the name Malfador Machination could mean absolutely nothing. And yet, this small Californian software house, born more than ten years ago just to be able to publish the second chapter of the Space Empires series, is one of the rare examples (together with names like Spiderweb, an appreciated ~old-style~ cRPG development house) of independent software house able to offer a niche product ready to satisfy fine and extremely demanding palates in defiance of the market logic which instead demands more and more flat and easy-to-use titles. Space Empire V is once again confirmed as the high academy of 4X strategic (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) and, as such, it necessarily pays the pawn, revealing itself in more than one situation as a demanding and grumpy title, however capable of giving rich and profound experiences for all those ready to turn a blind eye to purely aesthetic aspects and not reluctant to invest several hours of their free time.", "date": "2007-04-27", "grade": null}
