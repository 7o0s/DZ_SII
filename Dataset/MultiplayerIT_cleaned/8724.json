{"name": "Lemmings moderni?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/99557-escape-plan-lemmings-moderni.html", "text": "To accompany the arrival of PlayStation Vita in Italy, one of the most curious and tantalizing titles among those announced at the time for the initial lineup of the new Sony console could not be missing, an interesting project that has been well received by critics since its first appearances made during the various video game fairs in which it was shown. We are talking about Escape Plan, a game developed by Fun Bits Interactive which offers an extremely simple plot, which serves as a pretext to motivate the setting and characters, and which therefore focuses solely on a gameplay with a not very original but still interesting concept. Remember the Lemmings? Those cute little green-haired and funny-looking creatures who roamed in large numbers like so many fools along dangerous scenarios such as quarries, tunnels, frozen areas, etc., often ending up crushed or exterminated? The player's task was precisely to prevent the creatures from going towards certain death and vice versa from reaching the level exit unharmed, ~fleeing~ from the area perhaps by cooperating and joining forces through the orders given to them. Well, the gameplay of Escape Plan revolves precisely around the concept of escape, survival and collaboration, even if these three aspects are here physically reworked, expanded and embellished in the mechanics by the presence of commands linked to the technical specifications of PlayStation Vita, therefore by the possibility of direct control by the user of the elements of the landscape, from the shapes and the type of interaction that exists between the couple of protagonists, the little Lil and the voluminous Laarg. The two characters, who have to escape from the imprisonment into which the evil Bakuki, a sort of hysterical Jigsaw, forced them, are in fact characterized by a different physical structure from each other which in some cases can even influence the very way of approaching the scenarios by the gamer. The Riddler according to Fun Bits Interactive: blood and comedy a go go! Playstation 3 trophies Escape Plan offers thirteen Trophies of which nine are bronze, three silver and one gold. To obtain them, just progress in the adventure from level to level, satisfying some specific requests of the game, some strange such as for example the one that involves making Lil and Laarg die in at least five different ways, others more targeted, such as collecting all the signals of danger present in the levels or the completion of all the scenarios without exceeding the threshold of twenty deaths for the two protagonists put together. The Riddler For example, the sturdier one is more difficult to control due to the weight that sometimes makes him lose his balance and makes him slower than his partner, but is however useful for breaking through doors or breaking down obstacles or floors, while the thinner one is more agile and can therefore be exploited for other purposes. However, both are extremely delicate and a fall from nothing is enough to damage them for good. In general, therefore, each of them becomes indispensable to complete a certain journey towards freedom which winds along a series of rooms containing puzzles with a sadistic imprint and increasing difficulty, in which each enigma often has several alternative solutions and death is always around the corner. Dying squashed, burned, electrocuted or corroded by acid in Escape Plan is a frequent thing, especially in the more advanced game levels, but the departure of the characters despite their crudeness and violence is experienced in an ironic way, deliberately exaggerated a bit like in cartoons of Itchy and Dude from the Simpsons, and therefore there are also funny skits and deliberately comical accompaniments. Furthermore, dying not only has a punitive function for the player, but also becomes a useful tool for solving particularly complex puzzles, helping him to understand the best way to overcome a certain obstacle. In fact, we often die because it is simply expected that this must happen in order for the traps to be discovered, but in the end the beauty of all this in some ways lies precisely in the exploration of the environments in search of new interactions. However, where concrete elements of interest are found, as mentioned at the beginning, it is in the control system, a fundamental aspect within the economy of the product. Playing, the fact immediately transpires that the technical capabilities of the new Sony console have stimulated the creativity of programmers to the point of enticing them to create environmental puzzles linked to them in a double way. Forget using the face buttons or the Vita's directional pad, here the emphasis was on the touch of the front and rear panels and Sixaxis, with the sticks atanalogues used for the task of regulating the view by modifying the width or framing of the desired portion of the environment. Through the fingers of one hand it is possible to interact with everything that moves on the screen: the movement of the protagonists occurs simply by sliding the fingertip over them and tracing a horizontal line in one direction to make them walk, from top to bottom to make them jump and etc. Instead, to stop them, just literally press on them at the right moment. Touch me, but with style The combinations are several and the two protagonists can even be ~squeezed~ by simultaneously touching the console in front and behind at their body, so as to make them make a powerful slide / run forward quickly before a trap is triggered under their feet or above the their head, or made them fly after having filled them with helium, then rotating the console so that through the Vita sensor the movement affects their trajectory allowing them to avoid the pitfalls positioned for example on the walls in the form of razors or spikes. But things become interesting when you have to interact with the elements of the seabed, often indispensable also to eliminate some annoying armed enemy; to make a character drink coffee and momentarily give him a certain speed, just touch the appropriate machine to address him to you, to open a closed door it may be sufficient to tap with the index finger above the screen as if to knock, ditto to move a hook or a chandelier on the roof, while to make a mattress leaning against the wall fall to the ground, just tap the relative area but in the rear touch of the console so that it rests on the floor, so as to create a soft landing for the two heroes. These are just a few examples of what the user can do in the various game areas, but the variety of situations is by no means lacking in Escape Plan. Just to add some spice and partly compensate for the lack of other real game modes in addition to the main one, after each level a rating and a score is assigned based on a three-star system that takes into account the time taken to overcome a room and the number of gestures used to solve the puzzle, plus the possibility of collecting collectibles (danger signs) so as to stimulate the player to replay even the schemes already completed. The latter are then enhanced by the graphic style which in some respects recalls the Limbo game, and which rests on an atypical black and white color palette with environments that follow shades from the apt gray scale. The only adjective that immediately comes to mind to indicate the cosmetics of the product is ~elegant~. Then the idea of indicating with a number on the belly of the two protagonists, whose look clearly recalls that of some characters from the films Nightmare Before Christmas and 9, is nice, the times they died: in practice, initially on each of them there is the zero, but if they pass away for example ten times each, when they start playing again they will have written that number on the body. After the ninety-nine departures, according to the developers, a skull with crossbones, pirate flag style, will appear. Thankfully, we didn't go that far in our review test, so we can't confirm this for sure. Let's close this review by taking a look at the part relating to the audio, which on balance is qualitatively in line with the rest of the production: in addition to a soundtrack that goes well with the context, it boasts a series of effects that accompany the success or failure of each action of the characters and the user with applause, laughter and cheers of approval that seem taken from an American sitcom of the past.", "date": "2012-02-24", "grade": "8.0"}
