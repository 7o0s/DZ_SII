It happened with Kirby Fighters Deluxe and Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe from Kirby: Triple Deluxe; now Kirby's Blowout Blast closes the circle of Kirby: Planet Robobot opened a few months ago by the other stand-alone minigame, Team Kirby Clash Deluxe. Yes, in case you were wondering, we've already managed to spell the name Kirby exactly six times, seven if you count this one. In any case, the question that must be asked in this case remains the same, namely: is this version of Kirby's Blowout Blast really worth the seven euros it costs? The answer, as usual, is not very simple, but if you love Kirby madly, you may have already guessed it... Spit it out again, Kirby As mentioned above, Kirby's Blowout Blast is an evolution of the Kirby 3D Challenge minigame integrated in Kirby: Planet Robobot. At the time, it didn't convince us much, since it was a very simple series of arenas in which our adorable pink cloud had to suck enemies in and then spit them at each other until they were all wiped out, trying to chain together as many eliminations as possible to multiply the final score. In this stand-alone edition, the developer has worked on the basic idea to build a good thirty horizontal and vertical scrolling isometric levels. The player controls Kirby and obviously has to complete them in the shortest possible time: the company in general is decidedly easy and the duration of the levels is very short, given that each stage is completed in a couple of scarce minutes and at the ~end credits~, so to speak, you arrive in an hour or so. However, what really matters is the score, and in this respect the discussion changes a lot. The enemies are arranged in increasingly complex ways and to maximize the points multiplier you need not only to point Kirby in the right direction, but also to choose which enemies to aspire and which not, as well as study the timing and movements of the targets to defeat them in clusters. The developer, from this point of view, was quite ingenious, since it is often necessary to repeat the stages several times to learn the various dynamics before being able to complete them with the highest possible evaluation which, of course, will take into account the defeated enemies, the combos and other parameters. There are five worlds, made up of four or five stages each, but if you manage to complete each stage by winning at least the gold trophy you can access the extra worlds which are slightly more complex and which, in a sense, double the longevity of the game. The problem however is that Kirby's Blowout Blast remains a very simple and repetitive title, despite some particularly brilliant acute points in terms of level design, especially when the isometric shot plays on depth to take the player off guard and convince him to think three-dimensionally. In these cases, activating the stereoscopic effect of the Nintendo 3DS proves to be particularly pleasant even on a practical level, but unfortunately it also involves some inexplicable uncertainty in terms of fluidity: especially if there are many enemies on the screen, the game tends to slow down and frustrate the importance of timing, decreasing our shooting accuracy. In these cases it is better to deactivate the 3D effect, in short, but it is a contradiction, as well as a real shame.", "date": "2017-07-06", "grade": "6.8"}
