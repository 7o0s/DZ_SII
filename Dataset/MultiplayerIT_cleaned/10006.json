It is therefore interesting to see that one of the most famous and appreciated brands of the genre, or Sega's Football Manager, has decided to also appear on the App Store for the joy of those who couldn't wait to always have tactics and schemes at hand . It went at 100 per hour on the side band Football Manager Handheld 2010 is based on an intelligent reasoning made by the programmers: it doesn't make sense to faithfully transport a game from PC to iPhone which, due to its complexity and ~specific weight~, would be badly suited to the nature of the Apple platform. An undoubtedly correct decision, but which requires painstaking precision and expertise when repositioning and selecting the contents to be maintained in the adaptation process; this because if it is true that a Football Manager that is too complex would discourage a good portion of users, on the other hand an excessive simplification would remove the soul of the product by alienating the historical fans of the series. The final result is, from our point of view, quite satisfactory. Football Manager Handheld 2010 in this incarnation obviously allows you to choose a team among those present in 34 leagues of 11 nations (Australia, Belgium, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Portugal, Scotland, Spain); for the Bel Paese there are formations starting from C1 upwards, each obviously with a different budget and seasonal objectives to be respected in order to be able to maintain one's employment and not risk exemption. As is obvious, the vast majority of time spent will be ~behind the scenes~, i.e. away from the pitch and the actual matches; the deep organizational work starts from the transfer market, a fundamental point for strengthening the squad and reducing it of superfluous players, to then move on to the training phase in which it is possible to study specific paths for each athlete in order to enhance their most important characteristics. But since the game tries to replicate realistic situations, it is also necessary to establish ~human~ relationships, perhaps by trusting your goalless striker or publicly calling out an inattentive defender. Also important is the set-up phase of the entire team with the choice of mentality, the predominant type of passing, the strength of the tackles and the use of techniques such as pressing and the offside trap; needless to say about the tactics, with a whole series of schemes to be adopted and then ~stitched~ on their players to make them perform at their best. But a manager is not just a coach, and for this reason the relationship with the management and with the observers who are always looking for new talent around the world should not be forgotten. Therefore, the moment of the actual game becomes only a fraction of the gameplay, however probably the least successful given the poverty of options available during this phase; the modifications that can be performed during the match are really reduced to the bone, thus making the matches rather boring if not downright frustrating in the face of the reduced incisiveness that it is possible to have on the development of the same. The representation of the actions then, which takes place only via text or in 2d with a view from above on the playing field, certainly does not help in this sense. The game interface must then be added to the defect just described; if navigating the menus once you get used to it is all in all acceptable albeit a little chaotic, team management with dragging players to manage positions and substitutions appears decidedly cloying and imprecise.
