{"name": "Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-recensione.html", "text": "Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 is the fourth chapter (Persona 2: Innocent Sin and Persona 2: Eternal Punishment are considered two separate titles) of a saga that seems to know no moments of pause in recent times and which, episode after episode, continues to carve out more and more space in the hearts of millions of fans. Giving life to an authentic phenomenon now called MegaTen (from Megami Tensei), which has resulted over the years, as well as in various titles for various platforms, also in productions of all sorts, such as manga, audio compilations containing the OSTs in CDs, novellas, Action figures and gadgets. The game that we are about to deal with in this review, developed by Atlus Co., like its predecessors with the same suffix, is a spin-off of the Shin Megami Tensei saga, which has always been characterized by ~strong~ themes (just think for example of the way in which one summons one's demons) and deliberately dark. The hard life of the Japanese teenager Persona 3 is set in modern Japan, in the year 2009. The protagonist of the game, needless to say, a young orphaned student of Gekkoukan High School, who returns to his old hometown, Tatsumi Port Island. Without spoiling too much on the beautiful plot, let's just say that once he reaches his destination and following some events, the boy is attacked by the Shadows, creatures that move at night and feed on the minds of their victims. The suffered attack awakens in him the power of his Persona, Orpheus, with the help of which he defeats his enemies. In the game, the term Persona indicates a part of the soul of an individual who takes the form of a monster, a demon, and who fights after the owner summons it, usually shooting himself in the head with a gun called the Evoker. Soon the young man will discover that his other schoolmates (initially Mitsuru, Akihiko and Yukari - Ed) share this power with him, becoming part of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (SEES), a ~team~ that fights against the creatures of above. A Shenmue in horror sauce Like almost all the best newly developed J-RPGs, Persona 3 can also count on a solid foundation in terms of gameplay. It is essentially characterized by two distinct but complementary game phases: a daily life simulator in which the protagonist goes to school, relates to classmates and teachers, etc., and a traditional role-playing game, made up of fights and level-ups. Basically everything is focused on the so-called Calendar System, an element that consequently structures the adventure in periods, following a ~normal~ calendar, in which months, days and hours follow one another as in real life. In particular, each day is divided into three main parts (and seven ~sub-parts~): day (Early Morning, Morning, LunchTime, Afternoon), evening (After School and Evening) and ~dark hour~. During the two main daily moments, the player can live the life of a normal Japanese teenager through the Pg, going to school as told, attending clubs, bars, going out with friends or even playing (ideally, in reality it doesn't really happen ) with an MMORPG called Devil Buster. All this does not have a purely playful function, but a very specific purpose: what you do during the day then influences, through the Community System (or Social Link), what happens at night. Knowing how to move at school or in the streets of the city, in fact, serves to recruit new elements of the party as well as to refine the understanding with those already belonging to it, and to find new Personas to merge. Social Links During the game, in fact, you can meet various ~random~ characters among others. Each of them, just over twenty, is associated with a type of social link (and respective Tarot Card), which in turn is divided into 10 levels. Talking to them after meeting them, listening to their stories, their fears, but also helping them if it is possible means increasing one's ~social~ level (specifically three parameters: Intelligence, Charm and Courage) and therefore obtaining their sympathy, friendship and alliance, as well as advantages in creating and managing ~Persona~. In fact, the higher the level of the Social Link, the greater the bonus of experience points that we will have available for the creation or evolution of a creature in the Velvet Room (which we will talk about later). Once the maximum level of 10 of a Pg's Social Link has been reached, a very powerful Persona can be obtained for that specific card. The battle system All in anticipation and function of the dark hour. The latter is none other than a magical-temporal moment that takes place between the end of one day and the beginning of the next, at the stroke of midnight, when an enormous tower called Tartarus emerges from nowhere inside theschool attended by our heroes. This building, made up of 256 randomly generated floors, can also be explored by dividing the party to quickly cover the area, and is infested with monsters of all kinds, all visible on the screen and therefore avoidable, as far as possible, if you don't want to face them (there are no random fights). Here the 12 shadows to be eliminated each time will be searched. In some floors, placed in strategic points, there are then ~access points~ and ~terminal points~ from which the player can go back to the beginning or move to other areas without having to redo the same path every time. The fights take place, as usual, in turns. However, the player can only control the main Pg, while the companions are managed by the CPU. However, it is possible to give them simplified orders, such as ~Stand By~ or ~Full Assault~ for example, to obtain some tactical support from the team. The battle is managed through a special circular menu located at the bottom left of the screen, from where it is possible to select the various options available, including ~Attack~ (physical attacks), ~Skills~ (these are the special abilities associated with those of the equipped), Tactics and Persona (assigns a new creature to the PC). The latter obviously only applies to the main character, the only one who can recruit more People and change them in battle. Angels and Demons The combat system is characterized by the interesting ~One More !~. Each enemy has its own weak point which can be linked to an element (fire, ice, however indicated here with specific names such as Agi or Bufu for example), a weapon, a specific move, etc. If a party member manages to exploit one of the vulnerabilities in question on an opponent, he will go into ~down~ status while the other will get an ~extra turn~ which will allow him to immediately perform another attack. If all enemies are reduced to this state, the gamer will then be able to perform a powerful ~All Out Attack~, a sort of combo performed by all characters simultaneously, capable of literally wiping out the opposing party. Another interesting element of the SMT: P3 battle system is linked to the particular parameter that manages the physical conditions of the party members. This aspect monitors the status of each individual based on four levels: ~great~, ~good~, ~tired~ and ~sick~. If a character is in one of the last two conditions, his contribution during the clashes is practically nil, as he is weaker to enemy blows and less reactive than usual. It can also infect other members of the group. At the end of each fight, in addition to the usual points, new Personas or additional experience points, yen, energy items, and weapons can be obtained through a ~bonus card game~. Even the ~souls~ earned in this way can be merged with each other to generate new and theoretically more powerful ones, inside the Velvet Room we mentioned earlier, a room along the lines of the old Resident Evil rescue rooms, and where all fans of the saga will find an old acquaintance: Igor, in this case assisted by an attractive assistant named Elizabeth, the one who in addition to having tutorial-guide functions, helps the user to manage the ~souls~ and the parameters of the Pg, as well as assigning some sub-quests. Graphics and sound The in-game graphics are certainly not the flagship of Persona 3. However, its particular style is liked and in our opinion it performs its ~duty~ perfectly. In fact, it goes well with the splendid cut-scenes made in perfect anime style and, overall, with the semi-deformed style of the character design. Although it may be a bit old-fashioned, ultimately, it satisfies the player's eyesight. The animations, on the other hand, are always fluid even in the most agitated phases and the effects of light or magic. As far as the sound sector is concerned, however, the Atlus title surprises with the high quality and originality of the soundtrack. The latter is not typical of role-playing games, but presents rock, pop, jazz and hip-hop songs based on the situations in which you find yourself. For example, in certain battles it is easy to listen to a rocking piece in the background that perhaps breaks the slow and monotonous rhythm of the ~solo piano~ that accompanied the exploration of an area up to a moment before. Often these songs are also sung and in various languages such as Chinese, Japanese or English by the various artists. Comment PlayStation 2 is still confirmed as the undisputed queen platform of J-RPGs, waiting to see big exponents also on current consoles. Persona 3 is in fact the confirmation, a further jewel that goes to set itself in the already rich crown ofthe Sony monolith. It is not a game for everyone, given the complexity of the gameplay and the duration for some perhaps excessive, but certainly one of those perfect titles for fans of the genre. Deep, long-lived, complete, the Atlus title seems to be free from real defects, therefore, in the hope that it will soon be available in a localized version for our market, or at least PAL, our final judgment on it cannot but be very positive. Pros: Great texture. Deep and fulfilling gameplay. Great longevity. Cons: Not for casual gamers. Exploratory phases perhaps a little repetitive in the long run.", "date": "2007-10-10", "grade": null}
