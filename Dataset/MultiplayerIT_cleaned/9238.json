Sure, the war elephants of modern conflicts have always made some appearances in FPS and dominate the multiplayer of the various Battlefields but they haven't had a title dedicated to them for a long time. World of Tanks fills this gap and does so by also bringing a breath of fresh air to the competitive online world. In fact, the Wargaming.net title tries to recreate credible skirmishes between tanks without aspiring to simulation but still managing to create something convincing and articulated. It is no coincidence that one of the most important elements is teamwork, which absolutely cannot be overlooked. On the other hand, being in an open field with ten tons of steel to move and with fifteen guns aiming at us is something to be avoided at all costs. For this it is necessary to move taking into account the position of the companions and alternating the third and first person view to keep an eye on as much land as possible. The controls are quite simple and the interface is intuitive, but the learning curve is not immediate and it is advisable to start from the training mode to understand the mechanics of the title. In fact, although World of Tanks is not a simulation it is credible and articulated, it allows us to take advantage of the covers to the thousandth and allows us to carry out a large type of military maneuvers which are often essential for winning. Without traps, evasion maneuvers and covers it is difficult to get by and to have an overview of what is happening it is essential to keep an eye on the minimap. The second fundamental component is the possibility of buying and upgrading the tanks, obviously combined with the possibility of choosing the appropriate means according to the tactic we want to implement or the team with which we find ourselves fighting. The meat in the fire is really a lot and the title offers a wide variety of tanks of different tonnage flanked by anti-tank vehicles and by the vulnerable but lethal mobile artillery. To acquire upgrades, which also include crew whose members can obtain special abilities, you need to earn experience and credits. But it is also possible to take the usual shortcut offered by all free to play titles. We are talking about the use of real money which allows us to create a custom tank instantly. Obviously, as usual, we recommend that you evaluate your purchases well: first of all for the sake of your wallet and secondly because the seemingly tempting shortcuts often cut off satisfaction. Another way is that of the premium account which for about 10 euros a month (but it can also be done for a single day) guarantees some extra social options and 50% more credits and experience for each battle. But the subscription price appears quite high considering that the MMO component is decidedly limited. Small skirmishes and global war The random multiplayer selects players based on their connection and does a great job of sorting out latencies. In addition, the title implements aim assist to balance any connection disparities. Unfortunately, however, the netcode has other problems including several glitches and an annoying bug relating to the visibility of the tanks which often makes both opponents and companions invisible by transforming them into green and red counters. Defects to be fixed as soon as possible via patch. The Standard Battle mode, which randomly assigns a player to two teams of 15 contenders, is obviously not the only one available. In fact, to raise the level of challenge there are the Team Battles that allow you to set up an organized team and there is also a training mode to take measures with the title without wasting resources. But the most interesting mode, still in the beta phase, is undoubtedly the Ultimate Conquest which allows you to wage wars between clans. To participate it is necessary to have a clan of 15 players who have brought the tanks to tier 5. Once you enter the game, a map of Europe opens which is divided into provinces and each territory guarantees a monetary income, which varies according to the importance and to the clan that occupies it. Movements on the strategic map can be made by clan leaders and must be carefully considered as it is only possible to move once per day. Empty territories are conquered automatically, already occupied ones must be taken by force in a chariot battle. But the potential of this feature goes far beyond the simple aping of the componentsi strategic by allowing 100 clans to share a given scenario. In fact, each faction can make alliances, non-aggression pacts and treaties to allow another clan to pass through the territory. Currently, as we have anticipated, only a part of Europe is available but new territories will soon be introduced. Obviously this mode poses two obstacles since it requires a lot of time available and an organized clan. But for the second problem the solution should be at hand since World of Tanks has exceeded 3,000,000 players and has more than 1500 active clans. The bodywork is everything The technical sector enhances the appearance of the tanks which are decidedly faithful to the real counterparts with lots of details and engine smoke, moreover the vehicles are surrounded by an excellently made grass area which further improves the overall effect. On the contrary, the environmental textures are nothing special, but the title offers one-square-kilometre maps full of buildings and houses and the sacrifice of a part of the graphics is necessary to allow the maximum possible view distance. An element that in a title of this kind must necessarily be pushed to the maximum. In any case, the overall result is quite positive and very well supports the illusion of being in the middle of a battle between tanks. Among the features of the engine there is also the destructibility of part of the scenery. And even if the physics and aesthetic qualities of this feature are not at the top, the satisfaction of being able to devastate walls and structures with the tracks while advancing towards the front remains intact. The graphics engine is scalable but not enough to take advantage of video cards released in the last three years. In fact, the maximum requirements are too modest and a 9800 is enough to travel without problems with all settings at maximum. From an audio point of view, World of Tanks offers good sound effects and symphonic background music that give the right military flavor to everything. Nothing exceptional but just enough to support the atmosphere of the title. The invisibility bug There are some workarounds that in several cases have made it possible to solve the problem of the invisibility of tanks that appeared in version 6.4. If you have an Nvidia card, the advice is to try the Forceware 270.61 drivers. In some cases, however, the problem disappeared by manually installing the latest DirectX. Finally, some users have circumvented the bug by lowering the graphic settings of the title.", "date": "2011-06-16", "grade": "8.5"}
