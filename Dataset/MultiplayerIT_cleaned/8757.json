We are in the Alpha Centauri time zone. Which isn't so melted down, but it doesn't matter. It hurts to say it, but the rate of litigation among the species of the universe is very high. We mean, have you ever heard of people who, having met at the sixth stellar crossing of Polaris, the one immediately after the wookie dwarf underwear store, started chatting amiably instead of shooting at each other? Hello, how are you, how are the children, how is the sixth arm of the little one? Never be! According to the theory of communicating vessels, the large spaceship, also called astrosuv, serves to compensate for poor performance in the number one field. Thing is, if you're cruising through the stars in a utility spaceship, you're blown away by the first passing tin giant, whether you're as cute as E.T., or look like a human. The scenario of Stellar Impact, a free2play real-time strategy game, does not differ much from what is described above: two warring factions, the Axis and the Alliance (which are very original), each with its own technologies and means, contend for a fragment of universe because in 15 billion light-years of space they have not found another place to live. Any excuse is good to stage a nice PvP. Menus and tutorials Once the game is started, you are on a general screen where you can choose which faction to belong to and control the spaceship of the selected class, using the objects collected during the missions (turrets, shields or upgraded ammunition). There are five classes for each faction, each with main and secondary skills that characterize it. The spaceships of a given class are equivalent for both factions, while the three-dimensional models are very different and, expressing a rough judgment, decidedly well done, with numerous details to enrich the hulls. However, before starting to battle with other players, let's select the tutorial to understand how the game is. Unfortunately we are faced with long text screens, divided into numerous chapters and sub-chapters, which explain all the game mechanics, but which take a long time to read. An interactive tutorial would have been appreciated, perhaps with different levels of depth of the topics covered, as happens in many other similar titles, but we are stoic and intellectually advanced and we didn't complain too much. In fact, on the second text screen, we closed the tutorial looking for an offline mode to study the game a little before diving into the online game. Unfortunately there is no way to train alone, so we just have to find a server and start playing for real. Starting the first online game we discovered that, in reality, there is an in-game tutorial, but it is simply the replica of what can be read on the general screen placed in a small window at the top of the screen. Unfortunately the action does not allow you to start reading and we closed the window dedicating ourselves to our first space battle. Stellar Impact is a free2play game, meaning it can be played and enjoyed without spending a single euro. However, if you want, you can buy a premium account which gives you various advantages, which are essential if you want to compete against the strongest players, also because they concern level growth and the unlocking of some particularly powerful objects. However, the price to pay is not very expensive, given that a premium account takes home just 14.95. If desired, two DLCs are already available, Support ship and The Carrier, which add two classes to the game. They cost 4.95 each. Game skills Now, before talking about the gameplay, we have to make a premise. Currently Stellar Impact is not very played. This translates into a great difficulty in finding active games to enter. The most active players are the international ones and unfortunately the matches are often plagued by a deadly lag. Once inside, it turns out that you can play quite easily even without having read anything. The control system is very similar to that of the old and never forgotten Homeworld, probably the first source of inspiration of the Stellar Impact developers. Despite the underlying complexity, the first impact with the gameplay is positive, in the sense that in a short time you learn to maneuver the spaceship and to use weapons and skills and you are immediately projected into the action. Of course, learning to play is another matter altogether. The ship can be rotated left or right to line up with targets or to dodge incoming shots. Getting a maneuver wrong means being in the center of enemy fire, being targeted by other players. Of course, there are additional movements that allow you to get out of the way, such as askill that allows you to teleport to another point of the map, or there are shields that, when activated, reduce the damage suffered, but if you don't learn to go around the maps without ending up against an asteroid or without giving the idea of not knowing exactly what you are doing, the conclusion will always be the same: a smoking carcass floating around in space. Base and resources However, the focus of the game is team play. The fights are very important, but without a good team you go nowhere. In each level there are objectives to conquer, such as crystals or science centers. Doing it is very simple: just reach them with spaceships and wait for the capture bar to fill up. Obviously the most difficult part, when by now the factions have defined the preliminary distribution of resources, clearly visible in the map at the bottom right of the screen, is being able to defend all the key positions to win, perhaps conquering the enemy ones to speed up the process. Different elements are distributed on the maps that can help or hinder during the battle. For example, asteroid fields damage your hull, while nebulae make for a convenient hiding place when you're badly damaged or want to try a surprise attack. In case the conditions of the ship are critical, it is possible to return to the base to repair it, or to be destroyed and wait for the half minute that separates us from the respawn. The base also has other functions, the main of which is the improvement of skills, if you have enough points, but technological research should not be underestimated, which is essential for having the most powerful weapons. From a technical point of view, Stellar Impact will run on Unity and, despite the aforementioned beauty of the spaceships, it just does its dirty work without too many peaks. By zooming the camera, you can try to have more pleasant shots of objects floating in space, but in general it is difficult to waste time looking for shows for the eyes, apart from in moments of pause, because the game requires a very high attention on what that surrounds us.", "date": "2012-02-15", "grade": "8.4"}
