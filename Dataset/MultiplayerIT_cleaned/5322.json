{"name": "Campioni di simpatia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/173208-champions-of-anteria-campioni-di-simpatia.html", "text": "Blue Byte is the historic German software house responsible for two extremely famous sagas in northern Europe, so much so that it has kept its name even following the acquisition of Ubisoft, which took place at the beginning of the millennium. They are that of Battle Isle (which stopped in 2001 with Andosia War: a reboot was planned whose development was blocked in 2014) and above all that of the Settlers which has experienced alternating successes up to the present day. It is therefore somewhat surprising to discover a new intellectual property by the Dusseldorf studios, the first from Extreme Assault, an action dated 1997. As we were able to underline in our recent preview, there is no need to be fooled because this Champions of Anteria it is actually a rib of what should have been the eighth episode of Settlers which, after running the real risk of being canceled perhaps because it is too far from the dictates of the famous management system, has been taken up and packaged over the last few months. There is too much meat in the fire, with the result that neither of Anteria's two souls can convince Violent punches No one expects a first-rate plot from a strategy title, so it's nice to see that in Germany they have declined the usual and specious conflict with the bad guy in an ironic key. In fact, our paladins are the knight Vargus, the archer Nusula and the monk Anselm, expelled from his order as he is guilty of having converted to the vegan creed. The three are bored to death because they don't find bad enough ~bad~ villains to beat them like a thrashing: understandable therefore the enthusiasm in facing a new and demanding challenge in which the likeable thief Bryan, the narrator of the story, hunts them pilloried by a powerful wizard. The challenge is obviously to restore order to the native lands and become champions of Anteria: in this mission they will soon be joined by two other freaks, namely the vagabond Baltasar and the warrior Oona. To achieve the objective it is necessary to commit oneself on two fronts: on the one hand there is a macroeconomic profile that betrays the ~Settlerian~ origins; on the other a MOBA-style section in which to lead the team to liberate the territories. Double-sided The map develops similarly to that of Risk: it starts with a small region located in the center that must be expanded by conquering the neighboring ones. Just like in the famous board game, progress is cadenced by shifts that correspond to 24 hours; with the dawn of the new day, both the resources produced by the capital and those brought as a dowry by the controlled regions enter the state coffers. At this point, as per Blue Byte tradition, things get complicated. The five elements on which the mechanics of Champions of Anteria are based are produced from special buildings and for each of these there is a dedicated structure. Gold and fame come from the latter. Not having armies to manage, the only real purpose of the structures is to make upgrades for the heroes: both weapons and armor that permanently modify the warriors' statistics, and potions and other trinkets to be used once that prove to be equally fundamental for the good success of the mission. Obviously not everything is available right from the start: the list of upgrades must be released using the fame points that allow you to develop a very long skill tree. It is a very cumbersome and cumbersome structure: in order to build a simple ballista to be placed on the battlefield, it is first necessary to unlock the blacksmith skill; you must then materially build a forge (which will produce metallic material); later use the fame points to activate the master engineer and then build the scientist's laboratory. Only at this point, provided you have enough iron and money, will it be possible to create the coveted ballista. Mind you that this is one of the first and basic units: as the game progresses, the ramifications are amplified more and more and it can really become complicated to follow them all. After having done the tedious microeconomic practices, you can go back to the game map (or rather to the maps: there are four levels set in as many scenarios) and decide where and how to move. If you wish, you could wait a few turns before declaring war, but stalling means exposing yourself to the strengthening of the enemy ranks and a possible counterattack: artificial intelligence is very skilled in always keeping the player under pressure who can never rest on his laurels. Each area corresponds to a mission: in addition to the obvious and basic conquests obtained, it destroysndo the enemy units the menu varies including escorts, rescues, sieges. There are also end-of-level bosses. The victories, rather than increasing the experience of the champions, serve as written above to expand one's domain and consequently earn a greater number of fame points with which to obtain upgrades. Take this Once you have spotted the next prey, you need to form the small group to be sent to the slaughterhouse, drawing three of the five heroes available. Each of these possesses control of an element, and the balance between the forces of nature underlies the logic of the Blue Byte title. Water wins over fire, which instead has the upper hand over metal. The latter defeats nature which stands up to the electricity it puts under water, and thus the circle is completed. The party must therefore be composed keeping in mind this sort of enlarged Chinese paper. Adding Baltasar to the team, who does well against armored enemies, would not make much sense if the area is populated mostly by aquatic monsters. As mentioned, the game structure resembles that of League of Legends or DOTA 2, with the difference that you control three characters, which makes the game rhythms much more staid for a fundamental reason: the basic attacks are practically useless. To get the better of it, you need to heavily exploit the special abilities specific to each hero and it would be practically impossible to coordinate them all in real time: for this reason, the game pauses before each fight. A classic RTS-style approach is out of the question because the difficulty rate, even when set to normal level, is challenging. Even the most trivial duel can turn into a real bloodbath: considering that, apart from the highly requested healing potions with which it is decisive to fill one of the four inventory slots, there is no way to recover vitality, the risk to lose all the men and consequently the territory is always very high. Attacks must be coordinated in order to exploit the imbalances in the forces of nature, often avoiding team play. Each hero must contend with the opponent most vulnerable to their abilities, even if it means being at the mercy of the others. The result is extremely tactical and very little carefree matches, in spite of the light-hearted tone of which the Blue Byte production is permeated. The risk of frustration is always lurking both because there are no evasive maneuvers and because other groups of enemies who initially patrolled a more distant point and who were not thought could reach the vicinity of the battle scene often join the party. As long as the relationship between the two factions remains just below parity, it is conceivable to have the upper hand; as soon as the number of opponents exceeds five units, defeat is practically certain, especially when it comes to enemies belonging to a single kingdom. Colorful me The artistic realization of Champions of Anteria is pleasant and endowed with a good personality, even if not exactly new: the designers have embraced the light line dictated by the script, allowing themselves to be influenced by the stylistic elements from World of Warcraft, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and Bastion. The scenarios are very colorful even if not exaggeratedly rich in details: the textures and special effects are of good quality. It cannot be said that there is something out of place: the flaw lies in the characterization of the enemies and player characters, who would have deserved a few more polishes. The audio sector is also on decent levels, with a somewhat anonymous soundtrack compensated by a commendable dubbing and the ~sfx~ always in the right place. Around Dussledorf, years of apprenticeship have been made and it is very difficult for them to get lost on certain details: what is still missing is a slight optimization for mid-range systems that could find some difficulty in bringing the detail settings up. The gameplay partially reflects the flaws of the management part and is not easily digestible: the coup de grace was to focus on the logic of the Chinese morra which sterilizes many combat tactics. Even the furious reference to the tactical pause does not go well with the Risiko philosophy at all, above all because the painstakingly acquired territories are constantly subject to attacks by (good) artificial intelligence and thinking of retracing one's steps is the last of the wishes of any player who has a little self-respect. On the other hand, the longevity is excellent, even if limited to a single game (there is no multiplayer mode). However, it takes a lot of dedication to the cause.", "date": "2016-08-31", "grade": "6.5"}
