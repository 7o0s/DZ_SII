{"name": "Yetisports Games Pack vol.1", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yetisports-games-pack-vol1.html", "text": "Games developed in Flash are a genre that makes its own story, and which in recent years has somewhat revolutionized the concept of ~pastime~ on the internet. These are generally free applications, with a rather simple structure, which can be used even for a few minutes; and the Yetisports series is a prime example. Created in 2004 by the hand of Chris Hilgert, it is based on the likeable character of a yeti who, for fun, torments penguins in absurd and imaginative ways: he ~pins~ them against targets by hitting them with snowballs, plays baseball with them, throws them air and so on. The success of these minigames even led to the creation of a title based on them for PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, namely Yetisports Arctic Adventure, released in 2005: certainly not an unforgettable masterpiece, on the contrary. The yeti tries again today with mobile gaming: Yetisports Games Pack is a collection (divided into volumes) of the various episodes of the series, which can therefore be played by owners of Java-compatible devices exactly like the original Flash versions. Developed by Xendex, this ~volume 1~ is a collection of the first four minigames of the Yetisports series: ~Pingu Throw~, ~Orca Slap~, ~Seal Bounce~ and ~Albatros Overload~, the latter modified for the occasion. In ~Pingu Throw~, we will find ourselves controlling the yeti while he plays baseball using the penguins as balls: we will simply have to press the 5 key at the right moment to swing, then observe the flight of the penguin with the possibility of tilting it clockwise or counterclockwise to increase the distance of the throw, which at the end will be memorized and placed in the records. In the ~Orga Slap~ minigame we will instead move on to target shooting: an orca will throw the penguins into the air, which we will have to hit with a snowball to ~nail~ them to a board placed in the background. Timing it right will result in an eventual perfect center. ~Seal Bounce~ is a bit of a reinterpretation of the first minigame, in the sense that we will always have to hit the penguins with a club, but in this case the goal will be to get them as high as possible, helped in the enterprise by a group of seals that will make the poor birds bounce every time they touch the ice walls. Finally, ~Albatros Overload~ also presents itself as a variant of the first episode, only that in this case the launch will be supported by some albatrosses who will carry the ~bullet~ of the moment. On mobile, however, we will find the roles reversed: the penguins will hit the yeti and make him fly far away... The technical implementation of the game is discreet, certainly above average but caged in a structure that is too static and limited to be able to aspire to better results. The sprites are evidently pre-rendered in 3D, but the effect on the mobile screen is anything but spectacular, particularly due to the too woody and never fluid animations. The locations are what they are, white obviously reigns supreme but there is a lack of details and moving objects in the background. The sound is composed of moderately made MIDI music, accompanied by nice sampled effects but very limited in number. The response to the commands is precise enough not to represent a limit, finally. PRO Simple and immediate Very faithful to the original AGAINST Gameplay too limited Technically far from spectacular Poor longevity", "date": "2008-12-05", "grade": "S.V."}
