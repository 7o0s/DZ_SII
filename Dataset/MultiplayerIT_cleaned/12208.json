{"name": "Bust a Move - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bust-a-move-recensione.html", "text": "A remote control shoots bubbles What makes the appearance of this brand on the Wii curious is obviously the use of the wiimote as a control device. The developers have abandoned (not entirely, and then we'll see why) the classic levers and arrows of the pad to support the features of the Nintendo remote control, and they did so by opting for different configurations. In the control options we will have three choices, the first two configurations are identical except for the viewfinder which will or will not appear on the screen, and it is basically a question of pointing the wiimote at the TV and consequently moving the arrow that shoots bubbles, which will always aim towards your direction. Basically the bubble will be shot at the point where you are aiming and which you will see represented with a circular viewfinder. The system is immediately natural and reactive, precise to the pixel and even more comfortable than the classic system where, for precision shots, one finds oneself correcting the direction of the arrow by giving small strokes on the pad. What you will immediately notice, however, is that at least for direct shots, the game is too easy: in fact, it is enough to position the viewfinder between the desired bubbles and see the shot ball settle on top of the others without the possibility of error. This is why the second control system eliminates the viewfinder. In this way you will play as in the first configuration, but without having a visual reference of where you are aiming, and you will have to rely as always on the trajectory of the needle. The only drawback is that sometimes you lose the orientation of the pointer and without realizing it you find yourself complicating the situation yourself, but all you need is a little care and practice with the Wii to avoid any problems. The only doubt about this new control system, therefore, arises from the physical fatigue to which the wrist in perpetual motion is subjected, but frankly in our tests we got tired of the game sooner than of the controller, which, thanks to the infamous system of ~One more time and I'll stop~, pushed us to continue from level to level until boredom sets in: it was more the effort to get up to put everything back. One sensor for eight There is also a third control system, which instead takes advantage of the internal accelerometer. The controller must be positioned vertically and will therefore be tilted to the right and left as if you were holding the arrow that traces the direction on the game. This choice compared to the previous ones is undoubtedly not only less convenient, but also less precise. There is a small delay in the response, which, however minimal, is still noticeable, and a certain uncertainty during the movements where we will see the trajectory making small hops. The only reason therefore to prefer this system lies in the 8-player multiplayer mode. In fact, only the first 4 players (assuming you have 4 wiimote) will be able to point the screen, the others will have to settle for the nunchuk connected to the main controller or the limit of the classic pad. If the other competitors use the Nintendo ~pear~ you could opt for an identical control for everyone so as not to benefit anyone, even if in truth in multiplayer a more precise control is not likely to favor that much. In fact, Happy Happenings used the formula of ~chaos is beautiful~, and churned out a rather frenetic and certainly chaotic multiplayer. Whether you play in 2 or in 8, the setting is always the same, common screen for everyone and countdown at the top. Meanwhile players will have to drop more balls than the others and collect bonuses by hitting the UFOs that flutter around the screen. The more the number of players rises (they can also be set as bots) the more confusion increases, up to the moment in which we will start shooting at random because something happens anyway, and in any case at times everything is too fast, unstable, to be able to reason a tactic. Occasionally there's the right ball stuck at the right time to tip the tables in your favor, but most of the time it's a big, averagely fun mess. The game The mechanics of Bust-a-Move are now also known by Mike Bongiorno's housewives, and this episode makes no difference. You have to eliminate all the marbles from the area by piling up three of the same color, while the ceiling descends menacingly from above, bringing us closer to game over. The graphics are brilliant, clean and clear (a bit difficult to interpret only in the stages with the most distant zoom level), but completely in 2d, and if you think it could be a limitation for a puzzle game then you can change your reading immediately. The audio meekly and discreetly accompanies the moments of the game with the jingles and classic rhythms of the series. Levelso the developers limited themselves to doing what was necessary to make the game enjoyable, saving on artistic and technical ambitions. The game options on the contrary are rather limited, and this is probably the biggest drawback of the title. Single mode and multiplayer mode. I have already talked about the game in company, while for the single player campaign you already know what to expect. What you will be pleased to read is that the game is made up of 500 levels, of which the second half will only be accessible by completing the first 250 stages. Comment Bust-a-Move on Wii is the same Bust-a-Move found on all other platforms. It doesn't change the formula, and it doesn't get more original or funnier. If you are a fetishist of the game and can't help but play it in every sauce, if you want to have fun in the company of the many casual players who never disdain a game of Puzzle Bobble, then this episode on Wii is for you. Having said that, you shouldn't feel fascinated by the new control system, which if it is true that it changes the way you fly the bubbles, however it doesn't change the substance of the game. It is certainly a plus, but in the scale of judgment it must weigh less than your innate desire for bubbles and dragons. Pros 500 levels Multiplayer up to eight for party nights Cons The multiplayer is confusing, and there is no classic versus The game is the same as always And the modes are scarce Bust-a-Move (or Puzzle Bobble) is for the 90s what Tetris was in the 80s, it is the puzzle that made it, the one that emerges from the crowd and becomes a classic. From the first episodes for the arcade, the spin-off of the two bubble-shooting dragons has reached practically all available platforms, varying from time to time in small details, in search of the perfect balance that had probably already been achieved at the first shot. The rest, therefore, is needed more than anything else to continue playing it.", "date": "2007-06-12", "grade": null}
