{"name": "Burnout Revenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/burnout-revenge.html", "text": "Four times crash Right from the very first bars, Burnout Revenge highlights some elements of break with the third chapter, presenting a graphic style of the urban and cool menus: a vaguely more adult and dark imprint that is substantially reflected on every audiovisual aspect of the game, and which manifests glaringly in the look of the various routes. Beyond the characteristics of the eight different environments (fortunately endowed with greater variety and personality than those of the prequel), the most visible element of the track design of Burnout Revenge lies in the structural complexity of the tracks themselves, now full of shortcuts, secondary roads, half-hidden lanes and ramps of all kinds. In addition to being scenically impressive and very fun to ride at breakneck speed, the branches are perfectly suited to the new playful mechanisms of Revenge, which incite even more wild sporting against opponents. The first clue in this regard is the introduction of the exciting vertical takedowns, which can be carried out as it is easy to assume by ~landing~ on an enemy car following a jump. But this is only the tip of the iceberg of a significantly modified gameplay in order to maximize the spectacularity and the clashes and at the same time to reduce the fears of repetitiveness and frustration. In this sense, the new role of Burnout Revenge traffic assumes great importance, decidedly less dense than in previous editions and above all with a more active part within the game economy. In fact, cars traveling in the same direction as us can now be beautifully rammed, slightly slowing down the user's march but giving him two advantages: the accumulation of boosts and the possibility of exploiting the trajectory of the hit vehicles to his advantage to hit the opponents who precede him or bar the way for those who follow him. An important novelty, so much so that it has carved out an ad hoc competition (Traffic Attack) within the World Tour mode dedicated precisely to the destruction of as many cars as possible that are part of the traffic. Although initially unsettling, this aspect of Burnout Revenge convinces more and more game after game, adding further thicknesses of adrenaline and risk to an already electrifying product. Caution first Burnout Revenge therefore pushes the limits set by the third chapter further forward in terms of sensation of speed and frenzy of the action, also thanks to a decidedly rich fleet of machines in quantitative and qualitative terms. Having abandoned the subdivisions into classes, the Revenge cars - which can always be unlocked by completing the World Tour events - display statistics relating to maximum speed, weight (which influences drifting and takedown capacity) and the power of the Crashbreaker, allowing the user a more informed choice and indicated to the characteristics of the race he has to face. In addition to being very fast already from the first specimens, then, the various racing cars finally have a truly aggressive and captivating design, to the point of not regretting the absence of licenses from noble car manufacturers. However, the car department is certainly not the only aspect in which Burnout Revenge proves to be more convincing than its predecessor, also considering how the entire World Tour mode has undergone a significant restyling. No longer scattered on a globe, the races (which reach the beauty of 169 units) are divided between 11 ranks, which can be unlocked as equal skill levels are reached. This is made possible by obtaining stars at the end of each race, which are awarded to the user based on his aggressiveness on the road, providing yet another incentive for crazy driving: drifts, jumps, takedowns, counter traffic, collisions with traffic and prolonged donations of boost all contribute to the increase of the final rating, whose maximum ceiling is made up of four stars, with a bonus of an additional unit by obtaining gold and an equal and opposite malus by bringing home a modest bronze. Caution first A system that works, while failing to completely eliminate the feeling of repetitiveness that in the long run inevitably weighs down the excellent World Tour mode, formed as usual by events such as Race, Burning Lap, Eliminator, Road Rage, Crash plus the unpublished Traffic Attack and with the introduction of the Crashbreaker option in the more advanced levels (that is, the possibility of blowing up one's car following a takedown in order to involve the opponents in the accident is added to competitions). The Crash section deserves a special mention, decidedly different from that of the prequel and ora closer to a real puzzle game: in fact, there are many more elements to consider in planning your own battle, starting from the choice of the car and passing through the strength and direction of the wind up to the ideal target on which to crash . Once the on-screen bonuses of Burnout 3 have disappeared, the multiple Crashbreakers make their appearance here, with the player's car capable of blowing itself up several times depending on the number of cars involved in the accident, all to the advantage of the overall score. More cumbersome and brainy although always extremely spectacular, the Crash mode of Burnout Revenge is perhaps the only aspect of the game really open to possible criticism compared to the prequel counterpart. PS2 vs Xbox On a purely technical level, there are few differences that distinguish the versions of Burnout Revenge, and they still fall within the traditional canons of the ~challenges~ between the two consoles, with the Microsoft one having a slight advantage in terms of graphic cleanliness and speed in loading. The differences are instead decidedly more tangible in the online offer, with the Playstation2 version penalized for the umpteenth time by the never too much criticized Sony network service. In short, for those with a choice, the advice is undoubtedly to jump into Burnout Revenge for Xbox. Terribly beautiful As previously mentioned, there are numerous elements that contribute to making Burnout Revenge even more ~extreme~ than the third chapter: the greater power of the cars, the presence of shortcuts and jumps, the new rating system, the possibility of using as a weapon, everything is part of a design designed to make the game even more exciting and adrenaline-pumping. And the Criterion developers have succeeded very well, also providing their production of decidedly tough and insistent opponents controlled by the AI: in this regard, precisely in order to foment competition and increase the chances of takedowns, there is a catch system -up such as never to distance the first too much from the pursuers, for the sake of global entertainment. Despite the satisfactory level of challenge of the single player mode, Burnout Revenge manages to give its best in terms of competition in the online multiplayer part, fortunately leaner and more intelligent than the one seen in the prequel. Up to a maximum of six users per room can challenge each other between races, Road Rage and various Crashes, with the addition of a ranking system a la Halo 2 (useful in optimatches to search for opponents at one's height) and a controversial subdivision into levels of individual players: as in offline, even here it is necessary to climb the rankings - albeit much more quickly - in order to be able to take advantage of the more powerful cars, a forcing that perhaps could have been avoided. Apart from this, however, the online multiplayer of Burnout Revenge works like a pleasure, exponentially enriched by those same game elements capable of making even the World Tour experience more exciting and frenetic. Speed is always and in any case the watchword in the Criterion title, which on a graphic level again manages in a masterful way to recreate the sensation of speeding at 200 km/h, thanks also to an unprecedented effect of trembling of the image which is decidedly spot on and effective. All obviously with an exceptional fluidity, which in no way compromises the beauty of the game scenarios, very well cared for and embellished with perfectly fitting color choices and absolutely remarkable light and refraction effects. As if a further embellishment of the tracks was not enough, those of Criterion have also improved the cosmetics of the cars, stylistically impeccable and moreover even more susceptible to deformation and loss of parts following the crashes, which, needless to say, continue to be spectacular. Even the sound sector proves to be superior to that of Burnout 3: having abandoned the -bad- idea of the DJ and the punk-rock tracks that didn't go well with the game action, Revenge offers a more varied and better integrated choice of music with the style of the Criterion title, even if the possibility for Xbox users to take advantage of their own playlist is always very tempting. Comment Burnout Revenge once again confirms Criterion's skill in renewing its franchise with spot-on ideas and almost always capable of obscuring the merits of the previous chapters. Thanks to a whole series of improvements and innovations, in fact, this fourth chapter does not struggle to establish itself as the best of the series, reaching peaks of spectacularity and pure fun that are difficult to reach from other similar productions. A purchase practicallyand obligatory for all lovers of speed. Pros: Even more spectacular and fun Improved online multiplayer Technically excellent Cons: Crash mode perhaps too cumbersome World Tour at times repetitive It is impossible not to recognize the Burnout series a marked uniqueness capable of distinguishing it from the many other course productions on the market. In fact, if the vast majority of car sagas usually proceed with sequels that improve while maintaining the original game structure unchanged, Burnout has so far been capable of always changing something in each chapter, without ever distorting the gameplay but offering new and exciting stimuli to the user. And this new Burnout Revenge makes absolutely no difference.", "date": "2005-10-04", "grade": null}
