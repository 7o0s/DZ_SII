More than on face-to-face clashes, in fact, the game focuses on tactics, stalking, studying situations before carrying out any intervention and finally on calculating times and variables when it comes to taking up a sniper rifle to eliminate a guard by trying not to alert his companions. Well, many of these assumptions are missing in Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army, the stand-alone expansion made exclusively for PC that puts us in front of an alternative reality in which Hitler, now cornered at the end of the second world war, does not accept defeat and orders his people to go to ~plan Z~, that is to use the knowledge acquired during years of monstrous experiments to bring dead German soldiers back to life and aim for the total destruction of allied troops, no matter what cost. It is therefore on the streets of a Berlin invaded by zombies that the American agent Karl Fairburne moves this time, possibly accompanied in the cooperative mode (a novelty of this expansion) by a German officer, a scientist and a Russian soldier, all united against this terrible threat. They are your nationals The co-op, available for up to four players, immediately proves to be the best way to enjoy the experience of Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army. Collaborating with others, coordinating actions, covering each other and trying together to counter the advance of the undead is much more fun than doing everything alone, as indeed it was reasonable to expect. However, the system developed by Rebellion is not free from defects, as for example it does not provide for the inclusion of new ~running~ players if one of our companions were to leave the ship prematurely. In case of defections, we will therefore be forced to complete the mission outnumbered, even if fortunately the balance of difficulty will be modified dynamically based on the characters on the field. In short, the best thing is to organize yourself with friends. Anyone wishing to play the campaign in single player, however, can do so without problems, even if in this situation the limits we mentioned at the beginning quickly emerge. Where the franchise has established certain criteria for approaching the third person shooter genre, with tactics, stalking and so on, it is clear that all this is missing when the enemies are gruesome creatures that slowly wander in our direction, moved by a primal instinct rather than any intelligence. On the one hand, the action twist represents an interesting test for those who have completed Sniper Elite V2 with pleasure and still have a great desire to blow up some skullcaps, with the challenge actually becoming intense during a couple of long and exhausting boss fights. At the same time, however, the limits of this choice quickly emerge, first of all the repetitiveness of the situations. Kill. Stop The exploration of the scenario is an optional component with respect to the central node, or rather the elimination of an incredibly high number of zombies, which during certain phases arrive in waves and from which we must defend ourselves using everything we have and quickly switching from the sniper rifle intermediate weapon (a light machine gun or shotgun), pistol, or explosives. In the most agitated phases, unfortunately, the tactical vocation of Sniper Elite clashes with the new approach and you find yourself in great difficulty, especially when the enemy is at a very short distance. Fortunately, things improve when we have a good view and wide spaces available, and the spectacular kill cam continues to enhance our target shooting by showing us an ~x-ray~ vision of the victim on duty: the rotten bones shatter, the heart and the internal organs, petrified, split, the bullets sometimes pierce a first zombie and hit a second one behind him. This is a winning feature, the frequency of which can be adjusted from the options screen. And speaking of options, it must be said that Rebellion has done a more than decent job with this PC expansion, which allows you not only to use the mouse / keyboard combination or the perfectly supported Xbox 360 controller, but also to adjust the graphics selecting the resolution and the level of graphic detail, the latter adjustable in detail with many itemsthat you can see in the image on the side, even including supersampling up to 4X. It is obviously a feature, the latter, to be activated only if you have a particularly performing configuration, because the repercussions on the frame rate are as evident as the improvement in visual quality. Otherwise, there are fairly evocative settings and a good choice of colors, but the lack of interaction gives the idea that it's all too fake, which is a real shame.", "date": "2013-03-06", "grade": "7.0"}
