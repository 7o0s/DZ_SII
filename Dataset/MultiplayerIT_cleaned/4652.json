Probably the possibility of adapting the interface so well to the interaction via touch screen, but also the natural adaptation of the game rhythm to the asynchronous multiplayer, in addition to the classic addiction that derives from that constant progression towards conquest that is typical of the genre. In any case, between tower defense, MOBAs, clickers and the like, smart platforms have not only represented fertile ground for the proliferation of a type of game that has ancient roots deeply connected to the PC, but they have also found their own and great success of the strategic concepts also exploiting - as often happens on the mobile front - experimental hybridizations between different types of game. Now the panorama is much more complex and codified than a few years ago and it is not easy to escape the cataloging imposed by the logic of genres and clones, but sometimes there are games that are able to go a little off the beaten track. This is the case of Stormbound: it is easy to think of Clash Royale when we speak of a strategy game in which two opposing armies must conquer the opponent's castle within a map with a limited extension, being to all intents and purposes a derivative of the MOBA, but reducing the title Kongregate to a clone of the famous spin-off by Supercell would be somewhat misleading. The premises and various elements of the development are in fact the same: also in this case we find two opposing castles, armies of different composition intent on conquering the opposing base and a card-based mechanics, but the characteristics here are mixed, modified and enriched up to to find a somewhat original formula. There is also a free-to-play system that appears decidedly generous, with an almost total absence of forcing towards micro-transactions, unless you necessarily want to compete at high levels in multiplayer and in the shortest possible time. Stormbound looks like a simple Clash Royale clone but hides several interesting surprises Storm of Knights The war takes place on a chessboard made up of 4x5 squares, divided by a line that represents the front of the battle and the maximum limit within which it is possible to deploy one's own troops. This moves towards one or the other castle based on the movement of the units, which occurs automatically towards the opposing castle, and on the progress of the clashes, thus favoring the advance of one or the other faction. Squads of soldiers, special weapons, fortifications or other correspond to cards to be drawn within a deck, randomly drawn in hands of five (with a limited possibility of exchanging one if necessary). As in Clash Royale, to deploy the cards we must keep in mind the expenditure of mana required by each of them, which must obviously remain within the available level, with refills that take place at each turn. This means that the most powerful and expensive cards can only be used sparingly and with some study in the consumption of energy from turn to turn or in the application of methods to be able to increase it. Within a general mechanics that is not entirely new, it is the balancing of the parts and the introduction of the front line variable that strongly characterizes the game experience in Stormbound: the trend of the clashes between the troops significantly modifies the balance of forces in the field, because the ground gained by the troops is reflected in a greater possibility of deploying elements in a tactical manner and ever closer to the opposing castle, thus obtaining a strategic advantage of great importance. The strong stylistic imprint given to the graphic sector helps to strengthen the identity of the game, even in the midst of a rather fierce competition within this genre: it is not just a question of the quality of the 3D and 2D lines, but also of the general design of the units and their characteristics, which create an interesting variety of solutions to be used in battle with a wide range of results, also thanks to the different degree of rarity of the cards to be conquered and used. The general complexity has the implication of a certain length of the clashes that could be badly associated with mobile use, but those who appreciate a healthy strategic experience with a traditional taste will have nothing to complain about.", "date": "2017-09-27", "grade": "8.0"}
