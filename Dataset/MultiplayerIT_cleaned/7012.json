{"name": "Poinpy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/poinpy-recensione.html", "text": "If you are a Netflix subscriber and want an immediate and original game to play on your smartphone, then Poinpy's review can show you a very valid solution, given that Ojiro Fumoto's work, distributed free of charge by the video service to subscribers, is really very valid. For those who don't know him, he is the author of the well-known Downwell, a platform-shooter centered on a constant fall down into a bottomless pit full of pitfalls and oddities, which we also rated very well in his review. Well, Poinpy in a certain sense takes something of the Downwell concept and overturns it, proposing a fundamentally opposite structure, given that in this case we find ourselves having to constantly climb upwards, from platform to platform. In some respects it recalls the good old Doodle Jump, as a vertical setting and for its being based on continuous jumps that lead higher and higher, but the mechanism here is quite different and original. There is not really a story, but a sort of ~situation~: Poinpy is a small jumping dinosaur who finds himself constantly having to flee from a gigantic blue creature that occupies the lower part of the screen and which must be appeased by constantly supplying it of fruit juice. This can be obtained from the fruits that are found around the levels, but must be collected according to particular ~recipes~ provided by the creatures and visible at the top of the screen. In fact, it is a question of collecting these fruits in the sequence that is illustrated, thus forcing one to make jumps according to certain trajectories that allow one to reach the right objects and in the correct sequence, otherwise the destructive fury of the blue creature will be unleashed, capable of filling the flame level. Shrug and jump Poinpy, some pictures of the game At this point it is clear how Fumoto has the ability to create an engaging gameplay starting from a few very simple elements, taking some ~fundamentals~ of the video game and customizing them enough to build a title that appears original and fun. If in Downwell it was above all about shooting and finding the right path in free fall, here we always find ourselves drawing trajectories, but in the opposite direction and with a mechanism that is totally different. In particular, playing for a few minutes it becomes clear what Poinpy is built on: it is a question of taking the classic swipe down gesture, which we use a thousand times a day to scroll the screen of a smartphone, and using it as an input system for a platform. In this way, an instinctive connection with the game mechanics is immediately created, which must then be refined by learning to calculate the rebounds against walls, enemies and elements of the scenario, but always remaining somehow familiar. The greatest difficulty lies in trying to stay in air for as long as possible in order to reach the fruits more easily, and to do this you must learn to exploit the rebounds against walls, enemies and objects in order to obtain ~extra~ pushes. It's not a simple thing because you have very limited time windows to set the trajectory and in the more advanced levels it takes very little to make a mistake, angering the blue monster and immediately reaching game over. Poinpy, three screenshots of the game There is also some progression given by the unlocking of power-ups that increase Poinpy's abilities, increasing the amount of jumps that can be performed in sequence or obtaining extra lives, while an interesting addition is provided by the Puzzle mode which is unlocked as the game progresses and introduces a decidedly different game system. A characterizing element of Poinpy is clearly its graphic style: also in this case we can recognize a search for the opposite compared to Downwell, whose identity was strongly marked by the use of black and white . In this case, however, the stylistic figure is given by a veritable feast of colours, with bright and almost irreverently contrasting shades, emphasizing a cartoonish and stylized design that recalls an illustrated children's book. A real pleasure for the eyes, which largely compensates for a rather repetitive and not very charismatic soundtrack.", "date": "2022-06-30", "grade": "8.4"}
