The developers therefore thought of playing it safe, creating a digital version of rummy with a group of cats as ~protagonists~ and organizing the experience so that, after a short tutorial, it was possible to challenge other users in online multiplayer in real time . A description that fits Shuffle Cats perfectly, available on the App Store and Google Play in the traditional freemium format. Once the game has started, with the usual possibility of logging in from Facebook and possibly involving our friends, we will be led by the hand in a series of missions against artificial intelligence, all for the sole purpose of learning the simple mechanisms of this interpretation of rummy. Two players face each other in front of a board, each with seven cards in hand and the aim of scoring ten points before the opponent. In turn, a card is drawn from the deck (covered or uncovered) and one is discarded, in the meantime trying to make three of a kind, straights (strictly of the same suit) or pokers. In short, the rules are very intuitive and a timer determines the duration of each move to avoid excessive delays, but there is a strategic substrate that should not be underestimated, which takes shape when perhaps we discard the same card of the other player to prevent him from taking advantage of it , or we use one of the various power-ups that can be unlocked as you level up: a score multiplier, an ~ice shot~ that blocks certain cards from the other deck, and so on. Shuffle Cats is a nice and fun card game, but with a limiting freemium model The cat goes to the lard anyway... The introductory phase of Shuffle Cats is very pleasant, you quickly familiarize yourself with the rules of the game and understand certain tactics, following a freemium path that sees us use a small amount of diamonds to start each game and ~bet~ the hard currency, gold bars, to participate in a minigame that allows you to get more precious stones. The problem is when the challenges with artificial intelligence end and we move on to the true nature of the experience proposed by King, that of a card game based on multiplayer in real time. There is no shortage of users to challenge, that's for sure, and the matchmaking works quickly and brilliantly, similar to that of Clash Royale, but the requirements in terms of diamonds rise exponentially, starting from quantities ten times higher than those requests in the introductory sequence, and gradually higher depending on the prize up for grabs, which always corresponds to diamonds. If you win, everything is fine, our coffers fill up and you can continue to challenge players, but if you lose, you have to wait the four hours necessary for the release of free diamonds or bet the few gold bars at our disposal to obtain some brilliant useful to be able to continue. Well packaged, with a happy intuition like that of cats for protagonists, equipped with a clear and understandable interface, Shuffle Cats therefore falls on the limitations of a ruthless freemium model.", "date": "2016-10-19", "grade": "6.0"}
