{"name": "Dr. Mario & Puzzle League", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dr-mario-puzzle-league.html", "text": "Dr Mario A true classic from the NES era, Dr Mario is a puzzle game in which stamina and reflexes are the real test for the player. The player impersonates Mario, intent on eliminating the viruses inside a test tube by throwing medicine pills inside it. Viruses come in different colours, and must be eliminated by placing pills of the same color alongside them so as to form files made up of four or more elements. The player passes the levels by eliminating all the viruses, while the game ends when the pills or viruses reach the ceiling. Part of the difficulty of the game lies in the cumbersomeness of the horizontal operations and in the considerable degree of effort that is required, as soon as the speed of the game becomes high, to reach the bottom of the tube and deal with the accumulation of pills. In this sense, Dr Mario never really explodes as a strategic game, but is limited to a large laboratory of quickness and mental pragmatism. In this version, which also features the possibility of playing online by challenging another player, Intelligent System has also prepared a new game mode for Nintendo in which the aim of the game is to eliminate only some of the viruses present in the test tube, which are particularly inaccessible or to be exterminated in a very short time. The game mode is particularly apt, and in some moments it doesn't make you regret the traditional game mode, because it intelligently works on the original mechanics of Dr. Mario, enriching it with a strategic moment that was partly undeveloped before. There is also a short tutorial-guide, actually quite superfluous and which betrays Dr. Mario's lack of complexity ~on the distance~. Puzzle League (formerly Tetris Attack / Panel de Pon) Panel de Pon, the original name of a game later known as Tetris Attack (with the characters of Yoshi's Island) and here known as Puzzle League, is simply one of the best puzzle games in history. The game mechanism foresees that blocks of different colors are given to fill the screen, rising from the bottom to the top, and that the player can use a cursor as wide as two blocks placed horizontally to swap the tiles two by two, eliminating them once whenever three or more of them of the same color come into contact. The strength of Puzzle League lies in particular in the strategic and cerebral moment: the player can decide whether to live day to day, eliminating the blocks that emerge from time to time, or whether to focus on a more complex and technical style of play, forcing the climb more of the column of blocks in order to study complex combinations. Eliminating blocks causes those above them to fall, filling all the spaces left empty and in turn generating eliminations if they fall in order to combine with others of the same color. Brought to a certain strategic level, this mechanic is capable of creating spectacular reasoned combinations, in which blocks on blocks continue to fall, creating chain reactions. The complexity of the results is, of course, rewarded by the game, especially in all modes that do not involve simply crossing the finish line of the number of blocks to be eliminated but the challenge against human or CPU opponents. In this case, the more complex the combinations and chain reactions are, the more damage will be transferred to enemies in the form of blocks that fall from above, threatening to overflow from the upper edge of the play area and cause the defeat, which is not immediate. The blocks will try to compress and resist for a few seconds, leaving the player in difficulty with a very short but crucial period of time to resolve the situation. By eliminating blocks adjacent to the ballasts, these will turn into blocks in turn. In the time following the transformation and before their fall, which varies according to the mass in transformation, the player will have time to arrange the underlying blocks in such a way as to build combinations and make the attacker tit for tat. Puzzle League (formerly Tetris Attack / Panel de Pon) The combination of strategy, emotional tension and levels of commitment, combined with the fantastic dynamic of challenge, make Puzzle League an excellent game, worthy of appearing in any soft library worthy of the name. The GameBoy Advance port, despite the uninspired title and general sloppy presentation, comes with a host of new options in addition to all the game modes. There are the simple challenge mode, the progress in the levels (deprived of the nice aesthetic component of the SNES version), the challenge against the CPU, training,the tutorial and, above all, the fantastic puzzle mode in which the player has to destroy all the blocks on the screen with a limited number of substitutions. Compared to the SuperNES version, however, the game is much more customizable: practically every aspect of the game, from the speed of the column of blocks up to the music (few, in reality, and not as inspired as those for the SNES) and the possibility of activate or deactivate elements such as its speed up at will, it is highly ~scalable~ and adaptable to the style and level of play you want to undertake. Other additions, such as the ~waste~ mode that simulates the opponent's attack, go hand in hand with a mode with the link cable capable of making Puzzle League a fixed appointment for multiplayer moments. Aesthetics aside (which is dull, but still customizable, with a vast set of backgrounds and adjustment of color, opacity and on-screen logos), it is an excellent version of one of the best puzzles in history. Comment Dr Mario & Puzzle League is a very simple bundle in which two classics are offered for sale at a reduced price. He doesn't even attempt the actual collection route, so it's not entirely logical to accuse him of not historically accompanying the titles or providing an adequate presentation. Of course, the latter is very flat. It would have been nice to have an aesthetically more sophisticated reworking of these classics (the GBA is used to the minimum of its potential), perhaps accompanied by a faithful emulation of the originals (or just Dr Mario). In reality, however, this would have changed the excellent play substance very little. If Dr Mario is a more than decent puzzle, Puzzle League is an excellent title from all points of view, so much so that presenting it in a bundle with another game is almost a disservice to its value. Given the amount of options, the fidelity of the versions and the multiplayer modes, the cartridge reworked by Intelligent Systems is a solid addition to any soft library. The player, moreover, should not be fooled by this ~average~ final grade assigned to the package, and evaluate above all by taking into account the value of the games contained. Pros Two classics in one go Puzzle League is an excellent game Multiplayer mode and rich options Cons Absence of historical extras or accessories Aesthetic presentation a bit too minimal Doctor Mario and Puzzle League Dr. Mario and Puzzle League is a cartridge which, as the name partially suggests, brings together two of the most classic and famous puzzle games of all time. Dr. Mario will be a well-known name to many: it is a title originally produced by Nintendo for the NES, its eight-bit console. Puzzle League would sound like a new game, but the new title hides a product already famous in the sixteen-bit era such as Tetris Attack or Panel de Pon (and, later, Pokemon Puzzle League). Both titles have been faithfully converted and repainted, gaining some new modes. At first contact, the operation would suggest a moment of pure recycling. However, the few but pleasant additions, the reduced price of the package and above all the intrinsic quality of the two games manage, despite the non-originality of the package, to make Dr Mario & Puzzle League a decidedly recommended purchase for anyone who loves puzzles or good games in general.", "date": "2005-12-14", "grade": null}
