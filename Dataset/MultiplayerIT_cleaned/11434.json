The few megabytes to download, in fact, are just a misleading bait and switch: after starting the game, the actual update starts, weighing about 3 GB. We therefore recommend running the process under Wi-Fi coverage to speed up the installation. The amount of data also portends the quantity of contents of Pegasus Dream Tour. Behind this title there is an unsuspected author signature: Hajime Tabata, ex Square-Enix as well as director of various Final Fantasy, appreciated guest also of a recent Lucca Comics. Therefore, any game could not be hidden behind this high-sounding name. Pegasus Dream Tour, once launched, reveals itself as the title we didn't expect. Light years away from any other sports game, athletics, Olympics. Let's find out why in our review of The Pegasus Dream Tour. Phantasy Star Paralympic Online After starting a long and substantial tutorial that takes us inside the city of Pegasus, thanks also to an unexpected mayor who welcomes us right away: Doraemon! We immediately understand that we are facing a game with a strongly Japanese connotation. The setting in which Pegasus Dream Tour develops is a virtual city full of things to do, characters to meet, places to visit, collectibles to unlock. After almost half an hour from the start, you forget you're in front of a sports game, with the illusion of being inside a new Phantasy Star Online. Those looking for a Mario & Sonic-style experience at the Olympics have got the wrong game, here we are faced with an extremely more complex and rich title. Maybe even too much. After a while, the primary focus is almost lost, which is to excel in the various Paralympic sports, immersed in the city that offers many ideas such as eating, training, making friends and visiting different temples and places. It is a real RPG with massive multiplayer online elements, subgames to be played online, others offline thanks to an effective artificial intelligence. Our character evolves with us thanks to the activities faced within the city. Given the amount of things to do, collect or see, the title is often also confusing on the continuation of events and on what it is necessary to do in some precise moments. Good nutrition and constant training guarantee an ideal shape to face the official competitions: based on many elements, our virtual alter-ego will be more or less in shape. Customization is in fact another strong element of the game: you choose physique, face, nationality, muscles, clothing. And each value can be increased or decreased based on how we live within the city. The game is totally free because there are purchasable packages that speed up physical and sporting improvement times: thanks to constant training, your records improve day after day, in a visible and satisfying way. How is it made? The sports featured in Pegasus Dream Tour are well done and manage to transfer some mechanics triggered by the athletes' disabilities to the player. For example, during football matches between the blind we find ourselves having to dribble and pass the ball on an almost totally dark screen, accompanied only by the sound of the bell inside the ball and being able to see the ~shadows~ of the opponents they stand against us. The effort instilled in trying to give a touch of originality to these game mechanics is appreciable, even if the effect created by the developers does not always blend beautifully with fluid and fun playability. However, the technical realization is of great value. The whole city is created entirely in 3D and is full of details, places and characters with which to talk or exchange information. The stadiums where some races take place are very rich in polygons, applauding audiences, effects, all without pop-ups or graphic imperfections. In the open environments of the city, very heavy frame drops are occasionally noticed due to the large amount of people present, both online and offline. Luckily during matches and games everything runs smoothly. The audio sector is certainly the least memorable: apart from the successful use of some sound effects for gameplay reasons, music, soundtrack and all the rest go by the wayside like the umpteenth overused and anonymous tracks. The tunes used as background during life in the city are indeed almost annoying and repetitive. With regard to the general technical sector, a very performing device is certainly necessary to support all this data. We tested the game on the new iPad Air, where it has dator the best of himself. On Samsung S10 + and S21 it had some problems in the most chaotic situations, while on Huawei P30 Pro and Xiaomi Note 10 it was sometimes unplayable due to screen blocks. In any case, it is a game that can be installed for free and, given its totally original nature and the great signature of Hajime Tabata, we are sure that a try is worth it.", "date": "2021-09-04", "grade": "7.2"}
