In this case we are faced with a particularly ambitious project for a development team of small dimensions like Daedalic Entertainment: a dynamic adventure whose protagonist is none other than Gollum, one of the figures more controversial than the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien, whose fate is linked to that of the One Ring: his great, great treasure. The final result of the long efforts of the German studio, which planned to publish the game in 2021 only to postpone its launch several times, however leaves us dumbfounded: we explain why in the review of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. History and narrative sector The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, the protagonist in all his glory Let's start by saying that the narrative assumptions of the project are interesting and aim to extend and enrich the already boundless lore of The Lord of the Rings, going to tell what happened over the years between the events of The Hobbit and the birth of the Fellowship of the Ring, i.e. the period in which Gollum was a prisoner in the fortress of Barad-dur. Daedalic Entertainment, however, did not dare to write the story of the game without first consulting various experts of Tolkien's work, so as to deliver us an adventure as coherent as possible with the books, which develops through ten chapters for a duration that stands at twelve hours where one proceeds relatively calmly. There is no doubt that Gollum's rendering is valid: played in this case by Wayne Forester rather than by his original cinematographic voice, Andy Serkis, the protagonist of the adventure expresses his dualism in a very clear way within the dialogues and the change of personality leaves dumbfounded, proving a great job which however is not enough to raise the level of the story. Strongly limited for almost half of its entire duration by badly scripted sequences, in which the in-game action is so sketchy to remember the cinematic tie-ins of the 90s, with the big difference that in this case it was not necessary to adapt the mechanics to a story that was written from scratch, the narrative sector in particular appears devoid of a direction capable of emphasizing the better atmospheres and strengths. Gameplay: Derivative at best The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, one of the many platforming sections of the campaign The gameplay of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum therefore seems to follow the plot, rather than the other way around: a huge mistake, which in the first four chapters of the campaign forces you to grapple with very boring sequences of collecting and activating switches and then returning to your cell to rest, making the acquaintance of other prisoners of the fortress but without these implications producing anything concrete. one handhold to another in an attempt to find an escape route, with exaggerated tolerances in the hooks, really bad animations (see jumping from one bar to another) but also a lot of slipperiness and camera madness that produce frustrating and undeserved game overs. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, the chariot sequence is among the most broken and frustrating in the game These sequences sometimes leave room for rather basic stealth moments, in which Gollum must hide from the sight of the guards possibly using stones to distract them: a bit like in A Plague Tale: Innocence, but with a substantially worse realization. There are also short mini-games in which the protagonist's dual personality ignites a confrontation that we will have to try to win by selecting the most convincing items from a contextual menu. The moments of internal conflict between Gollum and Smeagol, but also the simple crossroads in which asked to act according to one or the other personality, they actually trigger events that change the course of history, albeit limited to background elements and characters: not enough to affect a gameplay that ultimately appears dated and uncertain in its mechanics. Technical achievement: two generations old The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, one of the few suggestive views you will see It's clear that bringing the world of The Lord of the Rings to the screen takes a ccertain type of work, especially in terms of settings, in order to recreate as effectively as possible the scenarios described so meticulously by Tolkien and brought to the cinema by the saga directed by Peter Jackson, who inevitably remains a point of reference at this juncture. Unfortunately, however, the technical realization is another sore point for The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which presents itself after a long development and several postponements with basically two generations old graphics in terms of geometry, animations and effects, as well as flawed by such a number of oversights and glitches as to question the completeness of the project. From this point of view, the addition of ray tracing appears more like a publicity stunt than anything else, a useless tinsel that ends up further weighing down what already so it certainly does not arise as an example of optimization, on the contrary it moves with an inexplicable effort considering the geometries and technologies in the field. And DLSS 3 support is no excuse. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum's Inner Conflict rendered as a minigame So forget suggestive scenarios or perhaps an alternative but convincing style: the title of Daedalic is devoid of personality, rough, problematic and sloppy, and beyond a just discreet realization of the protagonist there is very little that can be saved. The aforementioned interpretation by Wayne Forester, without a doubt, and a beautiful soundtrack, but the positive notes practically end here. Moreover, the PC version, which was provided to us for the review, suffers from enormous optimization problems as mentioned: on the configuration test we were able to run it at 1440p and 60 fps, with all settings at maximum and ray tracing, only by setting the DLSS to ~balanced~: a weight very similar to the highly criticized one we talked about in the review of The Last of Us Part 1, but with a distinctly different visual rendering.", "date": "2023-05-25", "grade": "5.0"}
