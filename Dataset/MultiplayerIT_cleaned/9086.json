{"name": "Arrivederci Marcus!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93379-gears-of-war-3-arrivederci-marcus.html", "text": "The adventure of Marcus Fenix and the COG should have ended at the end of 2010. Given the concomitance of the publication of Halo Reach, last year, and the need to have a title with a strong impact for this autumn season to complement Forza Motorsport 4 , Microsoft has probably decided to postpone the release of Gears of War 3 to September 20, 2011, transforming the launch, between the spasmodic wait of the fans and a public beta that has met with considerable success, into a real event. The mentioning of Halo is by no means a coincidence, because if there is a saga that has managed to carve out a place of honor in the library of Xbox users, right alongside the Master Chief, that is Gears of War, which had also the merit of finally marking a notable gap between the previous and this generation of consoles. The entire fortune of Unreal Engine 3 originated from the first episode, adopted almost unanimously for the development of some of the major productions of the last five years: a chain of successes for Epic, therefore. The problem is that, starting from a position of such great importance and so much expectation, the step to fall disastrously could have been damned short. Fortunately, Cliff Bleszinsky and associates, in closing the trilogy, lengthened the pace... The grand finale Gears of War 3, as well as the other episodes, to be an action shooter focuses on the plot and the setting with much more emphasis than other games of the category. Indeed, the events related to the planet Sera, which finds itself overwhelmed by the monstrous Locusts, burned in a devastating war, while a handful of heroes try to bring home their lives, while certainly not a concentration of innovation and literary expression, is extremely enjoyable. We grew fond of Marcus and were really curious to know how this story would end. A story that opens with the return from the afterlife, also because in the end he was not dead, of Marcus' father who seems to have the crux of the matter in his hands and the whole game is the story of the journey of the COGs in an attempt to go and recover him and to help him in a project that could save the world and end this devastating conflict. At the end of the adventure, which we don't anticipate in any element, a strange feeling is felt: there are ups and downs, epic moments, others not so, characters who have succeeded and failed, but we find ourselves sorry for not knowing when the next one will be ~ episode~ and, above all, with the memories that go to what happened in the other chapters as well. The universe created for Gears of War, and this is in our opinion the greatest advantage of the whole saga, is coherent, stylistically and mechanically, so much so that the three chapters stop in the mind as a whole, which over the years it has improved, especially from a graphic point of view, but which was clearly born, right from the start, as the result of an absolutely clear project. In short, we'd be crazy to tell you about a playful alternative to the Star Wars trilogy, but in the world of video games, we rarely happened to have before our eyes an absolutely playable experience that unfolds from one chapter to another without narrative repetitions, without having to find absurd gimmicks to get by and with the clear intention of telling a very simple and perhaps banal story, but with a universe of creatures and of locations that really seem to exist somewhere in the universe and in time. This solidity and this consistency are paid for in terms of real innovation, in the sense that Gears of War 3 picks up exactly where the second chapter left off, filing further the cover system, which now runs smoothly like oil at any juncture, adding the four-player cooperative and some new gameplay elements such as the exoskeletons that become the protagonists of a handful of sequences, but essentially remaining true to itself and without doing anything to convince anyone who didn't feel at ease in the other two episodes. While remaining enjoyable for anyone, also because there is an effective introductory video that explains what has happened so far on Sera, it is clear that the pleasure that those who have followed the COG from the beginning will feel will be much higher than those who will launch into Gears only now, but this is the strength and weakness of Gears of War 3, which however should be played only for the sake of experiencing the fun of this genre in one of its maximum expressions. I break everything Gears of War 3 is bombastic and perfectly synthesized by one of the best weapons ever created in a video game, the Lancer equipped with a chainsaw, which here also comes in the oldest version with a bayonet, more powerful, but less accurate. The weapons, the physicality they unleash, the active reloads, the work done on the cameras and the cover system are distinctive signs that now boast countless imitation attempts and Epic insisted on these once again, setting up a campaign that is completed in about ten hours . The energy recharges, as always, being in cover and the artificial intelligence of your travel companions, significantly improved, leads them to help you as soon as you end up on the ground when you get hit too many times in a row, decreasing a little too much the level of challenge, especially at normal level. There are four difficulty levels and our advice is to play difficult straight away, even solo, to fully enjoy the game, which has one of its strengths in its longevity. This is also thanks to the mechanism of unlockable elements set up, which leads to gaining experience points after every single session, in any mode, causing the player to continuously level up and inevitably leading to accentuate the link with Gears of War 3. They return the dozens of secret objects to find in the levels to know the background of what is happening, as well as the executions to torment the enemies who have fallen to the ground, reaching new levels of truculence and inevitable satisfaction. On these elements and on the online experience, essential for experiencing GOW 3, Epic has worked a lot, adopting that system of dedicated servers, considered fundamental by the players after the disappointment caused by the lag problems and the slowness of the matchmaking of the second chapter. The work, from this point of view, seems commendable. Games start in seconds and, playing in story mode, connected to Xbox Live, without a hitch it is possible to see other players join you in the middle of a mission without any interruption. Also from this point of view, of immediacy and cleaning of the code, Gears of War 3 represents a further refinement of the saga. Everything online there is Warzone, the Gears deathmatch, now has an uncomfortable roommate, Team Deathmacth, which sees two teams of five players clash with 15 respawns available (ideally, three for each member), after which, once dead, you are out game. Already now, there are a few hundred lucky ones with definitive copies, it is clear that it will be the main mode of Gears of War 3, but in the months the others will also have their moments of glory. Capture the leader is undoubtedly the most curious, with a version of capture the flag, in which the flag is the opposing team leader, who must be knocked down and then used as a human shield for the time necessary to close the match. From his side, the Leader has the power to see not only where his teammates are, but also where his opponents are, which makes communication essential, immediately reminding how strategy and teamwork are more important in the online of GOW than in many other games that focus so much on the game on the net. Epic also worked on Horde, a five-player cooperative mode in which you have to face growing hordes of locusts and shining ones, adding the possibility of earning money to spend on buying turrets and defensive items to place on the battlefield. The fun fact is that if money is needed to buy more effective items, such as exoskeletons, players can pass money among themselves. For the most wicked, comes the Beast, in which, as you level up, you switch to the side of the bad guys by gradually impersonating the baddest enemies in the game in an attempt, on the contrary, to repel growing waves of COGs.Obviously, being able to play the whole story in four players online is the tastiest addition to the online system, there is only to consider the fact that, in this way, even the highest difficulty level becomes too compliant. Xbox 360 goals Being careful to collect some hidden objects and finishing the game on a normal level, at the end of the first run, you should find yourself with about 300 of the thousand unlocked points. To get to the full loot, a goal that is not impossible, it will take many hours online, in a cooperative and the curiosity to find every single secret object. A little patience, ultimately. Surreal engine, last step When we first saw Gears of War, it was 2005, at E3, there was Tim Sweeney, Epic's tech guro who, talking outside the demo room with another programmer, was collecting a compliment along the lines of: ~ Probably, GOW will be one of the coolest things on Xbox 360 for years.~ This kind of poet, whose name we ignore, had seen us long, also because with each new chapter, Epic updated the version of the Unreal Engiused, adding details and particulars. This time it's the turn of the fluidity, which practically always remains anchored on 30 frames per second in every imaginable juncture, of the polygons on the screen (certain bosses are the new definition of ~Huge~) and of the lights. The new lighting system, of volumetric fumes and particles, above all, works wonders, giving life to certain glimpses that are difficult to look at without transport. Among other things, the interactivity with the seabed has greatly increased, with many of the covers scratching or even falling apart, making it necessary to move continuously to find shelter. The new female characters and Marcus' father make it clear that the engine was born to draw muscular and sweaty men rather than mature characters or attractive female soldiers, but the complex is truly admirable and will be remembered for a long time. Perhaps some ideas are missing that can bring back the anxiety and inspiration of some places in the first chapter, but a couple of passages, we are sure, will amaze you. On the audio side there are a couple of pearls for the fans, the usual good sound accompaniment and effects. The dubbing sees a change in Marcus' voice that will make the most nostalgic turn up their noses and you have to work with the volume levels in the options to get an optimal rendering (the voices are a bit low, otherwise), but other than that there that's all it takes to get to the end of this six-year film.", "date": "2011-09-17", "grade": "9.5"}
