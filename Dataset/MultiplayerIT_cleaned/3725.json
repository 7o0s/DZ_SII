Of course, it's not the first time that the Japanese company has offered something like this. In fact, who does not remember Virtual Boy? The 3D headset experiment of the father of the Game Boy, Gunpei Yokoi, was such a monumental failure that, by comparison, the Wii U didn't fare so badly. In the meantime the situation has changed a lot: Switch is one of the most loved and sold consoles on the market, it has given a home to some of the best games of recent years and Nintendo seems to have returned to experimenting with that light-heartedness that oscillates acrobatically between genius and madness, potential blockbuster and thunderous flop. And the product that best embodies this philosophy is undoubtedly some of its own Nintendo Labo. The line of cardboard peripherals launched last year was an explosive mix of mixed sensations, confirmed and, if possible, amplified by the latest set available from April 12 exclusively for Nintendo Switch. The VR Kit is in fact the most surprising emanation of Nintendo which amazes and causes discussion, which divides and which, almost always, hits the target. Cardboard VR Initial reactions to the announcement of the Nintendo Labo VR Kit were, understandably, full of irony and sarcasm. Already virtual reality does not enjoy great fame, if you then associate it with cardboard hardware, open the sky! There are those who immediately compared the paper viewer to Google Cardboard and those who, with witty observation, launched into irreverent anatomical parallelisms. And yet, as often happens when you try out even the most absurd of Nintendo products by hand, the VR Kit turns out to be an original experience and - it's hard to say at the age of 30 while holding a sober orange cardboard blaster - absolutely fun. Needless to dwell here on the construction experience. We've already talked about it abundantly in the Assorted Kit review and the VR Kit keeps all the pros and cons of the guided tutorials for the previous Toy-Con. We spent about 7 hours assembling all the peripherals inside the kit: we obviously started from the VR Visor (actually the Nintendo version of the Google Cardboard), to then dedicate ourselves, in order, to a pinwheel, to the camera with sub, to the elephant, to the bird, to a ~fan~ pedal and, finally, to the blaster, a rifle complete with manual winding which, in our opinion, represents the highlight of the lot (and in fact it is the only one that can be purchased separately with the base kit; the rest are sold as expansions). The Discover section also returns, where the trio made up of Tina Sapien, Gi C. Allagrande and Professor Cosimo De Aggeggis is once again ready to reveal the secrets behind the functioning of the different Toy-Cons and to guide the player in the Toy-Con Garage mode , the place where it is possible to program new games such as our Poltergust 5000. The main novelty of this section is the Garage Toy-Con VR: it is to all intents and purposes a virtual reality version of the garage, which however adds new nodes and a 3D editor where you can experiment with your own creations. To understand its potential, just think that Piazza VR, a collection of fun mini-games in the Play section, was created entirely using the tools in the garage. experiences in virtual reality Speaking of games, the Labo VR Kit represents the basic level of approach to virtual reality. The small experiences offered by Nintendo intelligently exploit the specific characteristics of individual Toy-Cons. Here then is the camera being exploited for an underwater tour looking for all the different species of fish; the elephant's trunk becomes a brush to make the most diverse 3D drawings or solve puzzles in the style of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild sanctuaries; the ~swan~ gives access to airborne exploration of an open world and a series of checkpoint speed challenges; the pedal puts you in the role of a jumping frog who must avoid the blows of a robot that seems to come straight out of an episode of Yattaman; finally, the blaster is associated with a first-person shooter on rails, which closely resembles Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, and a 1-on-1 mode where two players can challenge each other to see who can get the most hippos on their side by feeding them some fruit. Net of the numerous extras that can be unlocked by completing certain tasks, there is nothing particularly original in these experiences, but the peculiarity of Nintendo Labo is that it uses peripherals such as only some cabinetsfrom the arcade they manage to do. This way you can zoom in on the most interesting subjects by physically rotating the lens of the cardboard camera. You get your hair ruffled by the wind generated by the pedal when you jump or under full acceleration with your competition bird. Finally, feel the weight of each blaster's reload as you try to rid the city of as many aliens as possible. It is precisely this sort of fourth dimension, almost a replica of the smelly cinema imagined in Huxley's Brave New World, which compensates for the technical limitations of a technology that would otherwise struggle to be appreciated at such a low resolution. Inevitably, in fact, the image quality is the weakest point of the kit: the definition of the text is often on the verge of illegibility, the edges are blurred, the pop-in of the textures is the order of the day. There is even a slight delay in recognizing some movements which requires a little extra adaptation to not suffer from motion sickness. But none of this can undermine the enjoyment of an immediate, simple, engaging and, as we said at the beginning, surprisingly fun virtual reality.", "date": "2019-04-11", "grade": "S.V."}
