{"name": "Bomberman Land - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bomberman-land-recensione.html", "text": "Valley of tears It certainly cannot be said that Bomberman Land starts off on the right foot: before being able to start playing for the first time, the user is in fact forced to undergo an interminable introductory sequence which illustrates the very thin (and completely useless) plot of the product, all in the name of boredom and the most dramatic graphic poverty. In reality, the entire Story Mode is dotted with similar annoyances, clear gimmicks used by the developers to dilute the gaming experience: therefore, we often find ourselves stuck between silly dialogues and various formalities that take up much more time than it should be the true heart of the adventure, i.e. the minigames. Not even one of the numerous minigames is able to leave its mark Valley of tears Unfortunately, it is necessary to face this single-player mode to unlock them and make them available in the so-called Attraction Mode, which allows them to be played freely even in company: and we would not feel like saying it's worth it. Not even one of the numerous minigames is in fact able to leave its mark and justify such an effort (because this is what we are talking about in reference to the Story Mode), even if this does not mean that Bomberman Land is an unplayable title. Simply, the Hudson product settles on levels of total mediocrity, unable to get back on top in any aspect. Starting with the technical one, really not very decent even for a not particularly demanding console like Wii: graphically, Bomberman Land presents elementary polygonal models equipped with woody animations, which move on extremely undeveloped scenarios and, moreover, characterized by a dubious taste in the use of colors. To say the least anonymous from a cosmetic point of view, Hudson's work even becomes disheartening when we move on to the sound front, composed of literally unbearable music and effects that are scarce in number and quality. If at least the developers had sacrificed the audiovisual sector in favor of a play structure up to par... Plunge (bomb) into the past As mentioned, the Story Mode is not exactly the temple of fun: to continue and unlock all the mini-games it is necessary to obtain the maximum score in each test (something for which it is often necessary to repeat the same section over and over again), moving between five different zones. In the midst of all this there are permits to obtain, challenges to face and -useless- objects to buy in the dedicated shop, all activities that fall into the broad category of boring formalities with which the user is forced to cope. The minigames themselves are nothing special, requiring the use of the Remote in ways already seen and revised in titles of a much higher caliber. The only globally positive aspect of Bomberman Land is represented by the Battle Mode, which is nothing more than the umpteenth reproduction of the historical gameplay of the series, open to a maximum of four players. Here you can challenge each other with bombs in various arenas and choosing between six different modes, in what to all intents and purposes should have been a simple diversion and which in the end turns out to be the only positive note of the production Hudson. The only globally positive aspect of Bomberman Land is represented by the Battle Mode Plunge (bomb) into the past A consideration that brings us back to the demerits of the actual game, which could certainly have better exploited the potential of the Wii. Beyond the disagreements regarding the technical sector of the title (Hudson on the other hand has never been a software house renowned for refinement in this sense), what most annoys Bomberman Land is its approximate use of the motion control system sensor, improperly exploited in some cases and beautifully ignored in others. Just think of the fact that to move the character within the playground it is necessary to use a very uncomfortable point-and-click system, while in some minigames we have relied on traditional inputs even if a different solution would have been not only possible but even obligatory. Considering how Bomberman Land is also available on PSP, it is clear that the developers have not seen fit to make an effort to further differentiate the two versions. Comment Bomberman Land is a collection of minigames that has a lot to envy to the reference points of the category: not very original, technically poor and unable to properly exploit the characteristics of the Wii and its control system, the Hudson title is recommended as a party game only about the Battle Mode, a reinterpretation of the classic gameplay of the series. That said, there are definitely cheaper and more satisfying versionsgood old Bomberman...
