Those were other times, other platforms and other developers. Over the years the genre has evolved, above all thanks to the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, which has added many elements to those canonized by Bullfrog, putting the management part in the background, to focus on the editor of the park and its attractions, especially the mountains Russian. The player no longer wanted only to manage, but also to create and look at his work from new, more spectacular points of view. Many functions and many ways of visualizing the parks have therefore been included, so much so that in some cases it seemed that we were dealing more with applications than video games. Planet Coaster is the latest evolution of this trend, and also the most successful. Frontier, the development team, got revenge for the loss of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, producing the perfect rival. But what does it have to offer to those wishing to enter this magical world? We have reviewed Planet Coaster, currently the best playground editor available on the market Sandbox mode and challenges The main mode of Planet Coaster is certainly the Sandbox one, which is also the one that allows you to immediately explore the potential of the playground editor. For a detailed discussion of the editor, we refer you to the two trials we dedicated to the Frontier title when it was still in Early Access (here you find the first, and here the second). The final version from this point of view doesn't add much, but it refines some functions. For example, now the paths stick together much better and when building a ride the creation of the entry point of the row has been automated; some commands have been added to speed up the process of decorating the park and so on. In short, Frontier listened to its audience and stepped in by refining something that was already exceptional on its own, adding features and removing them where they weren't needed. The Sandbox mode is exactly what it says it is: you start from an empty and flat ground with unlimited resources and you can indulge yourself in building your own playground of dreams, having immediately available all the buildable objects included in the game. This is the most creative mode and does not burden the gameplay with the economy system. The Challenges mode, on the other hand, is a sandbox mode with some complications. The first is that you have limited initial resources; the second is that all the economic aspects of managing a playground must be taken into consideration; the third is the presence of real challenges, the ones that give the mode its name: they are not mandatory, but if successfully completed they give access to extra resources. The economic system itself is quite complex, but never penalizing. Visitors aren't very picky and are willing to spend their money at the park's attractions and shops. Aside from running it crazy, for example hiring dozens of maintainers when you have three attractions, it's really hard to end up in the red. The adjustments that can be made to the park entrances are really many: for example, it is possible to establish the ticket price of the single attraction, choose the load with which to start a ride, create priority queues with more expensive tickets and so on. Unlike in the Sandbox mode, in the Challenge mode (as in the Career mode which we will discuss in the next paragraph), you do not have all the attractions and all the buildings immediately available, which must be researched. Searching for something is very simple: select the icon of the type of search you want to perform, start it and wait. The only aspect to take into consideration is the monthly cost of a search, which can be more or less high. For example, researching new roller coasters costs a lot and it can be penalizing to do it at the beginning of a challenge, when income is limited. What matters is to make sure that at the end of the month (the game presents periodic economic reports) the revenues are higher than the expenditures, i.e. you must avoid that management costs explode due to reckless choices. It is not as difficult as it seems, in fact, the truth is that it is too simple. Once practiced with the game system it becomes really difficult to end up in the red and the economy is never a real challenge, unfortunately. Career mode Career mode is the weakest part of the game. It almost feels like a rushed extra just because it has to be there, rather than a thoughtful addition. Describing it is very simple: select a scenario, you have to achieve predetermined objectives divided by difficulty levels. For example, we may be asked to attract a certain number of visitors, or to accumulate a certain amount of money, or even to build some specific attractions, or even to make the attractions as a whole return a pre-established monthly amount. When you reach all the objectives of one of the three difficulty levels, you get a star. By accumulating stars you can unlock advanced scenarios, which offer increasingly difficult challenges. What's wrong? The variety of parks to manage is good, there are many objectives, but something that binds everything is missing. In short, the career mode lacks a career, that is, a glue between the scenarios that does not make them impromptu pastimes. Frankly, we would have preferred something more structured and meaningful, perhaps a campaign with progressive missions linked by a thin narrative thread. Given the versatility of the game system, one could also think of a series of objectives that branched out on the basis of the choices made on the field, something like: ~resolve the fortunes of the park by deciding whether to make it a dream place for teenagers or for families.~ Obviously ours is only one of the many possible alternative proposals, moreover very hasty, and it only serves to make people understand how listless the gestation of the Career mode that ended up in the game was. It follows that Frontier was primarily interested in making a great parks editor, which it actually did, caring less about the rest. Too bad, because for many it is not a secondary aspect. Attractions like this you have never seen before From a technical point of view Planet Coaster represents the best that the genre has to offer. The comparison with the direct competitor RollerCoaster Tycoon World is merciless, both from the point of view of the detail of the individual objects (attractions, decorations and so on), and from that of the engine itself, which manages to remain fluid even when the park becomes saturated of visitors, despite the day and night cycle altering lights and shadows in real time. Of course, to play in Ultra detail while maintaining a stable refresh rate, you necessarily need to have a configuration comparable to the recommended one, which is not very low, but the game looks very nice even in high and medium detail. Also, given the genre, you can safely sacrifice some fluidity for quality (doing so is a matter of personal preference). Going more specifically, it must be said that you will not find another playground management system with such realistic and detailed attractions. It can be seen that Frontier has a great deal of experience in the field, both for the work done on some chapters of the aforementioned RollerCoaster Tycoon series, and because it designs attractions for real parks. Also noteworthy is the particularly rich soundtrack: in addition to a vast range of sounds from the parks, which differ according to the attractions and decorative objects, there are musical pieces linked to the individual themes (world of pirates, fantasy and so on) which play when viewing a store or attraction. In short, exploring the Planet Coaster parks is pleasant and sometimes it's also nice to put yourself in the shoes of a visitor to take a ride in peace, admiring the fruits of the hard work done.", "date": "2016-11-17", "grade": "8.0"}
