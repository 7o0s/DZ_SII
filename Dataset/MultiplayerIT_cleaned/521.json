{"name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Essentials", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-essentials.html", "text": "The avenue of memories Splinter Cell Essentials, unfortunately, is not a real new chapter in the series. On the contrary, Ubisoft has preferred to create a kind of ~best of~, bringing together some missions taken from the previous chapters in a single title and adding a handful of new ones. In the series timeline, Essentials takes place after the next Double Agent, one year after the death of Sam's daughter, hit by a drunk driver. The plot of this episode for PSP is nothing more than a trivial glue to justify the passage through the different missions; in summary, distraught by his mourning, the former agent abandoned his role, incredibly going to be part of a terrorist organization. Arrested by the same secret services he worked for until a few months earlier, he is then interrogated and forced to remember some key facts from his past. We then move from one setting to another, without particular connections between them. The game mechanics are the same as always, without differences; it is a game often based on trial and error, or on the need to repeat certain steps several times before having the upper hand. As always, the stealth approach is absolutely to be preferred, thus trying to hide in the darkness, bypassing enemies or taking them by surprise from behind without making the slightest noise. In reality, compared to the previous chapters, Essentials seems to want to push the player more towards the use of weapons, which appear in certain cases as the only applicable solution to be able to continue. Obviously there is no shortage of a whole series of technological gadgets available to the protagonist, already more than fearsome in itself thanks to a truly athlete-like number of moves and evolutions. Up to this point, the picture that has been made is that of a normal episode of the Splinter Cell series, therefore promising. Unfortunately, several factors contribute to irreparably compromise the situation, which even the most avid fan of Sam Fisher would really struggle to overlook. Surely the most irritating is related to the control system; the lack of a second analog stick and 2 back buttons is no small matter, but careful planning could have allowed an acceptable compromise to be reached. Unfortunately the programmers have instead made the worst choices, especially in relation to the absurd handling of the camera. In summary, the latter is completely manual, thus leaving the player with the task of changing its angle in order to follow the action in the best way. But that's not all: the management of the same must be activated by pressing a key, and can not take place simultaneously with the movement of the protagonist. The result is a continuous, irritating (to put it mildly) interval between control of the view and of Sam, with absolutely disastrous results on the enjoyment of the game. Alternatively, it is possible to assign the movements of the camera to the front buttons, thus allowing you to move at the same time; but the result does not change, because the camera-mode must then be deactivated in order to use the aforementioned keys in order to perform the actions. And unfortunately this problem is not the only one; for example, the artificial intelligence of the enemies is absolutely laughable, with behaviors beyond any logic and which make progress in the levels much simpler than it really should be. Darkness is my friend The graphic component has always been one of the spearheads of the series on home consoles. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for this PSP edition, which is really weak even in this respect. Obviously no one would have expected the aesthetic level of the Xbox edition on a laptop not of the same technical capabilities; but the poor quality of some textures, the unsatisfactory use of colors, the dancer frame rate, the frequent interpenetrations and the excessive darkness that pervades practically every level make for a rather disheartening overall glance. Especially this last aspect, i.e. the very low brightness of the settings, proves to be extremely annoying in practice. The animations are saved, faithful to those that have always characterized dear Sam, and therefore of an excellent level. The sound, on the other hand, is good, especially as regards the effects; obviously the best is obtained by playing with headphones. Finally, it is worth mentioning the multiplayer mode, at the antipodes of the more than encouraging experiences on Xbox Live. In Essentials everything is resolved in absurd one-on-one deathmatches, which distort the mechanics that have always distinguished the series, thus resulting in a result that is really below the sufficiency. Comment Splinter CeThe Essentials is, sadly, not a good game. In reality, the impression one gets when facing Sam Fisher's PSP adventure is that every single aspect of Ubisoft production is nothing more than a bland and insufficient transposition of what was appreciated on the home console. Especially the huge gaps in the control system and in the artificial intelligence of the opponents are frankly impossible defects to accept. A pity then; old Sam certainly deserved something better. Pros Good variety of missions. Underneath it's still Splinter Cell. More than enough sound. Cons Absolutely inadequate control system. Not enough artificial intelligence. Understated graphics. Splinter Cell is undoubtedly a series of excellent quality; far from the function of a simple copy of Metal Gear Solid, it has instead followed a personal and its own path in the genre of stealth games, resulting in some players even exceeding Kojima's effort. But alongside an absolutely enviable career on home consoles, the Ubisoft series has developed another one on laptops that are absolutely not at the same level, between pale 2-dimensional versions and embarrassing three-dimensional attempts on machines not particularly inclined to grind polygons. Now, with PSP, the transalpine softco finally has in its hands a much more accustomed hardware to support the efforts of Sam Fisher; will it therefore be the right time to redeem the secret agent's adventure in a handheld version?", "date": "2006-04-28", "grade": null}
