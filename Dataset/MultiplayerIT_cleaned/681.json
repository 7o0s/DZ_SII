{"name": "Necromunda: Hired Gun", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/necromunda-hired-gun-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Necromunda: Hired Gun takes us to one of the most disturbing ant-hill planets of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Necromunda, where injustices and inequalities are the norm, ordinary people crawl like worms hoping to collect some credit and factions of violent criminals dominate the streets. The ideal scenario for the guild of bounty hunters that our character joins in the early stages of the campaign, after being rescued (or rescued: we will be able to choose the appearance and gender of the protagonist from a shortlist of possible alternatives) by the mysterious Kal Jerico and taken to the meeting place of Martyr's End: a refuge where you can interact with other mercenaries, buy new cybernetic implants or new weapons, upgrade them and maybe even spend some credits to improve the performance of our best man... a faithful hound. Setting The most interesting aspect of Necromunda: Hired Gun is the setting which, as mentioned, will see us explore various places on a hostile and threatening planet, terrifying in its facets, where slaves are mutilated and connected to various kinds of machinery, like of simple control devices, and three criminal groups dominate the territory undisturbed. These are the enemies that we will face during the missions and who are part of the Orlock family (rich industrialists equipped with standard weapons, often with protective shields), of the Escher (female warriors who also manage to use spells to teleport and throw flames and lightning) or of house Goliath (huge armored individuals, wielding war hammers, machine guns or rocket launchers). They are joined by robot sentinels, unstoppable trolls and even hordes of Genestealers. Structure Necromunda: Hired Gun, our bounty hunter and his equipment. As mentioned, the protagonist of Necromunda: Hired Gun is a bounty hunter who ends up under the aegis of Kal Jerico and, reluctantly, agrees to complete tasks for him until he goes on the trail of the guild's number one target: the ruthless Silver Talon. The game's campaign consists of twelve chapters plus the final battle, lasting about eight hours, and a series of randomly generated side missions, which often act as small arenas that are very useful for collecting money and loot. After selecting our next destination, we will be transferred to the place and there we will be tasked with completing a series of objectives which often include eliminating all hostile units present in the scenario, collecting objects and activating devices: a relatively linear mix, which however will give us the opportunity to fully explore the locations and perhaps discover their secrets, thus obtaining extra resources. Equipment and powers Necromunda: Hired Gun, a walk through Martyr's End lair. The loot obtained from each shipment can be analyzed piece by piece and we will be able to keep the objects and devices that we deem most useful. Alternatively we can sell everything without scruples. With the credits collected we will be able to go to some dealers operating in Martyr's End and buy weapons and armor or upgrades capable of giving us extra skills and special attacks, as well as improving the strength and resistance of the mastiff that accompanies us. There is an abundance of tools usable in battle, traditionally divided by rarity and value, but the game doesn't do a good job at all in enhancing them: once you find a light machine gun to your taste, you will dedicate yourself to upgrading it and in practice you will abandon any alternative for a simple matter of practicality. As for powers, during the fights you will be able to access a selection wheel and take advantage of the accumulated energy to launch EMP attacks or fireballs, acrobatic or running shots, or simply use medical kits. Gameplay Necromunda: Hired Gun, meet Silver Talon and his henchmen. The attempt by StreumOn Studio to try to create a DOOM-style shooter is clear and evident: this can be understood from the dynamism of the gameplay, from the presence of a grappling hook that allows you to move instantly from one area of the scenario to another, from the double jump and of the fast shutter, as well as by a metal soundtrack that enters the field every time a battle starts, accompanying the firefights and the painful finishers with its distorted guitars. The problem is that the whole system appears approximate, the intelligence artificial enemies is frankly ridiculous and there is literally an avalanche of glitches and more or less blatant uncertainties that greatly undermine the enjoyment of the experience. From this point of view we found ourselves faced with a situationembarrassing ions, between polygonal penetrations and fatalities that are performed without any balance (if you want you can kill even an entire group of opponents with the knife) and during which it can also happen that our character is thrown far, only to then reset his position to end of the animation. Necromunda: Hired Gun, a combat sequence. Expedients of this kind are actually very common and highlight a clear lack of resources on the part of the development team, which even found itself having to resolve dialogues between the characters using completely meaningless shots to avoid implementing animations. The feeling is therefore that of a project that fails, like the previous Space Hulk: Deathwing, to mask its production shortcomings and is indeed forced to show them off. The use of the mastiff, rather advertised by the authors, is revealed in the end a more tactical than concrete skill, in the sense that calling the dog allows you to identify the position of all the enemies in the area, but directing our four-legged friend towards the targets is another matter and the reload times are quite long so that we often forget about this option too. Not that somehow the situations triggered by this element manage to lift themselves from the already seen feeling that permeates the entire campaign. Necromunda: Hired Gun, the clash with a robot sentinel. At the normal difficulty level, the challenge also becomes quite substantial, but for a mere matter of numbers: the enemies, as mentioned, are decidedly stupid and do not boast complex routines, limiting themselves to coming upon us. When they do it in large quantities, you end up taking a lot of damage and recovering it with finishers is sometimes not enough, to the point of having to resort to a med kit or a stim after game over to come back to life. A similar speech can be made for the boss fights, which turn out to be chaotic and devoid of bite. ), you will find yourself dealing with an unprecedented amount of input-related bugs: from the inversion of the Y axis which is also reflected in the selection wheel (never seen before) to a general unreliability of the commands, which tend to jam , finally arriving at a very problematic stick sensitivity adjustment, which requires several tweaks before finding a decent setting. Technical realization If the derivative gameplay, devoid of trebles, full of glitches and with an artificial intelligence not received by Necromunda: Hired Gun were not enough to arouse great perplexities about the success of the project, there is the discourse relating to the technical realization which clarifies even more the botched and approximate nature of the new StreumOn Studio title. Starting from the narrative component, which as mentioned uses embarrassing solutions during the cutscenes and also suffers from major problems with the audio levels. Not that the inconsistent interpretations of the voice actors deserved to be listened to in a crystal clear way, because it is clear that this aspect also seems to come from by a time machine capable of taking us back to ten or even twenty years ago, in some respects. From the polygonal models (the dogs! Look at the dogs!) to the animations, the game looks really unpresentable and there are very few things that can be saved. The design of the scenarios, perhaps, but not the quality of the assets, which are extremely generic. The extensive use of a heavy lighting system enhances the environments but weighs heavily on performance, forcing us with an RTX 3070 to lower the 4K resolution by 20% for get a stable 60 fps (which becomes 120 at 1080p) with all settings maxed out, as DLSS malfunctions even in performance mode and annoyingly knocks frame-rates. Here, maybe it would have been the case to be inspired by DOOM also on the technical optimization front.", "date": "2021-06-01", "grade": "5.5"}
