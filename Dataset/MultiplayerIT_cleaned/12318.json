{"name": "Gunpey DS - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gunpey-ds-recensione.html", "text": "Gunpey Ds -this is the name of the game- is nothing more than a puzzle game with rather simple guidelines: within a grid of five columns in width, a series of different blocks slide between them according to the direction and shape of the line in they contained. The sole purpose of the game is to be able to form blocks of boxes capable of creating a connection between the two ends of the grid, only in this way will you be able to eliminate them and continue in the game. The only action that can be performed during the games is that relating to the movement of the cells, possible only and exclusively vertically, as already tested in Meteos (another product of Mizuguchi's mind). The story on which this Gunpey Ds gravitates is almost non-existent: the characters in the game chase each other between planets on the edge of the universe (and often - sad to say - of decency) to conquer the bounty that hangs over their opponents to the sound of musical bars. The main mode is represented by ~border~, in which the player like Meteos, moving between different planets (but without the possibility of choosing) meets the opponent to beat one after the other until the final confrontation with the relative boss . This type of mode comes with two different game styles - original and break - which slightly modify the game experience based on the player's preferences: if with break the eliminated squares will force the immediately higher ones to ~fall~ into the freed spaces, in original these will not move one step. In addition to the border mode, it is also possible to take part in the Gunpey challenge also in ~infinite~ mode, in which - as the word indicates - the goal is to play against yourself until the classic game over message appears. The timed and level-based battles also do not differ much from the other modes: in the first you will compete against the clock and in the second against a specific opponent. The single player of Gunpey -unfortunately- ends here, leaving the player with the possibility of having a friend download a demo version of Gunpey, to challenge him in game sharing or in an even more complete version if in the presence of another owner of the cartridge . The so-called ~G-tone gallery~ concludes the bleak number of modes, a place where all the ~moves~ of a strange character unlocked during the single player are collected, and the sound box, a kind of small music editor useful for creating the own piece to be used later in the game (the song can be created both from scratch and starting from an existing one in Gunpey). The game phase can be tackled in different ways depending on the player's skill and his personal style, the rule that underlies Gunpey (connecting the two extremes of the playing field with a line) can in fact be interpreted in many ways: for a player who prefers to aim for speed and the elimination of blocks with single lines, one of the best tactics is to prepare an articulated and branching grid of lines to be canceled in one go in order to eliminate as many cells as possible. However, in order to obtain complex and profitable results in terms of score, you need a lot of skill, patience and perseverance, qualities that are rewarded by special conditions (which can be activated in an absolutely random and automatic way from the game) for which a particular negative status will be applied to your opponent : ~slot~ will change the direction of each piece, ~no touch~ will inhibit the movement of the blocks, and so on. The gameplay of Gunpey -unfortunately- ends right here: although the player's skill actually opens up different possibilities on how to play a game, the fact of bringing the whole game back to just moving the boxes vertically and above all given the effective absence of events useful for ~handling~ the games, have the result of making Gunpey a game that is too short-lived and too soon boring. Graphically speaking Gunpey is extremely disappointing: Q? Entertainment is a talented software house, capable of pulling out of the consoles on which it works products that are always original and above all visually well-kept. Meteos probably represented the most extreme point touched by the Japanese softco, but this Gunpey exacerbates its spatial look even more, mixing its planetary vision with elements that partly recall Space Channel 5. The result is confusing, too detailed and at the same time poorly defined, too colorful and with characters that seem to have come out of the pencil of an amateur designer, not so much for the quality but for the excessive presence of useless details and accessories. If graphically Gunpey fails to be ~clean~ like Lumines or colorful Meteos, unfortunately also upOn the musical front, the news is not good: the game is probably one of Mizuguchi's least inspired ever, with a series of monotonous motifs, too banal and not too catchy. The claim that follows the game -music puzzle- has probably never been less apt for a game: the graphics are unrelated to the music and the puzzle is really lazily associated with sound effects and music tracks. Gunpey as well as being made for Ds was also developed on PSP with a decidedly different graphic style and a different musical sector, unfortunately Mizuguchi proves that he is unable to make the most of a laptop - the Ds - which in any case in the past proved to be more which is great for games that blend music, puzzles, and skill. Mizuguchi's operation pushes his vision for music-based music games to the limit: the screen is infinitely overfilled and redundant with elements that are in themselves useless to the game and that distract rather than brighten the gaming experience. Graphically unsuitable and musically bad, Gunpey probably proves to be one of the least interesting puzzle games for DS or at least one of the ~poorest~. However, the gameplay itself is not totally to be thrown away and manages to entertain for a few hours, especially in multiplayer sessions. Pros: Simple and linear gameplay Good multiplayer mode Cons: Too poor in everything Music and Graphics disappoint The figure of Gunpei Yokoi has been undeniably fundamental for the world of video games (and in particular for laptops): the brilliant mind behind the creation of Game&Watch, the development of games such as Donkey Kong, Mario bros, Kid Icarus and Metroid, but above all the father of Game Boy. Unfortunately, after years of great success at the helm of R&D1, Nintendo's internal development studio, Yokoi gives life to one of the least understood ~consoles~ in history, the Virtual Boy, thus starting a negative spiral of events that will lead to the creation of his software house Koto Laboratory, to the conception of the WonderSwan (Bandai's portable console) and to his tragic death in a car accident. Following this sad event, a puzzle game with a decidedly simple but captivating structure -Gunpey- was created on WonderSwan, recently re-proposed in an updated and remixed version behind which resides another of the most bizarre and musical minds of the industry: Tetsuya Mizuguchi.", "date": "2007-05-02", "grade": null}
