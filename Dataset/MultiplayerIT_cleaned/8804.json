From the release of the game onwards, spin-offs, single player chapters, modes, character skins, weapons and new maps for multiplayer have followed at regular and constant intervals. Holders of the season pass, a package that costs 2400 Microsoft Points which then allows you to download everything without spending extra, have no selection problems, Multiplayer.it therefore comes to the rescue of those who instead have decided to evaluate the purchase. The new available update, called Fenix Rising, offers five new multiplayer maps, new skins and a little surprise for all Gears fans. 400 reasons to keep fighting The new Gears of War 3 DLC contains a novelty that is quite significant and useless for gameplay purposes, in the multiplayer context. With a nod to Call of Duty, CliffyB wanted to insert a character progression system that manages to ~go beyond~ the classic 100 levels, allowing players to complete an entire cycle 4 times, thus reaching a total of 400 levels (and who knows, surely one day they will also be expanded with the same method). Obviously this system has no other purpose than to allow players to strut their stuff with friends or show their dedication to the game, rather than practical effects on matchmaking or the gameplay itself, but it is still welcome in terms of longevity. The other novelty is the presence of three new weapon skins, not obtainable in any other way than by downloading Fenix Rising: Re-Up Plasma, Re-Up Omen and Re-Up Electric. But, in addition to the maps, the most significant novelty is certainly the presence of four new playable characters: Cole Train in his role as sports champion, the Recruit Clayton Carmine, Savage Marauder and Savage Kantus. For those few who don't know it, Cole was a sports champion and therefore we finally have the chance to be able to interpret him in his glorious clothes as a Trashball player. The second character is one of the Carmine brothers, in this case Clayton, the veteran of the family as well as one of the only two survivors of the Great War. The third is the Savage Kantus, a locust regressed to the primordial form of a shaman after the operation Hollow Storm which caused millions of victims and the separation of the surviving locusts from the Queen. Initially planned as an exclusive character for Gears of War 3 pre-order buyers, it was later added with a variant of battle armor also for those who purchase this new DLC. The last extra character is the Savage Marauder, who also survived Operation Storm after the flood had invaded the entire Hollow, the land where the locusts had organized and lived. Savage Marauder was the first savage creature to live without the Queen Mother's command and to organize with her own kind. Xbox 360 goals Fenix Rising not only adds maps, weapons and characters, but also 250 new points to unlock through 7 objectives. One related to Beast mode, one by completing 50 waves in Horde, two by winning respectfully with COGs or Locusts in multiplayer versus, one by reaching level 100, another by level 200, and the last one by getting all battle decorations. Apart from the last two, a walk. The new maps The first new map to try out is the COG Academy, where nearly every top military officer trained, including the Fenix family and Marcus' father Adam Fenix. It is an almost symmetrical map, whose respawn points are equidistant from two strategic points placed on the sides of the map: the Auditorium and the reading room. Strategic because they contain a Torque bow and a digger, but also because they are protected and privileged positions by height and cover. The two spawn points are open and allow us to see a breathtaking setting, with a huge valley behind us and a boundless horizon but full of naturalistic elements and details. In front of us the map opens onto a courtyard that contains numerous walls, the central statue and a monument, useful for any covers and ambushes. It is a ~classic~ map, suitable for both close and long-range encounters, without favoring either team overwhelmingly. The second map, called Anvil, is based on the Anvil Gate fortified base built by the army in Anvegad during the 79 Years War, called the Pendulum Wars which pitted countries rich in Imulsion against states poorer in this miraculous energy source. The third map is ~Depths~. Set on Azura Island in the middle of deThe Serano Ocean, in whose depths are hidden warehouses, stations and military offices. This map is also perfectly symmetrical, except for the two spawn points which differ slightly in size and placement, but not so much as to benefit one or the other team in the arms race: two diggers on the sides, two shields in the side warehouse and a central boomshot are the first picks. Near the shields a grenade (excellent attached to some corner) and a Mulcher machine gun, powerful but perhaps too slow in such a narrow and closed map where melee contacts are preferred. This is certainly the most fascinating map of the entire DLC pack, especially thanks to its incredibly similar look to BioShock: entirely underwater and surrounded by transparent glass walls. However, the excellent graphic cosmetics and the particular setting of the ~Depths~ map do not allow us to be distracted from its tactical peculiarities: it is full of ravines, roofs, walls and narrow corridors, suitable for close combat, but with two central halls and parallels in which it is also possible to fight from a distance. Vaguely reminiscent of the famous ~traffic jam~ except for the vertical levels of which the latter was rich. ~Depths~ is undoubtedly the most particular map with the most inspired visual design, except for a fairly canonical tactical design and without prominent elements or novelties different from the usual. The fourth map is ~Slab~, which is Jacinto's maximum security prison. Not quite a ~normal~ prison, but rather a place where Sera's most dangerous and violent criminals were thrown in and forgotten by society, as described by a memoir from a COG Officer. ~Slab~ is a very small, tiny map, which therefore favors ~face to face~ versus and close and continuous confrontation without the possibility of hiding for long. The two spawn points are slightly different in size: on one side the dungeon showers, dismal and narrow, while on the other the open courtyard, wider and wider. In the middle of the map, a fundamental weapon, the boomshot, surrounded by two smoke grenades that are quite useless in this context. The latest map isn't entirely new, but rather a welcome return for all fans of the first Gears of War. It is in fact the very popular map ~Escalation~, one of the most loved / hated maps of all the multiplayer history of Gears of War. Loved by the strong, hated by the weak, one might say, because its asymmetrical nature created some tactical advantages for those who started the game from top to bottom, such as to make victories even more painful and coveted. ~Escalation~ is nothing more than a series of levels divided by a double stairway, one to the right and one to the left. Obviously those who start the game from above manage to dominate the view of the entire map, but the game designers have well thought of placing the sniper rifles in the lower portion, so as to balance the disadvantage a bit. It's not easy to snipe from the bottom up, but it's still one of the most fascinating challenges of this very particular map. In the center a Gorgon pistol and a digger, very interesting addition. This is the most demanding map also from the point of view of rhythm, one of the slowest and most reasoned, in which the top team ~camps~ waiting for some false move from the bottom team, which simultaneously tries to climb back up to the top of the map. map where enemies are hiding. Ultimately we are faced with five maps each different from the others, both in terms of tactics and visual design, once again masterfully beautiful and inspired. Each map is obviously inextricably linked to the Gears of War 3 universe and its stories, so in any case you will always feel ~at home~ in each of them because they represent unforgettable single player portions. A must-have DLC for any fan of the Epic saga. Fenix Rising is available for 800 Microsoft Points in the Marketplace and can be downloaded at this address.", "date": "2012-01-23", "grade": "7.8"}
