How would you react if Moioli appeared at the door of your house, dressed as a Swiss peasant girl, to offer you to review a game that simulates tractor races? Imagine the poor editor's face with the code in his hand while the beautiful Umberto goes hopping away with his basket of berries. Recovered from the shock, like a good professional (come on, don't laugh) you just have to install the game and try to think about what it can offer you. The problem is that it immediately becomes difficult for you to link your imaginary racer with the idea that a competition between beasts that go thirty kilometers per hour can be exciting. In short, in your mind you visualize it as a 100-meter race run by naked fat rappers with the lumbago. Started Farm Machines Championships 2013 you have to create a profile, then buy the first tractor and go crazy. There aren't many options to choose from. You can only venture into career mode. Wearing the straw hat we take part in the first competition: a classic circuit race against opponents led by the CPU. After the typical countdown we accelerate and... and accelerate! Come on! Forward junk! Move! Ah, are we already at full speed? In fact, even the opponents don't go very fast... The race is excruciating. The tractors are very slow, a fact that is especially noticeable on a straight stretch of a few meters which takes us more than a few seconds to travel. The sensation of speed is practically zero and the farmhouses, the bales of hay and the grass that sprouts from the ground scroll on the screen with a rhythm similar to that of Pierpaolo's hair regrowth. We can't do it... In the old factory... In addition to the sensation of practically zero speed we were talking about earlier, many other problems of Farm Machines Championships 2013 emerge from the first race. Let's start with vehicle collisions: it is true that two bodies colliding at low speed do not produce the same effects as two bodies , even smaller ones, colliding at much higher speeds, but nothing at all happens here. If you run into an opponent you will be glued to them until you decide to move. However, the same happens with all the other objects in the scenario, such as hay bales, which have the secondary effect of further holding you back. Yes, we know that tractors are already slower than they are, but we can't help it. Among the options in the race there is the possibility to play the horn, useful as an episode of the Test of the Cook, and to change the view, useful as Justin Bieber. After winning the race, as exciting as two old men trying to have sex, we launched into the second event: an exhausting slalom between poles. Basically you have to drive the tractor towards checkpoints, being careful not to touch any obstacles on the track with the vehicle or the long trailer. The problem is still the same as before: the general slowness of the vehicle which makes the action monotonous. Moreover, the checkpoints are located in such a way as to make rather long maneuvers necessary, just to magnify the repetitiveness of the whole and to hurt the poor player. This torment lasts for whole minutes, unless you want to finish first, a will that will result in many game sessions spent learning the location of the checkpoints by heart. Plowing, hauling, harvesting In total Farm Machines Championships 2013 offers eight different disciplines, among which how can we not mention the plowing and harvesting competitions? What do they consist of? But in plowing and reaping, at tractor speed, of course. Imagine having a large field in front of you and having to plow it completely. Minutes and minutes of work having to manage the gears (first and second are fine, plowing in third and fourth you risk overheating the engine) and the position of the plough. Doing it in a farm simulator might make sense, but in a racing arcade? Yes, because since its Farm Machines Championships 2013 it doesn't even have to be a simulator, so you don't have to face the difficulties due to greater realism. Instead, it is necessary to carry out few and very repetitive actions. How nice to go back and forth for a large brown rectangle having to go over several times to raise the earth in all corners! We are talking about long minutes of play that you have to repeat several times in case you are not able to overcome the competition immediately, or in case you want to finish first. We won't be here to bore you with the description of all the disciplines, because life is short and the general discourse we are making around the game should ebe clear enough. The question remains open: which audience is Farm Machines Championships 2013 aimed at? Not for simulation enthusiasts, not for racing enthusiasts and certainly not for those who love country life... who then? Technique and remnants To aggravate the situation there is also the technical aspect, certainly not first-rate, but not second-rate either. We are not only talking about the graphics themselves, of which only the tractor models and little else are saved, but also about some choices in the menus, really ugly but certainly not decisive for the final grade, and in the soundtrack, this much more important in 'aggravate the judgment due to the music totally out of context and poor in content. In short, from an aesthetic point of view there hasn't been great care and even the possibility of representing beautiful agricultural scenarios has been thwarted by the evident haste. Even the sound effects leave something to be desired and to be honest there aren't very many. We understand that the budget to make the game must not have been very high, but it is still a work inferior to several titles certainly not richer than this one. Let's also assume that the game has shown a certain passion for spitting us on the desktop and that in several cases the controls literally froze, forcing us to restart some long and exhausting tests, and you'll understand why we don't have much positive to tell you. The only doubt remains that someone might find it interesting for the subject matter, not so much for the realization, but because we are still talking about the only representative of the genre.", "date": "2012-10-17", "grade": "4.0"}
