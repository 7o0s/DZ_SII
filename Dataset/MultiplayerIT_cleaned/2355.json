Tom Clancy colpisce ancora!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-recon-tom-clancy-colpisce-ancora.html", "text": "April 16, 2008 The republics of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan have again been annexed by Russia. The project appears as clear as it is crazy. Re-establish the old Soviet empire. The whole world wonders if and when war will break out, but this does not apply to us who are secretly engaged in delicate missions. This is a beautiful and cursed profession. On the one hand we have all the best existing technologies, we are the pride of the US military, but on the other hand when there is the slightest crisis we are the first to leave. Well let's go back to our mission, today in the Caucasus mountains is a splendid day and it seems to me a pity to waste it hunting down a rebel. But we are professionals and we have a job to do! The ghosts So do we want to help Private Jefferson complete his mission, restore balance to that area of the planet and return home safe and sound, perhaps with his entire team in tow? As? Very simple! Go to the nearest videogame store, buy the new Red Storm effort, Ghost Recon, install it on your trusted PCs and start playing! The ghosts As attentive readers know, we have always dedicated many pages to this game and we finally have a definitive version that we have reviewed for you. To the laziest of you I can tell right away that we are dealing with a well-made title that is proposed as one of the sales champions of this intense end of 2001. Are you satisfied? Anyway let's take a step back and see what game Ghost Recon is (although I bet everyone already knows the title in question). Ghost Recon like Rainbow Six? Not exactly. Everyone knows that masterpiece that is Rainbow Six, the game that invented a genre and that has proven to have an absolutely extraordinary longevity in a very fickle world like that of video games (by the way, you were expecting a review of Rouge Spear Black Thorn the new Rainbow Six Mission Pack). Ghost Recon is born from R6, but performs the task in a substantially different way, focusing attention on different aspects and essentially becoming an innovative game. The first thing that is evident is the lack of mission planning, so dear to R6 fans. Ghost Recon like Rainbow Six? Not exactly. This is obviously intentional, because in GR we command a handful of soldiers who have to carry out a mission with some intelligence information, but nothing more. The exact location of the enemy forces and their degree of attention are not known. In practice, in GR everything is done in the field, apart from the choice of men and equipment which is done during the Briefing. One of the innovations introduced concerns the management of our men. First of all, there are four categories of Soldiers: Shooters, Support Men, Snipers, and Demolishers. Each of these has a specific armament, which can be changed to other standard configurations. So there is no opportunity that we were given in R6 to freely choose weapons. Also over the course of the game and based on our successes, they will be added to the group of Specialists, who have unique characteristics including equipment. Ghost Recon like Rainbow Six? Not exactly. I haven't told you yet that as in an RPG, men increase their characteristics as the missions progress, so it seems important to choose men well from the start and avoid that any of them get killed. The characteristics that each soldier possesses are four: Weapon, Stealth, Resistance and Command. I think their meaning appears clear enough. Realism as the watchword Although the events narrated in GR take place in the near future, all the weapons and in general the whole background is focused on shocking realism. So be careful not to make noise, use silent weapons and move stealthily. What drove me crazy is the reproduction of the weather conditions, which border on perfection. From the rain to the wind (you should see the tops of the trees swaying) everything is reproduced in minimal terms and thanks to the complicity of the exceptional sound department and the beautiful and large levels, the feeling of being there is all there. Realism as the watchword So if you're used to jumping with a grenade launcher in your hand and slaughtering enemies, this is the least suitable game for you. Here you strip tAmong the vegetation, one takes his aim calmly and tries not to make a mistake, because attracting the attention of a group of Russian soldiers can be harmful to our health. The interface has substantially changed, on the one hand we still don't see the weapon, but on the other we have a very useful command screen, which with disarming simplicity allows us to issue orders to our three action groups. Actually there is also the opportunity to play in tactical mode, choosing to command our troops from the outside, but personally I prefer to crawl through the mud together with my action partners. The famous GO commands are no longer there either. Here everything must be done on the fly, in reality it is always possible to coordinate an action, but the thing is done in a slightly different way thanks to the use of the Stop and Movement commands. An important innovation concerns the Threat indicator, which is represented by a disc placed in the center of the interface and which indicates which side the danger is coming from, also using colors to provide a more precise indication. Its usefulness is revealed to those who find the game very difficult and can see the threats only when they find themselves with a hole in the forehead. Obviously it is possible to exclude this function for Multiplayer games. Realism as the watchword I conclude this paragraph by reminding you of the excellent interface system, which allows extensive customization of the commands and the possibility of reviewing and saving the action thanks to a powerful replay function. Single and multiplayer The Singleplayer experience is mainly composed of a robust campaign mode, which will see us engaged in 15 missions all carried out in the Eastern theater of operations. Once a mission has been successfully completed, we will be able to replay it also in quick mode (as also happened with R6) in three different ways: Mission, Clash and Reconnaissance. Each mission is preceded by an exhaustive briefing, where the objectives of the mission and any difficulties we will encounter are shown. Single and multiplayer For all modes it is possible to choose the level of difficulty, among the three proposed. This ensures a good level of challenge, also because the AI behaves quite realistically. The missions are of various types, ranging from the elimination of objectives, to the capture of important characters (or their liberation), but also missions of reconnaissance and protection of NATO units. Then there is IGOR, the excellent and functional mission editor provided in the game. Truly a round of applause to Red Storm for the creation of this Tool which proves to be one of the best in the sector. We can bet that soon there will be many other missions available on the network. Obviously the management of Mods within the game is implemented in a simple and efficient way. Multiplayer involves playing LAN matches, but above all clashes via the Internet thanks to the Ubi.com portal, after having completed the ritual registration. It is possible to choose between three game modes: Team, Cooperative and Solo, and for each of these there are sub-modes, which significantly expand the range of choices. Single and multiplayer An interesting feature of the Multiplayer of GR and that it is possible to enter the game has also started, of course you have to wait for the round to end, but immediately after we have access to operations. Unlike the SinglePlayer, we can choose all the equipment we want (provided that the appropriate option has been activated in the Game Server). The games are almost always based on moving stealthily and shooting from afar. I remind you that one shot and you are at the creator, therefore the tactic of the kamikaze who fires left and right does not pay off here. Mission accomplished Meanwhile, I remind you that the version we tested is wonderfully localized, and then let's face it: Ghost Recon is a good game. It's actually a great game! I bet that soon many communities will form around the game, as already happened for Rainbow Six. Mission accomplished Good graphics, great atmosphere and a great gameplay for a written success. What else to say? Nothing go get your copy of Ghost Recon and happy hunting!! Oh I forgot, the flaws? Maybe just two. The first is given by the impossibility of driving vehicles, the second by the lack of voice chat. April 16, 2008 My name is Vernon Jefferson and I am a soldier of Company D, precisely of the 5th grouppo of the 1st Battalion. The team I belong to and what some call the Elite, the best of the best, are the Special Forces, the famous Ghosts. Today I am with my comrades near Tbilisi in Georgia to capture a certain Bakur Papashvili, a rebel leader who is encamped near the Caucasus Mountains. Since the Ultranationalist Radicals took power in Russia, there is incredible tension in the whole area.", "date": "2001-11-19", "grade": null}
