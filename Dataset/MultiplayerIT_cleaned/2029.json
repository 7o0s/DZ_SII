{"name": "Hunter: The Reckoning", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hunter-the-reckoning_a.html", "text": "Deliver us from evil... A game, an adventure, a beat'em up. You will experience horror, punishment, pain, sacrifice, revenge, fear, tension, anxiety and other conflicting feelings; Are you ready to pursue evil? Are you ready to forcefully drive him out of this earth? Or at least you want to beat your hands (and not only)? Before going into the details of the adventure, however, a bit of history and a prelude seems obligatory to better understand what world we will enter; certainly a world of darkness and horror... You are in Ashcroft, a ~quiet~ American town whose only major institutions were the great penitentiary and the railway and where life passed almost serene and without disturbances. But one day a fortuitous event such as the execution in the electric chair of multiple murderer Nathaniel Arkady unleashes the spirits of the renegades who over the years had populated and died in that prison, but four people managed to curb and reject the thirst for blood of the spirits and to seal the penitentiary, apparently though... But now Ashcroft stands on the threshold between the world of the living and the world of the dead, while someone or something plays with his destiny. Now it's up to you to free the former charming town from the evil and hatred that has poured into it... Four good guys and their faithful company: Once you have enjoyed the introduction, you will have the opportunity to step into the shoes of one of the four main characters of the story: Spencer ~Deuce~ Wyatt, Samantha Alexander, Kassandra Cheyung and Father Esteban Cortez. Each of the aforementioned characters corresponds to a different profile with different strengths and different weaknesses. The classes that reflect our heroes are precisely: avenger, protector, martyr and judge; and each one is obviously equipped with characteristic weapons both for close combat and for long range. So while the avenger wanders through the maze of the city armed with an ax and a shotgun, the protectress is armed with a katana and a magnum pistol, while the martyr has double daggers and self-loading pistols and the judge entrusts his fate to the sword of the crusader and a crossbow. This more than discreet destructive paraphernalia is joined by special weapons used by everyone and quite simply available in the various locations ranging from various models of classic shotguns to machine guns up to some precious goodies such as chainsaws, flamethrowers and rocket launchers. A respectable arsenal which is accompanied by the ~words of power~. The power of the verb Words of power, this is what could make the difference between defeat and the glory of victory, sometimes sheer force of arms and will might not be enough to back down and defeat the forces of evil; in this case we will rely on the words of power. Each of the Hunters starts with a single word at a minimum level, but during his clash with the horror and the forces of evil he could get up to three words and take all three to the third, and higher , level. These words of power of which I give you a brief description are: CLEAVER: increases the power of melee weapons; STROKE: 360 shockwave escaping from the hunter's body; BARRIER: aura of protection from evil creatures; JUDGMENT: immobilizes creatures by turning against them the weight of their own sins; SACRED WORD: cone of sacred light that radiates from the hunter and strikes the creatures of evil; EFFORT: increases the abilities and physical parameters of the hunter; PUNISHMENT: All creatures that wound the hunter are ~punished~ with a portion of the damage dealt; YOUTH: takes care of the hunter. As well as the weapons, the words of power are also assigned differently among the hunters and each one has the possibility of using only three pre-set ones which are schematically: AVENGER: Cleaver, Beat, Barrier; PROTECTIVE: Youth, Barrier, Effort; MARTYR: Effort, Punishment, Judgement; JUDGE: Holy Word, Judgment, Youth. A dive into hell: So our heroes are well equipped and trained, but for what? What will await us in our adventure? Death, Evil and Pain; this and more will get in our way. Certainly a perilous journey and not without mortal dangers. All made with dark, gloomy but detailed, clean and fascinating graphics,with refined and defined textures both for the characters (sometimes truly animated to excellence) and for the environments. Furthermore, the monsters on the screen appear in impressive waves with a large number of characters present at the same time; the music is gloomy at the right point and anguished and distressing in several points, with average or above average effects and nothing left to chance; therefore an audio-video riot at excellent levels... As far as playability is concerned, after a brief but necessary training and indoctrination in the use of the pad, it is possible to make the carnage of zombies flow naturally and without getting stuck with the controls ( interesting and excellent dividing movement and aim on the two levers of the pad, creating the possibility of retreating by shooting and other interesting combinations). However, everything turns out to be quite simple and linear enough, perhaps too much in my opinion, but this makes the title in question immediate, fun and, why not, relaxing. Four is better... A brief note on a fact that should not be underestimated. The game is great to play with friends and studied also, if not above all, for multiplayer. Honestly, I tested it at most in three but also in two or four it shouldn't be bad at all, with quite diversified characters also and above all in terms of characteristics; as always, the level of fun when you are in company increases considerably, by competing and helping each other by cooperating. Fun. Concluding Excellent title, fun especially with friends but also alone, the settings are also excellent, fast, quite difficult but not too much, one of the first examples of not cloying Beat'em up in recent years; some flaws of course but secondary as an excessive simplicity in the mechanism of the game which sometimes leads to a certain repetitiveness but which does not disturb too much, especially if we are in some company. Interesting purchase to end the holidays and not having to commit too much brains. Pros: Four well-characterized characters Hundreds of Zombies to slaughter Excellent and well-finished graphics Cons: Four of the screen gets crowded sometimes too much It will be difficult for you to use your head Maybe a little repetitive Materials: Preview Image gallery Movies Tricks", "date": "2002-08-23", "grade": null}
