Land of Wonders and Cuccchi. Today however, FORECLOSED is finally available, a cyberpunk adventure that relies entirely on a graphic novel style. Has Antab Studio been able to hit the mark? Find out in our FORECLOSED review. The story of Evan Kapnos FORECLOSED: The opening scene of the game FORECLOSED tells the story of Evan Kapnos, an employee of Securtech, a technology company that went bankrupt during the night before the game begins. However, bankruptcy leaves us not only without a job, but also without an identity. In the cyberpunk world of FORECLOSED, set in the year 2084, every person is bonded to our body's cybernetic implants and it comes at a price: the debt is borne by our employers and their bankruptcy is ours too. Unfortunately, losing access to one's identity means not being able to leave the city and not being able to see the faces of the people in front of us. A tragedy, clear, but not as serious as the fact that as soon as we leave our apartment to go to the court - as we were ordered to do - we are almost killed. We are saved only because an experimental firmware is activated, which amplifies our senses and allows us to dodge a bullet. From here begins an adventure that will revolve around the value of personal identity, the dehumanization we suffer in the face of bureaucracy and a society obsessed with rules, while multinationals pursue their own interests in the background. Obviously we don't want to go into too much detail on the main events of the plot or, better to say, it's much better if we don't, because FORECLOSED is very short. The whole adventure lasts about two and a half hours (in part it depends on the level of difficulty chosen) and in the course of the story it tries to touch too many themes for its own possibilities. Brevity, in and of itself, is never a negative, but FORECLOSED would have benefited from a higher playing time or a less structured and more concentrated plot on few but dense details. As it is, however, Antab Studio's work reaches a really hasty conclusion, leaving the results of some characters pending. Shooter gameplay FORECLOSED: Third person shooter sections are bland FORECLOSED is not a narrative adventure based on pure plot, on the contrary, it is first and foremost a third-person shooter. Our protagonist will have to continually make his way through hordes of henchmen ready to kill us and to defend himself he will have enhanced implants and a special weapon. Kapnos levels up as he defeats enemies and finds collectibles. Leveling up allows him to gain skill points which can be spent to unlock perks for the weapon. Basically it is a classic pistol (with infinite ammunition), but it can be transformed into a machine gun or a high-caliber revolver, powerful but less accurate on consecutive shots. Also you can unlock ammunition that can overcome enemy protections. These skills can be activated or deactivated and, while equipped, cause our chips to overheat. The same happens using some psychic abilities, such as the ability to throw objects, create a barrier and lift enemies to block them and expose them to our blows. FORECLOSED also allows you to act in stealth, roasting enemy chips FORECLOSED gives us various tools to advance in the game, but overall the combat system doesn't work perfectly. Especially at maximum difficulty and in the initial stages, the most effective tactic is to choose a safe point and fire a few precise shots, taking cover again in case you are taking too much damage, waiting to recover your life. A trivial trench warfare is therefore created, with the enemies not moving from their position and us eliminating them one by one in an orderly manner, trying not to overheat the chips and not end up KO. Some structurally very simple stealth phases are added to the fights. Except in the initial sections (during which we don't have a gun yet), for most of the game it's not mandatory to try to stealth, it's just an additional possibility that allows us to thin out the enemies before starting to shoot. To close the circle there will be rosewater puzzle components, in which we mostly have to find, via a radar, energy boxes hidden in the walls, to open several blocked doors. Despite being short, FORECLOSED repeats sections that are very similar to each other too many times. You don't get toThe point of getting bored and abandoning the game, mind you, but some additional gimmicks wouldn't have hurt, especially considering the potential of the graphic and directorial style chosen by the developers. Graphic novel art FORECLOSED has a graphic novel panel style The great strength of FORECLOSED is its graphic novel art structure. The whole story is constructed as if our screen were a page on which cartoons appear. It is a very interesting directorial choice, well done on a visual level and able to make the whole story much more enjoyable. Thanks to the presence of multiple vignettes, which can also overlap, we can see each scene from multiple points of view, with small sections of the screen zooming in on the most important details. Furthermore, the point of view often switches from being in the third person to a top down or isometric or side view. All these sections are usually pure exploration: exploiting them even during the gameplay phases would have allowed to mix the cards on the table and make everything less repetitive. The view of FORECLOSED can change during exploration Speaking of the pure technical realization, let's applaud Antab Studio: FORECLOSED's cel shading is simple, but well done and goes wonderfully with the idea of a graphic novel. There are also real onomatopoeias on the screen linked to our actions (shooting, throwing objects...). One thing is for sure: FORECLOSED is one of the coolest styled games we've played lately. Nintendo Switch version Our test took place mainly on PC, but we also had the opportunity to test the Nintendo Switch version. The differences between the two editions are obviously purely technical: on computers the resolution and frame rate are higher. While not a game that focuses on detail, FORECLOSED on PC offers a cleaner image, both thanks to the higher resolution and thanks to a practically zero aliasing effect (which is instead present on Switch). The game action is also enjoyable with the controller, thanks to an automatic aim that is always on the piece (you can adjust it in the options, however).", "date": "2021-08-12", "grade": "7.0"}
