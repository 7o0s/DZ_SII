Although this evaluation is obviously susceptible to personal tastes and preferences, it is indisputable that the title of the Australian studio at the time called Firemint is a product of great quality, in many ways more akin to the world of ~traditional~ consoles than that of smartphones. But between the second chapter and this Real Racing 3 many things have changed: Firemint was acquired by the giant Electronic Arts, merged with the countrymen of IronMonkey renaming itself Firemonkeys, and chose to adopt the very popular Free to Play model for its own publication of the third version of his racing game. An unpopular choice, which has unleashed the wrath of many fans who have seen behind it the desire to transform the franchise into a money-sucking machine with microtransactions. But is this the truth? Who goes slow... Before discussing the thorny issue in question, however, it seems correct to describe the elements that make up Real Racing 3, starting with the graphic layout; to get the most precise idea possible we tested the game on various terminals, specifically iPhone 5, iPad Mini, iPad Retina (fourth generation) and Nexus 7. What appeared clear to us was that the MINT 3 Engine, i.e. the graphic engine adopted on this occasion, is capable of giving life to the best that can be seen today from an aesthetic point of view on smartphones and tablets: being able to have a powerful terminal, Real Racing 3 is often capable of leaving you speechless in front of to the quality of the modeling of the cars, the level of detail, the abundance of effects, the dynamic lighting and the fluidity of the action. An exceptional result even more considering the possibility of finding up to 22 cars on the track, an element that manages to give great drama and pathos to the competitions. In the face of all this spectacle, the absence of a replay function is quite inexplicable, which we believed was by now an established standard in the racing game genre. What is certain is that to see the Firemonkeys title run at its maximum it is necessary, as previously mentioned, a terminal of a certain level; otherwise, the high scalability of the MINT 3 Engine allows you to always maintain a more than acceptable fluidity of the action, but at the cost of an even substantial resizing of the final result especially in the Android environment, where fragmentation certainly does not play in favor of the optimization on single device. On Nexus 7 there is a heavy downgrade that affects textures and details, and which for example sees the function of the rear-view mirrors disappear from the internal view; we are well aware that obviously for the price at which it is offered it certainly cannot be defined as a technically robust tablet, but at the same time we are quite convinced that much more can be obtained from the Tegra 3. Even on iPad Mini, which in fact has hardware comparable to that of iPad 2, there are cuts, but much less marked. However, thinking that Real Racing 3 is just graphics would be really wrong, and a few numbers are enough to prove the opposite: 961 races, 22 circuits and 46 real cars from brands such as Ford, Lamborghini, Nissan, Porsche, Audi and BMW give the perception of the extraordinary content work carried out by Firemonkeys, with a very remarkable longevity that is accompanied by a decidedly satisfying realistic driving model, which improves the already interesting one of the second chapter and which leaves some perplexity only for the approximate management of impacts with the trackside protections. The presence of 8 different types of events also allows you to offer a certain variety to the races, reducing the natural and inevitable repetitiveness which is however intrinsic in this kind of game. Hand to wallet? Even the much vaunted function of the Time Shifted Multiplayer convinces in the test of facts; basically eliminating any risk of lag, disconnections and problems related to the classic multiplayer that is unsuitable for cellular networks for a racing game, Firemonkeys has decided to make sure that the opponents during the races are non-anonymous drivers controlled by the CPU, but other players or perhaps Facebook friends who have previously played that same challenge at another time. Let it be clear, the exact identical conduct of the race is not replicated, but on the contrary the final time and the pace on the laps are used to thus ~create~ a virtual challenger to be beaten. Actually the paint exchanges and the tactics based on ~supports~ andrear-end collisions should be limited as much as possible, because a rather complex and realistic damage management system reduces the performance of your vehicle in proportion to the state in which it is found. At the end of the race, any problem can then be instantly remedied, but at the cost of a little hard-earned virtual money. However, together with the damage caused by impacts, there is also the element of wear and tear, which requires you to replace the tyres, change the oil, fix the engine, the brakes or the suspension after a certain number of km travelled. In this case, the money is not enough to be able to get back on track immediately: in fact, you have to agree to wait several minutes, or even hours, while your car is fixed. Or cancel the wait by spending some of the precious gold tokens, which represent the second currency in the game and which are also needed to repaint the bodywork, buy the last steps of the tuning and unlock groups of races without having to win trophies on the track. And here we finally arrive at the key point, namely the management of the free to play element; although victories and driver levels provide money and gold, these are never enough (especially with the more expensive cars) to be able to proceed easily without having to repeat races already completed or without having to wait for repairs. Mitigating the problem is certainly possible by expanding one's fleet, but the costs of the latter and the strong need to install all the upgrades to be competitive in the face of the high difficulty on which Real Racing 3 is cunningly set makes the purchase of money and gold often bordering on forced necessity. And seeing 89.90 packages in the in-app store can only give the impression that the sense of limit and decency has probably been lost.", "date": "2013-03-04", "grade": "8.0"}
