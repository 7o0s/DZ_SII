The Hungarian software house has been active since the nineties, even starting from Commodore's divine Amiga. They recently made themselves known for an interesting collaboration with Grasshopper, which brought to light Sine Mora. Now it's the turn of Bang Bang Racing, a simple racing game, designed to bring back the old 16-bit racing games like Micromachines. We have therefore returned to the old bird's eye shot, while the engine is completely polygonal and with a comic style. Let's see the product in detail. No holds barred Bang Bang Racing features a single player career based on four competitions, each divided into a series of events on specific circuits, characterized by an increasing level of difficulty. It's not just the tracks that present increasingly challenging corners, but the same artificial intelligence of the opponents becomes more aggressive the further we get into the competitions. The aim is always to cross the finish line between the top three positions, but as the campaign proceeds, nice variants are offered. These include elimination, where every few seconds the competitor in the rearmost position is disqualified, or the classic timed races where you fight exclusively against the clock. There are no rules, in the name of the venerable arcade racing school: doors, criminal swerves and impacts are the order of the day in Digital Reality's latest effort, rest assured that the CPU will have no qualms about sending you off the track. It is even possible to detonate special explosive barrels, with curious consequences on the circuit, such as the opening of shortcuts. Hence the name of the title. Xbox 360 goals Bang Bang Racing supports the new scoring provisions for Live Arcade titles. This means that we have 400 player points spread across 12 objectives. To win half of them, you need to complete all competitions and their respective tournaments, while the rest are dedicated to time trials and local multiplayer races. So arm yourself with friends in the flesh, the perfect score is peremptory! Like old times Perhaps to avoid excessive chaos, the developers have preferred to omit special weapons or particular power ups, the only resource we can count on, in addition to driving skills, is the nitro bar, which can be activated with a special key, which allows us momentarily increase speed. In addition to this we must pay attention to the health bar, which drops dangerously in clashes, but which we can restore by passing through the pitsops located near the finish line. The operation is much quicker than you think, since the car is reset on the fly, this allows you not to lose precious seconds, maintaining a balanced pace in the races. There are a fair number of circuits and they enjoy mentioning famous tracks, from Suzuka to Montecarlo up to the ever-present Laguna Seca. The technical realization is certainly one of the best aspects of the production, with many colors, a very nice style and a wealth of details. It must be admitted that even from a playful point of view, the Digital Reality title is quite successful, overcoming the races unlocks new circuits, cars and customized liveries, in order to keep the sense of satisfaction alive. Once all the races of a competition have been completed, we will have free access to a points championship where we can tackle the tracks in succession. The camera used makes the action sometimes confusing for the movements made, and the artificial intelligence relies on various tricks to be competitive, but the races work all in all and never fail to entertain. The most relevant problem is the absolute lack of online multiplayer, a really incomprehensible choice by the developers. In fact, Bang Bang Racing only offers the possibility of tackling local races, greatly limiting the longevity of the game.", "date": "2012-07-02", "grade": "6.8"}
