After all, many players have been allowed to experience milestones such as ICO and Rez for the first time, while those who had already appreciated them can now relive the same emotions with high definition to act as an effective digestive. Capcom, which is certainly not new to this type of initiative, has thus decided to seize the opportunity again and relaunch Resident Evil: Code Veronica, an excellent chapter first released on the Dreamcast and subsequently appeared on PlayStation 2 and GameCube. However, the horror series of the Japanese software house has seen big changes in recent times: what effect does it have going back over eleven years? Dead Island This new HD version for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade is based, as the title suggests, on Code Veronica X, the first re-proposition for Dreamcast and PS2 featuring some additions in the game and in the CG movies. The protagonist of the plot is a young Claire Redfield, who enters the Paris base of the Umbrella Corporation in an attempt to find and recover her brother Chris. However, something goes wrong, Claire is captured during the operation and taken to Rockfort Island prison, a sort of Alcatraz contaminated by the T-virus and, of course, populated only by zombies. Twists, political intrigue, battles with gigantic tyrants and a heart-pounding ending: for many fans of the series, Code Veronica X was one of the best episodes in terms of storytelling, deepening the character of Albert Wesker in his attempt to recover a sample of a powerful new virus called T-Veronica, although much of the background is revealed through the traditional documents and diaries scattered among the rooms of the structure. All accessible to anyone thanks to an Italian localization of the subtitles. Particularly successful was the passing of the baton in the middle of the adventure, with which the player returned to assume the role of the agile and beardless Chris Redfield of the very first episode, nothing to do with the lived and fit man of the fifth chapter. Obviously the main innovations introduced by this new version concern almost exclusively the aesthetic aspect, now enhanced by high definition graphics. This is not a sensational leap, especially due to the very poor textures, but at least the developers have made an effort to add dynamic lights capable of making the environments much more lively: now, for example, moving in a dark room holding the lighter, it is possible to illuminate the surrounding area much more credibly. The result is more than decent, but if you have the continuous feeling of playing a decade-old survival horror it's not because of the technical realization. 11 years and hearing them all It is no secret that Resident Evil is among the worst aged videogame series, and having to deal with a cumbersome, slow and not very intuitive scheme of related controls nowadays is a real test of strength on the part of the player. Finding yourself without bullets often forces you to sneak away from the arms of a zombie, or face it intrepidly armed with a knife, although the tension of the moment depends more on the impossibility of moving freely than on the game's ability to instill terror. If nothing else, those who miss a survival horror in which to feel helpless and constantly threatened will have bread for their teeth. Much more questionable is the choice to leave the classic interlude sequences intact between one room and another, born as a ploy to disguise the loading of the next level with a long animation of a door or a staircase: the problem is that these moments cannot be skipped in any way despite being superfluous on today's console, abruptly interrupting the pace of the game and indeed making it frustrating when, exploring the area in search of a clue, the player finds himself returning to the own steps. The intention to re-propose one of the historical chapters to long-time fans and the most curious among new enthusiasts finally collides with a rather unfortunate price range: 1600 Microsoft Points (the equivalent of 20 on PSN, half for PlayStation Plus users) may seem to many an excessive outlay for a game which, although refreshed in its graphics, carries an entire decade on its back during which the Capcom horror saga went on with new chapters, new reissues and many versions budget. Playstation 3 trophies The second novelty introduced in Code Veronica X HD is the ability to unlock trophies, but it must be said that, although they may represent an extra incentive to finish the adventure, they are quite limited in number and mostly require simple progress in the game. However, we have 12 trophies, two silver and one gold which allows us to obtain the rocket launcher in a second playthrough.", "date": "2011-09-26", "grade": "6.8"}
