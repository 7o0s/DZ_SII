Obviously this is often possible thanks to the introduction of a dedicated patch, which improves a video game from many points of view. It is also the case of Warframe which, after years and years of honorable service, arrives on PS5 with various improvements. Our tests were based on a direct comparison between the PS4 version and the PS5 version of Warframe. In our review of Warframe on PS5 we will analyze the most relevant differences. Uploads and resolution As with many other games, Warframe takes advantage of the PS5 SSD to significantly reduce load times. In a single second the very first load resolves (compared to 7 seconds on the HDD) and, after connecting and checking for updates, it only takes about ten seconds and a little more to get into the game. The saving is about 30 seconds. The difference is also noticeable in in-game loads, an easy test can be performed by going from Cetus to the Plains of Eidolon simply by walking. The waiting time for the opening of the doors, which hide the loading, is about 40 seconds less. As with any game, but especially in one like Warframe where you switch from one mission to another (with related loads) every few minutes, being able to reduce wasted time is very important. The loading speed also has a big effect on environmental elements that no longer suffer from that annoying pop up of the old-gen version. In Cetus' market, which is dense with items, it is possible to run and roll at maximum speed without anything suddenly loading in front of our eyes as we move. Also improving is the resolution and frame rate (now up to 60 FPS in 4K), which allow for a more fluid and detailed experience. For example, let's make a comparison on our Tenno in the foreground, which inevitably we will find ourselves looking at very often. As you can see, the resolution increase brings out more detail of the armor and weapons on the back. The new lighting system As you may have noticed, however, it is not only the increase in resolution that changes things. The bulk of the work is done by the new lighting system. The collected images come from the aforementioned Cetus, one of the first settlements in the game, a convenient place in which to observe the main changes. For example, let's start with the shadows, almost absent in the PS4 version, now much more realistic on PS5. Both our Tenno and its fluttering companion cast a full shadow on the ground. The difference is perfectly visible in the two images below. However, the advantage of the new lighting system is not only linked to the length of the shadow, but also to the area affected by the light effects. Look at the Cetus landing area for example - in the PS4 version the texture is not affected by the light in any way, as if it were in perpetual shadow regardless of the position of the sun. On PS5, however, the presentation is much more realistic. The increased resolution and enhanced lighting effects also allow for multiple environmental elements to be more detailed and natural. Furthermore, in the case of reflections from surfaces wet by the rain, on PS5 there is a more realistic effect, while on PS4 you are simply dazzled, as if you had a spotlight pointed in your eyes. Even more relevant, however, the fact that the PS5 version of Warframe can exploit the superior power of the console to introduce more polygonal elements and increase the render distance. In fact, the following pair of images allows us to notice two macro elements: first of all, in the lower right corner there is an additional post. In the background, however, there is an extra tree. In addition, light and detail also play an important role with water. As you can see, on PS4 Warframe offers a flat texture with no light reflections. Even if the ripples of the water have not been modified, on PS5 the lighting system helps to highlight them, giving an effect of greater realism (even more sensitive in movement, less impactful in a single frame). Finally, we offer you a comparison image from the Cetus market that encompasses all the Warframe improvements on PS5 in one shot. For example, you can notice the enormous difference caused by the light that affects not only the shadows but also the colors of the textures, creating greater contrast and making the scene more alive. Also note the leaves of the tree in the top center: the light gives more depth and clarity to the canopy of the plant. Top destra, however, you can see the tops of other trees: in the PS4 version the foliage is less in number and detail. The increase in resolution instead affects the closest elements, which are now clearer: look for example at the cable with the three blue lanterns in the center of the image. Also, the blue, green and red signs in the center of the image have additional text not displayed on PS4. The advantages of DualSense All the improvements mentioned, however, are only part of the package. Warframe, on PS5, has well thought of taking advantage of the unique functions of the DualSense. Thanks to the ability to boot the PS4 version via PS5 (after downloading both versions, of course), anyone can make a quick comparison and tell the difference. While far from the peaks touched by Astro's Playroom, the haptic feedback of the DualSense allows you to take a step forward compared to the generic vibration of the PS4 version of Warframe. Each shot fired feels on the hands, with differences between weapons such as a generic rifle and a bow, which returns the tension of the string and the release of the arrow. R2 also slightly resists the pressure making each bullet hit more physical. It's not a particularly refined or complex implementation, but it's a well-placed plus that helps add an extra sensory dimension to the experience. Our hope is that what has been done with the DualSense in Warframe becomes the norm on PS5. A recommended step Switching to the PS5 version, therefore, is more than recommended. The game is at its best on consoles and on Sony's next-gen platform there is the exclusive benefit of using DualSense. Warframe is also a free to play, so it is obvious that this technical upgrade is completely free. The game is PS5-PS4 cross-play so, even if your team doesn't have the new generation console yet, there's no risk of finding yourself divided: in the worst case you'll have to wait for their loading, slower than yours, finish. Try not to let him weigh it. Historical fans will therefore be able to continue their adventures, switching smoothly to the new version: just be sure to download the correct one! The PS4 version launched on PS5 has better loading, but otherwise lacks all the new features described. If, on the other hand, you are a new player who has yet to begin your Warframe journey, know that you must prepare yourself for a huge universe, from many points of view. Warframe counts, after years of updates, lots of content and lots of mechanics. The early stages can be tackled lightly, without worrying too much about materials, projects, mods and so on, but continuing you find yourself in a game that demands dedication and grinding before being dominated. However, being free, fun in co-op, having (especially now) beautiful graphics, multiple contents and intuitive and satisfying gameplay, even those who have some doubts should give Warframe a chance.", "date": "2021-01-14", "grade": "9.0"}
