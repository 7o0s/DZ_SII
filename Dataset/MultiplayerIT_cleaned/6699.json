The fans who support the brand are many and such as to have even justified the development of an excellent quality fighting game/visual novel, and while the spasmodic wait for the fifth Persona, scheduled for next year, grows, one must necessarily fall back on experiments like this Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth, conceived as a sort of spiritual crossover between the saga of the same name and the successful ~old style~ RPG series Etrian Odyssey. A risky combination, perhaps, but not so much, given that the two brands have several things in common. Further curious, then, is the fact that Persona is in turn a spin-off of Shin Megami Tensei, another brand that offers some peculiar characteristics of Etrian Odyssey  and vice versa. In short, the ingredients for an omelette were all there, but we ended up with a delicious stuffed omelette on the plate. The mnage  trois of Persona 3, Persona 4 and Etrian Odyssey works like a charm, but only fans will like it The labyrinth of life As a spin-off, Persona Q has a strength and a weakness at the same time: you don't need to have played the two titles it draws on, both because the plot doesn't connect to them in a particular way, and because the characters will clearly explain what the their powers, how they met, and what their purpose was in the original adventures. On the other hand, those who have never played Persona 3 or Persona 4 will not understand the many small nuances of the dialogues, the numerous references and quotes, as well as the irony in the vast majority of interactions. It's the curse of the fanservice, and there's little you can do about it, but Persona Q has another great quality, and that is that of presenting the characters with all their little quirks thanks to divinely written - and often also recited - dialogues: even if Persona 3 has not been played, in short, it is impossible not to become attached to Junpei or Koromaru, and considering that the latter is a dog and has no jokes, we can say that it is a great achievement. The story, on the other hand, does not take place in a precise moment of the two games, which after all take place years apart from each other, but there is also an explanation for the one on which, however , we will glide so as not to spoil the surprise. In fact, the player chooses the protagonist ~cast~ (that of Persona 3 or that of Persona 4, in fact) and begins the story with our heroes who go to school in an ordinary day, only to find themselves trapped in a kind of space-time limbo. There they will meet Zen and Rei, a rather strange couple who hide many secrets, and they will begin to explore the labyrinth hidden inside the school. In short, the prologue is different depending on the selected cast, and our stars only gather at the end of the first dungeon, allowing access to a huge roster of characters that differ in skills, stats and types of attacks. The plot continues through an infinite number of dialogues, optional or not: the cutscenes are important to better understand what is happening and what has caused this kind of temporal paradox, but sometimes the heart of the matter is lost in an ocean of gags and bickering designed only to wink at the fans of Persona 3 and Persona 4, playing on the idiosyncrasies of the characters and their characters. In short, for those who have played the original titles, it is a real treat, but those who are not accustomed to reading - especially if they know little English - will probably find the various interruptions annoying, especially when they follow one another at a fast pace. In any case, the game is called Persona Q and, in this sense, it fulfills its duty perfectly, as it has everything a Persona fan looks for in the series: a brainy plot, hilarious characters, gag after gag and a creepy atmosphere that beautifully clashes with the colorful and super deformed character design of Shigenori Soejima and with the soundtrack of Atsushi Kitajoh and Toshiki Konishi, a mix of beautiful new songs and remixes that accompany the exploration and j-pop pounding fights and play guitars. Down the rabbit hole If Persona Q's outward appearance is, apparently, that of the RPG of the same name released for PlayStation 2, its heart belongs to the Etrian Odyssey brand. Once past the cutscenes, the endless dialogues and the simple, intuitive menus, the aim of the game becomes quite obvious: to explore the various floors of four dungeons that make up the ~labyrinth~ where probably the only hope is kept,for our heroes to return to their original timelines. The exploration in question takes place entirely in first person and at that point the game turns into a real Etrian Odyssey, with its polygonal corridors, random encounters with enemies, traps, secret passages and Formido Oppugnatura Exsequens, that is, the FOEs that in the other Atlus dungeon crawler stand for Field On Enemy: monsters that appear on the map and that are much stronger than the others, real mini-bosses to dodge until you are powerful enough to face them without dying miserably. Leveling, in Persona Q, is almost everything: even the most common enemies offer an over the top challenge even at the lowest difficulty levels and must be fought with a pinch of strategy and an abundant use of upgrades and weakening. Those who have played Etrian Odyssey, especially the episodes prior to the Untold remake, will be perfectly comfortable with the difficulty of Persona Q and, perhaps, will also be happy to know that this latest Atlus effort offers four levels. Even the lowest one, however, often comes across common enemies that are tougher than normal, and in those cases the only way out is the system of weaknesses and ~boosts~ borrowed from the Persona series. Each character, thanks to his protective spirit, can cast various spells, and by hitting a certain enemy with the right element it is possible to gain a ~boost~ which, in this case, does not guarantee an extra turn as in real Personas, but the possibility to cast another spell at no cost: a very important bonus, given that magic points are scarce and, between the limited inventory and backtracking, leaving the dungeon to go and get treatment - for a fee! - certainly not ideal. Not to mention that inserting a chain of critical hits and boosts allows, with a little strategy, to literally dominate the battlefield. In this sense, the ~sub Personas~ that all the characters can equip are of fundamental importance: in Persona Q it is not only the protagonists of Persona 3 and Persona 4 who are the ~wild cards~ who can change their Persona, but also all the other heroes. New spirits are obtained randomly by defeating enemies, and can be fused in the Velvet Room to generate more with the abilities of those consumed. Once again, tactics win hands down: choosing which Persona to equip and with which skills is very important when facing the most difficult enemies, and the number of collectible characters and spirits allows for a truly incredible variety of builds and formations. The 3D effect Without art or part, the stereoscopic effect in Persona Q guarantees good depth during first-person exploration and cut-scenes, but on the other hand makes the graphics a bit muddy, especially with blurred backdrops. Turn it on, but don't overdo it. Through the mirror Persona Q may seem like a textbook RPG that all fans of the franchise will recognize, but it must be borne in mind that it is actually an Etrian Odyssey ~dressed~ as Persona, and not the other way around. In a certain sense, the Atlus title seeks a compromise between two different schools of thought united by a predilection for intricate dungeons and more or less unbridled grinding, but it is still a deep Etrian Odyssey in which static menus replace exploration in third person of the settings and the dungeons offer ad nauseam the same corridors, the same textures and the same enemies on each floor. Defining them repetitive, however, would be a serious mistake, given that the level design in this sense is absolutely stratospheric: the labyrinths are intricate, full of puzzles and traps, and as usual it is possible to draw the map on the lower screen of the console, taking advantage of a myriad of icons and options to customize and refine it. This is a typical feature of the Etrian Odyssey, of course, and even in this case Atlus has come to meet those who might not like it with some options that draw it automatically or intelligent icons that determine by themselves the type of detail you want to specify. On the other hand, if it is true that the Persona component has inherited its wonderful characters, churning out hilarious interactions and ~what ifs~ of the best kind, it is also true that it has lost those small characteristic elements such as Social Links, the calendar and the ~dating sim~. If the player wants to know more about the characters, and see them interact outside the dungeons, he can always resort to the optional cutscenes in the ~Stroll~ mode, but it is a divertissement designed above all for fans with concrete purposes limited to a handful of sidequests. First person combat may also appearand rather Spartan, to those used to seeing the characters mix with the enemies on the battlefield: in this regard, Persona Q offers the very welcome possibility of altering the speed of the clashes, in the sense that it is possible to visualize them in the Etrian Odyssey way, limiting the interaction with enemies to the sound effects of the attacks and a little more, or as in a normal jRPG, with the polygonal models of the characters that appear a few seconds to attack the target. An ingenious and pleasant solution, which however betrays the rather modest technical realization of the game: the models of the characters and enemies are poor in details and the aliasing is remarkable, especially if stereoscopy is active, but fortunately the character design is extremely cartoonish alleviates the defect and the animations during the interlude chats are certainly more engaging than the simple static artwork that Etrian Odyssey had accustomed us to.", "date": "2014-12-05", "grade": "8.5"}
