Without dedicating more space to the subject, which is also widely discussed in the long interview granted to us by Studio Evil which you can find at the end of the article, let's come to the subject of the review, which is a multidirectional scrolling shooter inspired by the Commodore Amiga classics. If you don't know what the Amiga is, take a small bottle of spirit, sprinkle yourself with the violet liquid, then grab a match and hang yourself. When you do, film yourself and leave it written in your will to upload the video on YouTube, so that we can laugh at you in glee. After the cynical and macabre parenthesis, let's get to the game. Syder Arcade tells the story of the humans of the Miza space colony, a very merry place where life flowed happily and would-be reality show contestants were thrown to the space lappers. In short, a large and highly advanced civilization envied throughout the universe, even on Alpha Centauri where geneticists have discovered the way to give birth to male babies with three pistols, but given that the women did not want to adapt and protested of: ~three cycles a month seem a bit too much~, two are left over. Unfortunately, there are not only peaceful and peace-loving races in the universe, but also human beings ahem, we meant that there are also more warlike, envious and less optimistic races. So the beautiful Miza is soon targeted by a mysterious force of creatures enraged by reading Chi, the only magazine granted by the regime. The inhabitants of the colony are forced to fight for their lives and not to give in to those of Alpha Centauri, who in the meantime were ~lulling~ them from the other side of the universe (when you have two withered little pistols you have to do something not to get depressed ). The future of the past As already mentioned, Syder Arcade is a classic multi-directional shooter with gameplay straight out of the late eighties and early nineties. Paradoxically, being inspired by such a remote past for the gaming world should penalize it in terms of freshness, but in reality it is exactly the opposite. If some shooter genres have managed to survive thanks to Japanese developers (see Cave and how he dragged Bullet Hell even to brand new platforms such as mobile), others have been set aside and penalized much more heavily, to the point of being forgotten first , therefore ignored by the masses. Such a scenario makes the work of Studio Evil capable of offering emotions that were now thought to be resumed only through emulators. Grasped the joystick, you find yourself catapulted into a space full of spaceships that attack with different patterns from the right and left of the screen. Each level of the six that make up the main campaign has its own objective and offers small variations on the same theme. For example, in the first you have to eliminate several waves of enemies, while in the second it is required to act as an escort to a large spaceship protecting it from attacks and asteroid fields. At the start of each game you can select one of three spaceships, each with different weapons and characteristics. The first games are mainly spent studying the spaceships, to understand which one best suits your style, and to understand with which level of difficulty it is better to start playing. Then you throw yourself into the action, aware that you will have to die many times before succeeding (especially if you select the Arcade difficulty level, or the more extreme one, Pure). The depth of space Even with only six levels, Syder Arcade offers a good longevity. Meanwhile, given the genre, it can be replayed several times at all available difficulty levels. The Survival mode should also be considered which offers a prolonged and lasting challenge, especially if you aim to score the best scores. In short, the Studio Evil title offers several hours of play to those who will be able to appreciate it, which are not at all few, also considering the price at which it is sold. One of the alternative display modes Given the genre and given the fact that it is a debut title, one could have expected much worse from a technical point of view, but we were really impressed by the general quality of Syder Arcade. The set designs of the levels are very rich in details and high quality objects, which make up very beautiful spatial paintings to look at. The models of the various ships, large and small, are made with great care, with some truly spectacular moments such as the beasts that appear in the fifth level. Even the special effects do not disfigure in front of those of May productionsri, even if they never confuse the action by preventing you from understanding what is happening on the screen. Also noteworthy is the soundtrack, composed of excellent songs, always inspired by the Amiga years. Worth mentioning is the possibility of selecting different display modes that simulate the machines of the past, from 2-bit monochrome graphics, passing through the 16 colors of the Commodore 64, the monochromes of the ZX Spectrum, the 32 colors of the Amiga and many others. With some it is more difficult to play, especially those with fewer colors, but in general the effects are more than pleasant and many will enjoy replaying the whole title with the various views selected. Interview with Studio Evil To get you to know this little and fantastic Italian production better, we decided to interview the guys from Studio Evil to learn more about their work. Let's read what they told us about Syder Arcade, how it came about and what their prospects are for the future. Introduce yourselves to our readers. How was the Studio Evil team born? Did you first meet in person or in some virtual place? There are currently five of us composing Studio Evil and we have become part of this project at different times and in different ways. Marco di Timoteo and Christian Meneghini were the first to meet and start making video games together. At the time it wasn't a full-time job but a passion that was carried on at night, studying and creating the first projects. Only after the arrival of Luca Marchetti did the small transitions begin to take place which led to the official creation of Studio Evil as a full-time video game development company. The latest arrivals are Fabrizio Zagaglia and Domiziana Suprani, who have started working directly on our first real project, Syder Arcade. How did the idea of Syder Arcade come about? You wrote that you were inspired by the classics of the genre for the Amiga, can you tell us which ones in particular? The games from which we have mostly taken inspiration are Uridium 2 and Project X. The first offered us the inspiration for the two-way scrolling, the setting and the large warships involved in space battles, while from the second (as well as from many other titles such as Xenon or R-Type) derives the style of play, both visual and gameplay. The Japanese shmup trend has not been ignored, but the main matrix that has been used to build Syder Arcade is European in style. Obviously everything has been enriched by improving some elements, such as the artificial intelligence of the enemies, which, despite being minimal, add a bit of variety to the gameplay. What we have most tried to maintain is the maximum freedom given to the player, inserting few automatic actions and concentrating on the movement of the ships, the shot and the controls. The game is made really well in terms of materials and resources, how long did it take you to develop it? What development tools did you use? It took about six months to complete the game. We chose Unity 3D as a development platform because it allows us to deploy on as many platforms as possible and therefore potentially bring our game into the hands of as many players as possible. Unity is an immediate tool, through which prototypes and finished games can be created in a short time: our past experience has allowed us to use it very intensively and at a low level, focusing on the game rather than on the engine. The graphic part was created using Blender, an open source 3D tool. Tell us a little about your game. What did you want to achieve? Reading the reactions of the public, indeed very positive, do you think you have achieved your goals? Our aim was to recreate a gameplay similar to that of the past, simple and immediate but also fun and challenging from the first minutes. We are very happy with the feedback that our players send us, we have also received piqued comments from people who start playing and then find it difficult to put away. We were hoping for this effect. Our current difficulty is not so much in making the game enjoyable as in making it discoverable by those who have never heard of it yet. The web is incredibly vast, and we're just newcomers to an industry that produces thousands of titles a year. We still have a ton of additional features and elements that we would like to include in Syder Arcade, but unfortunately they will have to be delayed due to time constraints. One thing that we will certainly try to do, given the requests, is to make an album with the game's soundtrack. Did you encounter any particular difficulties during development? If yes, which ones? The biggest difficulty was deciding when to close the project. Our enthusiasmit would lead us to keep developing and improving our games indefinitely, but unfortunately we have to deal with the market. At some point production of the game must end or it becomes economically unsustainable. It is therefore necessary to make decisions and understand which features can be included in the project and which ones should be discarded or postponed. This is definitely the most difficult part, as well as being decisive in terms of final quality. Fortunately, digital distribution allows us to keep adding new elements even after publication. Other obstacles we are trying to overcome concern the visibility of the game on the web since our name is still unknown to most. What prospects do you have for the future? What other projects do you have in the pipeline? Can you explain them to us? Our main project, which we currently call Syder Universe, is a cooperative action RPG for up to four players. Syder Arcade was actually born as a promotional idea to let people know both us and the world where our next game will be set. Some of the alien races we have already presented will then reappear, as well as some of the selectable characters and ships. Also for this reason we decided to work on the world design of Syder Arcade, which is usually not one of the first aspects that are taken care of in a shoot 'em up. Unfortunately we spent a lot of energy, both physical and financial, on this first game and we hope to be able to sell enough copies to be able to finance our main project and finish it. If you like, add something of your own that you feel the need to say but that the above questions did not allow you to express. Since we haven't had a real chance to do it yet, we'd like to thank all the people who encouraged us and underline how important it is for developers (especially Italians) to help each other. We've received tremendous support from friends, gamers, and other game creatorsnot just giving us their positive feedback, but also talking about us and sharing our story through the channels available to them. What we want is to create a game that can interest and entertain, without feeling forced to come to terms with the fashions of the moment. At the same time we believe that to make something engaging it is not necessary to go looking for a totally innovative gameplay. What really matters to us is to create a captivating and profound gaming experience that challenges the player, without necessarily having to detach ourselves from our old school matrix.", "date": "2012-05-10", "grade": "8.6"}
