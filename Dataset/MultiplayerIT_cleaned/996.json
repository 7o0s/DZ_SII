We hoped until the end, trying to ignore the information in our possession and the same test made with the semi-final version of the Snowblind Studios game; yet, alas, one of the first game screens dispels any residual glimmer of hope: four selectable languages, no trace of our beautiful language. Having made this disheartening premise, we embark on the now usual character selection menu, with the exception given by two new selectable classes to replenish the team of 'champions' extrapolated from the stereotypes of the fantasy Rpg. We will therefore have a berserker and a shaman to add to the more common classes such as warrior, mage, cleric and thief. Few, exactly as in the predecessor, the possibilities granted to characterize the physical traits of one's alter ego, mostly given by some hairstyle and the possibility of selecting the color of hair, skin and any beard. The real problem of Champions: Return to Arms is precisely the total absence of new ideas, new ideas and swerves aimed at reviving a genre that has been left unchanged for too long. Dress lightly, let's go hunting for orcs... After this stage, and once the points have been assigned to each of the characteristics of your hero, we will be inexplicably catapulted onto an island floating in the air. The only, but welcome, presence on the atoll is that of Firiona, the irrepressible damsel who will have the task of introducing us to a rather frayed and elementary plot, as well as giving us the opportunity to sell and buy items of all sorts during the adventure. This Return to Arms maintains the same feeling as the prequel, mostly made up of action focused on fights in which the player-enemy relationship will always be in the clear prerogative of the latter. Hence the idea of the coder Snowblind Studios to add some ways to diversify the games in both multiplayer and single, or a sort of arena in which to face human or CPU-controlled enemies. Just a sop to justify a new chapter in this series. Not only are the additions compared to the predecessor guiltily reduced to the bone, but also the same devices invoked by fans of the series have found very little audience in the presence of the US house, which seems to have done very little to give new life to a genre that begins to smell old. The real problem of Champions: Return to Arms is precisely the total absence of new ideas, new ideas and swerves aimed at reviving a genre that has been left unchanged for too long. New solutions that are expected from field veterans like the Snowblinds, but which are still slow to arrive. AAA Bastard Sword +35 damage with various types of poisons attached wanted, no time wasters This new production of the American team is made up of more than just bad news, which, due to not knowing how to read or write, has reconfirmed all the lucky choices that made the prequel successful. The excellent control system is one of the rare cases in which Snowblind Studios is thanked for not having made the slightest change, as an exponent of how depth and ease of use can coexist. The opportunity given by the coders to be able to play with the character created and raised in Champions of Norrath is also good, a choice that will obviously make all the fans of the saga happy who can't wait to continue the growth of their character. Something more had to be done in terms of enemy AI, especially for ordinary bad guys. The bosses at the end of the stage, in fact, are much more cared for and showy than the less fearsome companions, who suffer above all from a certain repetitiveness in the attack patterns. Entering purely technical themes, Champions: Return to Arms manages to confirm, and slightly improve, the graphic goodness seen in the first chapter. Those who remember it will certainly still have certain suggestive settings in their eyes, the excellent light effects and the fluid masses managed in an excellent way. Basically these are the cornerstones of this sequel too, which also makes use of a slightly more stable graphics engine even if it can still be improved. Good and precise camera, which in this version also makes use of the convenient angle reset, useful for not always having to manually adjust the view. Some more animation graces both characters and enemies, who also seem to enjoy a higher polycount. A thread of disappointment is given by the soundtrack, which, although in line with the excellent one of the predecessor, never manages to take flight and integrate perfectly with the action and game situations. The opportunity given by the coders to be able to play with the character created and raised is also goodor in Champions of Norrath, a choice that will obviously make all the fans of the saga happy who can't wait to continue the growth of their character. Champions: Return to Arms compared to its older brother has several more things: more weapons, more classes, more modes, more enemies, more skills. However, this abundance serves relatively, if not to make those who hoped for some substantial changes to a gameplay that is starting to be really worn out regret. The hack & slash genre needs a violent turn if it wants to keep up with the times, then afloat, and it is precisely from companies that are experts in the field such as Snowblind Studios that one can, and must, expect this type of rejuvenation. This new chapter will undoubtedly make those who loved the first Champions of Norrath happy, if only because it is a package of various added missions with which to continue creating your own alter ego. Also recommended for those who have never played such a game and want to try their hand at the best exponent on consoles. Pros: Technically very good. Ability to continue with prequel save. Fun multiplayer. Cons: Few additions, no improvements... Outdated gameplay. Four selectable languages, but not Italian. It may seem unprofessional to you, but in certain situations we hate to see our bad feelings materialize. Not more than a month ago we accused Champions: Return to Arms of excessive immobility in our hands on. We had an almost complete version, and the hopes of having surprises by being able to delve into the final build were almost nil. With considerable, and at the same time resigned, disappointment we have noticed how all the underlined omens have materialized, aggravated by some, to say the least, unpleasant lack. Snowblind Studios, which we remember gave birth to Champions of Norrath: Realms of Everquest and Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, seems to have rested on its laurels with this important sequel, which, however good, did not fully convince our 'trolly' hands.", "date": "2005-03-21", "grade": null}
