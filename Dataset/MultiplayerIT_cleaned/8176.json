Fortunately, the latest generations of consoles have given more and more space and importance to digital distribution, allowing publishers to reduce the economic risks associated with the classic retail model and also giving a chance to titles that otherwise would never have crossed the borders of the Rising Sun . In this category we can undoubtedly include Tokyo Jungle, released on Blu-ray at the end of June, and also arrived in our parts instead only through the PlayStation Store. Branco is not an astrologer Tokyo Jungle is based on an extremely interesting idea: in short, in a not too distant future man became extinct - we leave it up to you to discover the reasons - leaving room only for animals, which they then colonized (if not literally invaded) streets, buildings and districts of the Japanese metropolis. A dilapidated Tokyo, where vegetation is slowly taking hold and where buildings are starting to crack and collapse; in a reality of this type, it is clear that the conventions and rules of ~modern~ society have completely disappeared, leaving room only for the primordial instinct of survival. There are basically two modes available, namely Survival and History. In the first, an animal must first be chosen from the list of those available; this list is set to grow both as you progress through the game and through additional purchases from PlayStation Store. After that, you simply have to try to survive as long as possible by performing a series of actions and keeping an eye on some important elements. The most urgent is certainly the need to eat, and to this end a practical indicator of hunger suggests the timing to be respected; if a herbivorous animal must logically go in search of plants and fruits being careful not to be discovered by a predator, on the contrary with a carnivore one must prolong one's existence at the expense of another, by killing and therefore eating weaker creatures. The feeding mechanics are quite interesting, going to include ~stealth~ elements and a quite pleasant although somewhat superficial combat system, which takes into account the differences in the size and aggressiveness of the various species. But that's certainly not all, because in Tokyo Jungle you also need to think about exploring the neighborhoods, gaining control of the territory and giving continuity to the lineage before the age of your creature (which grows by one year for every minute) is destined lead her to her natural death. This last phase obviously requires to go through the coupling with a female, which however must be chosen in the one with the best characteristics in order to hand down its qualities to the descendants of which it will therefore take control. The continuation within the Survival mode is linked to objectives that are gradually assigned to the player. The story mode, on the other hand, is similar even if a little more structured, with missions supported by a slight background and some unplayable sequences. The title of SCEJ is therefore this: an intriguing and exotic product in its premises, engaging in the first sessions but limited by a basic repetitiveness that emerges rather quickly. Survival passes through cyclical needs (food - territory - reproduction) to be repeated with each generation and which could probably have been managed in a more interesting and stimulating way, just as the exploration of the areas and the design of the neighborhoods would have benefited from greater variety. Furthermore, the differences between the races in terms of gameplay could have been better developed, which instead are distinguished in a too superficial way. Extras such as the customization of animals contribute little, which allows you to literally ~dress~ the creatures with different items of clothing. Furthermore Tokyo Jungle is a title that certainly does not see its defects overshadowed by the technical part, and in this perspective the low budget nature is perceived; the graphics are roughly halfway between a PS2 game and a first generation one for PS3, with a very modest polygonal complexity, only sufficient animations and barely acceptable textures.", "date": "2012-11-19", "grade": "7.2"}
