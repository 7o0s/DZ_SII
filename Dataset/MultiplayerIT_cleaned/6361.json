Also inversely, the simple fact that some games for smartphones have reached the consoles of the big N, especially the 3DS thanks to the eShop channel, is a fact that allows you to expand the offer of the handset thus extending its catalogue. But if up to now the house of President Iwata had only favored and supported this process, in the case of Puzzle & Dragons Nintendo wanted to move in the first person, participating in the development and even granting the use of the Super Mario brand for the creation of a ad hoc version of the puzzle game in question. The reason for this choice can be easily understood by simply taking a look at the numbers of the Puzzle & Dragons phenomenon in Japan, with over 32 million downloads in the land of the rising sun alone and 41 worldwide: a stratospheric figure for a product capable of generating a huge volume of business and inevitably filling the coffers of the developer GungHo Online Entertainment with money. Puzzle & Dragons on Nintendo 3DS is a pleasant puzzle game, but far from the masterpieces of the genre Catch them all In reality, Puzzle & Dragons has already landed on Nintendo 3DS in Japan for quite a while, more precisely at the end of 2013 with a chapter entitled Puzzle & Dragons Z which has well exceeded one and a half million copies sold. At the end of April 2015, however, Puzzle & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition was released, precisely a version of the product adapted to the world of the mustachioed Italian plumber. For the Western launch, Nintendo has chosen to combine both titles in a single package, dramatically christened Puzzle & Dragons Z + Puzzle & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition; beyond the unthinkable title, it is simply two distinct games put together, with the possibility of selecting one or the other on the home screen. As for the first, it is essentially a reinterpretation of the original mobile version to which it has been ~stuck~ on top of a jrpg that in many ways (perhaps too much) closely resembles Pokmon. If in fact on smartphones the action was fully made up of puzzle phases, organized between them by simple graphic menus for choosing the various dungeons, in Puzzle & Dragons Z we wanted to build a plot, characters and a sort of pretext to justify the progression. The hero of the moment is a little boy (or the female equivalent) who, together with his closest friends, enters the company of the Rangers thanks to his abilities as dragon tamers, i.e. the power to control monsters using the energy of the spheres. Too bad that the Paradox group soon makes its appearance, an organization whose purpose is the destruction of the world (wow!) and which is led by a shady figure called Dogma the Ferocious Destroyer. From this incipit a teen-themed role-playing game takes shape full of clichs, not particularly refined, excessively verbose, with an extremely superficial and aesthetically very derivative development of the characters. However, the passion of the Japanese people for this gameplay model is well known, and it is therefore more than understandable that GungHo has astutely chosen to package a product that would expand the formula of the mobile version with precisely this type of element. However, the long chats and walks in the jRPG part serve essentially only as a glue for the puzzle sections within the various dungeons, which take place in a practically completely identical way to the smartphone edition: Puzzle & Dragons is in fact nothing more than the yet another variation, not even particularly elaborate, of the match 3 genre, with a grid of colored spheres that must be aligned at least for three to make them explode and disappear from the screen, to make way for others. The protagonist can have a team composed of a certain number of creatures, each of them associated with one of the 5 elements present. Eliminating a trio of spheres allows the creature of that element to launch an attack on the enemy, affecting its energy bar; performing combinations by exploding multiple groups of balls in the same turn allows you to generate combos that increase the offensive potential of your attack, with the ultimate goal of taking out the opponent before he does the same by draining his energy. The elements are also important to consider for their effectiveness and weaknesses against each other: fire is strong against wood, which is strong against water, which in turn is strong againstfire. Light and Darkness, on the other hand, are related to each other. But the most interesting point of the experience lies mainly in the possibility of adding new creatures to your collection, making them grow, evolve, merge them and improve their capabilities in such a way as to create an ever stronger team. As already argued above, therefore, it is clear that the title of GungHo is not a game capable of bringing practically nothing new to the scene in an absolute sense, but rather a clever amalgam of popular elements of various genres put together with intelligence and craft. The result is an engaging albeit very repetitive product, intended to stimulate thanks to the generous donation of short and medium-term objectives, in such a way as to be able to keep the player in front of the screen for many, many hours. The 3D effect The 3D effect is limited to guaranteeing a feeling of depth especially inside the dungeons, during which the rather basic polygonal structures enjoy a stronger detachment with monsters and enemies in 2D with the stick raised. Nothing essential, however. Puzzles & Plumbers Puzzle & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition is instead in some ways a sort of simplification, a ~return to origins~ understood as a rapprochement with the formula of the original on mobile. The jRPG element disappears completely by shifting the focus to a very good part on the puzzle component, which also in this case rests on the same identical mechanics mentioned above. The most relevant difference lies precisely in the aesthetic theming, which in this case transports the entire experience from the uninspired ~Pokmon wannabe~ style atmospheres to the much more incisive and pleasant ones of the Mushroom Kingdom. Dragons and monsters of your team are thus replaced by Koopa, Goomba, Paratroopa, Nella and so on: the leaders are no longer teenage dragon tamers but Mario and Luigi with all the variations of the case, such as Raccoon Mario, Super Luigi, Ice Mario, etc. And also the transition from one level to another, or from one series of puzzles to another, takes place via a map of the game world in all respects similar to that of the heroic plumber's platformers. Deprived of the role-playing game filler, in Puzzle & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition you can therefore appreciate a more streamlined and rhythmic experience, capable of condensing even dozens of challenges one after the other in a few minutes. The result is that, substantially, you play and have more fun, even if at the same time the nodes relating to the extreme repetitiveness of the gameplay come home to roost. Certainly the element of development of the members of one's team still represents an important, intriguing and stimulating factor, but at the same time one cannot help but think that the opportunity to have the world of Super Mario available could perhaps have been been exploited better, to give more breathing space to the gaming experience beyond what is in all respects little more than a simple reskin. And more generally from a stylistic point of view, not everything runs perfectly, with some rather evident weaknesses such as the modest animations and the dull polygonal settings of the dungeons. Even the social component, which represented a very important element of the experience on mobile, has been reduced on Nintendo 3DS according to the limits imposed by Nintendo guidelines: via StreetPass you can obtain the leaders of other players to use them as helpers, but it is certainly not a very incisive method.", "date": "2015-05-05", "grade": "7.4"}
