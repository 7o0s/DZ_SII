{"name": "Scontri impossibili", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mostri-contro-alieni_a.html", "text": "After being in contact with a meteorite, Susan Murphy undergoes a frightening metamorphosis, de facto becoming the tallest girl in the world... Difficult to go unnoticed if you are close to twenty meters and your weight has grown in proportion, so the US army he decides to capture her and put her in a sort of institution designed for ~monsters~, where Susan makes the acquaintance of numerous other bizarre-looking people. But when the Earth is attacked by hordes of huge hostile aliens and conventional weapons prove ineffective to repel them, the army decides to resort to the dreaded monsters. Susan and her new friends, therefore, will have to take sides in the first person to prevent the invasion and save the planet. The story of ~monsters vs. aliens~ will probably not sound new to video game fans, since it is the same one we saw in the fighting game King of the Monsters 2, released in 1992 for the Neo Geo platform and subsequently converted for the console of the time. Unlike the arcade developed by SNK, this mobile reduction of Monsters vs Aliens looks more like a platformer and shares some elements with the classic Rampage. In fact, the gigantic Susan can climb buildings and destroy them with her own weight, by jumping on them. However, the objective of the various missions is not the destruction of the cities, but the rescue of a certain number of people who are found on the roof of the buildings: when we meet them, just press the 5 key to ~pick them up~ and bring them to safety. There's basically no combat system, just the ability to charge into a boss fight. Things change in the stages in which we control BOB, the millennial fish-man: having infiltrated enemy bases, the character must fight with a series of androids, jump on various platforms, collect objects and destroy the super computers with his own hands that coordinate the invasion. In all cases, the controls are really simple and are based on the d-pad for movement and jumping, with a fairly punctual and precise response to inputs. At the top of the screen you can see the representation of energy, consisting of a series of hearts that disappear as each attack is suffered. However, the difficulty of the missions is rarely so high as to put us in trouble... Beyond the sound sector, as usual average for mobile gaming, Monsters vs. Aliens boasts very well done graphics, whose only limit is probably in the lack of variety of settings. The stages in which we control Susan are certainly the most beautiful, as well as those with greater interactivity: it is possible to climb the buildings and literally raze them to the ground by jumping on them. The colors and detail are also beautiful, the animations that vary according to the speed of movement are excellent. Some good ideas for the bosses too. The stages in which we control BOB are more meager, with the usual set of platforms to reach and not very nice opponents to see. Also in this case the animations are fluid and well done, while the management of the character leaves a little to be desired with regard to collisions, which are not always precise.", "date": "2009-03-26", "grade": "S.V."}
