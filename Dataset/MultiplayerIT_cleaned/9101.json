A few days ago, however, a very important update arrived which, while leaving the game structure substantially intact, revolutionized the experience from a technical point of view, adding not only an option to activate 60 FPS on devices high-end, but also various aesthetic tweaks, audio commentary and realistic sound effects. Are these elements that can really improve the mobile soccer game produced by Electronic Arts? Let's find out with the review of FIFA Calcio in the 2022 Season. The basic experience FIFA Football Season 2022, players on the pitch after kick-off As we wrote in the previous review of FIFA Calcio, in 2018, we are faced with a sort of simplified FIFA Ultimate Team, which puts unpacking at the center of attention and builds around it a structure full of achievements to unlock, different currencies ( many!) and the possibility of improving players through training, therefore the use of ~minor~ coins and cards. We go from short skill challenges to full matches, from shooting sessions to the inevitable team management , which can be automated: the variety of activities on offer is excellent and undoubtedly has the merit of keeping attention alive, avoiding a traditional formula between championships, tournaments and so on. Unfortunately, however, those looking for this kind of content even in the mobile sector will inevitably be disappointed. Good news comes from online multiplayer, which has been enhanced and now works very well, with fast matchmaking focused on your region to limit latency phenomena as much as possible. There is also a secondary mode that uses an asynchronous system and puts two users in front of short challenges, declaring the winner who manages to overcome them and score the most points. As for the freemium model used, you can play for free without major problems and high expectations (the ~tickets~ are abundant and recharge quickly), but the microtransactions are many and the spectrum of paywalls is therefore literally around the corner. Gameplay FIFA Football Season 2022, a free kick from the edge of the penalty area The good news is that over time not only the technical aspect but also the gameplay of FIFA Calcio has been improved, especially as regards touch controls. The gesture control system, which still leaves much to be desired today, can be limited (but not completely deactivated, which sometimes creates some headaches) in favor of the normal buttons with sprint, pass, through ball and shot, now much more precise and without the slipperiness of the previous version. There are various automatisms applied to the action, for example in the management of the tackles for the recovery of the ball, but even here it is possible to make some adjustments to increase or decrease the assists. The important thing is that on the pitch the dynamics are convincing and, despite some weird blunders (see, for example, an attacker who doesn't shoot when indicated, burning up a finish on goal) and an often bland artificial intelligence of the opponents, the end result is a fairly fun experience. Graphics and sound FIFA Football Season 2022, celebrations appear improved As mentioned at the beginning, FIFA Calcio has received a substantial technical update that has literally changed the face of the game, both in terms of graphics and sound. New animations are noticed, especially as regards the celebrations, but it is the 60 frames per second that make all the difference in the world, also reflecting on the pleasantness of the gameplay, which is inevitably more fluid and precise. Clearly it will be necessary to see if your device supports this function: we tested the game on the iPhone 12 Pro. As for the sound, it is possible to download two additional packages that insert the commentary in Italian, quite varied in the available phrases, and a set of sound effects realistic chants and background noises, vastly improved over the default equipment. Finally, there is also space for a signed soundtrack, which especially characterizes the navigation between the menus in an important way.", "date": "2022-01-22", "grade": "7.0"}
