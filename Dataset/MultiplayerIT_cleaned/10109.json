Rather than analyzing its characteristics in a scientific way, it is better to rely on the flow of memories and wonder how a role-playing game with a structure that was certainly not original (it followed the release of Baldur's Gate, with which it shared the graphics engine and the game interface) managed to overcome the barrier of time. In short, why are there still those who are ready to define it as one of the best role-playing games ever made, despite the fact that it lacked substantial innovations? What makes it so special? Yet, apparently, the plot is one that has already been heard a thousand times: a character with no name and full of scars wakes up in a place he doesn't know and has to find out what happened to him... But it would be a mistake to stop at the surface, because the there are differences. Often it is not so much the originality of a story that determines its beauty, but rather its representation (as Shakespeare teaches). The Nameless One The nameless protagonist, called precisely The Nameless One, is far from the stereotype of the hero and is forced to experience the tragic dimension of his condition. During the adventure he doesn't make the usual moral choices that in many role-playing games seem to divide the world in two with an ax (see Fables), but he is constantly stimulated to reflect on the meaning of what he is doing, including welcoming or not some travel companions who share his same existential ambiguity and the same indefinability. From this point of view, the balance and wisdom with which the elements of the game have been distributed come to the aid of the player. Unlike in any Baldur's Gate (especially the first one) or any Icewind Dale, in Torment fighting does not play a central role. Obviously there are, but the most important discoveries and key moments are entrusted to the dialogues, among the best in the history of video games, and the solving of puzzles. The resulting gameplay is still exceptionally fresh today, largely based on the empathy that is created between the player and the characters and on the desire to discover the mystery surrounding the plot. Curiosity From the Bioware graphics engine, Infinity Engine, three titles were born (four, actually, but Lionheart not many remember it because it didn't work very well), two of which produced sequels which, although very similar in interface and appearance Overall, they hid three completely different RPG philosophies: Baldur's Gate - balanced, i.e. dialogue and combat tended to be equal. The plot wasn't particularly deep but it was well outlined. It produced a sequel, Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn. Years ago there were rumors of the making of the third episode, but then nothing more was heard of it. For many, the spiritual heir to the series is Dragon Age: Origins. Planescape: Torment - dialogue, i.e. the dialogues and the plot have the upper hand over the fights placed in the background. Not for nothing was it made by the same authors of the first Fallout (which we always remember could be finished without firing a single shot). It is the only one of the three that has not produced sequels. Icewind Dale - swashbuckling, that is, the plot and the dialogues are a mere pretext for the fights. Among the three, it is the one that has left the least mark, despite having produced a sequel: Icewind Dale 2. The city of doors The scenery also helps to get lost in the meanderings of the game. Although it is based on the rules of Advanced Dungeon & Dragons (at least those of the time, since water under the bridge and editions have passed and the word Advanced has been cut...), the developers have made the bold decision not to rely on the more classic worlds and have opted for a new scenario (which moreover has no longer been used in video games... but if we're wrong, you can throw boiling pitch at us), Planescape. The resulting advantage is entirely formal, i.e. the developers had the freedom to create different settings from those usually seen in fantasy titles, starting from the beautiful and disturbing Sigil, the city of doors, while demonstrating great creativity and ability to vary on an all too much abused theme. Also from this point of view, playing Torment is a unique experience, because you find yourself faced with architectures and scenarios that don't recall those of other games. Of course, years later the two-dimensional graphics are no longer surprising, despite having maintained the beauty of hand drawing that characterizes almost all titles that use the same graphics engine. However, it must be said that depriving yourself of the experience of Planescape: Torment for purely matters youchnological, it would be silly and puerile, also because, in an age in which we do nothing but talk about storytelling and more or less beautiful stories, it is difficult to find a title that can rival this one in terms of goodness of the plot. A glimmer of hope As mentioned in the review, to date the major problem of Planescape: Torment is its almost total unavailability, caused by the usual set of problems that prevent the distribution of some great titles of the past. For a few weeks, however, a new version of the game has appeared on Amazon UK, which sells it at the modest price of 9.73 pounds. Needless to say, the advice is to buy it as soon as you finish reading the article.", "date": "2010-03-30", "grade": "9.6"}
