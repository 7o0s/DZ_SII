This is the case of Crossy Road - Endless Arcade Hopper, a casual game that takes the concept of the classic Frogger and transports it to a different context, in this case an isometric view embellished with a pleasant and colorful ~cubic~ graphic. To this it also adds a considerable degree of challenge, due to an endless setting which not only asks you to get as far as possible in a single attempt, but also to do it quickly, because if the lower part of the screen reaches the our character is over: an eagle will burst from above, taking us away and decreeing the game over. The setting is therefore very simple and dry, but how does it develop? Firstly through a simple and intuitive control system, entirely based on the touch screen: a touch of the screen to jump forward, in a ~block~ context, and a slide to the right or left to move in these directions. The focus is often on just going straight, hoping to find the right timing to avoid the many vehicles that crowd the streets and that can run over us, ending the game. When approaching a river, however, it also becomes necessary to make lateral movements, clearly recalling the aforementioned Frogger, to jump on the floating logs and, here too, find the right timing to arrive safely on the other side. Crossy Road - Endless Arcade Hopper is a great pastime, an immediate and fun casual game Count the steps Beyond the immediacy of the experience, the charm of Crossy Road - Endless Arcade Hopper undoubtedly lies in its peculiar aesthetics, as mentioned characterized by cubes that somewhat recall LEGO and which give an original look to all elements that move on the screen, starting with the character we control. The latter can be fished from a wide range of alternatives, to be unlocked by obtaining prizes and coins, therefore completely free, or via in-app purchase, at the price of 89 cents for a single ~jumper~. The starting chicken is thus quickly joined by irresistible figures, such as the pigeon bullhead, the duckling, the beater and then again sheep, horses, dogs and obviously frogs. There are even some exceptional guest stars, such as the protagonists of Forget-Me-Not and Epoch, also represented in a ~cubic~ style for the occasion. There are no substantial changes from one skin to another, except in the behaviors held during movement and the noises produced, some hilarious. Another important element of the game is the adoption of a ranking which, as in the classic Doodle Jump, marks the results obtained by our friends on Game Center along the way and therefore provides extra motivation to do well and overcome them, going to conquer a best position in the leaderboard. If we want to find a couple of defects to the Hipster Whale product, it can be said that the lateral movements via slide are less reactive than what would be needed to perhaps avoid being run over, and that the time constraint that dictates the rhythm of the action appears perhaps a bit too stiff. Aspects that, however, do not affect the goodness of the title, which remains highly enjoyable.", "date": "2014-12-01", "grade": "8.0"}
