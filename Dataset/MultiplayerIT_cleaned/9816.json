Cave Entertainment then arrives again on the iPhone, and after the excellent Espgaluda II also brings the fifth episode of the Do-Don-Pachi series to the Apple device in its latest version released in the arcade and confirming the additional mode called iPhone Mode, also present in the previous title of the developer japanese. The story starts with the headquarters of the Do-Don-Pachi Corporation hit by yet another virus which has knocked out a large part of the electronic equipment and has activated some defenses against the corporation itself, such as huge robot dolls which in full Japanese style represent the end-of-level bosses and are equipped with extremely lethal attacks. Shoot what happens to you The screen is always full of enemy ships, shots, graphic effects for a result that is extremely pleasing to the eye and satisfying for the eyes. Although more complex and varied from a technical point of view, Do-Don-Pachi Resurrection, however, seemed to us more ~rough~ in its realization than Espgaluda 2 intended for graphic cleaning; moreover, on the iPhone 3GS, the main device of our test, we felt some sporadic jerks in the movement of the spacecraft, albeit for most of the time without denoting any problem in extricating ourselves from enemies and the myriad of shots on the screen. For completeness of information, on the iPad (in the 2x version) and iPhone 4 the game enjoys perfect fluidity. The gameplay dynamics of the title obviously provide for having to eliminate a certain amount of enemies before facing the boss on duty, within six levels that also hide alternative paths and bosses when particular objects are collected and certain conditions are obtained . The movement is delegated to the classic sliding of the finger on the screen - the area dedicated to the game and the lower space reserved for the finger itself can be decided in the options - while the various action keys can be positioned on the left or right of the display. There are two main modes starting from the arcade one, which as mentioned takes up the 1.5 version present in the arcade and makes some balances such as the elimination of areas of the screen that are never reached by enemy fire. Each ship among the three available has a double shooting mode, with bullets and with lasers. The first allows you to have a wider and greater firepower as well as to move faster, the second instead concentrates the fire on a single point but has the welcome ~side effect~ of repelling all attacks of this type by enemies. After a certain number of kills it is also possible to activate the Hyper Counter, the classic lethal attack capable of repelling any type of blow up to its duration. The last weapon available to the player is represented by the area bomb which also makes a clean sweep around the player and also works as his energy: every time you are hit, in fact, the ship releases a bomb if there are any available, otherwise you lose one life. This configuration also corresponds to the most affordable level of challenge (there are in any case the classic three levels of difficulty), called ~Bomb Style~, a second one called ~Power Style~ does not include bombs but two fire modes with projectiles, with one that prefers power over speed and vice versa. The iPhone mode introduces some changes to the classic gameplay; First, there is a new bar at the top right called S/M that can fill in either direction. To go left you need to eliminate a certain number of enemies, in which case the speed and power of the shots increase at the expense of the points multiplier. If, on the other hand, the player is more skilled in avoiding opponents' bullets by touching them continuously, the beneficial effect will be a higher multiplier and the Hyper Counter reached quickly. Just the latter changes as a setting in iPhone mode: in this case, in fact, your spacecraft remains motionless but you can swing it to direct the shot and also load an additional beam even more lethal than the previous ones. The fun and gameplay of Do-Don-Pachi Resurrection isall based therefore on the alternation of the laser with the bullets, avoiding the enemy ones, discovering the alternative routes and maybe taking part in all the game modes, because the gameplay is quite varied and deep and the finger control works very well, since having done the necessary practice, you can also commit to perfecting your score with the relative combos. Dulcis in fundo, and good and right, the title supports Open Feint, an Xbox Live (or PSN)-style social network that provides online scores, a friends list and a nice list of goals to achieve, which can lend a hand to increase longevity because they involve completing both modes with all ships and meeting certain scores rather than requirements in specific levels.
