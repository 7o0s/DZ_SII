{"name": "The Getaway", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-getaway-4.html", "text": "An offer you can't refuse Former hitman Mark Hammond's life finally seemed to have truly taken the right path. Abandoned his ~job~, he retired with his wife and little son Alex to his home in London, ready to start a normal existence again, if it weren't for the underworld boss Jolson, in order not to let him escape from his clutches, he saw fit to murder his wife and kidnap his son, blackmailing him and forcing him to do the dirtiest jobs in exchange for the safety of the little boy. In a nutshell, these are the preambles that form the backdrop to your adventures, which will see you busy wearing the hot clothes of poor Mark in a desperate attempt to save his son and escape from the clutches of Jolson. The game mechanics is essentially based on two distinct phases: the first follows in the footsteps of the various Grand Tefth Autos and Drivers, putting you at the wheel of various cars and assigning you objectives to reach through the streets of London, without however the canonical map to show you the road, rather using the car's arrows to indicate the time and direction in which to turn. This system, certainly used in order not to affect the visual realism with indicators and maps, unfortunately turns out to be very inconvenient and not very intuitive, often forcing the player to whip around in circles before reaching the coveted goal. Once we arrive at our destination, the game transforms into a third-person action-adventure, with a shot behind the protagonist, in which we will have to make our way inside the pre-established buildings with pistol shots, in a continuous shooting until the completion of the goals. However, however appreciable and commendable this attempt to variegate the game mechanics as much as possible, unfortunately things have not gone completely in the right direction. First of all, the control system highlights many gaps, proving to be too cumbersome and imprecise, making life quite difficult for the player in the most chaotic firefights, reaching the limit of frustration. Furthermore, the extreme repetitiveness of the gameplay, always faithful to the machine-shooting-machine-shooting scheme and so on, easily leads to boredom after a short period of play, and if we add to this the extreme similarity of the missions, it is not difficult to guess than from this point of view The Getaway struggles to fully convince. Excuse me, for Trafalgar Square? One of the reasons why this latest work by Team Soho has conquered the limelight is undoubtedly placed in its incredible technical realization. While not up to the screenshots that appeared at the beginning of its creation, simple artwork by the developers' own admission, this The Getaway is simply one of the most massive showdowns that the Ps2 has shown so far: in fact, it is to be left speechless open to seeing a London so meticulously reproduced, rich in textures with almost photorealistic detail and complete with all those inevitable clichs that have always characterized the city in the collective imagination (including double-decker buses). Furthermore, the system for modeling the faces of the characters is impressive, capable of modifying the facial expression in real time and thus giving it a truly high-impact acting realism, to the point of often giving the impression of being in front of actors in flesh and bone. Also worthy of mention is the excellent algorithm for deformation and damage to cars, extremely credible and effective in simulating the damaging effects of driving that is a little too ~bubbly~ on our poor cars, with consequences on practically every part of the vehicle: just take some pavement too sporty to puncture a tire and see the car progressively lose control, or let yourself go into one too many rear-end collisions to irreparably compromise the engine. Faced with so much graphic marvel, the sound certainly could not be outdone, and also in this sector the work of the Soho Team was remarkable, with a musical accompaniment worthy of a film and a really convincing dubbing (localized in Italian), both for the choice of voices and the quality of the interpretation. It's just a pity for a certain lack of ~ambient~ sound effects as a backdrop to our movements around London, certainly a bit in contrast with the boisterous frenzy of the British city, but it's really wanting to nitpick a bit. Longevity is guaranteed by the presence of 24 missions, the first 12 to be tackled with Hammond and the remaining with detective Carter, in a whirlwind of twists and turns that will make it really difficult to resist discovering what surprisesTeam Soho reserved for us in the finale. comment One thing is certainly certain: The Getaway is not the heralded masterpiece that we all expected. The defects and lightness mentioned in the review prevent it from aspiring to this goal, however a first-rate technical sector and an intriguing and engaging plot partially improve its fortunes, making it all in all an attractive and interesting product, especially for fans of the genre. But, given the premises, the bitter taste can only be felt. Pros: Technically impressive Intriguing and well thought out story Great voice acting Cons: Repetitive game mechanics Inefficient control system Linear The history of the gaming landscape has always been dotted with titles with troubled and turbulent development, games repeatedly announced as imminent but then promptly postponed to dates that never seem to arrive. As a consequence of all this, two possible evolutions can be identified: either the title ends up being forgotten by the public, thus nullifying years of work, or an aura of mysticism/expectation rises around it, such as to monopolize (or almost) the attention of the entire community of gamers, so as to lead to the idealization of the game in question and its rise to the role of ~savior of the country~. Precisely in this second category is identified The Getaway, title several times postponed and rose to prominence thanks to the promise by the programmers to introduce a perfect reproduction of the city of London, accompanied by a first-rate technical sector capable of squeezing our loved Ps2 to the bone. After an interminable period of waiting, the game is finally in our hands, and the time has come to draw the inevitable balance sheets.", "date": "2003-01-29", "grade": null}
