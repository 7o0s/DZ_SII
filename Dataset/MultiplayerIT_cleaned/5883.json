It is no coincidence that the German Headup Games, already famous for having published indie gems such as The Binding of Isaac, Terraria and, not surprisingly, we mention it at the beginning, Limbo, have chosen the ~mariesca~ flagship to present Typoman to the world , of the equally Teutonic Brainseed Factory, a unique mixture of platform and puzzle not so much for the genre itself - we see platform/puzzle very often now - but for the nature of the puzzles, based on the player's ability to use the letters scattered around the game world in such a way as to create those words that will allow him to move forward. Since the presentation, the game has stood out a lot for its concept and atmosphere, but will it be able to meet expectations? A fresh and very fascinating experience, with some noteworthy limitations: discovering Typoman! Philosophy and Letters The first peculiar circumstance that immediately catches the eye as soon as you start the game is the total lack of a narrative premise, neither in the game nor in the electronic manual. The initial cutscene, a rule that will then be repeated throughout the adventure, is very short, paradoxically devoid of words that are written or spoken and integrates fluidly with the flow of the gameplay. We find ourselves in a two-dimensional world framed by the classic lateral perspective, the atmosphere that appears around us is very heavy, dominated by dark and faded colors, but with a fairy touch, almost like a Tim Burton's black fairy tale, and initially not let's check that... an H. An H, the very letter, capable only of moving here and there in a very clumsy way. Moving forward however, we soon meet other letters on our way, which join the previous ones to form the figure of a stick man: the letters in question are E, R and O, i.e. the word ~HERO~. A play on words and symbols that constitutes the very backbone of the concept of Typoman, the protagonist who can do nothing but run, jump and drag around the letters he meets along the way, positioning them to form meaningful words accomplished. The first puzzles are very simple and didactic: if we find ourselves in front of an off switch and the letters N and O, it doesn't take much to understand that by placing them together to form the word ON, the switch will turn on, activating a certain mechanism that will allow us to move forward. Just as if there's a platform too low for Typoman's modest jumping abilities, the ability to create the words RAISE or LIFT is sure to get us going. This concept, which in the first few minutes of the game is absolutely fun, almost hilarious for its freshness and intelligence, however, immediately shows the side of a first, important criticism: if you don't know English even at a basic level, forget it. A certain mastery of the Albion language is absolutely necessary, and here we are not even talking about a lack of localization, which actually exists for the main menu and the few options available, but precisely the fact that, to be presented in Italian, the title should have been largely rescheduled. Above all by virtue of the fact that, starting from the simple puzzles described a little earlier, they gradually evolve, becoming not only more complicated as it should be, but also, so to speak, much more conceptual and almost philosophical. Words like DOOM, FEAR and HATE concretely form real monstrous enemies, each one differently characterized, enemies to be countered, once again, with the power of their opposites, LIFE, BRAVE, LOVE and so on. This is what ultimately leaves us most beautiful Typoman, a reflection on the usual battle between Good and Evil seen through the perspective of the power of the word: in this sense, the almost total lack of a plot or in any case of an explanation does not disappoint to what happens on the screen, the programmers were obviously not interested in telling a particular story but simply bringing the players' attention to some universal themes, making them explicit through what has always been the most powerful means of expression available to human beings. Dark puns In fact, there is a remedy for the lack of knowledge of English, as well as for the general obscurity of certain phases, and it is the help system on the GamePad screen. Conceptually it works very well: activonly once we are provided with a short cryptic text (always in English, necessarily) containing the word we are looking for, a word that is highlighted if we use it a second time. A godsend to avoid getting stuck, however we would have preferred something better placed in the context of the game, since it seems completely detached from the flow of the gameplay, somehow fueling the impression of ~cheating~, also given the satisfaction that try solving a puzzle relying only on your own gray matter. The practical ~mixer~ is also entrusted to the GamePad, a quick way to form words avoiding dragging and throwing letters on the screen, a process which is in fact rather slow and therefore useless in the most urgent situations, when perhaps you are being pursued by enemies or other dangers. Oh yes, because if up to now we have only talked about the puzzle soul of Typoman, the other soul, the action one, is equally present, all in all well integrated with the first but unfortunately not as well done. The level design is very good, quite already seen but with some very interesting points, only that it has tended to make some passages so difficult, so full, for example, of jumps to the millimeter and series of obstacles to be overcome with perfect timing and learn by heart, that it is truly impossible to avoid dying over and over again maybe in the same spot. Even if all this does not cause excessive frustration given the very numerous checkpoints, it is clear how the attempt by the Teutonic team is to artificially feed a longevity that can be around five hours in all, which in hindsight are not even very few given the genre and the price. Aggravated by a not always perfect response of the commands and by collisions which in some cases can cause some unexpected behavior, this situation reaches its peak in the battle with the final boss, which we challenge you to beat without dying every first time one of the numerous movements of its complicated pattern. A pity, because in the final battle, we tell you without indulging in anticipations, the game, both in its action and in its philosophy, reaches a real climax that would have left better sensations if only it had been a little more refined. Climax also from the point of view of how everything is presented to our eyes and ears. If, since it is 2D, it is not surprising that the Wii U is able to handle everything with the utmost fluency (except for a few very short shots, a clear sign of loading a new part of the level), the artistic direction is instead absolutely commendable. On a visual level, the atmosphere is perfectly rendered both in the backgrounds and in the characters, which are basically black silhouettes animated in a very fascinating way, and on an auditory level, thanks to the music that accompanies the game phases by adapting to them, remaining for the most part almost in background and then unleash in pressing rhythms or in epic orchestral crescendos.", "date": "2015-11-19", "grade": "7.5"}
