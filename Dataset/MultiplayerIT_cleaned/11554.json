An evocative name for all those who have approached the world of video games at least once. Who in the world has never heard of this brand? Who, maybe wanting to recommend a well-made RPG to a friend, hasn't used the term ~it's a Final Fantasy game~ to describe its graphic, technical and plot quality in a moment? This brand has for years now been synonymous with role-playing games, indeed, with ~great~ RPGs, and not only if we refer to those of the Japanese type. It was back in 1987 when the brilliant Hironobu Sakaguchi, the same as the new, excellent Lost Odyssey for Xbox 360 (about the progenitors of a saga) gave vent to his genius in a last, almost desperate attempt, to invent something that could lift the fate of Squaresoft, the software house for which he worked, believe it or not at the time of the facts on the verge of bankruptcy. The reference consoles at that time were the SEGA Master System and the Nintendo NES and it was the latter that had the honor and the burden of hosting what, as the title suggests, ~Final Fantasy~, was to be the last work of the Chochobo house and instead, in addition to reviving Squaresoft's fortunes by elevating it to the ~Mother house~ of modern Japanese role-playing games, it proved to be the beginning of a triumphal ride that over the years has given birth to dozens of products including sequels , spin-offs, movies, comics, gadgets and anything else you can imagine. The origin of a myth In the Kingdom of Coneria there are four magical crystals that regulate and manage the power of the basic elements, namely Earth, Water, Fire and Wind. When one unfortunate day they disappear more or less mysteriously, chaos spreads everywhere and the evil Garland kidnaps Princess Sarah, throwing the population and the Royal family into panic. But to bring relief come the words of the wise Lukhan who prophesy the arrival of four Warriors of Light, capable by themselves of defeating the rampant Evil and freeing the young noble, and the actual appearance of the aforementioned holding the crystals of the elements. This is broadly the initial plot of an adventure that will slowly unfold before the eyes of the players, through a long journey that will take them virtually to explore forests, frozen lands, deserts, oceans and various locations, facing vault hordes of terrible enemies. In the first case, as per tradition (also born with this title - Ed) the user moves the main Pg, who for the record, contrary to the following chapters, is anonymous, like all his companions to whom we can only assign the class they belong to , as we will see later, on a map depicting the world, deciding from time to time, either for plot needs or for one's own (acquisition of new Items or weapons in shops, Sub-Quests, etc), whether to ~enter~ in some city or specific area, sometimes even moving with the help of vehicles. Here you act as always based on the situation: you can talk to NPCs, look for information, rest in inns, stock up on shops, find treasures or try your hand at rigorously turn-based battles. The battles These are generated randomly and take place in special screens where the two opposing factions stand perfectly still facing each other waiting for both a command and their turn to act. Through the canonical drop-down menu, the gamer then controls the four usable party members by deciding which move to make him make. And here the classes of belonging of the various heroes come into play, which, as we mentioned before, are the only non-aesthetic element to differentiate them, given that they have no names, ~historical~ details and therefore no background. The classes, six in all (Warrior, Thief, Monk, White, Black and Red Magician) selectable and assignable at the beginning of the game actually affect the fighting style you intend to adopt, given that it is possible to create teams focused only on physical strength or magical, or more balanced by mixing the two types of ~arts~ and skills. The parameters that regulate the technical and physical capabilities of each character as a tradition are then improved through experience points (EXP) obtainable at the end of each battle won. Novelty If we exclude some unpublished dungeons (~Soul of Chaos~), a bestiary, a new management of the cameras and an image gallery, on balance the only real changes compared to the original Final Fantasy here are to be found in the graphic and sonorous. In these sectors the restyling is almost total. As can be seen immediately from an aesthetic point of view, we have characters recreated in toto with two-dimensional sprites characterized by a level of din detail, a vivacity and brilliance of extraordinary colours, which manage to exalt themselves even on the small screen of the PSP. The scenarios themselves can boast a well-made chromatic realization, albeit with all the necessary distinctions. Beautiful CG movies. Despite this, the loading times are fortunately not excessive and there is an almost total absence of slowdowns. As far as the audio part is concerned, we have a brand new soundtrack, in the sense that it has been revisited and reworked, improved, with the addition of several new pieces of music. Comment Sometimes it happens to all of us to see an old film again, to play a videogame again, to read a book that we haven't touched for years, or to do something that in the past has amused us, perhaps made us literally dream, but which after some time, ~Savoring it again~ after having lived other specific experiences, it disappoints us, perhaps because it is now devoid of that spark which at the time had made it almost magical. Unfortunately, that's the way it is. There are things that deteriorate over time, others that improve, such as good wine for example. Still others, on the other hand, maintain their charm and quality unchanged, despite their antiquity. Final Fantasy belongs precisely to the latter category: it is something that goes beyond time. It is history, in its field. It is a title that must be played without any kind of foreclosures, with a mind free from prejudices inherent in graphics or antiquated style, to savor, get to know what this brand has represented, represents and will always represent in the universe of video games. For fans and beyond. Pros: He is the progenitor of an authentic gaming legend. Excellent technical restyling. Fair playability. Cons: Too frequent random fights. No localization in Italian. Maybe a little repetitive in the long run.", "date": "2008-03-18", "grade": null}
