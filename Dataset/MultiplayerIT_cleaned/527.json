{"name": "TrackMania Sunrise eXtreme - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trackmania-sunrise-extreme-recensione.html", "text": "The real gem, however, will be enjoyed especially by those who have not yet purchased the basic version of the game New and old The novelties of TMS eXtreme are essentially represented by a new mode called Stunts, new courses and new blocks to create tracks through the editor, which simply borders on perfection. The soul of the game, the multiplayer, has been updated with the possibility of having dedicated servers and putting yourself in the so-called ~observer~ mode, while the MediaTracker, the tool for creating racing videos, has also been expanded and improved with new visual effects. In terms of gameplay practically nothing has changed, since collisions between cars are still absent, but given the nature of the game and the already high difficulty of some tracks this is more good than bad: as in the case of TMS, go at 500Km/h on the circuits it requires a high level of driving attention, not to mention the routes which sometimes, especially the customized ones, are not very clear on the directions to take. In fact, what for many were the defects of the base game have therefore remained, given that the error is often around the corner and sometimes even the slightest distraction is punished. The positive side of all this is that with the absence of collisions it is possible to better interpret one's driving style, whether it is made up of very violent braking at the last moment or soft trajectories in search of the best way to travel the track without leave the tires at each braking. The new mode adds a further pinch of madness to the game, providing ramps and paths to travel at breakneck speed by performing stunts obviously unthinkable behind the wheel of a real car, also giving more variety to the game in both single and multiplayer. The latter mode remains the funnest part of TM, as well as being the one that guarantees its potentially infinite longevity, thanks to the really high number of people who challenge each other every day via the Internet and to the new availability of additional blocks to create the tracks. Good looking In technical terms, the TMS eXtreme expansion continues on the path taken by the base game, offering spectacularly wide scenarios, rarely appreciated in games of this genre, associated with meticulous car care. Also as regards the sound, nothing particularly new to report, as the expansion refers in all respects to TMS. The new version of the mediatracker will still allow you to enjoy the videos produced more, even in technical terms. you would do well not to miss out on TMS eXtreme Final comment Nadeo's choice to donate additional content to his fans, through TM Nations and TMS eXtreme, can only be appreciated across the board, demonstrating the fact that it is not necessary to make money on everything, as unfortunately often happens in the world of video games. Of course, several things of this expansion remain unchanged compared to TMS, but everything that makes up the main part of the game has at least been improved, starting with the additional number of elements to build customized tracks, which is very important for the large group of online players . For those who have not yet had the opportunity to play TMS, the special edition of TMS eXtreme is intended, which as mentioned in the body of the review includes some nice goodies at an honest price, in addition to the game of course. In any case, you'd better not miss out on TMS eXtreme, as it's just a few megabytes of completely free download away from you! Pros Very fun in all modes, especially online New blocks for the editor Great graphics Cons Overly arcade Can be addictive Never was a title more apt A couple of years ago, after having created the first TrackMania, probably not even the developers of Nadeo (also famous for Virtual Skipper) would have expected such a great success for the fruits of their efforts: after starting off a bit on the sly, especially in our country, the game succeeded in depopulating above all thanks to the community of online players, who showed enormous appreciation for the multiplayer mode, so fun that it recalls the old challenges that were made between friends at Micromachines. Once the great public success was achieved, the sequel arrived about a year ago, called TrackMania Sunrise (TMS from here on), which helped to give new life and fun to those who in the meantime had become thousands of fans of the series, so much so as to lead Nadeo to create TM Nations, a completely free project that can be downloaded from the network, to allow the appssionaries from all the nations of the world to take part in a final confrontation, in the coming months in Paris, with the possibility of securing a prize pool of no less than $400,000: needless to say, therefore, how this last move has contributed to making the TM series a true and its cult among players via the Internet. In the meantime, the development team has not been idle, creating the expansion called eXtreme for TMS, which can also be downloaded for free as TM Nations. The real gem, however, will be enjoyed especially by those who have not yet purchased the basic version of the game, given that a gold edition was also created for the occasion including TMS eXtreme (base and expansion together), the game's soundtrack , an exclusive poster and some nice stickers to customize anything you want, all for 29.90.
