Someone else short. Others are still dedicating dozens of hours a week to their characters. In any case, many, many have bought it. We are talking about 20 million pieces sold which, speaking of a hack & slash, represent a monstrous number, unjustified for many. Yet the reasons for this success are evident and do not exclusively concern the name. The competition, it is undeniable, is not up to par and valuable concepts such as that of Path of Exile are lost in front of a gameplay that in practice is not exciting. Quite the opposite of Diablo III which combines fast and spectacular mechanics with an intuitive specialization system full of possibilities. But despite the undeniable merits, initially the Blizzard title was undermined by some problems that became increasingly evident over time. As many will have guessed we are talking about the punitive drop system designed to enhance the auction and the non-functioning of the control skills on champions, elites and bosses. The special creatures, among other things, recovered their vitality in a few seconds and being practically immune to control skills, they created frustrating situations by putting the player's ability in the background to force him to ~farm~ the lower difficulty levels in search of equipment capable of making it more resistant. At the time, among other things, many skills were of little use, many builds were incomplete and most of the legendary items were practically useless. Today all these factors have changed radically. The drop isn't yet Diablo II's exhilarating feast of unique and incredibly powerful items, but the drop has disappeared from the PC version of the Blizzard title and was never implemented on that console. And since the release of Reaper of Souls the balance has become more convincing with numerous skills adapted to fit into elemental builds, new skills and an extra passive ability. Relevant changes that involve a much greater longevity, making even the experience faced with a single character deep and varied. The next-gen version of Diablo III brings with it all the differences of the console edition of the Blizzard title, multiplayer in split screen included, and includes most of the innovations developed by Blizzard since the launch of the title to today. The biggest difference is direct control of the character which also includes dodging with no cooldown or resource cost. The result is an action experience that is perhaps less precise but which has the advantage of being more direct and immersive. Unfortunately, the drop system remains stingy, even if the end-of-level bosses almost always drop one or two legendaries when we shoot them down for the first time, but as on the old gen and in the evolved version for PC, the type of objects obtained is often inherent to the class you use. This means that you change equipment often which decreases the typical frustration of low-level farming, when the character has few skills available and the gameplay is not yet in its fullest. The first ten levels are still slow, at least compared to the rest of the experience, but with the arrival of the first skills capable of increasing damage and movement, things change and the gameplay becomes decidedly more intense. And things get even better when some other differences from the PC version come into play such as bonuses from killstreaks, kills using scenery items, and destroyed scenery objects. In the first case you get a substantial bonus to the experience gained, much more sensible than the handful of experience points obtained in the PC version, and in the second a resource regeneration bonus. Destroying elements of the scenery in sequence, on the other hand, grants a bonus to movement speed. The Ultimate Evil Edition of Diablo III brings evil to next-generation consoles Xbox One goals Diablo III Ultimate Evil Edition offers the classic 1000 points all linked to progress in the plot or the accumulation of money, kills, items and journals. In addition to this we find all the companies of the PC version with hundreds of dedicated Achievements, some of which require hundreds of hours of play to be obtained. Furthermore there are the timed challenges the first of which will start at launch and ends by killing Malthael, the final boss of the fifth and final act. Constantly evolving One of Diablo III's most notorious problems is the lack of high-end mechanics that has become Blizzard's priority in recent patches. Diablo III Ultimate Evil Edition includes those released before patch 2.1 of the PC version as the levels of excellence that allow you to increase characteristics and bonuses practically at ainfinite. The next-gen console edition of the Blizzard title also includes the Adventure mode which allows us to eliminate various elite monsters without the encumbrance of the narrative component. Once all designated creatures are eliminated, you get a chest that has a chance to bestow specific legendary items. The rewards also include a special currency linked to bets on objects and the keys to the gates that allow us to open a portal to special areas, made up of several levels, with a final boss to face. Furthermore, more news should arrive soon, which we have talked about extensively in recent months. Blizzard has in fact guaranteed that the mechanics of patch 2.1, currently being tested on PC, will also arrive for the console version of the Blizzard title. In the near future, in essence, the major gates, the competitive seasons and all the new objects that will be implemented in the game from season to season should arrive. Furthermore, for future patches, Blizzard is thinking of a simultaneous release on consoles and PCs, which, according to the declarations, would be allowed, at least on new generation consoles, by the improvement of the update dynamics. But even if the 2.1 patch content won't be available at launch, the Ultimate Evil Edition of Diablo III is still enticing as it includes the Reaper of Souls expansion that came out not too long ago. We're also given the ability to import characters raised on old-gen consoles, and there are some intriguing new dynamics currently exclusive to the console version. The first is called Apprentice and it intervenes when there is a level disparity between the participants in a cooperative game. But instead of lowering the level of those who are at the top, as happens in other games, this feature elevates the level of those who are left behind, thus increasing the tenor of the gameplay instead of neutering them. The second new feature bears the high-sounding name Nemesis System and allows a monster that killed us to dive into a portal and then reappear, perhaps after a few days, in someone's game on our friends list. The problem is that for each hero killed the power of the monster increases and if the creature were to put together a series of victories it could become a thorn in the side even for the strongest players. The positive note is that as the monster gets stronger, it accumulates more and more treasures, becoming not a nuisance but a coveted prey. As you may have guessed we are not talking about a fundamental mechanic for the intensity of the gameplay but it is a sparkling addition that gives a pinch of depth to the online dimension, reminding us that we are not alone. The same goes for mail and for trading legendaries which should be allowed, but we couldn't test it first hand, with everyone on our friends list. A big difference compared to the PC version which, at least for now, limits the exchange of a legendary to only those present at the time of the drop. Confirmations, surprises and aftermath We have talked abundantly about the narrative system of Diablo III in these two years. The tones are not the dark ones of the first two chapters and the plot, although not without key events, does not have the dramatic force that made Diablo II unforgettable. However, there remain sumptuous interlude scenes, an excellent level column, dozens of beautifully dubbed audio diaries also in the Italian version and well-characterized iconic bosses. Furthermore, the graphic rendering of the next-gen version is finally comparable to that of the PC version at maximum detail. Explosions, ice shards and light effects abound giving us spectacular moments and enhancing the action. But the frame rate drops unjustifiably despite the fact that the polygonal mass of the Blizzard title is certainly not impressive. We are not talking about the average frame rate, apparently always anchored at 60 frames per second on Xbox One, but about apparently unjustified slowdowns and also typical of the PC version of the title. There is also a visual problem of a structural type that also interferes with the gameplay. We talk about the elemental abilities of monsters and characters that overlap and get confused making the action difficult to understand. Something has changed with the introduction of more visible effects as in the case of the icy impulse but facing multiple champions or elites at the same time it still happens to die without understanding why and it is not particularly pleasant. The uploads of the next-gen edition, on the other hand, surprise positively. Transitions from one area to another are practically instantaneous and loads are remarkably fast. The interface of thethe console version is quite different from the PC version with radial menus and shortcuts that are better suited to a pad. There are also some differences in the hud such as an indication of the time left for the massacre bonus and an instantaneous indication on the left of the game screen of any bonuses of an object collected compared to the same type of object currently equipped. The via pad system is more action but more cumbersome to aim and dodge. There is the automatic aim which takes into account the direction of the stick with great precision to establish the target and once we have it framed it is possible to lock it as a fixed target by pressing the left trigger of the pad. But when too many creatures are concentrated in an area it is difficult to choose precisely which opponent to target and this can be an issue with summoners having to be taken down before the summoned creatures. To this we must then add that the key of the primary attack is the same as the interactions that have a significant activation area. So it happens to exit a map to shoot a monster that is in front of the exit or to open a chest instead of shooting. Nothing to pull your hair out about but they're still minor annoyances that interfere with the flow of play. To balance, however, we find the possibility of quickly equipping the latest objects collected using the directional cross with which we can also activate teleportation and the map. For the rest, the structure is the same as the PC version with six types of skills combined with as many keys and a free mode that allows you to combine any skill with the keys on the pad without taking into account the type to which they belong. Then there are the countless levels of difficulty and the gates which, while not revolutionizing the experience, finally allow you to play games on repeat. Too bad that the drop system is still too stingy and many objects, some of which will be revised with the 2.1 patch, are still useless or almost. There is also a balancing issue related to the abilities of elite and champion-type creatures. On the lowest difficulties, special monsters only have one ability and no dangerous combinations are created. But at maximum difficulty, with much more powerful monsters capable of launching four skills almost repeatedly, combinations can be created, such as hordes and walls, with sometimes frustrating effects. To mitigate the problem without debasing the difficulty, Blizzard has prevented some skill combinations from occurring and has inserted a healing potion which, when used, allows you to break summoned walls. But it still happens to get stuck while hordes of enemies target us and when playing on high difficulties it is easy to leave the pens feeling the bitter aftertaste of impotence. With the latest patches, however, death has been made less oppressive by allowing characters to resurrect at their own lifeless body in no time at all. Obviously, this possibility is not given to us during the bosses but the aim, achieved, is to keep the pace of the gameplay high even when facing challenging difficulty levels.", "date": "2014-08-18", "grade": "9.0"}
