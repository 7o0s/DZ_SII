{"name": "Sull'orlo del precipizio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/88372-brink-sullorlo-del-precipizio.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360 Made by Splash Damage, the guys from Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, Brink proposes the same formula, or that of team combat, trying to capitalize on the criticisms received in the previous title. The American developers have structured the various clashes in the different maps that make up the title in order to tell the story of The Ark, a city / island in front of San Francisco which hosts the war between the Resistance and the Forces of Security, fighting for control of the city's resources, a city that seems to be the only survivor of some global cataclysm. On this narrative basis Brink rotates the single player campaign and the online part. Both allow us to experience the events of the Ark in the role of the Resistance or in those of Security, tying everything with videos both within each single mission, made up of several progressive objectives, and between one and the other . The difference is who we play with, with bots or with human opponents / companions in the online one. Better not be alone However, Brink does not limit the choice of how to play: both ~sides~ can be open to the network or played alone. Furthermore, both alone and with other players we can, indeed we must test our skills with challenges, or a sort of tutorial disguised as individual mini-missions, thanks to which new weapons and related upgrades are unlocked, such as optics, oversized magazines, grenade launchers, muzzle brakes and so on. These challenges replicate the typical objectives of each single class in restricted areas, therefore they see us engaged in trying to escort and repair as needed, a robot from one point of a level to another, in trying to reach all the checkpoints in an area taking advantage of the agility of the SMART system, which allows us with a single key to jump, run, climb and slide, defend an outpost as a technician, placing turrets and mines, from different waves of enemies - just like a first person tower defense - or do all this in the Factotum challenges, in which we are asked to change class from time to time to complete specific objectives. These challenges are symptomatic, more than the single player campaign, of the game's highly multiplayer nature. If the initial ones are quite simple, to all intents and purposes a preparatory appetizer of what awaits us in the title, the subsequent ones are characterized by a boost in the level of difficulty which makes them really difficult if played alone and which therefore require the ability to overcome them. 'assistance of several players, necessarily human, up to a maximum of four. For example, in escort missions, you go from a couple of opponents at a time to an entire team of six, eight, in outpost defense missions, from simple soldiers to ~tanks~ equipped with heavy machine guns, with lots of of numerous support infantry, all graced by a generous increase in health, same thing for the omni-tool. In short, this type of gaming experience, beyond the initial stages of learning, seems to be geared almost exclusively towards multiplayer use. This is not a bad thing, as everyone knows Brink is a product born with multiplayer in mind, which must be played cooperatively to be successful. But tying the unlocking of weapons and upgrades to overcoming challenges that require multiple players to be overcome makes life really difficult for all those who cannot go online. Obviously we are not faced with an aut aut, on the net or nothing to do, but only with an increase in the level of difficulty that is not at all progressive and not very balanced, compared to the starting challenge. What job do you do? The real peculiarity of Brink is the subdivision of the team by tasks. Each, belonging to the Resistance or to the Security, is based on different specializations, i.e. technician, soldier, doctor and agent, fundamental in the economy of the game as the main objectives, dynamic within each mission, are completed by exploiting the single specialization of a class. A typical mission is structured as follows: blowing up a door, you need the soldier with explosives, then you need to tamper with a computer to get a card, the agent and his thief/spy paraphernalia are needed to get past the firewalls, once you have the card it is possible to access an area from which to extract a prisoner to be accompanied outside, the doctor and his healing ~buffs~ become vital. If then there is a need to activate some structure, build barriers or defensive turrets, the technician is essential. As if that weren't enough, in addition to the choice of role, it is also possible to choose the build of our alter ego, which implies the tinumber of usable weapons (light, medium and heavy), agility, speed of movement and resistance to damage. This means that in missions in which the transport of a particular object is required, the ~courier~ should be fast and able to exploit all the level design, making the most of SMART. During the escort of a prisoner, the defense or the breakthrough of an objective, it is necessary to have a ~tank~ in the team, powerful, slow, but armed with miniguns with rotating barrels. A well-built team, not unbalanced and covered in every single role is the viaticum to bring home the mission, therefore it is necessary to work in concert, cooperatively avoiding any ambitions of a solitary knight. Working together doesn't just mean staying close and not scattering around the map, but making perfect use of the individual skills of each class. As with any recent online shooter, the accumulation of experience points by achieving objectives, kills, defenses and successful attacks allows us to unlock perks and further abilities. Each specialization brings peculiar skills, active and passive. The soldier, in addition to placing explosives, for example can supply teammates with ammunition and is immediately equipped with Molotov cocktails. The Technician can build, repair objectives, and upgrade teammates' weapons. Similarly, the medic heals the team and boosts the health of allies, while the agent can breach enemy structures and disguise himself as an enemy. In addition to these there are many others, which represent the true heart of the game. Mirror reflection There are about fifty skills (rather quickly you can unlock them all, one class at a time), divided between those relating to the class and the universal ones. The latter are those closest to the concept of perk, such as better performing bullets, reload on the fly and increased health, those of class instead give the player further tactical possibilities. Going back to making a list, the soldier has access to different types of explosives, can collect supplies from dead comrades or equip armor-piercing shells. The technician can lay mines, develop different types of turrets and speed up the construction processes. The medic will be able to grant temporary invincibility, restore incapacitated companions waiting to respawn, speed up a companion, pass supplies and much more. Many of these skills are also interpreted by the game as a secondary objective, in order to obtain further experience points by activating them. What's interesting is that many of the skills have a counter. We're not just talking about increased damage/increased health or armor-piercing bullets/Kevlar vest. If a technician has the ability to upgrade an outpost, from which supplies and class change are obtained, the agent will be able to screen it to make its capture longer. In the same way, a placed turret can be hacked and even used remotely against the original owner. In short, Brink invites the player to have the specifics of his role in mind and to act accordingly, without ever overdoing it to achieve the set goal. Dynamic objectives, which can be chosen in real time by the player, are another peculiarity of the game. It's all very simple, with the digital cross we access the choice of our main and secondary tasks. If you complete the first ones you go on with the mission, the second ones are used to get bonuses on the field or to conquer posts or outposts. From this point of view, communication with other teammates is necessary, playing with bots instead shows all the limits of artificial intelligence. Light or heavy? In Brink there are a good number of weapons, we are around fifty units, divided, as previously written, between light, medium and heavy. Contrary to many other titles, ~the irons~ are not linked to a specific class, but to the chosen build of our alter ego. The thin one runs and sprints, but cannot use heavy machine guns, conversely the imposing one can choose anything, but he will be slow and at most he can climb over very low obstacles. We therefore find pistols, machine guns, single shot rifles and assault rifles, grenade launchers and miniguns. Each of these weapons (all fictional, none real) can be modified, thus affecting parameters such as range, damage, cadence, accuracy, stability, reload speed, equipment and magazine size with bonuses and penalties. Choices that strongly affect the style of play. Confusion Companions and enemies behave quite well when it comes to shooting, healing or giving buffs, also thanks to the level design (to which we will return lateri), unfortunately, however, they often struggle to keep up with the progress of the main objectives. Many times they become entangled with an outpost when defending an exit or attempting to hack a computer, resulting in the team being dispersed to different points on the map, while the mission timer ticks down mercilessly towards zero. Precisely for this reason, for this intrinsic, how annoying problem of artificial intelligence, the pure single player fails to convey all the goodness of the tactical system set up by Splash Damage. About twenty missions, all structurally similar to each other and three levels of difficulty, alternating between Resistance and Security (same story, opposite actions) are in practice a training ground for the multiplayer experience, extremely necessary given the unlocking of skills (audio recordings but above all of the parts of clothing), but what a game of strength they only scratch the potential of the title. This feeling is also exacerbated by a level design that doesn't always manage to stage convincing and reasoned guerrilla and counter-guerrilla actions. Most of the (only) eight maps that make up the game are set in indoor environments, clubs, garages, laboratories, sheds and hangars, there is certainly no shortage of large spaces, but it often happens that the ~points of interest~ of the missions are in tight spaces, and even when there are multiple access points, convenient or to be exploited via SMART, the artificial intelligence seems to favor a single point of attack, generating enormous ~traffic jams~ and pigeon shooting in the defensive phase. Same thing obviously if it's our team that attacks, but with reversed sides. During a mission we witnessed the systematic killing of enemies who persisted in going through a narrow spiral staircase instead of taking advantage of a much more passable entrance. In situations like these, the illusion of being playing with human opponents completely falls away, and makes the limits of playing the title in single player even more evident. In short, Brink, while on the one hand it achieves the goal of offering challenging, full-bodied and mechanical multiplayer tactics, on the other it fails to support the same approach when it comes to playing alone with or against CPU-managed bots. It will be said that these are problems that do little to affect the objective value of the title given its purely online nature, but when single player and multiplayer are intertwined, sharing the same persistent advancement of skills and levels and above all proposing the same missions, the differences between two game experiences catch the eye and lay bare all the critical issues present. Xbox 360 goals Brink rewards the player with 36 achievements for a total of 1000 points. They are obtained by completing the two campaigns of the game, using particular skills, or by completing all the challenges. More generally, it is ~enough~ to thoroughly examine the game in its entirety to obtain them, but there are some really tough challenges, including those relating to the higher difficulty levels. Fashion in the Ark From a technical point of view, the work of Splash Damage, while not lacking in personality, certainly cannot be taken as a paradigm for the titles to come. Since the very first images released, what stood out more than the architectures, the polygonal count and the textures, was certainly the peculiar style chosen in the design of the protagonists, anti-naturalistic, almost caricatured, to emphasize the different body types to choose from. All this is tangible when you ~waste time~ with the complete aesthetic customization of your alter ego, being able to indulge yourself between head, beard, hair, face paint, jacket, pants, accessories, tattoos and scars. There is a lot to choose from, too bad that everything is an end in itself and once on the field, our fighter's look is lost in the first person view. Looking around then, in terms of textures, the game certainly does not excel, coloring rather anonymous structures of sci-fi derivation, with also visible texture pop-in problems, mitigated by the game's installation, which is highly recommended. The animations are good, visible thanks to the SMART, which works well in facilitating navigation of the map ~parkhour style~, and which in the hands of expert players can be a real game changing, given the possibility of taking impervious secondary roads and making a slide that knocks opponents down.", "date": "2011-05-10", "grade": "7.8"}
