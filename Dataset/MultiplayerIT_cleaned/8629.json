Therefore, the arrival of The King of Fighter XIII also seems inevitable, especially after the burning disappointment that fans have had from the meager previous chapter, both because the glorious franchise needed a relaunch and, above all, because it certainly could not be the only one title stuck in the pits while all the others battled it out with millionaire sales. An intricate story Following somewhat the practice of the genre, the plot that unfolds around the tournament of The King of Fighters XIII seems more like an unclear weave of metaphysical events, starring some very specific wrestlers. In particular, thanks to the interesting story mode, we sense a sort of responsibility on the part of the Hero Team (made up of Elisabeth Blanctorche, Duo Long and Shen Wuu) towards their old leader, Ash Crimson, who in the meantime seems to have betrayed the his former comrades. Just Ash, freed from the yoke that Elisabeth exercised on him, seems to have conquered the power of Kagura (holder together with her clan of one of the three seals essential to prevent the rebirth of the demon Orochi) and of Iori Yagami, in turn defeated. Of the three sacred artifacts now only Kusanagi's sword remains while the revived Yagami, in the grip of Orochi's evil power, attacked and defeated Kusanagi, putting him out of action definitively. In this context of impending danger and destruction, Rose Bernstein, a young and rich heiress, announces the thirteenth King of Fighters tournament; an opportunity to gather in one place all the best fighters on earth and thus put an end to the terrible danger posed by Ash and his ancestor from the past Saiki. In fact, having now reached the thirteenth chapter, it is difficult to summarize all the events that have justified the various episodes released in recent years; however, this last version can easily be considered as the end of the Ash sub-saga, which began with The King of Fighters 2003. However, the very strong Bogard brothers deserve a few lines of consideration, members together with Joe Higashi of the Fatal Fury team and always at the center of nice interludes, in particular with the beautiful and busty Mai Shiranui (protagonist of one of the most beautiful cosplay in the world, thanks to the our splendid Giorgia Vecchini). Three is better The three-person team fight has remained the fulcrum of the action also in this last chapter of the saga: in fact, the main single player modes, or the aforementioned Story and the ever-present Arcade Mode, can only be tackled using three fighters . However, in the story, which suffers from obvious localization defects, it is possible to choose only from already assorted teams, in accordance with the plot, and the only customization allowed is the order of appearance in the ring. In Arcade Mode, on the contrary, the choice is given to freely assemble the team, both as participants and in order of appearance; in both modes, however, the biggest problem will be the fight against the final boss, so difficult to predict at each ~Continue?~ used 3 choices to facilitate his departure, i.e. all the bars to the maximum immediately, an increase in damage inflicted with a relative decrease in that suffered and as an extreme ratio the reduction to a quarter of the health of the powerful boss. The pre-set sequence of fighters represents the first tactical choice: since there is no Tag Mode, the clashes each time involve a character from one's own group against one from the opponent; the winner, with only a small extra life bonus, will then face the second in order of appearance of the opponent and so on. It is clear that, unless you use all three of your fighters at the same level, it is advisable to weigh carefully the order of exit, in order to avoid finding yourself in critical conditions precisely with those who are less easily mastered. In VS and Online mode, on the other hand, you can freely choose whether to fight single-handedly or three against three; all the other choices available, obviously starting with the indispensable Tutorial, the Missions (which include a sort of Time Attack, Survival Mode and the real Missions in which to perform increasingly difficult combos suggested by the CPU) and Training they face each other with only one personage. The wide choice of modes concludes with the always appreciated photo gallery full of artwork and songs that are unlocked with each victory achieved, a customization menu for your own Online Gamertag and for the color of the characters, a section for online match Replays and direct access to the PlayStation Store, looking for any DLC present. Playstation 3 trophies The King of Fighters XIII boasts 47 trophies, divided into 33 bronze, 11 silver, two golds and the classic platinum that is obtained by unlocking all the others. Obtaining 100% of the awards is certainly not everyone's mission, given the general difficulty of the game, even if many of the bronze trophies are actually obtained simply by accumulation by playing over time (this is the case with trophies that require you to perform 50 moves of certain type, 10 wins in arcade or vs etc). The silverware is already more demanding, especially those dedicated to online gaming which provide for 10 consecutive victories or 50 total, and those which force you to finish the Arcade mode at the Very Difficult level or without ever dying, an undertaking that defining titanic is really an understatement. Completing all challenges and winning 100 online matches finally represents the struggles to get the two golds. Immerse yourself in the fight After all this rich side dish, which already represents a huge step forward in terms of content compared to what was seen with the previous chapter, it is good to talk about the actual combat, the soul of every good fighting game but above all, in the case of The King of Fighters XIII, a particular reason to brag about. The approach chosen is, as always, technical in the strictest sense of the term: the ~disclaimer~ to be made immediately concerns users from sagas such as Marvel vs Capcom or, to a lesser extent, Mortal Kombat or the recent Street Fighter itself X Tekken. The speech concerns in particular the execution of the combos: in reality, it is already enough to have to do with the appropriate Mission mode to realize how we are really serious here. Beyond the difficulty of executing the most effective moves, which instead of the classic ~quarter circle~ or ~crescent~ to be performed with the directional cross (or, better, with an analog stick), often involve double movements (~quarter of moon ahead, crescent back~), also the ~timing~ of execution, i.e. the ~time windows~ of chaining become shorter and more rigid. The general balance is really excellent: each character has a set of moves to deal with any situation and team combat if possible increases the uncertainty of each match even more. However, the maximum of ~hits~ is reached by forcing one's opponent into a corner, thanks to the impossibility of moving away during the execution of the blows. However, this probable source of imbalance has also been balanced, thanks to the somersaults present on the R1 key during which all blows are dodged, thus allowing escape from every dangerous ravine. The game HUD, actually a bit crowded, is full of some fundamental bars: at the top, in addition to that of the clearly visible life, there is that of the parade (which, however, recharges when you do not suffer hits), while at the bottom there are the Energy bar which accumulates up to 5 times and the Hyperdrive bar, both recharging with each shot parried or scored. The function of the Energy and Hyperdrive bars is essential for the execution of special shots: in addition to the basic moves, in fact, there are EX shots, which generally consume a notch of energy, Super techniques, also from a bar, EX Super, which cost two levels of energy and finally the Super Neo Max, which consume three levels plus the entire Hyperdrive bar. An EX Gauge can also be used for defensive techniques, such as Forward or Backwards Cancel Guard Dodge and Counterattack (all of these techniques are explained in the tutorial, which you are highly recommended to complete). The Hyperdrive level is instead The King of Fighters XIII's answer to the Focus Cancel present in Super Street Fighter 4: the most passionate will remember the fearsome technique of the Capcom title, capable of interrupting an animation to chain another hit in combo to the cost of two EX levels. In this case the discussion is much more complex and varied, as the Hyperdrive can really be used in many different ways. The simple Erase Drive for example, which consumes half of the Hyperdrive, serves to interrupt a special technique (and therefore cancel its animation) by executing another of the same type; the Super Cancel instead, at the same cost, occurs when a special technique is interrupted with a Super and for this it also requires an energy baraccumulated. With the Hyperdrive line at its maximum, by pressing the X plus Triangle keys, you can also enter Hyperdrive mode for a few tens of seconds, indicated by a sort of aura on the character; the main advantage of this status is that of being able to perform Super Clears repeatedly but above all the fearsome Neo Max Super Special Techniques, personalized for each fighter, and the Max Clear, which allows you to chain the Supers to the ~normal~ special techniques, increasing out of all proportion the overall Hits. Nice but no frills The technical aspect of a title like The King of Fighters XIII basically has only one purpose: to serve as a support to the splendid gameplay, which represents the state of the art for a fighting game. And in this the final result is really positive: beyond the 1080p and 60 frames per second guaranteed in every situation, the title enjoys sometimes wonderful animations, an impeccable response to commands and in general a really positive glance. However, some sore points could come from the backgrounds: little characterized and very little animated, they certainly do not make a good impression compared to the competition. However, there is a downside: the almost absolute lack of action in the background manages to focus even more attention on the fighters, helping to make the atmosphere in the ring unique. As well as the absence of exaggerated special effects, even the music, certainly not memorable, seems to deliberately play a secondary role, leaving the limelight all to the wrestlers. The online sector is also good, which worked quite well during our tests, even if the impression is that in general the whole game is slowed down slightly in this case; not a real lag, but rather a kind of intentional depower. However, this sensation could depend on the performance of our test line and occur to a lesser extent where the latency and speed values are better. In addition to the typical modalities always available in online games, such as the creation of rooms for free play and classified matches, a note of merit goes to the possibility of training with a friend online, an option also available in the recent Street Fighter X Tekken and which is really useful and appreciated. The biggest regret is perhaps the impossibility of playing cooperatively online and offline even if, given the absence of Tag mode, everything would then have been reduced to normal 1 vs 1 matches.", "date": "2012-03-30", "grade": "9.0"}
