The game currently has a base of around 15 million users and earns 100 million dollars a month through its in-app purchases system, projecting the GungHo team to the top of the Japanese gaming industry. Neglected at first, we return to consider this title also in the light of the amazing results obtained by Puzzle & Dragons Z in the Rising Sun, the adaptation for Nintendo 3DS that currently dominates the software ranking of the best-selling video games in those parts. A quick look at the game's appearance and contents is enough to understand how its success is based on a simple principle of aggregation of features with a certain positive impact on the Japanese public. Collectible little monsters, ~match 3~ style puzzle game, progression from RPG in dungeon crawler structure and social elements: GungHo has simply worked according to the simplest of expressions, adding all these elements and putting together a composite creature with the formula surprisingly stable. Such a hodgepodge of features could have generated a bizarre videogame Frankenstein too composite to stand together on its legs, and instead the ability of the Japanese team was revealed precisely in the relative compactness of the final product. Not that this completely eliminates the impression that there are far too many elements within the game, some of which are poorly blended and perhaps more appreciated by the Japanese public than by the Western one, but the overall system works and succeeds, after a period of adaptation and understanding of the numerous mechanisms that can last longer than seen in many other mobile titles, to immerse us in the vortex of addiction given by the classic mechanics of the puzzle game combined with the progression of the RPG. Among the positive elements, however, we note the adoption of a freemium system that does not show the typically poor characteristics of the money-eating mechanism, with in-app purchases present but not absolutely necessary for the use of the game, mainly linked to the purchase of stones magic that allow you to find new rare creatures through the slot machine, accelerating the evolution times of your party. Puzzle stimulation, RPG progression, and Pokmon collecting: Puzzle & Dragons ingredients A successful chimera The central core of the gameplay is a classic puzzle based on the association of colors, a type of game now standardized and found in a myriad of variations, from the old Columns to the present day, but inserted in a completely different context. In fact, the game sees us face many dungeons with progressive difficulty, essentially composed of clashes with various monsters placed one behind the other. There is no exploration but only clashes, which basically provide a pretext for solving puzzles, which in this way take on a specific function in combat. While the upper part of the screen is occupied by the classic subjective view of the dungeon and the enemies to be faced, the lower part during these clashes shows the spherical gems of different colors, to be associated in a minimum of three horizontally or vertically, thus making them disappear and eventually triggering a series of combos with further color associations. Each color is associated with a magical element that can be connected to the characteristics of its fighters, thus enhancing the effect of the attack, as well as having different effects depending on the enemy we are facing, more or less sensitive to a certain type of magic . Each player's move takes up a turn, while in the turn of the enemies we are forced to suffer an attack that decreases our hit points, which once they reach zero determine the game over. Upstream of all this is the construction of one's own ~team~ of fighters, made up of a group of creatures decidedly similar to those found in titles based on collecting monsters and the like, along the lines of Pokmon. On this front opens up another large section of the game focused on the discovery of new creatures (they are conquered by receiving eggs from eliminated enemies or by investing magic stones in the ~slot machine~), on team composition with elements with different characteristics and powers magic and on the possibility of making creatures evolve by merging them together. In short, Puzzle & Dragons proves to be an extremely multifaceted game and not easy to digest at firstimpact, with the need for a certain period of acclimatization within all the various options to master the different elements, which tends to clash with the immediacy trend of many mobile titles, especially of the puzzle genre.", "date": "2013-12-31", "grade": "7.5"}
