The sales success and the investment of the American giant on the project carried out by Avalanche Software had already made a sequel more than obvious for some time, which after a year promptly materialized in stores all over the world. Unimaginatively called Disney Infinity 2.0: Marvel Super Heroes, this second episode shifts the focus towards an (even) more masculine and slightly more adult target, putting the superheroes of the Marvel universe at the center of the project, also - as is well known - owned by the US giant. Disney Infinity 2.0 improves certain aspects of its predecessor, but there is no shortage of shadows Manhattan project Tight development times to guarantee the annual release of a product so extensive in content have evidently forced the Texan team to make some choices, such as asking Ninja Theory for help in refining the combat system. But evidently this was not enough to maintain a similar thickness in the Worlds offer compared to the first chapter: if in fact Disney Infinity guaranteed access to 3 adventures related to The Pirates of the Caribbean, Monsters University and The Incredibles with its Starter Pack , for a total of twenty hours of play, in the case of this new edition there is only a single World, that of The Avengers, together with the statuettes of Thor, Iron Man and the Black Widow. To be able to have fun in other Worlds it will be necessary to put your wallet in hand by purchasing the Play Sets of Spider-Man (which however shares the setting of the city of Manhattan with The Avengers) or of The Guardians of the Galaxy. A choice, that of Disney, which therefore leaves a little bitterness in the mouth, although it is fair to underline how the Starter Pack of version 2.0 conversely guarantees immediate access to cooperative multiplayer which instead in the first episode had to necessarily go through the purchase of other characters compatible with the various Worlds. More generally, it seems quite clear how Avalanche Software has preferred to assign less specific weight to the Worlds within the Disney Infinity 2.0 offer, preferring to give even greater importance to the Toy Box. In fact, facing the adventure of The Avengers we are faced with a Manhattan which, despite the presence of some iconic buildings and with the fairly generous dimensions of the explorable area, appears rather devoid of ~things to do~ making exploration unrewarding and debasing the free roaming key that the team has chosen to adopt. Even from a purely technical point of view, something more could have been done: the ~reference~ version from this point of view, i.e. the PlayStation 4 that we used for the review, shows a graphics system that is only marginally better than that offered by the old -gen, already certainly not extraordinary especially as regards the polygonal complexity of the scenarios, the effects and the lighting. Even the basic physics to say the least, the pop up at close range, the exhausting (REALLY exhausting) loading and the modest driving model of the vehicles certainly don't help. Better notes instead come from the character development system: while in fact with the first chapter the growth of the levels did not lead to substantial advantages remaining an end in itself, in Disney Infinity 2.0 there is instead a tree of skills to be unlocked precisely as the character progresses . The interesting thing is that the total compatibility with all the statuettes released so far, including therefore those of the first chapter, translates into specific skills also available for the ~old~ characters, thus increasing longevity and interest on paper. Unfortunately, however, the stringent limits on access to the Worlds, which allow only the characters of that precise context to enter the game with rare exceptions, make the process less fun and useful than it could have been. The combat system, on the other hand, is sufficient considering the audience to which it is addressed, even if the lazy camera and the absence of a sort of automatic coupling sometimes make things not fully satisfactory.Let's edit them all As mentioned above, it is therefore precisely towards the Toy Box that Avalanche Software intends and hopes to direct most of the hours that users will spend in Disney Infinity 2.0. It is, in a completely similar way to what was seen in the first episode, a large and robust section within which nothing is hidden but an editor through which to build, literally piece by piece, your own game world. The philosophy behind it is precisely the same as the toy boxes of the little ones, which thanks to the imagination of the latter become real inexhaustible sources of improbable but exciting adventures. Compared to the past, the developers have this time added the possibility of customizing and decorating the interiors of one's home as desired and of connecting different areas to each other, thus increasing the thickness of the offer; at the same time the constructors have been inserted, i.e. small creatures that in practice take charge of a large part of the user's work by generating the chosen structures in a procedural and automatic way. A kind of partial relief, actually, because unfortunately the construction phase of Disney Infinity 2.0 remains tiring, if not exhausting: navigating through the overly complex, redundant and tangled menus via the controller requires an effort equal only to the time it takes to put together something that makes a minimum of sense, and even once you have completed your work it is not said that the final result is actually funny enough to convince you that it was worth it. Let me be clear, the underlying concept remains very interesting, but we are convinced that given the target user a simpler and more accessible interface would be absolutely preferable, even on the condition of drastically cutting the number of available ~pieces~. Because it is certainly nice to have several different types of tracks for cars or different buildings or even plants and shrubs, but our impression is that the quantity is decidedly overwhelming at the expense of the usability of the Toy Box. At least a more extensive and progressive tutorial phase would be useful instead of the few and limited indications that are offered. In any case, to give a concrete example of the possibilities offered by this mode, the programmers have chosen to add a new type of Tokens to the already complex ecosystem of Disney Infinity 2.0, called Toy Box Game Tokens. In a nutshell, these are hexagonal objects to be placed on the Base and which allow access to experiences built thanks to the tools offered by the editor. Two are included in the Starter Pack, a kind of tower defense set in Asgard and a top-down dungeon crawler in the prison of Guardians of the Galaxy. Although interesting from a creative point of view, these are often flawed experiences from a purely gameplay point of view, thus making this new category of Tokens not exactly thrilling. Obviously, the element of the community remains strongly, through which users can share and access the creations made through the Toy Box: the variety of the offer is commendable, with some even considerable efforts, but we are not yet entirely convinced that it is this is the best path for the future of the series.", "date": "2014-10-02", "grade": "7.0"}
