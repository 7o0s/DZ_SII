In fact, we are talking about a title that uses already widely tested solutions, both on the gameplay front as well as on that of the structure, to involve us in turn-based battles that follow one another in a linear and progressive way, without beating about the bush, in the context of an experience perfectly calibrated on the needs of immediacy and portability of mobile gaming. There isn't a real plot at the base of the missions that we will face, it's all rather generic: we have this fantasy world at war and our handful of heroes, as per tradition linked to a guild, opposes the forces of evil within different modes that also include a PvP arena, a bounty hunt and an interesting territorial mode in which you have to conquer and then defend new locations on a large map. However, the core of the game is represented by the campaign, which will see us explore different scenarios and fight increasingly cunning, resistant and dangerous enemies, as well as a long series of bosses. Duels can be resolved in a matter of seconds, especially at the beginning , or even take place in a completely automated way. It is therefore their quantity that is surprising: the developers have inserted hundreds of them, given the speed with which they are completed, to keep the involvement high and avoid running out of experience too quickly. Gameplay and structure As mentioned at the beginning, Crystalborne: Heroes of Fate is not an original production, on the contrary it refers in every respect to the most famous exponents of the tactical RPG genre with gacha elements. The summoning of new heroes and new objects represents a fundamental aspect of the game, as well as their growth, the upgrade system, the assignment of equipment and everything that revolves around the concept of upgrades. When it comes to the point, i.e. the in-game action, the touch control system (the Bluetooth controller is not supported, but frankly you don't miss it) proves to be extraordinarily simple and immediate: just a few taps are enough to make the moves and possibly change targets, unleashing the repertoire of the various party members to quickly eliminate each threat and proceed towards the next fight. In this sense, the freemium model used for the occasion appears rather permissive: you play for as long as you want without waiting, the times for unlocking the chests are quick, but above all the experience is set up so as to flow smoothly and without uncertainties, avoiding getting wrapped up in complex concepts or dead phases. There are obviously calls for monetization, but at least in the early hours, the need to dig into the wallet is never really felt. The problem, if you like, is that this type of characterization, so aseptic and dry, which gives gacha enthusiasts exactly what they want without a minimum of intermediation, soon ends up revealing the limits of a very simplistic and banal base, which it is no coincidence that it repeats itself endlessly, changing only the values in the field to push us to obsessively pursue the growth of the characters. That's a shame, because technically and artistically Crystalborne: Heroes of Fate does pretty much everything perfectly, with great graphics (although the hero designs are fairly generic) that run smoothly on our testing iPad Pro The sound is less brilliant, which seems to suffer from frequent and annoying latency episodes compared to what happens on the screen and is limited to the bare minimum, without involving too much.", "date": "2020-02-27", "grade": "8.0"}
