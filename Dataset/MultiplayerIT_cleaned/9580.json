The latter in particular has distinguished itself over the years compared to the competition for its classic style in which the so-called item-crafting has always been the key element of playability. Precisely with an episode of this saga, which is the eleventh chapter of the same, the first to be developed for PlayStation 3 and to take advantage of 3D graphics, the Japanese software house returns to work to bring us back to one of its fantastic worlds. Atelier Rorona: The Alchemist of Arland is therefore, perhaps needless to underline it at this point, a typically old-fashioned Japanese role-playing game, that is, with turn-based combat and anime-style characters, in which the component linked to the creation of objects and accessories through the alchemy is the fulcrum around which the entire gameplay revolves. The plot itself, therefore, while presenting some more serious moments, is generally quite simple, fun and carefree as in other genre products, and there are also bizarre characters such as a cook who fights using a giant frying pan or a storyteller who pays court to the protagonist. The latter is obviously played by the player: her name is Rorona, and she is a young apprentice who works in an alchemy laboratory in the kingdom of Arland. However, due to the unpopularity achieved among the local population by its owner, Astrid, the king decides to close this magic shop. At least until those who manage it manage to improve its fortunes by also making themselves useful for the community. The Sorceress' Apprentice Rorona takes matters into her own hands and therefore decides to satisfy the sovereign's requests: for the next three years she undertakes to successfully pass twelve quarterly missions, completing the jobs assigned by the city management and helping the other inhabitants in everyday life otherwise he will leave the kingdom. The adventure is therefore divided into timed blocks, with periods within which certain quests or situations must be completed, otherwise the game will end prematurely (and restart from the last save). And since everything largely revolves around alchemy and the creation of magical artifacts through it, the phases for recovering the ingredients necessary to create them become fundamental. These elements can be found in the appropriate shops, obtained at the end of certain battles, but in principle most of them can be found in the locations surrounding the city. The exploratory part, which involves a party of three characters if desired (otherwise you can also go alone), takes place within areas where a certain freedom of action is granted, with different crossroads or alternative routes that dislocate along the way, and a few puzzles scattered here and there to spice up the action. The search for ingredients for Rorona's recipes is instead simplified by a system that signals in advance both the objects present in a given area and the points in which to find them. Which on the one hand can be seen in a positive way since, having to optimize the time available to the maximum, one is not forced to wander around the kingdom, on the other hand, however, it drastically reduces the pleasure of exploring and discovering the things. However, nothing striking one way or the other. If anything, a bit of a nuisance in these situations is the limit number of objects that the protagonist can transport in her inventory and the impossibility of synthesizing the products recovered directly on the spot. Which forces the user, once the appropriate space in the menu has been filled, to return to his laboratory to deposit everything. It would have taken very little to make the experience less annoying and speed everything up: a tent to pitch, a makeshift camp or huts strategically located ad hoc in various points of the map where to synthesize the objects. Especially considering the fact that every second in this title becomes precious. Time is running out Because the real enemy in Atelier Rorona: The Alchemist of Arland, beyond the monsters that cross each other on the street and which we will talk about later, is precisely the passing of time. As mentioned at the beginning of the article, the game takes place over a three-year period: each operation, be it moving from the city to the hunting areas, making alchemical potions or resting necessary to recover hit points, in fact, they cost Rorona a certain amount of hours and days. At first everything seems easily manageable. But as the story progresses and with the increase of the rThe requests for objects from the ~customers~, and consequently for the sub-quests, the alternation of the collection and synthesis phases will turn into an authentic race against the seconds. Consequently pushing the gamer to plan every action and to decide to give up some of the side missions. Something inevitable but certainly not useful for the purposes of the adventure since not completing a quest for reasons of expediency not only implies the dissatisfaction of the person who commissioned it (and therefore jeopardizes his esteem for the protagonist) but also makes him lose some valuable artifact or ingredient and a lot of money. And the latter are fundamental in Atelier Rorona since they are especially useful for the purchase of alchemical tomes containing new recipes, but also for enlisting new allies. The members of the party, in fact, are decided both on the basis of the development of the plot and the meetings that take place, and by talking to some characters in the appropriate town square where they can be enrolled. The amount of money needed to buy his services is determined by the interpersonal relationships between him and Rorona: in other words, the better the degree of respect or friendship, the lower the cost of the person hired. Playstation 3 trophies Atelier Rorona: The Alchemist of Arland presents 53 Trophies (1 Platinum, 2 Gold, 8 Silver, 42 Bronze). These can be obtained with the continuation of the adventure, and, depending on the type, can be unlocked by collecting, for example, all the information on the creatures present in the game, by passing the various tests or by obtaining level 50 as an alchemist or adventurer. Turn-based combat Going back to the exploration phases, it must be said that the locations around the city are obviously infested with monsters and wild creatures. These are generally hostile and are visible on the map. Therefore, they can be avoided whenever possible. If, on the other hand, you decide to face them or if you are attacked, a fight begins. This takes place on a separate screen and technically refers to the classic canons of the genre, namely that of turn-based battles, with orders to party members given by the player via the menu. Using the latter it is therefore possible to attack, use the characteristic skills of each character, use objects, perform, after having loaded a special bar, powerful couple combos with an ally or order a supporting actor to defend Rorona by shielding her with the own body. For the execution of spells or special abilities, the consumption of Magic Points or Skill Points is not required, however absent, given that these actions directly consume the life bar of the character who performs them in relation to the power of the attack. Also by virtue of what has just been described, the battles, at least in the more advanced stages of the adventure, are far from simple, and it is therefore always advisable to pay attention to how you act, planning the best not only every move but also the supplies of objects to carry around, especially healing ones. Speaking instead of the crafting phases in detail, that is the system that allows the player to build certain objects starting from basic materials and ingredients, it appears a little more simplified than the previous chapters of Atelier. But that doesn't make it any less beautiful. It incorporates a ranking system for ingredients which determines their quality. The higher the latter, the more the chances of making the most of them and obtaining artifacts of a certain type increase. Each component then has its own characteristic labeled as aromatic or unpleasant (stinky) depending on the type. Opposing characteristics cancel each other out, while fusing items with similar or compatible characteristics strengthens the final product. Like an anime Considering the large number of items that can be recovered around the kingdom of Arland and their respective characteristics, the opportunity to create a large number of items is great. Provided of course that you have one of the recipe books necessary to obtain them, especially those containing the most advanced alchemical formulas, and a good level of Rorona's alchemy, given that the final success of some jobs also depends on her magical abilities. The artifacts obtained can be of various kinds and used personally in the equipment of the characters of the party or exchanged and sold with the inhabitants of Arland. Finally, to enrich the adventure there are over ten alternative endings, each of which is linked to the actions performed by the player and the objectives achieved, especially in relations with the community. Atelier Rorona: The Alchemist of Arland abandons the two-dimensional stylenal that characterized the previous incarnations in favor of a new three-dimensional graphics engine. From an aesthetic point of view, in fact, the game has an engine that makes cel shading its strong point: the anime-style character design is consequently enhanced by the latter. The characters are well characterized visually and boast fairly fluid animations, at least in relation to the cartoon style adopted, with very nice moves and lighting effects. The scenarios are also pleasant which, despite their simplicity, give a discreet overview. Furthermore, the avatars of the protagonists appear splendid during the numerous and amusing dialogues (the interaction with the other characters takes place through fixed screens) which give the sensation of having been painted by hand. Too bad only for some drop in framerate in certain situations. The soundtrack features a style reminiscent of Celtic music. Guitar solos and a certain repetitiveness of the melody in a well-defined rhythmic set, with their slow gait, give gamers the right magical atmosphere in every phase, especially during those of exploration. Among other things, the game offers a fairly wide range of musical themes. Good dubbing, available in both Japanese and English, with French and English subtitles.", "date": "2010-12-10", "grade": "7.0"}
