{"name": "Inspector Gadget: Advance Mission", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/inspector-gadget-advance-mission.html", "text": "Only Gadget can save the world.. The evil Doctor Claw has hatched yet another of his terrible plans to take over the world. He has planted a series of bombs in the most disparate parts of the world. To make his plan even more striking, he hid the bombs inside some important monuments, such as the Statue of Liberty in New York, Big Ben in London and others. The fate of the world is in the hands of Gadget, Penny (the blonde girl who is the real proponent of the inspector's successes) and the faithful dog Brain. Will the many and unpredictable gadgets be enough to foil this horrendous threat?? For the first time, the fate of the world will be in your hands! Penny and Brain to the rescue of the Inspector At the beginning of the game you will be asked to choose the character to use: Gadget, Penny and Brain are the choices available to you. This is an important step, given that each of the protagonists has their own peculiarities which could prove to be fundamental for passing the internship. Well on Gadget I think there is no need to dwell. An immensity of hyper-technological trinkets are its prerogative. Penny, on the other hand, is able to control robots while Brain has not only an excellent jump but also the ability to transform into a penguin (very funny transformation). The programmers have included the possibility of changing your character once you reach the middle of the level and in many cases making use of this possibility will be the only way to finish it. Let's see what emerges from the cape One of the aspects that contributed to the success of the saga was precisely the unpredictability of the add-ons that emerged from Gadget's mantle at each episode. We will find all this in the video game where from the beginning we will be equipped with an umbrella to ~fly~ and glide gently. During the game we will come into possession of a Gadgetcopter (a small customized helicopter), a spray that keeps enemies at bay and much, much more. This variety of vehicles is accompanied by a fair variety of locations. Our adventures will span four worlds and we will travel from one end of the globe to the other. China, Egypt, the United States are some of the places we must visit to be able to defuse the terrible bombs that threaten the world. Graphically, the title is of decent workmanship with well-characterized characters and settings, made with a good number of textures. Even the sound does its duty, adapting to the scenarios in which we find ourselves. Each of the four worlds has its own soundtrack. Unfortunately, as often happens, the programmers have rested on the laurels of the license obtained. The title has a repetitive game pattern based on defeating enemy robots, with absolute linearity in the story-line. Many purists will welcome this choice, but I personally believe that the implementation of some variants such as sub-games or small puzzles to solve would certainly have helped to increase the longevity and variety of this product. See you at the next episode Although there were all the premises for a great title, we are faced with yet another excellent official license that does not find support in an equally excellent game. Unfortunately another missed opportunity, even if in this case we were close to crossing the line that divides a discreet game from a big game. See you at the next episode Pros: Inspector Gadget is still Inspector Gadget decent graphics multiplayer option Cons: gameplay becomes repetitive in the long run Inspector Derrik? No thanks, I prefer the Gadget one Raise your hand how many of you have never heard of this name: Inspector Gadget! I see none. After hundreds and hundreds of appearances on television networks all over the world, after a film starring Mathew Broderick (however very mediocre) Inspector Gadget and his ramshackle company are ready to land for the second time on the Nintendo laptop. After a good debut on the Game Boy Color last year, the guys from Light and Shadow Productions have just released the second installment of this ~police~ saga giving it the subtitle Advance Mission.", "date": "2002-01-27", "grade": null}
