In fact, we are talking about a franchise that manages to sell millions of copies with each new release on PC and console, which has managed to renew itself over the years and which in its latest incarnations has introduced elements of great solidity such as the sandbox structure and dialogues, the latter capable of giving a further dose of humor to the brick-based cutscenes that we have come to know and who always know how to make us smile. There was no shortage of portable episodes and there were therefore all the conditions for a slap-up debut on the App Store, with the excellent LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes leading the way. However, TT Games immediately wanted to cover the category of free productions as well, and so here is LEGO Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles, a title that draws on the tradition of real-time strategy games to deliver us an experience that stands as a spin- off of the George Lucas film saga and which is closely linked to the playful contents on the official website, which can also be used for free and, for once, without even the presence of in-app purchases or limitations of any kind. All good, then? Not really, considering that the game immediately shows a clear lack of levels and scenarios, with only two settings immediately available (the planets Coruscant and Tatooine, with two more locations coming with the updates) for a total of fifteen stages if we consider both the possible alignments, namely ~light side~ and ~dark side~. However, the similarities between the ~good~ and ~bad~ missions are evident, a factor that adds to a general lack of depth and the excessive simplification of a trend accustomed to a very different substance. You can move if you touch The control system adopted by LEGO Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles, as mentioned above, refers to the tradition of real-time strategy, that is, it asks us to touch an area of the screen for our units to go there and, at the same way, to touch a possible target for them to open fire against it. In short, unlike the various video games in the LEGO series, we will not be able to enjoy direct control of a character and manage a team by switching from one component to another by pressing a button, nor resort to one of the elements that have always characterized the productions TT Games belonging to this franchise, or the possibility of building structures using bricks and thus solving environmental puzzles. In short, the approach is completely new, but far from effective. Firstly because the fixed view does not allow you to zoom on the play area, which substantially limits our movements, often forcing us to repeat the commands to move in a certain direction; secondly because the design of the levels is immediately basic, devoid of the minimum thickness, evidently designed for a target of very young users (who, however, own an iPhone or an iPad...). The missions do not include objectives that go beyond moving from one point to another on the map or eliminating a target, only allowing us to approach towers to select, based on the coins collected, the type of unit we want to use among soldiers on foot, armored vehicles and spaceships. In short, the experience is miserable, often devoid of any challenge and even rather short, but it must be recognized that in terms of technical realization, the product has been packaged as best it could not be and makes a fine display of fluid and discreetly animated graphics, with the typical design of the LEGO series and the inevitable cutscenes of great quality.", "date": "2013-05-08", "grade": "5.0"}
