{"name": "Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metro-exodus-enhanced-edition-recensione.html", "text": "The Metro saga has proved, since the first installation, one of the most demanding test benches for the hardware. The latest episode, Exodus (here the review of the PC version), is no exception: it was in fact one of the few titles to take advantage of the newborn GeForce RTX for ray tracing lighting. Almost two years later, 4A Games has returned to retrace the moscovite lands with the precise intention of making history: an objective achieved, as Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition is the first title to require, as a minimum requirement, a video card capable of support ray tracing. This drastically reduces the audience of players it is aimed at, considering costs and the scarce availability of Big Navi and Ampere chips; on the other hand, even the old 20 series of NVIDIA (Turing) can venture into this challenge which, as we will see in the review of Metro Exodus - Enhanced Edition, will be unlikely for most of the systems currently on the market. Too heavy an update As it was conceived, the Enhanced Edition is sold as a separate product, even if the owners of the original title will still be able to download the client for free: they will find both versions in the library, bearing in mind that in the latter it is not possible to deactivate the effects ray tracing. Metro Exodus used a version that we could define as ~embryonic~: in practice, the game was designed with traditional rasterization, to which individual lighting sources governed by the ray tracing technique were added later. The result, although effective, could not be defined as optimal due to the coexistence of the two working methods. In this edition the lights positioned artificially by the designers have been completely eliminated to make room for those calculated in real time by the GPU (hence the exclusion of older cards). This not only allowed the beams to intersect each other, giving greater realism and depth to the scene, but also led to a further interaction of the lights with the surfaces they radiate. For example, a sunlit yellow building 'bounces' its reflection off a window, giving the room a yellowish tint. Without going into too in-depth technical examinations, we can say that the graphic quality that the Enhanced Edition brings is truly phenomenal and represents a real taste of the next-generation. Although the optimization work has been considerable, such a graphic level pays off heavily in terms of absorption of hardware resources. Therefore, what you are reading, rather than a tout-court review, is an analysis on the performance impact of the graphic update: for this reason we used the useful integrated benchmark. Ray tracing only First let's start from the graphics settings menu, where of course the item relating to the API is missing, since the technologies used are only available with the latest version of DirectX. The section dedicated to NVIDIA RTX also disappears, which now leaves room for three levels of ray tracing: Normal, High and Ultra with a specific menu regarding reflections, which can be hybrid or ~raytraced~. The difference lies in the resolution in which the global illumination is rendered: in the highest, the native one at which the title is running is used; in the intermediate level the resolution is halved, while at the normal level the ratio drops to a quarter. Obviously this produces some ~noise~ which becomes more evident the lower the initial resolution; in 4K the differences, while appreciable even to the naked eye, can be more tolerated during the excitement of in-game sessions. Needless to say, these are the options that weigh the most on the frame per second counter. By setting the native resolution of the monitor used for the tests (an excellent LG 27GN950), i.e. 4K, and setting all values to the maximum, our reference system scored a score of 23 frames per second. We gained 3 frames by setting the ~hybrid~ reflections: an increase that is more appreciable in the ideal benchmark situation than in game sessions, as this option mainly concerns the reflections that affect bodies of water. A more concrete performance ~bump~ is obtained with the second level of ray tracing, High instead of Ultra: in this case the fps rise to 35. We reach the limits of the acceptable with the lowest level (Normal), where we finally reach the 40fps. Technologies that help To relieve the work of the GPU, the developers have implemented three algorithms: the pMost important is undoubtedly the DLSS, owned by NVIDIA, which was already present in the first release but which has been updated to version 2.1 with excellent results both from the point of view of performance and, above all, from that of image quality, the whose loss of definition is decidedly less marked than in the first and rudimentary iteration. The new release has allowed, in the worst case, an identical execution speed (with the same video card) compared to the original Metro Exodus, but in some scenarios even increases in the frame rate can be recorded, despite the greater quantity of sources of light to be managed in real time. Then there is the VRS, acronym for Variable Rate Shading, always initially introduced by NVIDIA with the Turing GPU and subsequently implemented by Microsoft in its API. It is a similar technique which, in a nutshell, allows the computational power to be concentrated where the eyes ~fall~, leaving the peripheral areas of the screen slightly less defined. In Metro Exodus the VRS grids can be more or less wide (4X or 2X); also in this case it can be said that the loss of image quality is hardly noticeable in in-game sessions, but its contribution to the cause of performance is absolutely marginal, given that it allows you to gain just under one frame per second (it concerns only transparency). native. Unfortunately, the integrated benchmark does not allow you to act on this algorithm (which therefore remains disabled), but from internal tests we have been able to appreciate a discreet performance increase in the face of an acceptable definition loss with a value of 0.7. AMD Fidelity FX Support for FidelityFX Super Resolution technology (AMD's answer to DLSS) not only will not be contemplated at the time of release, but not even in the future as the programmers argue that it is not compatible with their engine. After all, NVIDIA has historically used the 4A Games franchise as a ~showcase~ for proprietary technologies (just think that Metro Exodus is the only game, in the last four years, to use GPU acceleration for the PhysX engine), for which the ostracism of Lisa Su's company is quite understandable. Minimum and recommended requirements Let's now move on to examining the minimum requirements, the table of which shows configurations that may cause some perplexity. According to the programmers, an RTX 2070 is required to be able to play at 60fps in FullHD; for 2K you have to switch to an RTX 2080 or a Radeon 6800 XT (protagonist of our test); for 4K at 30 frames per second you need an RTX 3080 or a 6900 XT, while to enjoy all the technical marvels at 60 frames you must necessarily have the very expensive RTX 3090. These indications confirm Big Navi's difficulties with Ray Tracing technology: in principle, AMD video cards pay a heavy duty in direct comparison with NVIDIA ones, given that in 2K the GeForce RTX 3080 obtains an average performance 25% higher than the Radeon RX 6800 XT. Our PowerColor Red Devil, at 2560x1440, recorded a score of 71 fps, while the NVIDIA reference easily settles over 82. However, some doubts remain in the comparison between the two top of the green range. In fact, we know that the performance delta between the 3080 and the 3090 is on average about ten percentage points, so it is not explained how the latter, according to the table published by the developers, can guarantee a double frame rate compared to its younger sister: unfortunately , we have not been able to field test the two Amps.", "date": "2021-05-06", "grade": "8.0"}
