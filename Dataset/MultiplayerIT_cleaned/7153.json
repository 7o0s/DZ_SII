Tolkien, The Hobbit, suddenly changed its title. It will no longer be called Round trip as originally announced, but The battle of the five armies: a high-sounding title that will certainly attract much more attention in the name of the god of money. It is the umpteenth choice that has made Tolkenian purists turn up their noses, after the decision to transform a more or less short story into three films of three hours each and to add a female figure absent from the original story to appeal to an audience more varied. And neither are these the problems of the two excellent films by Peter Jackson who, ten years later, has returned to materialize Middle-earth in our cinemas as only he can do: between slow pace and questionable editing, A Journey unexpected and The Desolation of Smaug we liked, but with some reservations. We could say the exact same thing about LEGO The Hobbit, which seems to be faithful to the source in all its strengths and weaknesses. LEGO The Hobbit is a good title but it suffers from the same pacing drops as the films it is inspired by A slightly discounted trip The fact that LEGO The Hobbit has been released now, at the turn of the success of the second film, is probably the cause of all the problems with the game: the development seems to have been hasty and uninspired, the title itself is actually incomplete. The Desolation of Smaug has just been released on DVD and Blu-ray and we'll have to wait until next December to find out how it will end - unless you've already read The Hobbit, of course, and if you haven't, try to fix it - but the same goes for the TT Games tie-in which, to avoid previews of the sequel, ends exactly like the film, with Smaug flying to Lake-town. ~What have we done?~ Bilbo wonders in the last scene of the film and the game: well, we played through sixteen levels full of bricks, eight per film, destroying and building everything while overcoming environmental puzzles and fighting enemies and bosses. In short, any ~LEGO game~ in short, because LEGO The Hobbit does not deviate from the formula to which TT Games has accustomed us, except for some innovations on which we will focus shortly. LEGO The Hobbit, on the other hand, is a faithful adaptation of the film that employs the same ruse as LEGO The Lord of the Rings: the ironic cutscenes are accompanied by the original voice acting of the film (subtitled in Italian, of course) and the superlative soundtrack by Howard Shore. They basically serve to tie the various levels and to condense the story, but we found them less amusing and original than those admired in LEGO The Lord of the Rings mainly due to a not exactly optimal timing and originality of the gags. The characters, however, are all there, as well as the most significant locations of the two films in which the stages are set: from Bilbo's house in Rivendell, passing through the Misty Mountains and Moria up to Lake-Ponte and, of course, Smaug's lair . Just like in LEGO The Lord of the Rings there is a miniaturized version of Middle-earth to explore freely between levels and to focus on once the story levels have been completed: as per tradition, at that point it is possible to control all minifigs unlocked to find every hidden treasure, object and secret, enabling additional characters and using their unique abilities to reach otherwise inaccessible points. The technical framework is more than satisfactory and further confirms what has already been suggested by the latest multiplatform LEGO games: TT Games seems to be at ease on next-gen consoles, definitely the best and most stable versions among those proposed. The next-gen game graphically has very little, mind you, but the frame rate is much more stable and the amount of details and elements on the screen appear impressive from time to time. Thumbs up, in short, and from this point of view LEGO The Hobbit really seems to be a tasty appetizer of what we will see in the years to come. Playstation 4 trophies Also this time it won't be very difficult to unlock the forty Trophies of the game: twenty-seven bronze, eight silver, four gold and platinum. It will just take a lot of patience, because for example you will have to complete the story, of course, and collect all the minifigs and millions of bricks. To be concluded It was a risky strategy by Warner Bros. Interactive to release so far in advance of the end of the film trilogy, offering only the tie-ins of the first two films, but then the trick was discovered: the levels of The battle of five armies will comeyear to the end of the year, in conjunction with the filmic conclusion, in the form of DLC. Whether it will be free or paid is not yet clear, but we doubt those eight new levels are a Christmas present for players. After all, LEGO The Hobbit isn't exactly a content-poor title, even if it turned out to be one of the shortest LEGO games. If anything, the problem lies in the dead times that punctuate the game sessions and in the roster of minifigs that are not exactly interesting. Starting from the second problem, LEGO The Hobbit offers a good number of memorable clothes to wear, but there are many more simple extras or characters borrowed from the rest of the Tolkenian saga if not recycled from LEGO The Lord of the Rings. Even the abilities shared by the various minifigs are decidedly less than the super powers seen in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, for example, but we particularly liked some environmental puzzles for their originality, even if some turned out to be less clear than usual, forcing us to change characters a little at random in search of the right one. The company of dwarves alone offers quite a variety in terms of skills, including Bombur who ~transforms~ into a trampoline, Dwalin who can fix objects with hammers and so on. To spice up the gameplay, however, TT Games has not limited itself to implementing ~combined attacks~ inspired by the scenes of the film or a whole series of quests scattered around the huge hub that is Middle-earth, but also a sort of crafting system which, on balance, turned out to be the worst feature in the game. In practice, in addition to the canonical ~studs~ materials and precious stones will now be collected which can be consumed to build objects to equip or use to complete missions or unlock new paths. Sometimes it will be mandatory to devote yourself to crafting to continue in the main quest, and not infrequently we have found ourselves short of raw materials and therefore having to travel far and wide to collect them or exchange them with some NPCs. As interesting as this mechanic is, it causes quite annoying drops in pace that already interrupt the not particularly frenetic one of the various levels. Definitely something we could do without in the next LEGO games, if not revised and corrected to perfection.", "date": "2014-04-29", "grade": "7.0"}
