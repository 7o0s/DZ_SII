Benza Race -Toilet Shooting Star- had to be written on toilet paper, we know, but for love of you we raped ourselves and used a trivial word processing program. Describing the title from Japanese indie house Da-Soft is as easy as pulling the chain after going to the bathroom: it's a racing game in which the competitors don't drive cars, motorcycles or any other conventional vehicle you can think of, but cups of the toilet, on which they continue to relieve themselves with impunity . Realization If the premise of Gekisou! Benza Race -Toilet Shooting Star- seems particularly silly to you, it's because you don't love all that vein of satirical or parodic video games that have somehow accompanied the evolution of the videogame medium throughout its history and that have always acted as a counterpoint to the most series and set. Without making it too long, let's say that over the years the industry has crystallized on large late-adolescent productions, relegating these titles to the independent scene, the only one to still produce them (take Goat Simulator or DLC Quest for example). Unfortunately Gekisou! Benza Race -Toilet Shooting Star- fails at anything it sets out to ultimately result in just a complete disaster. Honestly, we started with all the best intentions before trying it, because the subject seemed nice to us, because it comes from Japan and because sometimes there is also a need for a little lightness in what you play, but the truth is that there 'is very little to save. The problem is essentially one: it was created in a hurry and is incomplete and poorly finished in all its parts, starting with the main menu which seems to have been created by the brother of a graphic designer who is a baker. The game structure is very simple: you start with a single driver and a single circuit and to unlock the others you need to accumulate points, which are obtained by winning races. There is no career mode and there is no such thing as a campaign. In reality there is nothing at all: all you can do is select a circuit, a driver and go. Gameplay Entered into the game what smelled rotten becomes simply mephitic. Gekisou! Benza Race -Toilet Shooting Star- is unplayable, mainly due to a physics engine calibrated by someone who must have first drunk a dozen flasks of wine. Moreover, it clashes with the design of the circuits which in many cases require a very precise control system to be addressed in a sensible way. Basically, the toilets struggle to go straight and suffer every stress in a devastating way, flying practically everywhere and making the poor player lose control and sense of orientation, already tried by having suffered everything else. The only lifeline, if we want to call it that, is represented by the bad artificial intelligence of the opposing pilots, who regularly end up stuck in some piece of scenery, slowing down enormously. Thus, from jolt to jolt, it is also possible to finish first, often without having understood how. Faced with such a massacre, everything else takes a back seat, starting from some elements that on paper could also be interesting, such as the special powers of the pilots, capable for example of throwing rolls of toilet paper or using the toilet as a turbo , or like the bonuses scattered on the tracks, which closely resemble Mario Karts (just the idea, mind you). To understand the level of refinement of Da-Soft's title, it is enough to mention the fact that some pilots occupy such a large area of the screen that they are impossible to use because they do not allow you to understand where you are going. Changing shot is useless, because the only one that can really be used to play is the one showing the runners from behind. In short, unlocking some content, already few of them, is simply a waste of time. The same goes for some circuits, where playing is basically a pain. Who will have thought of filling them with precision passages such as bottlenecks or hairpin bends? Probably the same one who filled the circuits with practically unreachable hidden bonuses, which will then be the same one who horribly animated the runners, who always remain straight like stockfish, limiting themselves to bending over to change direction. What else is there to say? Did we tell you that you can unlock everything that can be unlocked within an hour? Which in case it would be one of the worst hours of your life did we tell you? Did we tell you that the graphics are worthy of Rebel Youth? Did we tell you that you don't have to buy it?", "date": "2019-09-04", "grade": "2.0"}
