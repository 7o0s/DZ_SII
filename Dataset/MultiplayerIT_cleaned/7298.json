It tells the adventures of Finn the adventurer, a twelve-year-old boy with great vitality and a strong moral sense, and Jake the dog, his best friend, who has the ability to change his body by transforming himself, shrinking and enlarging himself to 'occurrence. Together, the two live in each episode of the heroic ~swashbuckling~ adventures in the land of Ooo, a world which, according to some clues scattered here and there, should be the Earth a thousand years after a nuclear holocaust, populated by unlikely characters such as Princess Bubblegum and the Ice King, the bad guy of the situation. The series has achieved a bit in all the countries where it is broadcast a great success not only among the pre-adolescent audience to which it would tend to be aimed, but also among lower and higher age groups, due to its original graphic style, the humor sometimes hilarious, sometimes subtle, and, let us add to get to the topic that is close to our heart, for the inspiration clearly identifiable in paper RPGs and video games. The transition to consoles was therefore absolutely natural: Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!!, released in the USA at the end of 2012 for both Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS, is actually the first of the two games dedicated to the series, although it arrives in Europe after Adventure Time: Explore the dungeons because. .. BUT WHAT DO I KNOW!, which was instead designed for home consoles, and which did not receive much critical acclaim. The Cartoon Network animated series at the new videogame test: is it adventure time? Hey Ganondorf! Just watch one episode of the series to realize that the author, Pendleton Ward, grew up on bread and video games in the 80s/90s, as he himself has repeatedly stated. It is therefore no coincidence that the more direct playful reference of Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!! both the most representative video game of the fantasy genre, The Legend of Zelda, and in particular the second episode on the NES, The Adventure of Link. Just like in Miyamoto's controversial offspring, the WayForward title features two different gameplays, an exploratory top-down view as you move through the land of Ooo which then becomes a classic side-scrolling action/platformer every time you enter a dungeon, a city, or in any case in a point of interest on the game map. And, again as in Zelda II, the game world or at least a part of it is freely explorable from the beginning, only to be faced with obstacles or closed doors that must necessarily be overcome by acquiring a new skill or a new object. Even if the various ~levels~ can theoretically be tackled in any sequence, however, in reality there are events preparatory to others, and only by identifying the right sequence can one actually proceed; in the perfect spirit of the adventures of a few years ago this ~pretend non-linear~ structure can only be understood after having collected some information from the non-player characters, often in the form of humorous stories and puzzles, while there are no tutorials or Navi assistants that they guide you. The return to a formula from the past and frankly much more stimulating (although we never reach extreme points of complexity) than today's highly guided counterparts can only please us, but good news also comes from the front of the action phases. Finn, with Jake in his Banjo-Kazooie backpack, moves nimbly through levels that are never too long (which mitigates the fact of having to repeat them several times due to the ever-present backtracking) and which won't be level design masterpieces but which don't even have particular shortcomings. The many funny and strange enemies present can be faced by Finn with his bare hands or, from a certain point on, with his sword, as well as thanks to an ability of Jake useful for greater distances and, finally, with the help of various objects. Here, however, the painful notes begin: the inventory is in fact entrusted to BMO, the video game console with which the two enjoy themselves in their free time (very similar to an old Game Boy to reiterate once again the bond of the Adventure Time universe with the world video game) which, managed on the lower screen, also allows you to view the map, options and statistics (opportunely improveable at certain points of the journey as in an RPG). Well, the obtainable objects are numerous and abundant, ranging from the classic foods that restore energy, to condiments which, applied to them, give greater restorative strength.stituent (or minor, given that nobody has ever liked jam on the hamburger until proven otherwise) up to the power-ups that grant higher than normal capacities for a limited period of time. However, all this must be managed with the stylus, with the very large inventory divided into decidedly small boxes: drag one object over another to combine them, double click to use it and so on. A rather cumbersome mechanism that inevitably breaks the fast and fresh rhythm of the action; it does not make up for the other possible control, with the back buttons, which perhaps does not force you to take the nib every two by three but proves to be equally not very agile. The 3D effect Since this is a game (you'll forgive us if we don't write the very long title for the umpteenth time) originally also intended for the predecessor of Nintendo 3DS, the stereoscopic effect is the classic ~afterthought~ put there just because the console allows it. Basically it is the even more incisive rendering of the legendary parallax levels that 16-bit console owners were so pleased to show off: no influence on the gameplay (and how could it have any?), but basically it is a nice thing done well, so why deprive yourself of it? It's not an Ooo for old men We were talking about the characteristics of the cartoon: adventure, fairy tale, humour, graphic style. All of this is captured perfectly in the game, written with the collaboration of the author. Suffice it to say that the premise of the whole, also recognizable in the long title, is the Ice King who shows up at Finn and Jake's house one fine morning and takes away their garbage. It might seem like a kindness, and as such the cold enemy lets it pass, unfortunately, however, for subsequent collections the containers are indispensable to ours, who thus set off in pursuit of the King. From then on it will be all about meeting unlikely human characters and not, some taken from the series and others created ad hoc, and solve a whole series of problems ranging from demented to pure nonsense, resulting in a lot of laughs. Even the graphics, totally in 2D, incorporate all the assets of the television series: the style may not appeal to everyone, but the quality from this point of view is undoubted, with a good profusion of colors and various and rich settings, a certain cleanliness and above all very numerous, fluid and fun animations. Perhaps even better is the soundtrack, from the fully sung intro (which will not fail to be imprinted in your brain) to the quality music both in terms of composition and technique, although you don't waste too much with the spoken word. So why only enough? What a Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!! is a game that, among all the age groups to which the cartoon is dedicated, chooses the lowest, it is a fact: the title certainly would also like to appeal to those who have played the adventure games of the past decades, but its not high complexity, the difficulty curve calibrated well but which goes only from easy to ~slightly less easy~ and the duration which does not exceed five-six hours are all characteristics aimed at capturing an audience, let's say from elementary school or not more. A sort of ~my first adventure~, in short, and it's not that this is a bad thing in itself, quite the contrary. But two collateral facts to this choice must necessarily be pointed out and cannot be treated leniently. The first actually concerns not the game itself but the grip it can have here: Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!! in fact it remained totally in English. And it's not a clean, linear, scholastic English that some university students already have problems understanding, let alone children. On the contrary, it is very youthful English, full of slang, neologisms, grammatical errors, also in respect of the cartoon, and it is above all necessary to move forward correctly given that, as we said, understand the exact path to take between explorability free and backtracking is only possible by reading, and sometimes interpreting, the words of the characters. The other (very) weak point is, merely, the price. Such a short duration can sometimes be a right choice, a low or zero boost to replayability is a defect of all representatives of the genre, but Adventure Time, released by us only on the eShop (in America there is also the boxed version ), costs the beauty of 40 Euros. On 3DS, whether digital or retail, there are dozens and dozens of titles that are much richer in content and require only a small fraction of the cost of the new WayForward: why, we wonder, bring a game, albeit a very short one, to us with so long delay, choose the eShop route to limit costs and risks and then offer it at the price of the biggest console productions?", "date": "2014-02-21", "grade": "6.0"}
