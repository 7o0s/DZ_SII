{"name": "2008 Euro Cup", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/2008-euro-cup.html", "text": "There are some good football games for mobile, but still none even come close to the titles available for the console and PC market. This is because it is a type of application that is difficult to render well on a phone screen and is even more difficult to make playable using joysticks or numeric pads that are often too stiff and uncomfortable to allow certain movements to be performed. This last problem is particularly felt when using a three-quarter view, which forces us to call into question the diagonals in order to be able to proceed straight with a player towards the goal, with the ball at his feet. For the realization of 2008 Euro Cup, the developers of the Mobility Zone team used the same structure as their previous football title. Well, to be honest, the two games are very, very similar: the new one, more than anything else, boasts better graphics as regards the interface, but the substantial differences end there. After selecting the type of game, we will be able to choose the national team to lead and define its scheme among those available, without going into the details of the formation. Then we'll move on to action: a commentator will describe the salient stages of the action through textual interventions, while we'll be busy conquering the ball and reaching the conclusion whenever possible. We will have a special command available to perform dribbling (otherwise impossible...), we will be able to pass the ball to any teammate indicated by an arrow on the screen and, once near the opponent's goal, a directional bar will appear which will determine the angle of the shot. Players don't respond very quickly to commands, there's always a few moments of hesitation so you have to take this into account when organizing an action. Unfortunately the team's artificial intelligence has its ups and downs, and especially in the defensive phases it leaves much to be desired, leaving ample room for maneuver for the opponents who often find only the goalkeeper standing between them and the goal. The graphics of the game, as already mentioned, use an isometric view and are characterized by a good level of detail as well as a good use of colors. Unfortunately, the players are all identical to each other and have just enough animation, probably not to slow down too much an action that is far from fast and fluid anyway. The sound sector tries to do its job in an even exuberant way, with some sampled effects of great effect but which are rarely called into question. As far as the control system is concerned, it can be safely said that the type of telephone is decisive for transforming the gaming experience into something fun or absolutely cumbersome and frustrating. The inputs are not instantly received by the players, but you get used to it quickly enough and after a few games you can score without too many problems. PRO A large number of nationals Functional graphics to the action Effective sound effects AGAINST Terribly cumbersome Much improved AI The isometric view can be a problem", "date": "2007-12-18", "grade": "S.V."}
