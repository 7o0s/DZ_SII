{"name": "Killing Floor: Incursion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/199815-killing-floor-incursion-la-recensione-di-killing-floor-incursion.html", "text": "Having originated as a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004 way back in 2005, the very first Killing Floor achieved a level of success its creators perhaps didn't even expect. The Tripwire Interactive guys were thus prompted to develop a separate version, which arrived in 2009. For the second chapter of the series, Zed fans (as the Killing Floor zombie-likes are called) had to wait a few years, to see it arrive in 2016 not only on PC, but also on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. After having crossed over into the console universe, it's now time for the Georgian team to try to enter another world: that of virtual reality. Thus Killing Floor: Incursion arrived on the market, a title dedicated only to VR technology that is actually already available for PC since the end of 2017, but has only recently been made available to the most abundant slice of the market thanks to PlayStation VR. With a helmet on his head and a pair of PlayStation Moves in his hands, we have therefore seen what Tripwire Interactive has in store for us this time. Am I dreaming or am I awake? Killing Floor: Incursion puts us in the role of a member of the Horzine Security Force, who is in charge of dealing with the Zeds in the real world. Seriously injured during a clash with some creatures, our protagonist finds himself stationary in the pits to receive the necessary treatment, but in order not to make him lose training, his employers decide to drop him into a simulation. In the latter, of course, the aim is to continue killing Zed, to try to find out what lies behind the existence of these terrible monsters. If you haven't played the two previous chapters, don't worry too much, because the plot is just an excuse to slap the zombies that appear in front of you, crossing the handful of levels (for more or less as many hours of gameplay) that make up the campaign mode of Killing Floor: Incursion. Embracing the philosophy of those who take virtual reality in small doses, the aforementioned levels can be played (and replayed) separately, proposing quite similar game dynamics without however ever resulting in repetitiveness and boredom. While not exactly a shooter on rails, Killing Floor: Incursion is quite linear, like other similar titles intended for virtual reality: the first comparison that came to mind is the one with Arizona Sunshine, with respect to which Tripwire's effort Interactive presents itself in a slightly darker way, retaining a level of humor within it that does not touch the peaks of those of the Vertigo Games game. So don't expect the tension of Resident Evil 7, even if having a viewer on your head helps to enter the part by feeling in danger in the first person, forgetting the simulation in which the protagonist is instead. Thus we find ourselves facing hordes of zombies, alternating these main phases with others that require you to stop and explore the surrounding environment to move forward, making use of the torch you have supplied. There is no shortage of encounters with boss creatures. Killing Floor: Incursion also offers a second mode, called Holdout, in which to potentially face infinite hordes of Zeds with increasing difficulty, to see how far you are capable of going. Both modes can be played together with a friend, thanks to built-in online co-op support from Tripwire Interactive. Playstation 4 trophies Killing Floor: Incursion comes with thirty Trophies. Together with the usual Platinum, obtainable after unlocking all the others, we find three of the Gold type, seven Silver and nineteen Bronze. To get them all it is necessary to juggle the two modes of the game, obtaining up to ten thousand points in Holdout and completing the campaign on a difficult level. It is then necessary to complete the latter both alone and in co-op, as well as performing some particular actions such as killing a zombie by hitting it on the head with a knife thrown from a distance. Heads fly Despite being a shooter, Killing Floor: Incursion is playable only through the pair of PlayStation Move, therefore without support for the Aim Controller. A choice undoubtedly linked to the dynamics of this title, oriented towards the possibility of holding weapons with one hand (with some exceptions) but above all towards close combat. In fact, the player can use anything Killing Floor: Incursion allows him to pick up to play them to the Zeds for good reason, including parts of their bodies detached with ax blows. When everything seems to go wrong, Zed's arm can prove to be a terrible weapon against creatures, with which the melee confrontationrpo is very frequent. For the rest we find a good variety of weapons of all kinds, from knives that can also be thrown to the aforementioned axe, up to pistols and rifles (including the precision one, to which a small part of the campaign is dedicated). The various weapons are placed at our sides or behind our backs, depending on their type: to extract them it is necessary to mimic the movement with the two PlayStation Moves, repeating the same thing also to put them back in their place. It's not an easy control system, that of Killing Floor: Incursion, and in fact requires you to go through a long tutorial as well as some additional practice before being properly tamed. Fortunately, the developers have thought of rematerializing the objects on the player, should he unfortunately drop a weapon in an attempt to put it back. The movement mode chosen by Tripwire Interactive is teleportation, with one limitation: to prevent the player from constantly running away from the Zeds, a sort of recharge time has been introduced, which prevents the player from positioning himself too far from the current position after already made a move. The more you go around therefore, the less you can move immediately. As is now the standard of virtual reality games, the movement occurs jerkily with the pressure of the cross and circle keys of the controller. If you wish, you can still replace everything with fluid movement, taking into account your possible predisposition to motion sickness. On a graphic level, Killing Floor: Incursion looks quite good, now taking for granted all the considerations on what this can mean in the field of virtual reality: the gloomy environments undoubtedly play in favor of Tripwire Interactive, which still deserves the credit for having characterized his creatures well enough so that they cause us the right disgust when we find them within a palm of our nose.", "date": "2018-05-26", "grade": "8.0"}
