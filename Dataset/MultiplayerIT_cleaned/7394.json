Rusty's uncle, the robot protagonist of SteamWorld Dig, worked in the mines of a small western town, Tumbleton. Unfortunately one fine day the poor fellow got lost in the subsoil from which he never came back, ruining the city (well, six to three inhabitants is quite a demographic collapse). Now it's up to Rusty to pick up the pickaxe, enter the mine and, after discovering the sad fate of his uncle, try to restore prestige to the town by collecting valuable minerals. Initially Rusty can only make short leaps and dig the most fragile ground. The tutorial explains its basic movements and where to take the harvest to turn it into hard dollars (to spend on various extras). Going deeper into the mine, you will discover many interesting power-ups that will greatly increase the robot's freedom of action. Usually to collect one you need to enter caves where strange highly technological machinery is hidden, capable of grafting new powers under Rusty's fur. Later in the adventure we will discover why the mines are full of alien technology, but we certainly don't want to spoil the pleasure of discovering the little twists that underpin the thin plot. What matters is that after the first rather slow minutes, SteamWorld Dig becomes one of the most engaging experiences of recent months, capable of making an activity that for some might seem the exact opposite hilarious: digging. Don't worry, we are not dealing with yet another Minecraft clone. Image&Form, the developer, has seen fit to create something very different, more immediate and not at all related to the title of Mojang, if not for some inevitable references, given the theme (just to say, Notch publicly praised SteamWorld Dig, without complaining on the alleged resemblance to Minecraft pointed out by those who, evidently, have never played it). If there's one thing the last few years have taught us, it's that digging can be a lot of fun What's new in the PC version Speaking of content, the PC version of SteamWorld Dig is virtually identical to the Nintendo 3DS version. The only notable differences are the higher resolution which, together with some embellishments in the effects and some more animation, makes the visual aspect more pleasant, and the obvious lack of the 3D effect, which however was not exploited extensively. As an extra we can mention the inclusion of some Steam features, such as achievements and trading cards, and a Half-Life ... 3 cameo of which we will not reveal anything, but otherwise there is nothing relevant to report, as they always say in these cases. Advanced gameplay SteamWorld Dig offers perfect progression. The slow start is quickly forgotten, especially when you find yourself hopping from side to side of the mine to collect ore, while dodging rocks, similar to what happened in Boulder Dash, eliminating or evading enemies and looking for passages secrets that lead to the richest loots. In a short time Rusty gets an auger, which allows you to crush the most resistant rocks, dynamite, good for clearing the way when you get stuck, teleporters, which can be used to quickly return to the surface and much more. Among the advanced powers, an energy punch stands out which can be used to destroy distant blocks, and a double jump which allows you to reach the highest areas and which will give access to the final part of the adventure. And the dangers? In addition to the aforementioned monsters, which consume the energy bar, and various rocks, which kill on the spot, Rusty will have to pay attention to falls that are too high, at least until the end of the second section of the mine, where there are special shock absorbers, and to certain traps, such as poison pools or laser turrets. Furthermore, our hero must keep an eye on the water consumption, which is used to power the drill, the energy punch and a super jump (not the double jump we were talking about earlier), and on the charge of the lamp which, in if it runs out, it will throw the scenario into absolute darkness and will not allow you to distinguish rocks with minerals from simple ones. To recharge the lamp you have to go back to the village, or collect the appropriate icons left by dead enemies, while for water you have to look for the pools scattered in the mine, or collect other icons.", "date": "2013-12-19", "grade": "8.8"}
