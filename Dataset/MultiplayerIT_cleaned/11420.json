{"name": "The Sims Biliardo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-biliardo.html", "text": "It really seems that mobile game developers have understood that the world of mobile gaming is changing, not only on a technical level but also and above all on a conceptual level. The idea that only ~simple~ products should be made, which allow us to spend a few minutes in joy, is slowly giving way to something different. There is a need for titles that are certainly immediate and entertaining, but which also offer a bit of substance. In the specific case of The Sims Billiards, for example, this philosophy has been clearly adopted: there is no simple game of billiards, there is no limit to playing. Far from it: you create a character, enter the room, take care of your reputation and during the games all this has a natural practical application. Once our Sim has been created (starting from a series of predefined models that can be customized in colors), we are presented with a popularity bar that we will have to grow not only by winning games, but also by demonstrating our value in front of a higher level opponent. By playing you get better, by winning games the level of popularity increases and the challenges and characters available also increase, through a process that gives this new EA mobile product a surprising depth. The standard pool game can be played in three ways, according to the ~US 8 ball~, ~UK 8 ball~ or ~US 9 ball~ rules. The first move will always be up to us, we will have to ~break~ by trying to pocket a few balls already, then determining whether we will have to pocket the solid colored ones or the striped ones. The control of the cue is very complete, but at the same time intuitive and immediate: we will be able to control its direction using the joystick, then press the 5 key when we are ready, first of all to give a possible spin to the shot, secondly to calibrate the power (stopping the 'indicator at the right time). The game takes us by hand, in fact graphically not only the trajectory of the ~cue ball~ is represented, but also the one that will be followed by the ball we hit. We soon realize that such simplicity in shooting is compensated for by the strength and cunning of the opponents, who prove to be truly threatening from the very first game: woe to granting him an advantage, because they will take advantage of it without causing any problems. In addition to the normal games, in which you face other Sims to gain popularity in the room, you can try your hand at a multiplayer mode for multiple players (all using the same mobile phone, unfortunately) or face a large series of rather complex skill tests. The game is available in both a 3D and a 2D version, and it is on the latter that our test is based. The EA Mobile graphics have done an excellent job, with the usual slightly stereotyped but very well-characterized characters, the result of digitized photos, surrounded by sparse but well-designed settings, with an excellent use of colours. Otherwise, table and balls are convincing in appearance, movement and scrolling. The general idea is of ~agile~ graphics, very accurate and well optimized, accompanied by a series of fairly good quality MIDI music which, however, too often leaves the player at the mercy of absolute silence. There is little to say about the control system: it is absolutely precise, responds to input promptly and allows us to control everything with just the joystick and a button. PRO Different modes, different characters Precise and well thought out control system Good technical realization AGAINST Sound bare Difficulty level not very optimized A real ~story mode~ is missing", "date": "2008-05-14", "grade": "S.V."}
