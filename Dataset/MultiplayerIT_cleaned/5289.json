{"name": "Victoria 3: la recensione del simulatore socioeconomico di Paradox Interactive", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/victoria-3-recensione.html", "text": "Paradox strategies are like this: they put you in front of a slice of human history and you have to ride it to the end, trying not to be unseated by events that you can only partially try to dominate. The Victoria series specializes in managing a nation's economy, as well as its profound social implications; here you will be given the keys to a country of your choice that you will have to lead for an entire century starting from 1836. It is a complex game, but it is not as difficult as it might seem: as you will discover by reading the Victoria 3 review, Paradox has everything is done to streamline the menus and make them readable even by novices, however the game systems are so closely interconnected that it will be a while before we understand how profound the ramifications of each choice will be, and how these will affect the future of the nation. Economy for the masses Victoria 3: A piece of Sweden straight from 1876 Our first game was against Chile, one of the Nations with which Victoria 3 recommends starting and on which it is possible to activate the tutorial. If that of Crusader Kings 3 was the best Paradox tutorial up to now, that of Victoria 3 easily surpasses it by proposing a series of tasks that, from time to time, will help us climb among the countless functions included. Some of these tasks will be present from the beginning and others will be added when we have consciously or otherwise activated special events, or built buildings that will allow access to new mechanics that have remained on the sidelines until then. Provided you have a minimum of familiarity with the genre and the software house in question, one or two games will be enough to have a clear enough nature of this game and its basic functioning. It will take some time to understand all the mechanisms, but what's the hurry? Each mission of the tutorial can be selected from the journal, where we will also find different dynamic objectives that we can pursue, trying to respect all the requests, and activate them thus benefiting from interesting and varied bonuses. The Chile of 1836 is a poor country, dominated with an iron fist by the fascist caudillos and yet with excellent growth prospects. Totally different to start a game with the prosperous and enlightened Sweden, our second choice and another of the nations with which the game recommends gaining experience. Sweden in the Victorian century was regimented by a secular monarchy, made strong by abundant natural resources, and positioned at the center of important trade routes that kept it safe from the most imprudent invasions. The state in which we will find a nation at the beginning of the game partially decrees its difficulty, but wrong choices can still drag the most enlightened country into a socialist hell, while the most prudent ones can transform the worst of totalitarian regimes into a civil rights paradise . Social metamorphoses Victoria 3: it's not a Paradox thing, but certain missions proposed in the journal would have deserved more pompous celebrations than a simple summary window How you do it depends on you and on various internal and external factors of the chosen country. Consider that this game, like most of the Paradox strategy games, you don't expect a real victory: it is possible to achieve very important objectives, like Sweden we could for example unify the whole of Scandinavia, but the predominant part of the game is the path that we will do organically along the hundred years simulated in Victoria 3. You can easily set yourself a precise goal: to transform England into a crazy but efficient autarky or, as in reality, to make Sweden the largest exporter of low-cost furniture in the world. No one will then forbid you to simply aspire to the military conquest of any nation that will oppose your hunger for raw materials. The funniest and most challenging aspect is just trying to turn the empire under our commands in the desired direction... Money and problems Victoria 3: Don't know what to do? the game will offer you different nations for each type of game you have in mind The most important part of Victoria 3 is the one that regulates the economy. If the money doesn't flow, the people die of hunger; if they turn around, other problems will inevitably emerge from the new social classes that will be formed. If you build a predominantly agrarian economy, the landlords will become increasingly politically powerful and will come into sharp opposition to the even more numerous working class; the former will naturally ask for laws that benefit their business and that come closer to their vision of society. Forget about passingmake a law for gender equality, if you have only illiterate peasants whose women can do nothing but look after the house and raise children like rabbits. Be careful, however, to look too far ahead and ahead of time: even the choice that may seem more right to you could have negative implications. Allowing women to work can lead to a sharp drop in the birth rate, opening the doors to the voting booths for them at the wrong time could instead lead to dangerous political instability. You can also decide to change the division of powers between church and state, debate child labour, welfare, public and private education and much more. School and work Victoria 3: make sure that basic necessities can be purchased by even the poorest, or the squares will soon explode In Victoria 3, the player has several tools to subdivide the population according to needs: he can diversify his industries, or use technical advances to adopt new production systems that will increase the demand for new and better paid specialists, decreasing that of less skilled workers . The more schooling increases, the more the population will be able to change jobs quickly. The more authorial forms of government could also interfere directly in the political choices of the population to encourage or limit the popularity of one or more alignments, however, great care must be taken not to annoy those most influential and loved by the population, in short capable of organizing a dramatic insurrection. The political alignments in government will have the last word, but it is good to avoid pushing too hard and waiting for even the more traditionalist ones to review their positions. To make this happen, we will have to spend research points in the tree of social achievements, choosing the progress that we deem most appropriate in that particular historical moment. Assembly lines Victoria: in the late 1800s, Sweden elected none other than Sigmund Freud as head of government To stay profitable, any industry we open will need to have enough workers and someone to buy their goods. If we start making haute couture clothes, but we don't have enough wealthy people to afford them, the company will soon go into the red with all the consequences, unless you establish a lucrative trade route. But to ensure that goods arrive on the market at competitive prices, it will be essential to carefully study the entire supply chain, which will naturally become increasingly complex as we specialize our industries by proposing more technologically advanced goods. We remain in the textile field: simple and hand-sewn clothes can be produced by a small number of low-skilled workers, introducing more complex processes, however, things will change quickly. Activating the first sewing machines will exponentially increase the number of garments produced, reducing simple workers but introducing engineers and mechanics into the company workforce. Another problem: producing more garments will require more tools, more fabric and, in some cases, more chemical dyes. If these are not produced or imported in sufficient numbers, their price on the market will increase and so will the goods produced with these ingredients. Consumer goods Victoria 3: the whole world available, only Atlantis would be missing, but with mod support anything is possible It's not a big problem if a luxury or little-used item costs too much, we can tax anything for a little extra income, but it can become so if inflation concerns essential goods, or those particularly appreciated by a large number of citizens . It is very important to always keep the balance between supply and demand at bay, and to diversify the nations with which to import sensitive goods in order to avoid that the sudden closure of a commercial contract leaves the army without ammunition, or the agricultural fields without fertilizers. Didn't the same thing happen between Europe and Russia with gas? Also in Victoria 3 a sensitive commodity can be transformed into a weapon of blackmail, perhaps just as a prelude to a real and more decisive military invasion. The conquest of new territories can also take place in more peaceful terms, thus avoiding earning infamy points that will negatively affect diplomacy: you can ask a weak and culturally subjugated nation to become a protectorate, or make sure that the government passes laws to pave the way for the colonization of tribal regions. Logically this will have consequences on immigration, a phenomenon which may be more or less accepted as wellthan exploited, based on the political direction taken by the country you are leading. Economic warfare Victoria 3: the coasts of Japan The war, as implemented in Victoria 3, has caused a lot of discussion since, for a clear design choice, Paradox has decided to simplify some important aspects. Contrary to what happened in Victoria 2, in this new game we will not move troops directly on the map; instead we will limit ourselves to assigning them to one of the open fronts, so that the numerical value that represents their strength is as similar, or higher, than that of the enemy. We understand the initial reluctance of the public, but the game actually seems to work much better this way: Victoria 3 is not Heart of Iron, nor Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis, it is instead a game that focuses on other aspects, mostly economics, and it is right that these also dominate the indispensable war aspect. The troops must be maintained economically, to deploy them they must be assigned to generals or admirals and these can be promoted or demoted; if their popularity explodes, perhaps following important victories, on the wave of success some of them could even decide to enter politics, bringing with them any power imbalances. Also, a nation's industrial strength and the advancement of its technologies will allow for better organized and equipped soldiers, but will you have enough opium to keep those field hospitals going? And enough engines for that fleet of state-of-the-art ships? Belle Epoque Victoria 3: our textile industry is missing an important ingredient. Liquidity is dwindling, production all but zero, and many of the workers are leaving Everything is interconnected in Victoria 3, counted and well divided to then be transformed into statistics to be fed to the player, who will decrypt it to decide his next moves. Iron is missing; miners are in revolt over the high death rate brought on by the reckless implementation of explosives; the people's party led by the intelligentsia is on a war footing over the new welfare law; subsistence farms are hurting a region's business; a communist uprising is trying to overthrow the puppet government we are holding. All this, and much more, will have to be kept an eye on as we try to achieve the most important goals: wouldn't you like to create your very own Belle Epoque? And how about organizing a Universal Exposition that takes the breath away from the whole world? What if your nation was the first to put up a skyscraper? Infamy, prestige, business, cultural revolutions, wars, embargoes, electricity, oil, steel, unified markets, dynamite, plastics and rubber, engines for assembly lines first and then automobiles. With Sweden we have become the first exporters of canned food; the second time with Chile we created ~El Mercato PB+C~ (Peruvian-Bolivian and Chile) which allowed us to unify our industrial and negotiation skills, leading to rapid development to the detriment of Argentine expansionist aims, apparently blocking giving wings to Brazil and of course pissing off the United States. D factor Victoria 3: This is how thoroughly each nation's population will be surveyed Victoria 3 has all the numbers to become the best-selling and most appreciated large-scale economy simulator ever. It really can do it because there has never been one so polished, so big budget, so concrete and easy to learn and use. What it won't be able to do is convince fans of the previous chapter to immediately embrace all the changes made to its gameplay. It is very probable that not all the innovations brought by Victoria 3 turn out to be good ideas in the end, and it will undoubtedly take an expansion or two to reach the complexity that the second game can show off today, after years on the market, but on one thing we are ready to fight hard: Victoria 3 is much more fun than its predecessor. This game works better, it offers a market with a much more realistic and multifaceted trend, it divides the population into a myriad of categories and sub-categories to take into account. The war has been simplified compared to the second Victoria, but the new system allows for a much more fluid and rhythmic flow of matches, also leaving economic preparation always the most important aspect. Isn't it precisely because of its deep economic simulation that Victoria is chosen over another Paradox game?
