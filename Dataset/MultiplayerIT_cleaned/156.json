{"name": "Super Fruit Fall", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-fruit-fall.html", "text": "Super Given the addition of the word ~Super~ in the title, it was reasonable to expect some changes, which instead did not arrive. Incredibly, the new Fruit Fall is identical to those already released in past years, making each of the three peculiarities of the Nintendo Wiimote completely useless: the means to do something extremely original and fun were certainly not lacking, from the various position detectors to the on-screen pointer, but they weren't exploited at all. Having clarified this, the quality of the game remains unchanged; a puzzle game is generally evaluated based on four factors: the originality of the puzzles, the structuring and quality of the puzzles, the importance and precision of the control system, the value of the multiplayer mode. The idea behind Super Fruit Fall is very simple: eliminate all the fruit on the screen by rotating it to the right, left or one hundred and eighty degrees. Each variation will naturally cause the movement of the various elements that will make up the stage, subject to the force of gravity, which however will only go away by combining three or more fruits of the same type. This seemingly elementary mechanic was expertly developed by the developers: the stages are many and very difficult. The learning curve isn't particularly accurate, since the puzzles will become highly challenging immediately after the tutorial, but what really doesn't work in the game is the highly restrictive juxtaposition between the conception of the stages and the time limit imposed: the levels are studied well, capable of hindering even the most expert player, but they would have needed a different time management. There are puzzle games designed to be adrenaline-pumping, such as Puzzle Bobble, which requires mental lucidity, timing and high precision in the various movements, and others that are instead made to be enjoyed calmly, observing the stage for several minutes, trying and trying again until reaching the right solution, such as Polarium: Super Fruit Fall should belong to the second type, but was mistakenly forced into the first. The complexity of certain stages, which taken alone would only be an advantage, unfortunately clashes with the few minutes granted to the player, often forced to rotate the screen randomly left and right in the hope of aligning three apples. Fruit in the face Needless to deny it, it is clear that Super Fruit Fall is certainly not facilitated by the platform on which it runs: it was an excellent puzzle game on mobile, it is not on console. In addition to the structural reasons previously exposed, it is its very origin that limits it: the simplistic control system, perfect for a platform unable to detect precise movements or to manage a frenetic type of game, has certainly been a highly compromising element for the creation of internships; the fruit falls in blocks, and there is no difference between bananas, apples or pears. Although there are some commendable design choices, unfortunately this lack of depth has affected the variety of levels, which from the first to the last change more due to the increase in difficulty than due to actual structural differences; unfortunately the foundations of Fruit Fall are not solid enough to guarantee plurality to the game by themselves. The secondary modes are few and do not add much to the normal experience, which consists in tackling the various levels in sequence (with the possibility of saving): one allows you to play the stages calmly, improving your score, and can be associated with the classic ~training~, present on almost all puzzle games; the other is the multiplayer one, essential to ensure high longevity. Again, Fruit Fall is disappointing: in addition to limiting the experience to only two users, the latter will not influence each other in the least, essentially playing two separate games; whoever manages to pass a certain number of stages first will win. It is our duty to let you know that Fruit Fall, given the few moves, can only be played with the telepad: with the directional cross you can rotate the screen in all three of the foreseen ways, even if in this case you would preclude the possibility of moving it to the left and right by waving the nunchuk and wiimote respectively; nothing serious, given that these movements simply replace - in a less precise way - the pressing of the keys. The technical sector was created with approximation: in addition to being simplistic, it is also lacking in style. Super Fruit Fall is a puzzle game for the Wii, but on a mobile it would have been the same. The idea behind the game is nice, the puzzles are not perfect but still appreciable, but in single it ends early, the multiplayer mode is poor and the controls are approximate. In addition to this, it is evident that the structure of the title was created for a much less powerful system, and that a home console is the ideal platform to show its defects rather than to enhance its merits: although it costs ~only~ 35 euros, it is not certainly a title to buy sight unseen. Pros Clever puzzle Very challenging Cons The Wiimote is practically unused On mobile it would have been the same Poor multiplayer Fruit Fall is a rather well-known puzzle game which over the years, remaining unchanged, has expanded its range: from a simple mobile puzzle it has become a real PC title, and now it has also arrived on a home console , the Wii. The potential of the Nintendo remote control is very high, if exploited well they could be able to reinvigorate even the flattest and conceptually archaic videogame genre, which puzzle games, despite their age, certainly are not. System 3 therefore saw fit to take advantage of the new Nintendo school of thought, which focuses entirely on innovation: the results, we tell you already now, unfortunately were poor.", "date": "2007-01-23", "grade": null}
