With Pixel Ranger for iPhone, MetroGames wanted to re-propose the same scenario in an arcade game with such a retro flavor that it couldn't leave those who grew up in the Commodore 64 era indifferent. The Argentinian developer's goal was evidently to combine an aesthetic exquisitely nostalgic and a traditional game type with a modern interface, able to take advantage of the touchscreen and motion sensors of mobile and tablet devices. They come out of the pixelated walls! Through the most predictable of the incipits, Pixel Ranger opens with the kidnapping of a young damsel by a naughty UFO, but unfortunately for the gang of aliens, the girl's boyfriend is a freckled cowboy armed with a lot of courage and, above all, a rifle. In the role of our hero, the player is thus called to face a series of levels full of aliens to shoot down and strange creatures to crush, all through a game structure that is heavily reminiscent of the old vertical shooters  la Space Invaders. The first moments of the game are far from traumatic: by tilting the device you move the little cowboy to the right or left, while with a touch on the screen you shoot in the desired direction, trying to shoot down the aliens who meanwhile descend from above; one almost deludes oneself that the control system is so simple and intuitive, but the problems arrive as soon as the aliens are joined by enemies on the ground. Thus, in addition to having to keep an eye on both the top and bottom of the screen, the player is forced to leap over incoming creatures from the sides by pressing a specific point on the touchscreen. Now it's easy to imagine the result: having to tilt the device, touch the screen at the top and use other fingers to jump, playing Pixel Ranger requires considerable manual dexterity, and even after getting the hang of it you have to live with an input system that is not precise enough to get out of the most agitated situations unscathed. And it's a real shame that the overall experience is compromised by poor controls, as behind what is a simple mechanic there are instead several extremely interesting ideas. Above all the economy at the base of the bullets at your disposal: if you destroy an enemy, this drops a certain number of pixels that the cowboy must collect and reuse to reload his weapon. However, the collected pixels also act as vital energy, so that this curious dynamic is created whereby the player is pushed to kill enemies with one shot, in order to gain more ammunition, but at the same time tries not to get to strike and to dose one's blows, in an attempt not to run out of energy. To make everything even more complicated, there is a very strict checkpoint system, which forces you to start over each of the 12 chapters of the adventure from scratch in case you die in an attempt to complete it. There are several power-ups which, if they don't make the player's life easier, at least add a little variety and humor thanks to bizarre secret techniques and improbable weapons ranging from rocket launchers to laser beams. However, the characteristic element of Pixel Ranger remains its aesthetic component made up of cubic characters and neon colors, even if it were a hybrid between Zak McKracken and a Jeff Minter game. As the number of enemies increases, the screen fills with explosions and pixels raining down at every moment, and ensures that the player enjoys a particularly pleasant visual experience, although the background music cannot be said to be equally successful. Finally, an Endless mode offers an additional challenge to those who want to break away from the classic adventure, asking the player to survive as long as possible while increasingly fierce and numerous waves of opponents invade the screen.
