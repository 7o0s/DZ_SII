{"name": "The Bug Butcher", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/162079-the-bug-butcher-attenti-al-rimbalzo.html", "text": "The unstoppable success of independent video games, effectively cleared through customs in recent years even on the stages of the most prestigious international trade fairs, is linked to a series of reasons ranging from low costs to the diffusion of digital delivery platforms, triggering a virtuous circle where the competition has done nothing but raise the quality level. It is no coincidence that a large portion of users - especially among the hardcore ones - prefer them even to the sumptuous Triple A, attracted by the old school arcade mechanics often inspired by immortal classics. Among the games with a glorious past that still today have not had a worthy spiritual heir is the famous Pang, best known for its 1990 sequel Super Pang, developed by Mitchell Corporation which was distributed in arcades and on home systems of the time by CAPCOM. Although conceptually it is a different work, The Bug Butcher by the Austrian Awfully Nice Studios certainly has several points of contact with the historic Japanese action, expanding its basic dynamics and enriching its recipe with an audiovisual sector in step with the times. If you love pure arcades and above all you appreciated the original inspiring muse, known in Japan as Pomping World and in the USA as Buster Bros, we strongly suggest you continue reading. Lots of fun and a refined artistic sector in The Bug Butcher, a work inspired by the legendary Pang If it bounces, shoot Many indie studios were born out of collaborations between former employees of large software houses, and Awfully Nice Studios is no exception, as it was founded in Kufstein by ex-Blizzard Till Aschwanden and Rainer Zoettl. After winning the prestigious contest The Big Indie Pitch of Pocketgamer at GDC Europe with the prototype of The Bug Butcher, the two decided to develop a commercial version that was translated last summer on Steam in Early Access, whose running-in and finishing has just finished. As specified in the introduction, the title owes a lot to Pang, however, although the action is conceptually similar, there are also some substantial differences, especially after passing the first levels of setting. The player controls Harry, a cheeky space exterminator who is called upon to solve a ~major problem~ on a scientific station on an unidentified planet. Its aim is to shoot upwards to eliminate round insectoid aliens that tend to bounce on the floor and split up when hit, just like Pang's big colored balloons did. Instead of the famous harpoon, our anti-hero is equipped with a more classic blaster which can be enhanced or replaced for a short time by much more effective and destructive instruments of death, the mastery of which becomes essential to overcome the most difficult and filled levels of targets. The campaign is made up of thirty levels set in five sections of the scientific station, from the garage to the inevitable reactor where the creatures have placed their nest. Between one main area and another, the player must move up a dangerous elevator where the bosses of the moment must be faced, who, once defeated, will turn into ~common~ enemies in the following levels. Each stage is nothing more than an arena to be cleaned up from the various waves of aliens, represented by a large bestiary that ranges from small very fast spheres up to large monsters capable of crushing the player, shooting or ~vomiting~ waves of other amenities. At the beginning the arenas are large empty spaces, but in the following settings the design is enriched by barriers, self-propelled platforms and dangerous obstacles (such as the large pneumatic hammer of the furnace) which can considerably complicate the player's life. The systematic elimination of enemies is in fact linked to a timer of two or three minutes, after which a poisonous gas is released which instantly kills poor Harry. However, the limited time and the attacks of the enemy creatures are not the only concern for our hero, since there is a species of spiders similar to the Barnacles of Half Life (but not static) ~interested~ in the bizarre scientists who accompany him during the adventure: if they manage to capture one and take it towards the exit, killing it, the game over would be immediate. The gameplay is exquisitely arcade and the skill of the player, beyond a bit of luck with the bonuses, is the only discriminating factor between victory and defeat. Harry can help himself with running to escape enemies or to hit them strategically, but the move, which can be activated with the B key on the Xbox pad, is also useful forTo collect coins to spend in the appropriate shop. The simple RPG component of The Bug Butcher provides for a rather linear growth of the character, with the possibility of upgrading the basic weapon, the temporary bonus weapons and the very useful special gadgets, to be activated with the X key. Among the secondary guns we find lasers, miniguns, rocket launchers and plasma rifles capable of mowing down numerous enemies at the same time, while among the precious bonuses, which are unlocked by filling the appropriate indicator through the combos, there are very useful freezing bombs and invincibility, which works like the Mario star making Harry even quicker with the trigger. Each stage can be tackled in three distinct levels of difficulty and has a classic star rating system, which are unlocked based on the score and the combos performed, to be compared with an inevitable world leaderboard. The campaign is completed in a handful of hours and is accompanied by the so-called Panic mode, which can also be tackled in local cooperative: it is a sort of horde mode where you can resist the waves of enemies as much as possible. Pest control 2.0 The delicious old-school arcade gameplay is not the only merit of the first work of Awfully Nice Studios, since it also boasts an artistic sector of remarkable workmanship. The stages and especially the sprites are all drawn by hand using a highly inspired cartoon style, embellished with fluid animations designed to underline the ironic and grotesque trait of Harry's adventure. Unfortunately thirty levels are not very many and the individual settings do not offer a great variety from the point of view of level design; for 7.99 euros, the price at which The Bug Butcher is currently sold, it is a sufficient amount of content, although a dozen more arenas would certainly not have spoiled its longevity. The refinement and artistic care placed in the details is also reflected in the sound effects and above all in the soundtrack, which, although not exuberant in the number of songs, is always catchy and well integrated with the frenetic pace of the game. Online multiplayer for Panic mode would certainly have been welcome, but the best way to enjoy it is certainly side-by-side with a friend holding another joypad.", "date": "2016-01-18", "grade": "8.2"}
