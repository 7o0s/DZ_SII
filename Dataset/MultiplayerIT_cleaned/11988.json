{"name": "Streets of Rage 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/streets-of-rage-2-recensione.html", "text": "Younger players probably won't even have a clue what they are, since they've all but disappeared from the market. The fact is that the two-dimensional scrolling fighting games, at the time when arcades were still on the crest of the wave, constituted one of the most popular genres within the entire videogame scene. Capcom's Final Fight and Sega's Streets of Rage were, however, the series capable of offering something more, detaching themselves from the crowd and achieving truly enormous popularity. In particular, the second episode of the SEService GAmes brand managed to combine the best offered by the genre in a single product, earning the status of leading exponent of the category according to many. Today Streets of Rage 2 is added to the XBLA offer, at a cost of 400 points; is it worth proceeding with the download? Vintage barrel Sega's fatigue is obviously a product dedicated to those who have an interest in retrogaming, and therefore in rediscovering gameplay that now belongs to the past. Street of Rage 2 offers simple, no-frills, dry, but not unsatisfying mechanics. There are 4 characters available, each with different characteristics and different abilities; Axel, the most balanced, Skate and Blaze, agile and fast, and finally the fortissimo but slow Max. The control system is based on the use of only three keys, delegated respectively to the hit, the jump and the special move. The latter, often useful for solving the most complicated situations, must however be used sparingly since it inevitably leads to affecting the residual energy of one's alter ego. There is also a whole series of more or less conventional objects and weapons to collect, from knives to bars and so on. The peculiarity of Streets of Rage 2, so far rather conventional, lies largely in the good development of the enemies that will be encountered during the 8 levels present; in fact, they are not trivial and semi-immobile dummies to be filled with fists, but on the contrary of fighters endowed with numerous qualities both for attacks and for movements on the screen. Such a situation, which obviously becomes more and more complicated as the adventure continues, gives a variety often unknown to titles of this genre, and finds further confirmation during the exciting boss fights. Obviously the most from this kind of product is obtained by playing in pairs, and this edition of the Sega product offers this option both locally with a friend next to you and online via Xbox Live; in the latter case, however, particular attention must be paid to the lag, since pairing with a user without an excellent connection can make the experience decidedly frustrating. However, when everything works in the right way, the title is capable of giving loads of fun, especially when by mistake (cough cough) you start hitting your friend... As for the graphic aspect, Streets of Rage 2 is a conversion absolutely faithful to the original, without any kind of improvement; there is actually a ~smooth~ option which in theory should improve the appearance by adding a watercolor effect and thus smoothing out the pixels. In reality, the result is simply ugly and hardly preferable to the original. Comment Streets of Rage 2 is a scrolling fighting game that made history, and the confirmation of its quality lies in the fact that even today it is capable of giving a few hours of healthy fun. Of course, the limits of a title dated 1993 are much more than evident, but for 400 points we believe it could be absolutely worth throwing yourself into the fray and beating your hands like in the good old days. Pros One of the greatest exponents of the genre Still entertaining Online multiplayer... Cons ...that doesn't always work well Very difficult goals to achieve Years go by even for the best", "date": "2007-09-25", "grade": null}
