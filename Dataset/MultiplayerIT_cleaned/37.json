We attacked them for no apparent reason and slaughtered them camp by camp. After all, the Vandals were little more than barbarians and we needed territories in which to expand to the south without infuriating Cleopatra, who was occupying the northern part of the continent. Sure, they were still her family, so we understand her, but that doesn't mean we can tolerate her: she's the mother of the heir to the throne of the Persian Empire, future ruler of at least twelve cities and a civilized territory that stretches for miles. We are the most technologically advanced people known, whose culture is having a decisive influence on all others. We simply had to expand somewhere, otherwise we would be crushed. She will come to terms with it or we will convince her, making her reach her loved ones ahead of time. After all, these are the rules of this somewhat surprising 4x, as you will discover by reading the review of Old War. Hybrid gameplay Behind the project is Soren Johnson, former designer of Civilization IV, who, having left Firaxis and after the successful Offworld Trading Company, with his Mohawk Games has tried to evolve the formula invented by Sid Meier towards a new but recognizable direction, looking at the Crusader Kings. So in the Old World we continue to found cities, build settlers and workers, defend ourselves against barbarians, develop technologies by investing resources in a large scientific tree and so on, but we must also look after the rulers and their interpersonal and family relationships, under penalty of premature end of the game for lack of a descendant who can take the reins of the kingdom. Yes, because unlike the Civilizations, in which a leader is chosen to lead his people from the dawn of history to space, in the Old World the rulers can die in a more or less traumatic way (old age, wars, murder and so on) and they must cultivate not only their family, but also a court, where friendships, duplicity and conspiracies abound. The illustrations of the events are very beautiful After all, we're talking about power, so that's normal. All this translates into a really interesting gameplay, in which at a certain point you have to seriously start worrying not only about irascible wives and overly ambitious children, but also about friends who are not friends, despite having entrusted them with control of a city , or of courtesans too well versed in the art of preparing poisons. When you find yourself managing the economic part of the game at the same time, therefore choosing what to build, which troops to send to war and so on, and the more political part at the same time, you realize that the experiment has been successful and it is hard to think how the competitors can ignore it, as it works well and reaches a very remarkable and intriguing level of depth. Novelty Old World is reminiscent of Civilization, but don't be fooled by appearances! It must be said that, unlike the Civilizations, Old World is more concentrated, i.e. the evolutionary arc of civilizations spans only two hundred years, with the single rounds advancing the game by only one year. In fact it would have been impossible to manage interpersonal relationships in a realistic way with leaps of ten years and more that would have immediately aged the characters. In any case, don't expect to go into space, because at most you will go to war with some catapults, scaring your enemies with your elephants, while perhaps you take care of a psychopathic son who has decided to make enemies of your people with absurd pretensions. The differences between Old World and the Firaxis series are not limited to the introduction of mechanics taken from Crusader Kings. Johnson and his team have also rethought some classic elements, giving them a different value. For example, the management of production is more articulated, with the people being able to refuse certain impositions, such as slavery, when they have reached a certain level of well-being and a certain cultural level. The fact that the rulers are mortals and that revolts and overthrows have a direct effect on their heads, makes these elements of micromanagement much more important than in other titles and we find ourselves from the middle game to face problems that in Civilizations, such as in other 4x, they essentially don't exist. Old World has a lot of new things to offer Another relevant change concerns the movement of troops. Instead of having only the classic movement points for each of those deployed, so-called order points are available, which can be spent to move all the troops, but which, once depleted, are recharged on the next turn. Let's explain better: putI like having three scouts, each with six individual action points, but only having fourteen order points: who are we going to move first? Who more, who less? By running out of movement for two troops, there would only be two order points left, with which to move the third unit or perform other actions. As you will understand, deciding how to invest orders becomes essential right from the start and forces you to make unprecedented assessments, which are not found in the 4x in which each unit has its range of movement detached from that of the others. From this also derives a different pace of play, more meditative in a certain sense, so you don't have to do everything in a single turn, but you can spread the moves, creating a real hierarchy. Artificial intelligence also helps in this sense, up to the challenge, which, above all by selecting the highest difficulty levels, puts in place interesting strategies, which force well-studied counter-moves and embroidered on the budget of order points available. Finally, the cities deserve a mention, which cannot be built wherever you want, but must be established on already urbanized territories, so to speak. Basically, by exploring the map, there are villages that occupy one or more boxes, on which it is possible to found a new city, starting to exploit its resources. It is a much more realistic system than that of Civilizations, in which urban settlements must always be created from scratch and which have never considered spontaneous forms of urbanization, which are instead fundamental for the development of human civilization. Problems Intrigues and betrayals abound Were we to judge Old World only for how it tries to rejuvenate the 4x, ours would be a full promotion. Unfortunately, the Mohawk Games title also has some problems, of which the most obvious is the user interface, which does everything to hide important information from the player, increasing the clicks too cumbersome to perform each action. Experience obviously helps, but some menus remain too cryptic and it is often very difficult to find what you are looking for. Unfortunately the tutorial is not a comfort and, indeed, is part of the problem. Basically it consists of pop-up windows that give us information on the basic actions, briefly explaining some of the game mechanics. Too bad it's largely incomplete and leaves out so many essential concepts that one wonders what it's really for. Old World, therefore, requires a certain dedication to be fully understood and played as it deserves, i.e. to start giving some satisfaction. Let's discuss it civilly For veterans of the genre it won't be a stumbling block, but we imagine that more than a few novices could be bent by such a steep start. So the advice is to start from one of the lowest difficulty levels (let's say the first two), in which the artificial intelligence is not very aggressive, so as to become familiar with the interface without immediately having to worry about having problems from every forehead. From a technical point of view, however, little to say: the game is in line with the classics of the genre. It is certainly visually less rich than a Civilization V, but it is evident that the production levels are very different. Luckily we're talking about 4x, so the graphics side is secondary. Let's say that Mohawk has done his thing and that's enough. A separate mention deserve the illustrations of the events, really very beautiful. Sure, a 4x isn't played for illustrations, but they're still nice.", "date": "2021-07-12", "grade": "8.5"}
