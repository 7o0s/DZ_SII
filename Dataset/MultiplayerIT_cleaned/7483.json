Unfortunately this noble question has taken disturbing turns due to the new digital identities. Let's think, for example, of how out of place the messages of pain and farewell written on the Facebook pages of dead people who, in spite of themselves, leave a piece of their life, now out of control, for all to see. It makes me shiver just thinking about it. This drive towards immortality on the one hand and morbid voyeurism on the other has led to the development of a technology called Soul Cloud. Thanks to this software, dead people can relive in the Soul Cloud cyberspace by eternally traveling through their memories, which become real worlds that can be visited by relatives, friends and acquaintances of the deceased. Knowing this will already help you a lot in the approach with Master Reboot, a video game that relies on the player's sense of disorientation. In fact, at the beginning of the game we only know that we are in a world that looks like a cross between a surrealist painting and a technological nightmare born from the pen of William Gibson. And things don't get better as you progress through the game, on the contrary, the environments become more and more disturbing and shocking. On the other hand, the information begins to arrive, transmitted by the very shape of the levels. As in the case of Gone Home, in Master Reboot it is the environment that tells the story. Thus we understand that we are inside the Soul Coud and that we have access reserved for employees of the company that created it. Unfortunately for us we are not alone: Serene.exe, the system antivirus, is hunting us. What is not clear is who we are and why we wander among the memories of a deceased engaged couple. Only by following the logic of their memories, made up of symbolism and abstractions, will we arrive at the shocking truth. Master Reboot channels a number of brilliant insights and almost always manages to transfer them to the game with surprising results. Sadly, even though a patch has already been released as of this writing, the game still suffers from a lack of cleanliness in the level structure. The proposed mechanics go badly with the first person view and some environments clash in quality and design compared to the others. Especially the ending sequence needs an overhaul. This does not mean that the developers of Wales Interactive have an extraordinary eye for shapes and have been able to put it at the service of a unique video game. Master Reboot throws the player off balance by keeping them suspended between wonder and uneasiness, only to leave them at the end with many crucial questions for which there are no easy answers. Extreme environmental storytelling and dizzying perspective shifts await you in Master Reboot Memories in binary code Master Reboot is a puzzle-solving horror adventure. Describing the structure of the game as a whole is difficult, so let's try to isolate the three keywords, adventure, horror and puzzle, and take a closer look at them one at a time. There is little adventure in Master Reboot. At first, the pleasure of exploration dominates over the other elements, but it doesn't last long. The action is very fragmented, divided into memory rooms, each of which represents a world of its own, very different in structure and atmosphere from that of the other rooms. Unfortunately, these worlds are defined by a clear and linear path, and leave us very little freedom of movement. It would have been nice to alternate such defined rooms with more free ones, because the sense of mystery and disorientation of the rooms is so strong that it makes you want to get lost among the shapes and colors of memories. Instead it doesn't happen. On the other hand, puzzles dominate the scene. Indeed, each memory asks us to solve one or more puzzles, after which it offers us an action sequence of some kind, usually linked to platforms to jump on. These are the most frustrating moments of the game, because the first person view makes it difficult to calibrate the movements. In the final it is not excluded that some players risk excommunication by fury of curses. It must be said that these days it takes very little to make players impatient, used to being fed like frightened babies, but when the difficulty is due to imperfect controls, complaining is legitimate. Finally, let's move on to the horror aspect of the game, linked more to the visual theme of the rooms of memories than to real moments of fear. On a couple of occasions we took a step back, but almost always the tension that is perceived does not turn into a real threat. In one room for example we heard footsteps around us. So we watched each other. Except that after a while we understood that the passages were part of dthe sound carpet. Needless to say, the fear disappeared and we set about looking for clues without haste. Although it didn't keep us on edge, Master Reboot still left us with an unease that manifested itself after the first few minutes of the game and never left us until the end, also due to the possessed child-like aspect of the Serene antivirus. After all, the beauty of this game is all in its atmosphere and in the way the images amplify and shape a powerful theme. Emotions to inhabit If we strip Master Reboot's environments and focus on what we're doing, we find that most of the time we're busy solving very simple environmental puzzles, similar to those that young children play with. We are therefore talking about objects to be ordered according to a certain logic, colors to combine, melodies to be played with the keys of a piano, colored balls to find and other tasks of this kind. The basic actions of any video game: collect, order, follow the rhythm, aim, hit. Only that in Master Reboot these actions remain in their primitive form. We are amazed to find out because it is not at all obvious; in the world of Master Reboot, even the simplest actions become complex. Without clues or indications of any kind, an elementary problem can become a source of anxiety and disorientation in the Soul Cloud. Of course there are rare cases in which the solution to a puzzle is so bizarre that it represents an obstacle only for the lack of logic, as in the case of the abandoned playground. But when it happens, the environments are so small and the objects so few and recognizable that one finds the point of interaction even just letting oneself be attracted by the shapes. Basically As you may have noticed we always end up talking about environments and representations. On the other hand, the Master Reboot experience is really all about the spaces and the objects that fill them. With radical variations of scenery and atmosphere from one memory room to another. One of our favorites is the child's room. Here the proportions are reversed and everything looks gigantic. We can even visit the dollhouse as if it were an apartment building, while the fire truck looks huge in comparison. But that's just one example. There is everything inside the Soul Cloud and it could not be otherwise, because each memory is illuminated by different emotions. Fear, for example, takes the form of an airplane in which Serene is an evil stewardess who patrols the corridor and which we must avoid by stealthily (again with crude and minimal mechanics). The memory of a beautiful day at the beach is instead a sunny beach on which to dedicate ourselves to a relaxing treasure hunt. Relaxing so to speak: in every moment we know that something is wrong and that we are living the memories of a dead person. The examples could continue for each room. Do you think that we took photos of almost all the environments, undecided on which to choose for this review. It is useless to continue further on this point. Only one detail remains that deserves to be mentioned. The symbol that is repeated most during the game is that of a plastic duck. They are found in blue scattered in the rooms of memories. There are also giant yellow ducks and two-dimensional stylized white ducks. The idea we have is that the little duck is a symbol of the Soul Cloud like the chirping bird is the symbol of Twitter. And in fact ducks always have some fragment of life associated with them, sometimes a photograph, sometimes a scribbled sheet or an excerpt of communication via chat. If, on the other hand, you're wondering why a blue duck, well, perhaps there isn't a logical reason for that. In our opinion it's just a brilliant aesthetic intuition that goes wonderfully with the graphic style of the game.", "date": "2013-11-15", "grade": "7.8"}
