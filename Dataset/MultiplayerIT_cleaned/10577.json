The WiiWare game that we are about to analyze is in fact the most different from the legendary first-person game based on James Bond that you can imagine, but on the other hand it is a concept that really has few similarities with what we have seen so far. The player is called upon to interpret a barber for plants: from a semantic point of view, it can be argued that it is more correct to use the word ~gardener~, but a glance at Bonsai Barber is enough to understand that we are not dealing with a logical title. Before us, one after the other, different types of plants appear: tubers, fruit trees, ornamental plants and so on, each characterized by its own character and, above all, specific preferences in terms of hairstyle. The normal work of the gardener - pruning, care of the leaves or whatever - is therefore transformed into a refined practice of coiffeur: remote control in hand, we will find ourselves satisfying the aesthetic demands of the plants trying to complete the job in the best way so as not to incur their wrath. In fact, it's a slightly more complex variant of the many flash hairdressing games, but with a decidedly satisfactory use of the Wii Remote, the only type of control supported by this title. Framed from a first-person view, the customer-vegetables appear in front of us occupying the entire screen, while our task is to take care of their thick hair by modeling it according to the preferred shapes (round, pointed, heart-shaped, triangular and so on, the shapes increase as you progress in the game) and embellishing it in various ways. There really isn't much else to say about the game structure: the aim is to satisfy the subjects as much as possible, who reward us with evaluation stars and possibly medals, while the agenda is filled with appointments with plants of various types, moreover connected directly to the Wii calendar, creating a nice connection with the console system itself. Green thumb barber What is most striking about Bonsai Barber is the excellent implementation of the Wii Remote for controls: rapid wrist movements allow you to scissor with precision, with the possibility of rotating the remote to obtain maximum control over the foliage of the plants. We have a large array of tools at our disposal: scissors to make clean cuts, an electric razor to finish off, a watering can to make the leaves and branches grow back (and remedy the grossest mistakes), a comb to tidy up the foliage, the brush to color it and even a camera to immortalize our creations. All this can be recalled at any time by simply pressing a button and can always be used with the remote control. The sensation is excellent, the movement always reactive and precise (at least compared to what we impart), making the gaming experience enjoyable. Bonsai Barber's problems lie in the ability to attract the player for more than a few long-term games, because the game is impeccable in terms of immediate feeling. Even the graphic and sound sectors, in their extreme simplicity, are pleasant and sensible, at least within a game that - actually - has very little sensible. The stylization may seem excessive but overall it gives a naive impression that fits well with the spirit of the game, a pity about the austerity of the audio sector which could have done more to create an even more facetious atmosphere, but all in all the feeling that comes from being in front of the big smiling face (or altered, depending on how we behave) of a tuber or a fruit tree waiting to get the desired ~hair~ cut is pleasant. The behavior of the leaves and branches in contact with the various tools is also convincing: the cut (or the comb, the brushstroke or whatever) hits exactly the point selected with the Remote Control, with a coherent reaction of the shrub in question.", "date": "2009-08-12", "grade": "7.0"}
