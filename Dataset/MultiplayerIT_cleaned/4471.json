And now that the wait is over, we can do nothing but retrace our steps and retrace this short but intense period of work that led to the explosion of the videogame phenomenon of the last five years. If it is true that there is certainly no way to understand how it was possible to sell almost thirty million copies and become the most played simultaneously title ever on Steam, it cannot be hidden that, as in the most classic of situations, the word of mouth and the desire to play with your friends and compete, has made the title the son of the one who invented this videogame genre great. But the question is always the same: does it really deserve all this attention? Last Man Standing Precisely because we have already spent enough words, it is useless to describe the formula of the title in detail. We will limit ourselves to making the substance of PUBG understood by the less accustomed. After choosing whether to play alone or in a team with up to three other users, you will literally be parachuted onto one of the two maps now in the game, armed with nothing but your desire to stay alive. Together with another hundred players, your goal will be to make sure you are the last one standing, with the consequence of bringing home glory, honor and a handful of coins to spend on aesthetic boxes. To do this you will be able to recover a myriad of offensive and defensive tools on the field, which will allow you to slay your opponents and limit the damage received to a minimum, with the possibility of modifying your weapons by adding various accessories. The move is yours then: will you prefer to go around with a sniper rifle and a nice 8x scope mounted on it, or will you opt for the assault rifle from medium range with impressive firepower? Whatever your choice, the only natural element that will really be against you is an energy barrier which, at regular intervals, will narrow the playing area so that all the remaining contenders can concentrate in a single piece of land. New map, advancing desert Finally the time has come to discuss the new desert map officially released with this 1.0 version of the title. It does not represent the only substantially aesthetic change to the title, which has also benefited from a totally rewritten UI and which, finally, abandons the HTML language to give us an extremely reactive main menu, visually more appealing and simple to manage. The team invitations section has also been completely redesigned, with slots to fill and the classic window that indicates your online friends. To conclude, a generally better cleaning of the graphic aspect of the title, which is also found in the game and which we will discuss later. Returning to the map, freely inspired by the Mexican territory, some elements can be analyzed right from the start: compared to the first game area, in this case we are faced with a decidedly more accurate work from the point of view of the extension and the various urban agglomerations . The almost total lack of reuse of the previous assets is noticeable and, even only from an aesthetic point of view, the work carried out to recreate the environment from which the map is inspired is painstaking. Divided between an almost pristine area, interspersed with small groups of buildings, and a central city infinitely larger than any other on the first map of the game, this new iteration is able to give many satisfactions. What struck us most, to be honest, is the exploitation of the idea of a desert setting to avoid leaving large spaces totally open as happened in some areas near Pochinky. Even if there is no shortage of long walks into thin air, it is almost always possible to work on your positioning, taking advantage of dunes and depressions that will allow you to attack or hide in the best way, without necessarily turning into moving targets if you are forced to flee. The set of absolutely positive elements is concluded by the possibility of climbing over obstacles, a factor around which the whole new layout of the map has been designed and this is noted whenever it will be convenient for you to jump from the first floor, rather than returning to the front door. entrance. Obviously not everything is exactly as we would have liked, and there is no doubt that the extension of the map is too large with the risk in some games of already finding a few players after a few minutes. Another element that could definitely be improvedle in the current state is that relating to resources, not yet managed in the best possible way and often all grouped in a few environments, without the possibility of dividing everything in the best possible way among the different players. Stretch servers A small box seemed necessary to give you our impressions on the situation of the servers. Trying to use the brain as a player and, at the same time, as a critic, it was immediately evident that PUBG Corporation was displaced by the success of the title and by the amount of players who flocked to the servers. Over time, the situation has improved exponentially and it cannot be said that there has been no support from the team. What most afflicts the title at the moment is a very annoying elastic effect that unites all the games during the very first stages and which settles down after a few minutes from the beginning of the chaos. Nothing unmanageable, but there is no doubt that the risk of ruining interesting plays during the so-called ~early game~ due to this problem cannot be ignored. Another negative note is that relating to some sporadic crash of the title, which we hope and are confident can be resolved shortly anyway. Giulia passion for optimization In the light of all that we have listed in recent months and our impressions of this version 1.0, what is the real consideration regarding the technical aspect of the title? Can PUBG be considered the first honest and fast Early Access in the history of the sector? Difficult to give a single answer and that everyone agrees. However, what cannot be hidden for intellectual honesty is that the guys from PUBG Corporation, despite having found themselves hit by a whirlwind undoubtedly bigger than them, were also able to stay afloat, a non-negligible element in these situations. Certainly the stock didn't come out with the best prospects, about nine months ago. Server dancers, the need for rather high-performance machines and problems related to the frame rate that are decidedly difficult to digest. Over the months, however, the situation has settled down, arriving at a version 1.0 which, regardless of the gossips, runs enormously better than a large portion of products now considered ~triple A~. We don't dare say that PUBG is the best Early Access project ever seen, but without a doubt it turned out to be the most honest, even going so far as to overcome the onerous problem of the price increase that a few months ago led us to club ARK: Survival Evolved. At present, PUBG can be considered a concluded title, capable of giving dozens and dozens of hours of fun alone or in company and, net of a few problems already analyzed in the box relating to the servers. What the next few months have in store for us is all to be discovered, starting from the third snowy map, to get to the future of PUBG as an e-sport title. Until then, enjoy the phenomenon of the year, without the snobbishness that now distinguishes all too much hardened gamers.", "date": "2017-12-28", "grade": "8.0"}
