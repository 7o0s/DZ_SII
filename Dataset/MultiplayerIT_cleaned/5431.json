Although it falls quite precisely in the definition of the dungeon crawler, the new Orange Pixels title also tries to emerge with something original, and it does so above all with the idea of the two interchangeable characters. It's a small introduction, but in a game with a simple structure like this it manages to be a pivot for the whole mechanics, so much so as to entrust the alternation between the two fighters to the simple pressure of a button, which paves the way for a continuous reminder to this feature as the foundation of the game structure. It is therefore possible to select two complementary characters to take part in the action: a warrior specialized in melee attacks and a typical ranged character for ranged attacks, with the initial choice limited to warrior / valkyrie and elf / mage, each characterized by stats and slightly different special abilities within the two macro-categories. By advancing in the game it is then possible to unlock further character classes, even if the dynamics of combat with the alternation of close and ranged attacks remains practically unchanged even with the more advanced characters. The level design is basic and clearly designed for mobile platforms, with fragments of short dungeons and without too many complications, beyond some secret passage to discover or some key to find to open locked doors. In short, it is basically about fighting and collecting loots; the quests cannot be said to be structured in any way. Between dungeon crawler, action and roguelike, Heroes of Loot 2 emerges with an original game solution Loot heroes Compared to its previous productions, Orange Pixels has here definitively taken the big step towards pure action mechanics, having removed the turn-based elements that remained in the first chapter and in Space Grunts. In this case, however, the action flows inexorably and without interruption, allowing you to attack continuously but obviously also increasing the pace of the enemies, which makes the danger even more widespread and constant. From this point of view, however, there are some balancing problems in the game, which at times concentrates truly intense moments of challenge apparently without calculating the pace and the difficulty curve, while the control system via the classic virtual pad on the touch screen behind its classic weaknesses and a few too many uncertainties. However, the result is pleasant and Heroes of Loot 2 lets you play by overcoming even these defects, thanks to the functional combat system, the frenetic pace and well-studied for mobile platforms, the loot and the continuous progression from game to game. As regards this last aspect, which is decisive for the longevity of each RPG, it must be kept in mind that the achievement of important results such as the unlocking of new characters and objects of a certain level, can only be obtained after some time and numerous attempts , therefore a certain constancy in the approach to the game world is necessary to begin to mesh with the progression system of Heroes of Loot 2. As for the aesthetic aspect, Orange Pixels is now confirmed as specialized in classic pixel art graphics, proposing again his graphic style made of small colored sprites in predominantly dark settings but enlivened by numerous sources of light, capable of creating interesting contrasts. Anyone who has seen the team's other games will surely recognize the graphic setting, now a real stylistic code.", "date": "2016-07-05", "grade": "7.8"}
