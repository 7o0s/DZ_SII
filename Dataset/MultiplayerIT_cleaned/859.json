{"name": "Trackmania Sunrise - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trackmania-sunrise-recensione.html", "text": "TRAVEL WITH ME! The multiplayer is certainly the flagship of this production: there are all possible modes, including the ~hot-seat~ (the legendary ~hot chair~ of GranPrix) in which up to a maximum of eight drivers take turns on the same pc. It is also possible to play a race via LAN or the Internet, by modifying various parameters. The most interesting thing is being able to compete on tracks created by other players and therefore having a practically infinite database of tracks! In addition to the usual timed races, you can compete in a team with other opponents or in the ~laps~ mode, in which the winner is whoever completes the set number of laps first or does the most in a set time. Too bad for the lack of a split-screen, more fun than the ~hot chair~, but if you have a network there are no problems. It would be a crime not to use multiplayer! MOTION BLUR The graphic aspect of TS stands at medium-high levels, with the introduction of the latest inventions to make three-dimensional scenes more realistic, therefore pixel shaker, motion blur, etc. The thing that is immediately evident is the massive use of this last effect, which is always present to try to make the speed effect even higher. It can be said that it works even if seeing blurry things continuously can give a certain annoyance (it is however possible to remove it from the graphics options). However, everything has a plasticky air, and above all unrealistic in the levels that include the huge structures suspended in the void. The cars are well modeled and the truly complete decal editor deserves a separate discussion: it is possible to apply images, text, shaded colors as you please, thus allowing an infinite variety to just the three car models. Overall, many things are reminiscent of the beautiful Far Cry so much so that we find very similar tropical settings. The tracks have many contour objects, and above all a very distant horizon, which shows absolutely no clipping effects. Another mention of merit concerns the fantastic level editor, to which the game manual dedicates quite a few pages. It is possible to build any type of circuit thanks to dozens of elements and parameters that are very reminiscent of Sim City. Some pieces will only be available by buying them with the appropriate currency, so trying to win gold medals is recommended to have no limits. Thanks to these possibilities, TS becomes a virtually infinite game, and unlimited courses are already available online. Finally, there is a last completely new feature for a driving game: the mediatracker, which allows you to create initial and final videos for the races, adding texts, fades and special effects. Combined with the excellent replay mode these two additional options allow you to enjoy the game even just by watching it. [C] The huge structures! Far Cry has nothing to envy! [/C] BRAKE! I WANT TO GO TO THE TIDES! Trackmania Sunrise is the sequel to Trackmania, a title that came out some time ago and spread incredibly through the Internet. The game is a perfect clone of the old Stunts, brought to the present day both in terms of graphics and contents, or an arcade in the pure sense of the term, in which only four keys are used, accelerate, brake, steer left and right. Basically, you get behind the wheel of a car and race on totally fantasy circuits, furnished with jumps, loops of death, obstacles of all kinds, etc. The game is a perfect clone of the old Stunts, brought to the present day BRAKE! I WANT TO GO TO THE TIDES! TS sees different types of challenges to be faced, some of new conception: in addition to the classic races against computerized opponents and against time, there are also sub-games such as ~Platform~ and ~Puzzle~. The first sees courses along the lines of Mario Bros games (!) in which you have to make the car jump from one platform to another (with great precision); the second is a mode in which you have to draw the tracks with the help of already fixed pieces! This is possible because the game has been designed so that you can create your own circuits with an excellent editor. From here it follows that an infinite number of levels created by enthusiasts can be found on the Internet and the variety offered is quite wide thanks also to the different types of possible settings. The developers have inserted huge structures suspended in the void, with parabolics and loops of death, which if taken the wrong way will force you to repeat certain areas of the tracks (divided into checkpoints). This leads to some negative considerations: the title is strongly discouraged for those who live on bread and GTR, given the total lack of realism, so much so that in some tests it is necessary to bounce the autor on the water as if it were a stone! In addition, the vehicles are very powerful and reach speeds of over 500km/h. The result is a problematic control in the most complicated courses and a sense of frustration in making some mistakes that are difficult to avoid, with the consequent overtaking by the opponents. The AI then almost never makes mistakes, making the victories very sweaty. In some cases the tracks are very confusing and it is difficult to understand where to go. Trackmania Sunrise is a very controversial title: the game mechanics are those of a genre that disappeared eons ago, the simplest arcade that exists, brought to the present day in terms of graphics and content and with some interesting innovations. Nothing wrong with it since the immediacy of the game has disappeared for years but unfortunately there is also a downside: the total lack of reality (which goes badly with the graphic aspect) even in the simplest maneuvers and the excessive speed of the cars, the real penalizing pivot of the entire production. Going at 500 km/h on convoluted courses somewhat detracts from the fun, given that sometimes you will be forced to repeat some circuits due to trivial mistakes due to excess power. Ultimately the dusting off of a genre, fun and immediate for those who want to play with friends without banging too much. Purists avoid it like the plague (they would immediately hate it!); the others also think about it. Pros: Old-fashioned arcade, immediate and fun Graphics up to today's standards Exceptional multiplayer Cons: Only three cars Excessive game speed Totally unrealistic even for an arcade UNZ! UNZ! UNZ! The sound sector sees a very simple audio for the cars: accelerated, braked, skidded and nothing else in the style of a poor arcade. Collisions against objects vary according to the surface (fortunately!) and we find only a few particular exceptions (such as the special lanes that ~shoot~ the car). On the other hand, the background music is good, catchy and of the techno-commercial type.", "date": "2005-08-09", "grade": null}
