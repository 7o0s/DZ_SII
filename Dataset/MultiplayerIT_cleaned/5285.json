Animation Throwdown: The Quest for Cards checks each of these characteristics, and the overall result is also pleasant, in an amalgam of titles of sure interest but uncertain coexistence such as Futurama, Family Guy, American Dad, King of the Hill and Bob's Burgers. Already the selection of the series involved makes it clear how the chosen audience is above all North American, given that apart from the first two, the other series are not extremely well known in our parts, even if they have been broadcast for some time and still have a certain following. In short, it may not be the call of the Simpsons, but the titles put together by Kongregate to give life to this bizarre alchemy are nonetheless of great depth, and the charisma - an element necessary to keep a card game on its feet, and which often must be taken into account loan in extra-game fields if your name is not Blizzard or The Pokmon Company - is ensured by a cast with an assortment difficult to find elsewhere. It's pure fanservice, of course, and the humor of the characters between menus, tutorials and real games often seems forced into a context that doesn't exalt it too much, but taken as a fun side dish to a game of traditional cards does its duty and if nothing else the graphic characterization of the famous series works properly to give a particular identity to Animation Throwdown: The Quest for Cards with the obvious creation of a humorous theme also of the playing cards themselves. It is a combination that works, beyond the structural limits of the game and its typical free-to-play structure which imposes its intrinsically annoying dynamics, starting from the energy bar which is automatically consumed with each game (even if the requests are never excessive), to get to the inevitable grinding that emerges as you progress through the game and can push you to buy gems with real money, even in rather expensive packages. Futurama, Family Guy, American Dad, King of the Hill and Bob's Burgers battle cards Cardboard clash The card game follows the standard rules of the genre, involving the use of a combat deck containing characters to be deployed on the battlefield and related abilities. Obviously it's about playing against an opponent, who can be human or managed by artificial intelligence, with the fight taking place in turns, selecting the cards and placing them on the table, trying to beat the opponent's statistics and reset his energy . Beyond the basic choice of characters to deploy and skills to connect in attack and defense, a particularly important role is also covered by the combos, which derive from the association of different cards. The main hub allows us to engage in the various sections of the game, mainly divided into the Arena, i.e. the place where one-on-one battles also take place in multiplayer PvP, and Adventure Mode, which transfers the structure into a sort of story mode in which you collide with various characters with progressive difficulty. Both modes allow you to win more or less rich rewards depending on your performance, consisting of cards, coins and gems. In-game currencies can be used to expand and modify your deck and to reduce the waits, which emerge with the automatic consumption of the energy bar in each game or in the phase of creating combos. A particularly interesting element is represented by the Laboratory, in which it is possible to create combos by associating various cards with each other, with often hilarious effects, as befits the general spirit. Obviously an important phase of the gameplay is represented by the construction and management of the deck, and given the quantity of cards in the catalogue, the drive to conquer new elements and the careful selection of these represent two key elements of the whole gaming experience. Precisely in this sense, the microtransaction mechanism can be extremely sneaky, because the randomness of the game mechanics, in addition to the interruptions imposed by the energy bar, can make it almost necessary to resort to the purchase of gem packs in the full grinding phase. even if as usual no one forces the purchase.
