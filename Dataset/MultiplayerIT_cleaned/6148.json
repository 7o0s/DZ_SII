Max is one of the least pleasant heroines we have had the opportunity to follow on an adventure recently. She spends her time peering into other people's lives, she sets a tone with Polaroids so she doesn't have to stoop to use a trivial easel and refuses to show her work to the world; appearing is too mainstream for her, even if she pretends it's just shyness. Finally, she is never there when she is needed. In fact, the first half hour of this episode is spent apologizing to Chloe for not being the best friend in the world. She says it like a dozen times, while Chloe tells her that many times how nice it was to spend the day together. They talk a lot but listen to each other little, these two friends. And then there are Max's powers. For no reason, at least for now, Max discovers he has the power to rewind time. However, her snobbery prevents her from even taking into consideration the extraordinary nature of the fact. I mean, she's Max: having superpowers is tough, but she'll know how to carry this cross that would crush any other Christian. And to think that he always speaks ill of Victoria, who may be a snake, but at least she's honest in her feelings. To complete the picture of this vaguely depressed young woman (she is not at all) we add that she has no sentimental interests. What are the chances that a good-looking young girl in her prime enrolled in a school for hotties will not experience any sexual attraction for male or female? Here, exactly. Max is superior even to love. Let alone sex. And if at the end of the episode Warren has found another less self-absorbed to hang out with, we toast to his health. However, Max's dominion over the universe is put to the test by the overflowing Chloe. The authors must have noticed that the two girls have a habit of killing the rhythm of the story with long exposition scenes in which absolutely nothing happens, so they decided to go all out with a series of twists - no less than three - which in this fourth episode are inserted at more or less regular intervals in the investigation of the two friends. You got it right. Chloe and Max finally go on the attack. So let's see how they fared, and what these twists are (spoilers coming!). Despite its delays and stumbles, Life is Strange manages to put enough fuel into its story Manhunt We mentioned that at the beginning of the episode Max and Chloe have another long moment together. Between repetitions we leave Chloe's bedside to take something from her and have a look around. The situation is very natural, everyday. Then out of the blue Chloe asks us if we're willing to let her die. A boulder thrown at the speed of a meteorite in conversation. The girls' eyes suddenly turn red and we have to make our decision. Here's a clumsy attempt to wreak havoc on the dozing player from the conversation. The nonchalant way in which the theme of euthanasia is introduced is so improbable, and the speed with which the scene is resolved, improbable, as to put even the well-disposed player to the test. What's worse, Max is about to fix everything by returning the world to the state where Chloe isn't paralyzed on a bed. Therefore one decision is as good as another. The game was just kidding. Fortunately, the situation is resolved at the moment of the second twist, the confrontation with Frank, in which the two girls discover they know how to kill, if necessary. We liked this passage because it can be replayed over and over using Max's powers sensibly. Each avenue gives us new insights into how Frank might react and allows us to manipulate our own destiny to the fullest. In this central part, the game allows itself a series of quite rich puzzles, at least for the genre. Some are simple to solve, but the one about analyzing clues might give you some pleasant headaches. However, the solution to the investigation could divide souls. If you've been hoping for a Twin Peaks-style mystery, you'll be disappointed, because the game goes in the direction of the cold sex maniac, the territory of Men who hate women, so to speak. However, it must be said that two moons shine in the sky, so we are still in time for some twists on the edge of reality. Thus we come to the third part of the episode, the one that convinced us to promote it beyond sufficiency. Indeed, the sequence of Max and Chloe at the party has the right rhythm, the environment is believable, the tension from waiting for Nathan Precott grows with every minute we spend looking for him and more than one secondary character reaches what seems to be the sa final evolution. The conclusion, undoubtedly of great effect, could be partly taken for granted precisely because it did not want to be. The attacker is in fact not who we expected him to be, and this is the predictable part. His real identity, however, we must admit that caught us unprepared. The next episode will therefore be the final test for the series.", "date": "2015-08-01", "grade": "7.4"}
