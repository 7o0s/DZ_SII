{"name": "Il calcio nelle mani", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/109395-fifa-13-il-calcio-nelle-mani.html", "text": "Regardless of the bugs that have emerged in recent days relating above all to the Italian commentary, to some freezes that would seem to occur during the Career mode by acquiring players on a free transfer and some problems always on the market, on which EA is working hard to resolve in a hopefully short time, However, FIFA 13 has once again marked another step forward for the series, at least in terms of gameplay and other functions. In this sense, the EA title continues to be the best available on the market as regards football simulations, a ~feature~ that the development team wants to try to maintain on PlayStation Vita as well, trying to bring it to Sony's ~mobile~ console as well all the positive aspects of the domestic counterpart. In reality, however, it must be said that this thirteenth chapter of the saga, the second to see the light on Vita, is much more similar to its predecessor FIFA Football than to the edition whose name it bears. In fact, the product offers more or less the same modalities present in the latter mentioned, some of which are proposed again with some modifications or cuts (others, such as for example the Ultimate Team or the EA Sports Football Club are completely absent), but in purely technical terms it appears as an upgrade of the one already available on the new platform of the Japanese company. But let's take it one step at a time. In the game you can play the classic friendlies, all the championships and the related national cups, the various official tournaments of the series and the customized ones; the Professional mode as a goalkeeper or footballer, the online mode, which however we will talk about in a little more detail later, the brand new Head-to-Head Seasons mode, and finally the Career, as always the beating heart of genre productions and specifically of EA sports titles. Career and Head to Head In the aforementioned modality it is in fact possible to undertake that of a simple player or goalkeeper, real or created from scratch (as always, you can also use your own virtual footballer, insert it in any team and use it in the various modalities, improving it with good performances) or coach-manager, therefore with the possibility, in addition to taking the field to lead the whole team, of managing the transfer market, training, training, the club's budget and much more, dividing between European, national and championship cups along a whole series of seasons (fifteen) just like in reality, living as the absolute protagonist of competitions with a real structure, complete with a constantly updated calendar, statistics and rankings linked to the results achieved. Even if some options present in the domestic counterpart are missing, this mode remains one of the most fun and complete to play. Going back to the online game, let's say that it is possible to try your hand at exciting head-to-head challenges, even 11 against 11, create your own personalized tournament, lobbies and challenge gamers from all over the world in quick normal or customized matches, ranked and unranked ranked, comparing your online statistics with the rest of the globe or with friends. During our test we found excellent matchmaking, but also a fluctuating fluidity with regard to the games played due to a dancer frame-rate. All this does not affect the usability of the product in the game via the internet but it is certainly something that cannot but clash with the general quality that the title is able to offer instead. Closed the discourse on the various game options of FIFA 13 let's analyze the part played. The gameplay, as mentioned at the beginning, is more similar to that of FIFA Football than anything else, so he is inevitably the benchmark for FIFA 13 for Vita. Game speed and other parameters, such as the possibility of choosing manual or assisted controls and, in addition, that of integrating Vita's touch controls, for completely renewed management of actions and athletes, can be set as the user prefers in the field. PSVita trophies FIFA 13 offers users 39 Trophies divided as follows: 24 Bronze, 11 Silver, 3 Gold and 1 Platinum. To obtain them you must meet certain parameters such as for example to score at least one goal or make 100 passes using the tactile commands of Vita or to win a game using only the manual controls. A handful of trophies must then be unlocked by playing online, as in the case of the one obtained by playing 100 ranked Head-to-Head challenges. With fingers In the first case we have the usual use of sticks, buttons and so on with a couple of differences in the mapping of some commands due to the manualR2 and L2 triggers, but the same excellent response to inputs, while in the second, as in FIFA Football, the front and rear touch of the console are used respectively to carry out any type of pass and shot. In detail, when you want to set up an action, just press your fingertip on the console screen near the player you want to get the ball to then serve him automatically low shot or high ball. The type and success or otherwise of the service will be determined by factors such as the pressure exerted by the finger, the distance between the teammates involved in the action and the technical value of both: the CPU will take care of the rest and regulate the power and pass accuracy. As for the shots, these are performed via the Vita's rear touchpad which is considered by the game as the opponent's goal. When you are near or inside the penalty area, just touch the area of the console corresponding to the mirror of the goal where you want to direct the shot to see it then made by the player in that direction. For example if you press the bottom left back of the touchpad, the virtual athlete on the field will kick to the bottom corner, and so on. This function becomes particularly fun during free kicks, where it is also possible to kick by literally drawing the trajectory on the touchscreen and also adjusting the effect. Unfortunately this year too we have to highlight some problems related to these tactile commands: for example, with them it can be difficult to manage an athlete with the analog and at the same time use the screen by placing a finger on it to select a teammate to give him the ball or to take control of it in case of defensive action, covering the view for a few moments, or it is easy to shoot involuntary shots by accidentally moving while holding the console. Notable improvements If what has been described up to now confirms the similarities mentioned several times in this article between FIFA 13 and FIFA Football, the situation is different with regard to artificial intelligence, the impact engine and tactical defense: in all three cases in fact, they record significant improvements that differentiate these elements in the two games. In fact, the first performs better than the previous edition, especially in the management of tactics, changes and movement of the players on the pitch; the second, while confirming itself as a reduced version of the one available in FIFA 13 for home consoles, still appears better implemented in favor of more credible contrasts, without prejudice to the vital importance of doubling the marking to be recalled at the right time; finally the third, albeit simplified, seems at least to give less space to the constant pressure of the pressing button in favor of a greater strategy in the non-possession phase. Let's close our review by talking about the graphic sector of the product and the audio one. Graphically, the title is really nice to look at, with bright colors, a very sharp image definition and well-made textures to cover environments and players. The latter are reproduced quite well and can boast extremely detailed polygonal models, which are particularly enhanced in the workmanship of the faces, at least for those of the most famous athletes. In terms of licenses there are, as always, many teams and official championships, so the title offers in this sense an excellent reproduction of the shirts with lots of sponsors and logos in evidence. The sound, on the other hand, re-proposes the commentary in Italian by Fabio Caressa and Beppe Bergomi, which here works normally unlike the domestic versions. However, as unfortunately tradition by now, the sentences and comments are always the same recycled from past years with some exceptions: and to think that even the commentary of the dynamic duo of Sky present in FIFA 10 for PlayStation 2 is much more complete and full of sentences ( seeing is believing), so it would be enough to take that one by weight and transfer it to Vita to have a better one. For the rest we have the same excellent match audio effects and the series of musical pieces already appreciated in the home counterparts of the production.", "date": "2012-10-11", "grade": "7.0"}
