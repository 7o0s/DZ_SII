In the case of GAMEVIL, we are talking about one of the most successful Korean teams, which has received various international awards and which boasts a respectable catalogue, very varied in its offer and attentive to all types of gamers. GAMEVIL is also the team responsible for the creation, in addition to the excellent Zenonia, also of that visual/playful delirium that responds to the name of NOM (play on words?), an action game that defining original is an understatement but which could not mix freshness , style and fun in equal measure. In short, from this point of view, the experiment carried out with VANQUISH: The Oath of Brothers has the flavor of a ~second attempt~ in the name of innovation: a slash'em-up set in feudal Japan and characterized by almost in black and white, sometimes stylized and essential, in which often the only warm color we see is the red of the blood of the killed enemies. This is Shogun Mitsukuni Mito! An original graphic style, we said: the new GAMEVIL title focuses entirely on the visual impact, and in addition to the ~noir~ approach, it plays the card of a three-dimensional representation of the battlefield out of the ordinary. Our character moves on horseback and runs towards the enemy army to defeat it, complete with kinetic lines to underline the dynamism of the action; when it moves vertically, however, the scenario ~rotates~ following its movement and things start to not add up: opponents who should be approaching move away, the perspective changes and it becomes much more complicated to understand exactly where we are. Fortunately, the gameplay asks us to think little and act a lot, so just press the attack button continuously (possibly alternating it with the ~charge~ button or holding it down for a long time for a disruptive ~lightning~ maneuver) and don't care if the soldiers whether or not we mow need to move faster than the horse's run or be somewhere else when the view changes. The variations on the theme are few, in fact: the bosses to be eliminated at the end of each stage, far from unforgettable; the presence of allies who run with us and who must be protected; the ability to restart the game using one of the unlockable characters once finished. In the end, the game action turns out to be very limited and repetitive, and unfortunately the originality of the graphics and the courage of some innovative choices are not enough to put a piece together. The control system is classic, with a virtual stick at the bottom left of the touch screen and some buttons for attacking. Unfortunately, the movement of the character, also due to the discussion on perspective made previously, always appears chaotic and imprecise. Similarly, collision detection has been implemented somewhat haphazardly, further detracting from the quality of the experience. Finally, the sound sector is largely forgettable in its paucity.
