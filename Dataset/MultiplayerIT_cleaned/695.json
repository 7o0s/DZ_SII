{"name": "Condemned: Criminal Origins - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/condemned-criminal-origins-recensione.html", "text": "Be very afraid... Thus begins the surprise title of this Christmas lineup of XBox 360, an atypical FPS, with very strong fighting game grafts, son of an iconography with a strong cinematographic mold, but not only. The first example that comes to mind, right from the opening credits, is Seven by David Fincher, with its apocalyptic, morbid and death-bearing atmosphere, but also, in the video game field, the oriental saga of Silent Hill. This means that darkness will follow the protagonist everywhere, lapped only by the weak light of the torch. The aim is to investigate the traces left by the killer, discover the truth, and bring the fur back home. If you accept the challenge, 10 chapters full of twists and turns, dilapidated locations, pitch darkness and an infinite number of objects to use to defend yourself await you. We were talking about fighting games, remember? The serial killer isn't the only problem, the streets are infested with homicidal psychopaths that Ethan will inevitably face. There are few firearms, non-existent bullets, an extremely precarious condition that will soon make it necessary to use the most varied weapons: bars, wooden beams, pieces of pipes, and everything we can find along our way. ESP Multiplayer doesn't want to reveal further about the interesting plot concocted by Monolith, but the necessary revelation of the aforementioned psychopaths is an intriguing pretext to oppose the player with an artificial intelligence capable of giving variety and challenge to the clashes. This means that the enemies will behave in an absolutely unpredictable way, looking for objects of offense before lashing out against the protagonist, or uniting with other arrivals, or even hiding or attacking from behind. The possibilities are truly numerous and help to amplify the drama of the action. It is very difficult to describe it in the review, but we assure you that the experience with this game will remain etched in the memory for a long time. ESP To further underline this factor contributes the excellent melee combat system devised by the programmers. In addition to the possibility of parrying opponents' blows, Ethan can use a teaser, the police electroshock pistol, to disarm the aggressor. It is also possible to inflict the coup de grace as a fatality, by selecting one of the possible (and gruesome) offensive actions on the directional cross. The animations of the characters turn out to be exceptional, as well as the effect of the blows suffered by the protagonist, among the most realistic ever seen in this kind of product. Taking advantage of a link with FEAR, another Monolith title from which Condemned shares physics and graphics engine, the game features numerous hallucinatory sequences, related to Ethan's extrasensory abilities, functional not only to scare the player, but also to understand the pieces of the cryptic narrative plot . CSI extension In precise moments established by the cpu, we will be called upon to collect certain clues in the scenario, using special scientific equipment. These investigative phases provide additional narrative elements to the story, but mainly serve to break up the exploration and combat phases. It's just a pity that the procedure is very driven by the game through the instructions given by Rosa via mobile phone, thus making it mechanical and sequential (if we exclude a particular chapter). To counterbalance the potential boredom of the act contribute the morbid and intriguing clues, and some masterful low blow. The use of sound is excellent. Instead of music, the game features complex industrial sounds to provoke precise emotions in the player, from fear to fear, and identify him in the situation. It's nothing new, but the effectiveness with which Condmned manages to raise tension is, even with the simple sound of distant footsteps. It is very difficult to describe it in the review, but we assure you that the experience with this game will remain etched in the memory for a long time. My kingdom for a crowbar! Technically Condemned does not show off a technical sector capable of seriously exploiting the capabilities of the new Microsoft platform, but its close relationship with FEAR guarantees a visual rendering of considerable impact. The characters are modeled with a good number of polygons, while the use of high quality textures and lighting gives an impressive visual realism. The physics of the engine is really very good and involves not only the protagonist and enemies, but also different elements of the scenario. Taking advantage of an hdtv type connection, it is possible to enjoy greater definition of the textures, and a much cleaner general image. Unfortunately though, it's impossible not to highlight a series of defects caused by the haste of the release, especially clipping and polygonal interpenetration, perceptible despite the perennial low visibility offered to the player. The framerate doesn't always manage to handle the action, a defect that doesn't affect the experience, but leaves a slight bitterness in the mouth when thinking about the specifics of the platform. The characters are modeled with a good number of polygons, while the use of high quality textures and lighting gives an impressive visual realism My kingdom for a crowbar! We leave the level design for last, the quality of which fluctuates. Despite the strong linearity of the adventure, too often the player finds himself completely disoriented in corridors similar to each other, thanks to the lack of any map, and the obligation to use specific weapons (symbolic keys) to open some doors does not help in this sense. The overall duration is around ten hours of play, an average time for this type of adventure, but it must be considered that a large part is spent wandering around in circles or searching for the aforementioned weapons. As far as options are concerned, there is no multiplayer mode. The only incentive to pick up the title once completed, consists in the discovery of some bonus items designed to unlock movies and conceptual artwork. The game is in English with Italian subtitles of excellent workmanship. Comment Condemned is a decidedly adult detective-horror with character, which will not fail to satisfy fans of the genre. The use of the subjective amplifies the sense of immersion, the audio gives real thrills, while the alternation of fights and investigations gives a certain variety to the gameplay. The story is intriguing and unpredictable, even if not without inevitable cryptic points subject to interpretations of the case. Too bad for a not always brilliant level design and the technical realization not exactly next generation. But they are defects that we can overlook given the intensity of the adventure. The base created by Monoltih Studios is very good and original, full of interesting ideas for a future sequel. Until then, you can enjoy one of the brightest horror experiences in recent years, provided you do it with the lights on... Pros Great atmosphere Well-crafted audio compartment Twisted and intriguing story Cons Graphically the 360 can do better Level design not always satisfactory Let the impressionable abstain Not a good day for Agent Ethan Thomas. When he entered the homicide section, he thought he'd earn easy compensation bivouacking through paperwork, he never would have thought he'd be looking for a ruthless serial killer, a macabre exterminator of women they call a ~marriage agent~. But now there is no time for memories, we need to act, and quickly. Because Ethan is a hunted man tonight, his former colleagues hold him accountable for a crime he never committed. And maybe the marriage broker had something to do with it. Why all this, and why him? The only possibility is to find the killer, perhaps with the telephone help of Rosa, her contact at the FBI, or perhaps that mysterious individual who seems to be stalking him. Ethan grabs his service pistol and lets himself be swallowed by the darkness, heedless of the menacing shapes that are following him...", "date": "2005-12-14", "grade": null}
