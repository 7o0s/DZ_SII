As often happens for the productions of the French house, the game is undoubtedly ~inspired~ by the famous Minna no Golf (Everybody's Golf in the West), of which it takes its mechanics and style to adapt them in the best way to the characteristics of Apple devices. The second episode was also converted for Nintendo 3DS and published on the related eShop (with the title of Let's Golf! 3D), even if the results of this operation didn't seem extraordinary to us, especially from a technical point of view. In short, the Let's Golf! franchise now boasts a large number of enthusiasts all over the world; So why not make it a freemium title? After all, it is a model that is catching on, especially among the most popular series, and which allows you to play completely free if you agree to submit to certain limits. In the case of Let's Golf! 3, these limits are represented by the amount of ~energy~ our character has, which is consumed to the extent of one point for each hole and which can be recharged in three different ways: by waiting for the timer to reach sixty minutes (l energy recharges by one point); purchasing energy points using virtual money; buying energy points using real money. We are well aware that there are freemium titles that offer in-game transactions that are not at all ~micro~ (see the case that broke out for GLU Mobile's Gun Bros), so it will be interesting to understand what exactly Gameloft's intentions are in relation to this new project. Pay and play? Started Let's Golf! 3 for the first time, the game ~leads us by the hand~ in creating a character, has us start a game and explains how the controls and interface work. The developers have therefore eliminated the roster of golfers present in the second episode (which also added an important replayability factor due to their differences) in favor of an alter ego that we can ~balance~ in a certain way and that we can grow and improve through the use of skill points, in a classic reward system characterized by good progression. We can also modify the appearance of the character by drawing hairstyles and clothes from the integrated shop and paying with virtual money. Better to be clear right away: despite all the possible preconceptions towards the freemium system, we played Let's Golf for literally hours! 3 and even had fun customizing our own golfer, all without breaking the bank. This is because the game, in its current form, rewards our skill and grants us a large amount of virtual money with each victory, thus allowing us, if necessary, to obtain energy points without putting a hand in our wallet. Furthermore, to make the experience as long and challenging as possible, Gameloft has seen fit to increase the number of modes and scenarios available. We can tackle the single player career in six different settings (Fiji Islands, Egypt, Ireland, China, ~Under the Sea~ and the Milky Way) that unlock as we level up. Each of them contains eighteen holes and three different ways to tackle them: ~stroke competition~, ~duel~ and ~challenge~. There are also multiplayer modes: from the online one for four players via the Gameloft Live service to the local one, taking turns, on the same device. In short, there is really a considerable amount of stuff and we will be able to spend hours and hours playing, deciding freely whether or not it is appropriate to spend some money for the purchase of extra elements, upgrades, clothes and so on. 'other. From a gameplay point of view, the game is basically unchanged from the second episode, so both the touch controls and the interface are really good. Instead, we noticed a slight step backwards from a technical and artistic point of view, with less ~brilliant~ scenarios than usual, polygonal models that would have benefited from a better definition of the edges and some annoying ~jerk~ in the frame rate.
