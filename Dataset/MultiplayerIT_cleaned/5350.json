There is no other way to effectively describe it. Whoever made it must have fed on Manowar, Judas Priest, Slayer and Blind Guardian records for years (there are four of the many feasible band names, don't get warm), there are so many references to the cultural styles of the genre that cross along the levels that compose it, from the shape of monsters to that of simple decorative elements. The Charged Attack Sure, it's also a pixel art platform action, i.e. a tribute to the Rastans, the Rygars and all the other titles of the genre that populated the 80s, but it's first of all a way to celebrate a certain culture, dedicating every single pixels. Slain is also an evolving project that knows where it comes from and, above all, knows where it wants to go. The first version, the one released in March 2016, was mediocre and with immense problems due to the control system and some big gameplay imbalances. The version we are reviewing, the second according to the count of Andrew Gilmour, the developer, is instead a captivating and bloody fresco in pixel art which, while not upsetting the world of video games, lets itself be lived from start to finish with great passion. Andrew did not want to abandon his creature, despite the initial failure and continued to work on it in the following months to fix all the critical issues identified, finally making it up to the expectations that had arisen around it. Sure, as we'll see, it still has flaws, in our opinion largely due to inexperience, but it's hard not to feel sympathy for what appears to be a work full of love and dedication. From grave to glory Slain begins in a tomb: the protagonist, an old bearded warrior named Bathoryn, is awakened from his eternal sleep to free six kingdoms from the evil that populates them. The plot is all here. The six kingdoms are as many levels populated by monsters of all sorts and lethal traps. Some bosses are really tough Bathoryn's sword will have to slice through living skeletons, demons of all kinds, flying heads, putrid growths that feed on miasmas, werewolves and many other creatures raised directly in hell. The first level is quite simple and is used to get familiar with the controls. The combat system is immediate, but not trivial as we will see. Bathoryn has a basic attack, which she can combine into a series of increasingly powerful chain blows, some magical powers, which we will discuss later and the classic parry, which stops the blows of the opponents but does not always prevent damage ( larger and more powerful enemies manage to partially ignore it). Holding down the attack key loads a more powerful blow, very useful against larger beasts, while parrying at the exact moment an enemy is about to injure us, you can carry out a very powerful counterattack, lethal for most opponents common. But we mentioned the magic. The friendly old man essentially has three powers: a basic energy attack, a charged attack, which is a more powerful variant of the basic one, and a super end of the world attack that can only be used when the magical energy bar, visible below that of life, is completely full. Obviously, each magical blow consumes a certain amount of energy, which can be recharged in various ways: by reaching one of the checkpoints or by eliminating enemies with a charged sword blow or with a counterattack. But we said that the first level is quite easy and can be overcome by dying only a handful of times. However, we will soon understand that the challenge offered by the game is much more difficult. We reviewed version 2 of Slain: a completely different game from the original release Difficulty Slain's levels aren't super long, but being able to complete them is another story. The developer seems to have done everything to put the player in difficulty, both by placing traps and enemies in an insidious way, and by creating bosses that are really difficult to defeat, each with its own attack pattern. Just to say, it took us a good half hour just to defeat Mamma Beholder, a nice lady who is not happy with shooting volleys of poisonous balls, she also enjoys giving birth like a bunny, quickly filling the screen with her insidious offspring. A race between wolves In some cases the difficulty consists only in finding the opponent's weak point, but in general the advanced levels of Slain are unforgiving and can require numerous attempts to be overcome. Especially some sections put you in great difficulty. In principle we have not had any problems with this feature, also becausegreat commitment is followed by the satisfaction of having made it. In some cases, however, there are naiveties that are not justifiable. For example, there are sections where the checkpoints are placed far apart from each other, while in others they are too close together. Sometimes they also create some annoyance, such as when you find yourself with a secret immediately after the checkpoint of a very difficult section: since the game only records progress when you touch one of the checkpoints, every time you die you have to go and get it again the secret. It's a waste of a minute's time, but multiply that by, say, twenty attempts and you'll see that it's not pleasant. As we said earlier, many of the imbalances of the first version have been resolved, but something remains. Bathoryn has three types of swords: the basic one, a flaming sword and a frozen axe. The game makes it clear that against some enemies it is better to use one weapon rather than another, but in the long run, when things get complicated, you tend to always keep the same one so as not to get confused while risking your life. Pixel art work From a technical point of view, Gilmour's game is a little jewel in pixel art, with rich, very detailed and animated scenarios and well-designed and animated characters in an excellent way. There is no shortage of light and particle effects, especially related to powers and the blood that rushes across the screen while fighting. Some disturbing characters give us details on the story There is also no shortage of impromptu animations, such as the one celebrating the metal god after the victory against a boss, which will make concert-goers happy. Of course, to appreciate Slain from a graphic point of view you must necessarily like his gothic style, in which the baroque quantity of details is functional to the culture from which it derives. The exact same can be said for the soundtrack, essentially made up of metal pieces that will delight fans. Speaking of flaws, perhaps the worst afflicting the game is the lack of variety. Of course, being very difficult, it is right that it was thought around a few mechanics that are continuously put under stress, but it is also true that apart from a few situations, such as running in wolf form, Slain tends to be quite a bit repetitive, even if it doesn't last long. It takes a few hours to finish the game. How much it is? Let's say five, but a lot depends on the skill shown. Some passages may in fact require many attempts to be overcome, greatly lengthening the game time. However it doesn't cost much and if you want you can replay it at least a couple of times, even just to retry some passages.", "date": "2016-08-15", "grade": "8.0"}
