{"name": "Act of War: High Treason - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/act-of-war-high-treason-recensione.html", "text": "Original language To be clear immediately: this expansion ~suffers~ from the same problem as 90% of those that come out, in practice the speech in Italian disappears. In this case it is also a good thing, given that the cutscenes with flesh and blood actors of the original game were dubbed by the usual four voices which often prove inadequate. High Treason stayed with the English dub, which is still very effective. For non-English speakers we find subtitles in Italian and also the translation of the video writings. As for the sound effects we find a more than adequate sector, with shots, explosions and dialogues that are always spot on and often effective. The music section occasionally offers dramatic pieces that are well suited to the dynamism of the situations. At times it seems to be watching a film about terrorism! Well done! Shoot the President! As for the multiplayer, in addition to the classic modes already seen in the original, we find two new interesting options: ~Marine One Shot Down~ and ~Scud Hunt~. The first turns out to be very tactical as it involves escorting the President to a specific point on the map. It is not possible to kill it or carry it on vehicles, let alone construct buildings/units. Reinforcements can only be received at checkpoints controlled by us. The result is a frenetic and neighborhoodless mode, with continuous passing of the ~ball~ between opponents. To try. The second mode is a variant of the deathmatch, which involves reaching the Scud missile launcher. The player who takes possession of it can launch devastating attacks. The downside is its vulnerability: in the event of an explosion this causes enormous damage to nearby structures and units. After a while it will reappear at the starting point. Surely the longevity of the game increases even more thanks to the various types of clashes. In addition, there is also the skirmish to fight up to 8 opponents controlled by the CPU. Final comment After a year, Atari offers us a worthy and full-bodied expansion of the original game. About thirty missions, mostly long-lived and linked by a new all in all engaging storyline. The introduction of mercenaries and naval units then offers interesting variables in terms of gameplay, greatly expanding the possibilities (which go far beyond the usual ~search and destroy~). The graphics always look good and the new multiplayer modes are definitely worth a look. A must for those who have fully appreciated the first course. Also recommended to all strategy lovers, who can now find the game plus the ~gold~ edition expansion in stores. Pros Lots of new units and upgrades Tactical and gameplay innovations Improved longevity and multiplayer Cons: Some graphical bugs Less engaging in terms of movies Sometimes very difficult Act of War part two High Treason is the official expansion of the acclaimed Act of War: Direct Action, an interesting RTS released last year under the Atari brand. After about a year it will be possible to try your hand at a completely new campaign, which picks up the events from where we left off. It is also possible to tackle the missions without necessarily having to complete them, but in this case the tasty plot is lost. The innovations introduced are not few: in addition to the classic new units (several ones have been added, especially aerial ones) we find the possibility of fighting by sea which greatly enriches the thickness of the gameplay with respectable naval battles. Another important addition is that of mercenaries: they allow you to expand and improve your army with various types of units, compensating for their weaknesses! Given the variety offered by these, one could almost speak of a new faction, which however has the defect of being very expensive. Purchasing this type of item has high costs that often lead to spending everything. If unfortunately you run out of money, the contract will expire and the mercenaries will withdraw! If it is true that AoW does not distort the RTS, there is no doubt that it expands its depth with significant tactical elements Act of War part two The side inherent in marine combat is certainly the ~completion~ of the Act of War universe: although it is certainly not a novelty in strategic (remember Red Alert?) the possibility of moving fleets and using them for support and land preparation expands even more more the remarkable variety offered by the title. In fact, we must not forget the secondary side of upgrades and special abilities, which in this expansion sees several new features, first of all the ability to use the air vehicles present on the boats, whether they are helicopters or fighters. Speaking of artificial intelligence I wasAfter the game at medium level it gets tougher: the number of enemies has considerably increased, and especially in missions with few men adequate tactical planning is required. If it is true that AoW does not overturn RTS, there is no doubt that it broadens its depth with important tactical elements, which can really make the difference in dealing with different situations; and this expansion is no less, offering moments of real tension that involve a lot! Progress has also been made in terms of duration: now most of the missions take longer to complete and there are several secondary objectives that you can try to achieve (often it can come in handy!). Clapperboard! DO NOT turn! The bitter (so to speak) news is that the cutscenes with the actors seen in the first episode give way to those in computer graphics. While it is true that the acting was certainly not the best, all in all the cinematic aspect of the game was somehow even more immersive. In High Treason, on the other hand, we find rather short clips which however lose the ~interactive film~ characteristic of Act of War. Act of Graphic The graphic part has remained substantially unchanged, with the addition of some timid shaders. Strangely we notice a worsening in the shadows that were well done in the previous version while here they show (sometimes) in blocks (hard to believe it's intentional, more probably a bug or some incompatibility). As in the predecessor, you will be able to enjoy an excellent creation of the maps, with attention to the smallest details. Buildings, roads, vehicles and objects are all well built, as is the new naval component. The effect of the sea is pleasant and the battles between fleets have their why. It is always possible to zoom and rotate to the maximum on the map to see the single details from every angle (except in rare cases for gameplay needs). Negative note is the usual angularity of the soldiers, which however is certainly not worse than more recent productions such as Empire at War. Finally, it sometimes happens that the terrorists hit on different heights make strange leaps, making their departure unrealistic. The fact remains that Act of War after a year holds up (if not even surpasses) the comparison with the other RTS in circulation, offering a respectable graphics engine and not too expensive in terms of hardware.", "date": "2006-04-05", "grade": null}
