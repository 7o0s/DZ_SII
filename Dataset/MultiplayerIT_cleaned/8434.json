Not always, mind you, but often yes. The first minutes of The Queen of Whispers are a concentrate of powerful, impactful, bewitching emotions and sensations and at the same time able to petrify you if you are passionate about the narrative of the Bungie universe. The moment in which the fact of being in front of a character introduced (in a superficial way, with a hint) 12 years ago is realized, perhaps remains one of the moments that will probably remain indelible in the mind of the writer. Realizing that you are part of an artistic project of this size, for a player, is an indispensable resource, a feeling that must be preserved as a protector of that feeling of being a child that allows you to live carefree what you have in front of you. We have told you our first considerations on The Queen of Whispers once the main campaign of the new major expansion of Destiny 2 is completed. Now, however, after having stripped all the contents of the released launch, we are ready to tell you our definitive opinion in our review of Destiny 2 : The Queen of Whispers. An impactful narrative Destiny 2: Queen of Whispers: Savathun's Throneworld As mentioned earlier on these pages, Bungie's narrative has definitely improved over the years. The awareness with which much of the current dynamics of the Destiny 2 plot are proposed is decidedly of a high level. Without too many spoilers of course, the figure of the Witness will have a central role in the coming years and the idea that it is being treated in a similar way to what Marvel did with Thanos can only give fans hope. This parallelism arises from the fact that by now we have seen how Bungie is able to create that construction of the hype towards the most important villains, which has been the central point of Marvel's MCU for years. What has been done with Savathun is minimally what has now begun with the Witness and at the level of judgment, we can tell you that it was masterfully orchestrated. Main narrative, secondary, but also implicit and explicit narrative, raids, assaults, campaign, all of the lore-rich contents have fulfilled their duty both in the creation of the hype and in the materialization of an enemy, precisely Savathun, who respected the waited brilliantly. La Megera Regina is on balance a sneaky combination of acumen, elegance, power and even sweetness. Savathun shows the players, if still needed, that it is the point of view from which one looks at an event that changes the perception about it. Deception is a load-bearing element, a pillar that supports the whole narrative. The idea of being constantly misled, misled and manipulated overwhelms the player, enveloping and knocking him over again and again. What is being told is a story that encompasses classic elements of the Bungie narrative, but which also tries to vary, to paint new nuances through the creation of cases to be solved, as if the player were a detective who connects the dots to arrive at the conclusion of an investigation. However, once the legendary campaign is over, the whole beating heart emerges, set also and above all in the Raid. The end-game activity par excellence is on a narrative level an antechamber of what we will begin to see with greater force in the coming months waiting for Lightfall. What we can tell you is that really, at this point Bungie has unleashed the big loads going to hit the hearts of fans and intriguing newcomers to the series with very dark themes. A granite gameplay Destiny 2: Queen of Whispers: Savathun's design As we have said several times, Destiny's gunplay is perhaps one of the most solid on the market. Satisfying, varied and now perfectly oiled in its mechanisms, it manages to give excellent feeling with all weapons. For this reason, the introduction of a new weapon archetype is always big news at Bungie. With the Queen of Whispers, the introduction of the Falcione has clearly intrigued everyone and we can tell you that what we have seen is definitely excellent. The design and feel given by the first melee weapon to be used in first person (the sword changes the view of the game in third), is excellent. This is not an overwhelming weapon in its legendary version, but certainly an excellent solution as it is a hybrid between medium and short range. As for the exotic glaives, they offer some interesting variables thanks to their unique ability, but they need to be explored further to understand their actual usefulness.three two big news regarding the gameplay are the Crafting and the Legendary version of the campaign. Speaking of the difficult mode of the main story missions, we were able to express ourselves positively earlier, praising this system capable of offering new challenges especially to players more accustomed to Bungie's modus operandi in its videogame epic. The news that emerged in our recent interview with the developers remains excellent, regarding the return of this feature also in Lightfall. Destiny 2: Queen of Whispers: The Spectre of Savathun As far as Crafting is concerned, however, the story is different. What Bungie has done allows players to choose which weapon to forge (or reforge) and with which peculiarities to do it. However, this is obviously limited in two ways to balance this possibility: firstly with the use of consumable materials for the use of forging, secondly by restricting the basket of weapons that can be created. If from the point of view of balance this is still an excellent choice, from the point of view of consumables a little less. The only flaw found in this expansion is in fact the excessive request for materials for forging, also given by the somewhat fallacious management of the drop of weapons of the new 6-player activity of the expansion. Nothing that is not already in the filing phase, but in any case at present it remains a small neo. Just in terms of activities, if on the previous occasion we had the opportunity to talk about the normal ones, here we can also celebrate the excellent success of the end-game activity par excellence: the Raid. Disciple's Promise, this is its name, is really an excellent instance. Difficult, challenging, full of new mechanics and very artistically inspired. Although the Infamous are a decidedly underappreciated race, this Raid has been able to create a convincing blend capable of enhancing every positive aspect of all the components in the game, culminating with an exciting peak in the final battle with the boss. Maximum Artistic Inspiration Destiny 2: Queen of Whispers: Savathun, Oryx and Xivu Arath Weapons, armor, setting, narrative, audio sector and activities. The masterful set put in place by Bungie for The Queen of Whispers is truly able to make this expansion the best ever. Each of the areas just mentioned is rich in art, and every single part is perfectly connected by a coherent and harmonious red thread that enhances all the positive sides of each aspect. Savathun and its throneworld are a stunning beauty to explore. A horrific playground in which to wallow in search of secrets and mysteries, seeking the wide open spaces to receive a mouthful of oxygen from the narrow corridors of the fortress. A French Gothic style reminiscent of Notre-Dame, but which also takes full advantage of the medieval fortresses of the most classic western fantasy. Bungie's sci-fi epic once again proved to be an alcove of pure art, a design forge capable of subverting rules and canons while remaining faithful to the highest trappings of the reference genre. Also and above all at an audio level, The Queen of Whispers excels by proposing both a soundtrack of the highest level and an incredible sound design that accompanies the player in the darkest descents with horrific themes, but also presses him in excited moments in open spaces with a push remarkable emotional.", "date": "2022-03-13", "grade": "9.0"}
