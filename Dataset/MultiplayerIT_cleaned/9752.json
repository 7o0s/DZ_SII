R-Type also arrived in 1987, a horizontal scrolling shooter that introduced several innovations for the time such as the possibility of accumulating the laser beam to release a more powerful one, things which, it seems stupid to say now, at the time gave rise to to different variations of gameplay and the way to other masterpieces of the genre inspired by it. He's not handsome but he's a dude Welcome to 2010, the Dutch division of Electronic Arts has decided to re-propose the original version in all respects, adapting the resolution to the iPhone screen and also proposing the original one dressed up by the arcade cabinet that fills the rest of the available space. Therefore, in command of the R-9 Arrowhead spacecraft, the aim is to get the better of the Bydo empire through eight horizontally scrolling levels, at the end of which there is the classic boss who needs more coordination to be eliminated. There are three control methods available associated with automatic fire or not: the first involves the use of the accelerometer to move the spacecraft, the second dragging the finger on the screen and the third finally virtual commands like a coin-op . The one that works best is certainly the touch version, but in any case we are not fully satisfied because it still has some precision and response problems especially when the spacecraft moves to the edges of the screen or has to avoid heavy volleys of bullets; considering that the checkpoints are relatively few, this thing is not at all pleasing. The distinctive element of the R-Type gameplay is in any case represented by the possibility of acquiring force modules after eliminating a certain type of opponent. These modules can add support fire in one of the four cardinal points relative to the main spacecraft, but the interesting thing is that they can be hooked by the spacecraft itself on the front, in such a way as to increase direct fire and above all use them as a shield from a most of the bullets coming from the front. For the rest, as at the time, the game remains rather difficult to deal with already in normal mode without counting the delirious one, but this is also due to the aforementioned checkpoints and the imperfect control system. There is also a game mode that returns infinite lives, but in this way the whole challenge goes down the drain. Beyond the perfect transposition and the nostalgic element for what was a masterpiece at the time, the lack of a graphic review to current standards, of sensible additional modes rather than any online integration between modes and scores heavily undermine a product which cannot have the same appeal of the time and is indeed and if we want to rightly aged to the point of making it difficult to recommend it even to the most avid nostalgics, also because this is just one of its umpteenth transpositions of the original title.
