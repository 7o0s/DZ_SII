A certainly divisive title, given its hybrid nature: developed by Koei Tecmo, it is basically a musou, albeit much more articulated and refined than many other exponents of the genre. Overseen by Eiji Aonuma himself, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, not to be confused with the previous Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition, we really liked, and the Expansion Pass announced at the same time promised very interesting additional content. On balance, a DLC is something that can be of interest, by its very nature, only to those who have appreciated the title that it would enrich. It is very difficult for a DLC to overturn the quality of a game, and therefore represents an expense, if there is actually a cost, to be considered only if you enjoyed it from the start. In this sense, the Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity Expansion Pass belongs to that category of paid content that is basically purchased on trust. We liked the first part of this Expansion Pass, released last June: if you have read our review of The Ancestral Beat, then you will know that we had postponed the overall judgment to the second part of the Expansion Pass. Well, the time has come to sum up in our review of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity - The Keeper of Memories. The EX missions Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Rovely and Pruna in a scene from the game The ancestral beat, the first DLC of this Expansion Pass, added very little on the narrative front to a game which, however, challenging the divisive environmental narrative of Breath of the Wild, told us a story quite full of cinematics, retrospectives and dialogues well dubbed into Italian . A year later it should now be known that Age of Calamity, while telling the background to Breath of the Wild, at a certain point diverged from the pre-established mythology, establishing a real alternative timeline. The ancestral beat that, perhaps, at this point, we would have preferred as the second part of the Expansion Pass, focused entirely on the gameplay with a scheme to be completed in the Ancient Court Laboratory (EX) to unlock new weapons and upgrades by repeating the missions ad nauseam unpublished in order to accumulate the numerous materials required. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity Expansion Pass adds new monsters If The ancestral beat represented an optional content for completionists, The Guardian of memories chooses a different approach: the new EX missions, in fact, enrich the story of The age of calamity, going to tell some backgrounds that better characterize the characters but, in definitive, they add little to the narrative fresco. Practically the introductory and final cinematics of these missions show us what happened in certain moments of the campaign, when we were engaged elsewhere, focusing above all on secondary characters such as the Champions and their descendants. It's an excuse to stage missions in unedited maps that show us Breath of the Wild's Hyrule before Ganon put it on fire: a delightful tribute for fans of the award-winning Nintendo open world. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Memory Quests unlock additional rewards Most of the EX missions added with the DLC also offer some secondary objectives, called Memory Missions. By fulfilling the indicated requirements, old and new materials are obtained which are then used to unlock new gameplay content: a new appearance for the weapons of the Champions and their descendants, as well as an unpublished EX personal action for each character that enriches the move pool . They are interesting abilities, both in function and in appearance. Impa, for example, can project his explosive illusory images after loading three symbols, while King Rhoam can abuse his ability to transform repeatedly without interrupting combos. Each character therefore gains a new fighting technique, but perhaps we would have preferred to play this DLC first, in the Expansion Pass, so as to be able to take advantage of these new gameplay elements much more. The new characters Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, complete the new campaign to unlock Rovely and Pruna Completing all main EX missions - there are some optional and very high level ones,which will require a lot of effort and concentration - this additional mini-campaign of the DLC is completed and a new character is unlocked... which are actually two: Rovely and Pruna. The two wacky scientists of the court laboratory fight together, or rather, Rovely fights wielding two Sheikah Arms while Pruna follows him. If Rovely's weapon is already bizarre - he practically uses two mechanical prostheses to hit enemies in a wide range - the personal action is even more bizarre: as soon as you press the ZR key, Pruna activates a random invention that will hit a certain area dealing damage to Rovely as well, if he's inside it at the moment of impact. It will therefore be our care to chain the attacks, always being ready to move so as not to get involved in the attacks of our battle partner. Beware of the following spoiler. Rovely and Pruna aren't the only addition to the cast. The ancestral beat had implemented a new character which, however, had not driven us crazy: the veteran Guardian was really anonymous, despite being an important fanservice for Breath of the Wild fans. We counted that Koei Tecmo would also add Astor to the roster, the villain that we discovered having summoned the Calamity Ganon, and therefore the culprit of every catastrophe, and we almost believed it when one of the new EX missions showed us this crucial moment in history . Instead Astor is not playable at all and to unlock the second character you need to complete a Secret Memory Mission in The Retreat of the Yiga (EX). If you can complete the task without losing any allies, then you will finally unlock Supa as well. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Supa is the ~secret~ character of the second DLC The unprecedented Yiga warrior introduced in the mythology of Breath of the Wild with Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity is a really powerful fighter, but not exactly easy to use. Supa wields her iconic dual blades and can ring in quick and powerful combos, but it's her personal action that steals the show: it's called Mind's Eye and can be used during a combo without interrupting it. By pressing ZR, Supa assumes a defensive position and instantly counterattacks an enemy blow, accumulating a charge up to a maximum of three: each new counterattack will inflict much more damage based on the number of these charges, but if the timing is wrong, each charge will be lost accumulated. Supa is a character that we could define as ~high risk, high reward~ and is very funny, but in the chaos of musou fights it is not exactly easy to intercept enemy attack animations, especially since the response time window is very short. Conclusion In conclusion, we might have expected a little more from this The Guardian of Memories, perhaps another character like Astor, who in any case was highly anticipated, but on balance the Expansion Pass of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity cannot be defined disappointing. Between the first and second parts, we are talking about a generous amount of content and hours of gameplay, which can exceed twenty or thirty if you want to complete each objective and unlock each power-up. Perhaps it would have been better to release this DLC first and then complete the Expansion Pass with the grind of The ancestral beat, but at the end of the day the reasoning made at the beginning is valid: if you liked and enjoyed the Breath of the Wild musou , then the Expansion Pass may be a valid purchase.", "date": "2021-11-08", "grade": null}
