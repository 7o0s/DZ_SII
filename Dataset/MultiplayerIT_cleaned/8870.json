The well-known production based on puppies has also landed on the new 3D platform since its launch, once again obtaining a good overall result. But competition, as we know, is good and right and that's why the always active Ubisoft has decided to ~take the field~ among kibbles, balls and various toys, releasing Puppies World 3D and thus providing dads with a new, further , a source of embarrassment when choosing the most suitable ~puppy toy~ for the increasingly demanding offspring. The importance of having a puppy In Puppies World 3D, before starting to look after your pet, you will literally be catapulted into a rather disturbing story, which would have the purpose of giving a semblance of a logical explanation to the presence of the various puppies: once you arrive in the city, in fact, you will be greeted by a pretty but decidedly intrusive saleswoman, busy working in the nearby pet shop. The diligent employee will thus make us sharers in the local custom, which provides for the obligatory possession of at least one dog for each inhabitant; to help us, we will then be given the opportunity to choose our first puppy for free (selectable from all the most famous dog breeds). Once chosen, brought home and having finally given it a name, the real interactive part begins: as usual, the health and care of our puppy completely depend on us. The satisfaction of his primary needs is indicated by 4 simple parameters: food, water, coat and fidelity. On the first two items there is very little to clarify: being a living creature, albeit virtual, the dog needs both to eat (choice between dry and wet foods) and water or milk; the coat, whether long or short, then needs at least one bath a day while fidelity, which essentially indicates the harmony with the master, increases based on the attention paid and the activities carried out together. In addition to the part related to simple survival, fortunately there are numerous related activities, related to keeping the new four-legged friend active. First of all, the training, which allows you to perform some of the most common movements, is structured in the form of a mini-game: once you have chosen the movement to learn by selecting the appropriate icon (you start from the simpler ones and then unlock the complex), you will need to find and drag the same image from the outside to the inside of the touch screen with the stylus, (choosing it from a succession of other moving images) 4 consecutive times within a few seconds. Repeating the exercise at least 4 more times will eventually make the puppy fully aware of the new stunt. 3D effect Stereoscopy adds an extra value to the puppies in Puppies World 3D: as with other games in which animals have to be looked after or in any case often viewed, the possibility of seeing them ~in the round~ is a significant plus. In this case, if you don't pay attention to the sketchy backdrops, the 3D is very pleasant and never annoying even at the highest levels. On the contrary, in 2D the title loses much of its charm, appearing almost old and uninteresting. Strolling with the paddle There are also many secondary objectives to be achieved, which can be viewed through the Challenges icon. However, the interaction does not require a precise purpose: always with the stylus, in fact, it will be enough to touch any part of the room for the animal to arrive with a whistle. Finally having his attention captured, it is possible to make him play with frisbies or balls, take him for a walk outside (thus knowing other people and making him carry out the more than natural ~needs~) or simply pet him until you drop. In the latter case, however, it is advisable to temporarily mute the audio to the 3DS, due to the inexplicable choice by the developers to make a prolonged and very annoying whistle sound coincide with each caress. Objects, food and accessories for customization can be purchased in the appropriate shop (which can also be reached directly via the menu, avoiding the walk) using the appropriate game credits; however, the availability of money will never be a big problem given the generous allocation that is usually given at the end of any activity carried out. When the confidence and training with your puppy is now at the highest levels, it is possible to publicly demonstrate what has been learned parparticipating in real dog competitions, in which to perform the exercises learned in private in front of a jury; definitely a fun choice that adds a dash of interest and motivation to the long time spent in training. As in the competition, even in Puppies World 3D there is the possibility of taking photographs and filling in data sheets to be exchanged via StreetPass, in addition to the always fun option of viewing in Augmented Reality using the appropriate card. Technically speaking, the polygonal models of the dogs appear to be of good quality, while the same cannot be said of their play environment, which is poorly maintained and substantially stylized. A small note goes instead to the menus, not always intuitive and clear. Although Nintendogs+Cats remains a step up both technically and, above all, in the ~physical~ interaction with animals, the Ubisoft title can be a welcome gift for the little ones, aware of the fact that, in strictly videogame terms, there is very little to do.", "date": "2011-12-13", "grade": null}
