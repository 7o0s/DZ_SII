This boring old man speech makes sense if we consider the history of the genre: derived from text adventures (what are now called ~Interactive Fiction~) this immediately tries to capture its users by making the transition from a completely textual interface less traumatic (the so-called ~parser~) to an essentially graphical one. The first graphic adventures were in this sense very cumbersome but at the same time they allowed the player many possibilities (~Zak McKranken~ and ~Maniac Mansion~ are still unbeaten from this point of view... and they were on a couple of floppies). As we know, with the increase in technical possibilities, all the various elements that gave the genre a certain complexity have been reduced. The decrease in the possibilities for interaction has forced the massive introduction of mechanical puzzles in order to allow the adventures to remain installed on the hard drives of the buyers for more than a few days. The superficialization of interfaces and the massive introduction of 3D into other genres has made graphic adventures suddenly ~obsolete~ from a technological and content point of view. Obsolescence has led to commercial death. At least in appearance. Return to the center of a genre ~Journey to the Center of the Earth~ immediately appears a strange adventure. The game, from the very first moments, seems to mean something different than the other titles of the genre. We will take on the role of Ariane, a journalist engaged in drafting a report for a scientific journal, who crashes in a rather remote place in Iceland with her helicopter. Soon the misadventure will turn into the possibility of her life by putting her in contact with a strange unknown civilization and with the truth about Professor Hardwigg's story, defined as a fake by the entire scientific community (he is the protagonist of Jules Verne's novel from which the title by Frogwares takes inspiration). To control Ariane we will have a very classic graphical interface made up of a few elements: the inevitable inventory (located at the bottom) while a pleasant addition, albeit not very original, is the presence of a laptop at the bottom left, with which to send and receive emails, collect information on various topics that will emerge during the game and catalog the documents found in the various locations. If desired, we can also use it as a browser to review the photos we can take of the more exotic scenarios with the camera provided (Ariane is a journalist anyway and has to do her job). The game, from the very first moments, seems to mean something different than the other titles of the genre. Return to the center of a genre As for the rest, the control system is the classic point-and-click one with the cursor that changes shape when it is on a hot spot, adapting to different needs. The view is generally in third person although, in some situations where a more detailed view is required, it will switch to first person. It is precisely in the first subjective location that the willingness of the developers to re-propose an element that seemed now lost in the adventures emerges: complexity. Final comment From a graphic point of view ~Journey to the Center of the Earth~ offers some very beautiful scenarios interspersed with others unfortunately subdued. Obviously there is a certain care of the more exotic locations with the search for a suggestion that manages to emerge only at times. There is nothing to complain about even miracles are to be expected (Syberia remains unbeaten in this respect). Overall, in conclusion, we are faced with an adventure suitable for an audience of shrewd players who have a lot of time to devote to the game. This feature, the complexity, is both the strength and weakness of ~Journey to the Center of the Earth~. Probably, if you love old graphic adventures and regret the times when you spent weeks on a puzzle, this is the game for you. All the others know what they are getting into and decide accordingly. Merits Good story Some excellent puzzles Beautiful scenarios Defects Tremendously difficult Waypoints sometimes unobtainable Sound subdued A sea of objects and puzzles ~Journey to the Center of the Earth~ is not a game of easy impact. As I said above, from the beginning we will have to deal with many objects and with some rather difficult puzzles. Let's face it that notwe will be given but little guidance to resolve them and the situation should appear clear. Often we find ourselves with an overflowing inventory of objects whose use we do not understand. If this could be seen as a flaw by all those who do not want to spend too much time on a single puzzle, it is true however that many could find the greater challenge that derives from it pleasant compared to today's average. Furthermore, the dislocation of the puzzles does not help the less experienced: the order in which to tackle them is not well understood and often it is not clear how to overcome them. The defect is evident above all in scenarios such as that of the city where there are dozens of places that can be visited with as many puzzles to solve. Often we find ourselves using random objects to try to get some useful result. The possibility of combining objects and using some of them independently, through a special menu that appears by hovering over them with the pointer, can further increase the sense of frustration. Let's also assume that some objects are small and can be seen with a certain difficulty (in the mine almost at the beginning of the game I found the chisel by pure chance, it was so small). Another problem encountered in the game is a certain difficulty in understanding where to go. Often the hot spots useful for moving from one location to another are ~hidden~ and it is difficult to find them quickly. So you spend a lot of time moving the mouse frantically trying to make the cursor appear with feet (the one that indicates the possibility of changing location). Sometimes it is even the design of the scenario that deceives, with drawn roads that are not passable or with doors that you think you have to enter but which are actually inaccessible.
