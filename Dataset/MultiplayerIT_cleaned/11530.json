{"name": "Asteroids", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/asteroids.html", "text": "There are games that have literally made history. Let's take Asteroids, for example: made in 1979, it's one of the first videogames that used vector graphics but above all it introduced the concept of ~inertial control~. In fact, the player not only had to destroy the asteroids that fell from every angle of the screen, but he had to move his ship taking into account the inertia of each movement. It was an explosive mixture in terms of gameplay, it is no coincidence that the coin-op was incredibly successful. Like any classic, Asteroids has been the protagonist of numerous remakes, therefore the one produced by Glu is not and will not be the last exponent of the genre. From the start screen we can start a quick game (with random settings), access the classic mode (ie the original Asteroids) or try our hand at the new ~Theme~ or ~Powerup~ modes. The first offers us the original mechanics dressed again, in this case we can choose between three different aspects: ~modern~, ~techno~ or ~virus~. The game is always the same, but the graphics are completely different: two-dimensional instead of vector, with backgrounds and so on. Finally, the ~Powerup~ mode changes things a bit: during our clashes with asteroids, in fact, we can collect fire power-ups that change the situation radically. Whatever our choice, the control system is based on the joystick and key 5: by pressing the first one to the right or left, our spacecraft rotates clockwise or counterclockwise, while by pressing it up or down respectively we can activate the thrusters (move, therefore) or activate the teleporter. This last possibility proves to be useful when there seems to be no escape, but the outcomes are absolutely uncertain: we could find ourselves in an area even more ~crowded~ by debris. The 5 key, of course, is used to shoot. The cadence of the shots increases according to the distance of the targets, a bit like what happened in another classic like Galaga. Glu has accustomed us to truly exceptional products from a technical point of view, but unfortunately this is not the case with this remake of Asteroids. The classic mode reproduces the original game faithfully, there is no doubt, but it is precisely from the ~alternative~ modes that it was reasonable to expect more. The adoption of bitmap graphics instead of the polygonal one can also be there, but the sprites are really trivial, made in an approximate way. And the sound sector can only count on catchy music, but which does not leave its mark. The control system is well organized and immediate, with a prompt response to inputs. PRO Faithful to the original Playable as always Nice new skins... AGAINST ...but could have been done better For <strong>Asteroids</strong> fans only Very limited sound", "date": "2008-03-28", "grade": "S.V."}
