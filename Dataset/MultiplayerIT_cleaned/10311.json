Monster 4x4 Stunt Racer takes all the essence of these typically American vehicles and condenses it into a fun and very fast title. Environmentalist spirit As is well known, all-wheel drive gives its best on almost all surfaces: mud, snow, vertical walls... Vertical walls? A moment and we get there! In the title in question you will never find anything explicitly new or particularly innovative, but the set of elements still forms a pleasant product. The foundations are definitely solid. In fact, there are a fair number of crazy, very fast and very powerful vehicles to choose from, each obviously with different characteristics and driving styles. Do not miss the turbo bar, now almost taken for granted, to be filled by performing reckless maneuvers and figures and to be unloaded at the right time. Finally, there are a certain number of averagely varied and well-designed tracks with the inevitable shortcuts and acceleration lanes. The modes in which to tackle these tracks are five in all and range from the usual ~Race~ to the less obvious ~Survivor~ in which the last of the race explodes every ten seconds. The ~Freestyle~ mode is nice, where you can engage in ringing spectacular stunt combos and, again, the ~time challenge~ mode, also decidedly canonical, is quite difficult. Also interesting is ~Car junkyard~ in which you are committed to destroying a certain number of cars by touching them in order to ~upload~ the score of a special car to then explode last. The roundup closes with a particular challenge, ~master of arms~, in which three types of explosive cans must be hit, to obtain the greatest possible destruction, one of which detonates those present in the immediate vicinity, another which is thrown at depending on the point of impact and finally the last to search. We close with a pleasant multiplayer section that includes all the above modes. Monstrously funny? That's all, in the sense that Monster 4x4 Stunt Racer immediately reveals itself for what it is, that is a modest title but with a structure so tested and consolidated as to be pleasant in any case. In fact, everything is qualitatively average; the controls perform quite well whether played with the hand wheel or with the nunchuk setup. Undoubtedly the steering wheel suspended in the air is definitely more fun to use, even if less precise and sometimes a bit capricious in performing stunts, compared to the traditional joystick. The difficulty is never too high, apart from some tests where you will sweat a lot, also because once you understand the mechanisms that allow you to win, it is easy to reproduce them if necessary. In fact, it happens a little too often to be able to complete the entire route using the turbo constantly. This aspect simplifies the race especially against the very modest artificial intelligence managed by the CPU and also has a side effect. After a few games, in fact, one wonders if we are playing an F-zero clone rather than a simulation of heavy and powerful 4x4 vehicles. The impression is also reinforced by the fact that in some parts of the slopes you can literally defy all physical laws by running for very long stretches on the walls. The thing is implemented on average well, even if sometimes it is decidedly a bit forced. Defying the force of gravity generally allows you to obtain good advantages such as maintaining the combo multiplier between one jump ramp and another or lengthening the time available, or again, simply, the possibility of exploiting the accelerators and cut pieces of the path. Technically Mediocre is also the technical realization, in the presence of a respectable speed, which decreases only in very rare situations, unfortunately textures and polygonal constructions stand out that repeatedly recall the Nintendo64. The set itself is still functional, and this forgives many things, but the use of the same color palette for most of the circuits is still a bit annoying. Apart from some, in fact, they all tend to look alike aesthetically and it's a bit of a shame. Furthermore, you often come across more or less serious bugs with collisions that are not exactly perfect or your car disappearing swallowed up by the track. The very little artificial intelligence of the opponents, on the other hand, definitely undermines the level of challenge. Especially in the mode in which to destroy the cars, to be faced in three laps, the virtual pilots perform the same actions in each turn, killing a challenge that could have become very fun. Theremusic on the other hand has rather sloppy and monotonous motifs being based exclusively on ignorant electric guitars. The multiplayer section is done well enough with the obvious drops in frame rate and graphic impoverishments. To conclude, one cannot fail to reiterate what has already been mentioned above: it is a bit of a shame to find oneself with such a mediocre technical and structural realization with such solid and fun foundations from which to start. For a short rental to some unpretentious afternoon section it does its job worthily, but don't expect a deep title or one with which to spend entire afternoons trying to improve your results.", "date": "2009-12-15", "grade": "6.3"}
