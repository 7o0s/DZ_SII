Nintendo had already tried this route a few years ago with Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer for Nintendo 3DS which, as the subtitle suggests, was practically the same thing. On that occasion, however, the experiment had failed for two reasons. First, it lacked all the improvements to the quality of life we are used to today: going from the portable console to the hybrid console has improved interfaces, functions and gameplay dynamics that make everything more accessible, faster and more intuitive. Second, it lacked a real game to back it up. Happy Home Designer did not rely on Animal Crossing: New Leaf, but it was a stand-alone title focused solely and exclusively on a mechanic that perhaps was not as appreciated at the time as it is now, and that is furniture. Animal Crossing: New Horizons has awakened many unsuspected designers, players who may have discovered a passion for creativity only thanks to the possibilities offered in the Nintendo title. The DLC released in conjunction with the excellent 2.0 update, which already added a lot of content and improvements to the initial package for free, would not have been able to exist without a base, and it is precisely on this mutual synergy that our review of Happy Home Paradise finds very positive feedback. Before starting Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise, the staff of Casimira Vacanze Before starting, you need to buy the expansion. Let's clarify, because there is a crucial point that is worth emphasizing. Nintendo essentially offers two ways to buy Happy Home Paradise. The first is very direct: buy the DLC on the Nintendo eShop for 24.99 euros and that's it. Once downloaded, it will be yours forever and become an integral part of the Animal Crossing: New Horizons software - and rescue -. The second is a little more convoluted: the DLC is in fact included in the Nintendo Switch Online + Add-on package which costs 39.99 euros a year and includes, in addition to the Nintendo online service, also the catalogs of classic Nintendo 64 and Mega Drive. Everyone then gives the value they want to the contents of this package, but in general it is estimated that Happy Home Paradise costs about 5 euros less in this way. The problem is that you are not buying it, you are renting it. Here is the crux. If you subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online + Annual Add-on Pack membership and then cancel the membership, the main contents of the Happy Home Paradise DLC become inaccessible. By main content we mean the Casimira Vacanze archipelago with its ~campaign~, while all the extras unlocked up to that moment, such as the possibility of building partitions or other DIY schemes, can still be used in any other Animal Crossing context : New Horizons. Nintendo has in fact specified that the save is not compromised in any way, but until the subscription to the annual package is reactivated, it is no longer possible to play Happy Home Paradise. In this sense, our advice is to buy the DLC directly, also because if you love Animal Crossing: New Horizons these new contents are absolutely worth every penny. Play decorator Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise, customize the exteriors Once you have purchased the expansion, you will be contacted by the Mephistophelean Tom Nook who will summon you to the airport to introduce you to an old acquaintance of Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer players. Casimira is a real estate agent who will offer you work as interior decorators at her Casimira Vacanze, located in a large archipelago accessible by air. This means that every time you want to go to work, you will necessarily have to go through the airport and Dodo Airlines. The archipelago is made up of a plethora of islets, and Casimira's office is right in the centre. There you will meet Albertuccio, a friendly handyman monkey, and Gedeone, a walrus who takes care of Casimira's shop, where new furniture and accessories are sold. The only problem is that Gideon doesn't accept stars, but a new currency, the poki, which you can only earn by working for Casimira. But what is this job all about? Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise, customize the interior Happy Home Paradise is punctuated through a kind of ~campaign~, so to speak. Old and new inhabitants will arrive on the island in search of a holiday home: the agency's protocol requires a preliminary interview in which the customer explains his preferences, usually a certain number of specific pieces of furniture that must be placed in his space. But what is this spaceor we will decide it. The archipelago is divided into about fifty lots, but each one is a separate biome that we can customize by choosing the weather conditions, the time of day and even the season. Once on site, we will therefore have to furnish the space inside and outside the prepared house, which in any case can be modified by choosing its appearance, roof and colours. It's all very simple: the interface also allows you to modify the land and plant the fences in a practical and fast way, as well as to move the house itself to another point on the selected lot. Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise, the map of the archipelago Once inside, the real game begins. It's nothing an Animal Crossing: New Horizons fan hasn't already done, but there is a small difference. The Casimira Vacanze catalogue, accessible like the closet in our house, not only includes the accessories specifically requested by the customer, but also a large array of furniture, walls, carpets, chandeliers and so on and so forth. Not all are necessarily in tune with the style suggested by the client, but this variety allows the player to indulge himself and furnish the house as he pleases. There is no Game Over and you can't fail: to be a job, Happy Home Paradise is really relaxing, also because that sensation that many players will have experienced in New Horizons when they wanted to furnish their home in a certain way but felt the lack of an accessory or matching piece of furniture. While not drawing on the entire, boundless catalog of the game, Happy Home Paradise provides you with all the means to furnish coordinated houses consistent with the client's requests. Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise, in work uniform This means that it could take a few minutes or more than an hour to furnish a holiday home, depending on how determined and fussy you are. If you wish, you could even summarily furnish the interior and ignore the exterior, so you can come back later to improve the house with new ideas and functions. Once the job is done, the important thing is to take a nice photo which will then be uploaded to the agency's photo album, which also acts as a fast travel system: in this way you can immediately reach a specific lot to make changes, take new photos or whatever. Rewards and achievements Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise, you can also customize the weather and time of day of each lot Each completed task will earn us a small reward in poki, and there is no limit to the number of houses you can furnish each day. As we said, however, Happy Home Paradise is a kind of campaign that unlocks new content, functions and activities by reaching certain goals. By completing a certain number of assignments, for example, you learn new techniques of furniture or beautification, such as polishing - which makes furniture and accessories shine - or partition walls and accent walls which in the hands of a good designer can literally revolutionize every project old and new. Gedeone's catalog naturally expands accordingly, and over time it becomes possible to exchange stars for poki, deposit currencies or order furniture that we could not buy in the past. Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise, at some point you will also have to furnish the school Casimira Vacanze's services are also expanding as the player's possibilities multiply and customer requests become more complicated. In addition to being able to invite the inhabitants of our island to take a holiday home in the archipelago - of course this won't move them on a permanent basis, huh - we will have to deal with the furnishings in the shared houses and with the additional structures that Casimira will propose to build as was also the case in Happy Home Designer: the school, the hospital, the restaurant and so on. We will have to furnish them, choose the personnel drawing on the number of visitors to the archipelago who will spend the day in their holiday homes or socializing around Casimira's office, perhaps dancing on the beach or relaxing under an umbrella. The archipelago thus becomes more and more lively, colorful and fun to explore, but above all it guarantees the player long and short-term objectives that give an additional purpose to the gameplay. Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise, even Fluffy wants his vacation home We said at the beginning that there is a strong synergy between Animal Crossing: New Horizons and its DLC, and it is in fact this winning feature that makes the add-on pack aA must buy for gamers who have spent tens if not hundreds of hours modifying their island and decorating the interiors and exteriors of their homes. Almost all features and techniques learned in Happy Home Paradise are fully compatible with the gameplay in the original island of New Horizons: this means that if you learn to build, for example, a partition wall or a pillar while working for Casimira, then you can at your home. This reciprocity literally expands the gameplay and content of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, incentivizing the player to dig into Happy Home Paradise's content to improve and perfect their original creations. In conclusion... Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise, you will learn how to build pillars and partition walls We will never know if Animal Crossing: New Horizons would have had the same phenomenal success without the pandemic that forced us home, causing many players to find an almost perfect form of escapism in the Nintendo title. But one thing is certain: New Horizons and its expansion complement each other, forming a practically perfect product ... if you love Animal Crossing and all its creative part. It is clear that if you don't like spending hours decorating the virtual homes of these talkative anthropomorphic little animals, Happy Home Paradise will tell you absolutely nothing, but on the other hand it is quite obvious that this series is not for you, although there is certainly a small part of the community that appreciates it but doesn't tear its hair out for the creative component. Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise, a lonely winter vacation home That said, we can only recommend the expansion to players who loved Animal Crossing: New Horizons and return to their island daily. If you have left behind this edition of the Nintendo franchise, perhaps Happy Home Paradise is not a content to bet on a new involvement, although it takes several hours to complete it, so to speak, which amply justify the cost of the DLC. We can argue that it would have been better to have this content at launch, but we don't feel like saying that Animal Crossing: New Horizons was ~incomplete~ before Happy Home Paradise and that this DLC is a so-called ~cut content~ - like the Pigeon House , to be clear - also because there are various functionalities and dynamics that appear clearly conceived at a later time.", "date": "2021-11-13", "grade": null}
