{"name": "Phantom Brigade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/phantom-brigade-recensione.html", "text": "A ruthless and violent occupying force has seized power by looting and deporting the population. A group of rebels organizes itself to stop it, using the same technologies as the enemy: powerful mechs armed to the teeth with which to reconquer strategic locations and entire territories. Season it all with a game system based on time manipulation and you have a potentially explosive title on your hands, which could aspire to be one of the best strategy games of the year. Except that sometimes even good ideas can be frustrated by counterproductive choices, as we will see in the Phantom Brigade review. An outstanding idea A squad of Mechs Phantom Brigade seems very complex to play, but it actually becomes quite simple when you have mastered the few tools needed to manage the movement of our units. At the beginning of each turn, the system resets a timeline, showing the actions of the forces in the field over the next five seconds. By scrolling the line we can therefore know where the enemy mechs and tanks will go, when they will shoot, what targets they will aim for and other vital information, to which we will have to react by setting the actions of our team on the timeline itself. We are therefore faced with a tactical game in which time plays a key role and in which the player plays a role that simultaneously resembles that of director and film editor. At first Phantom Brigade is exhilarating Each action has its own cost in terms of game time and must therefore be managed intelligently, in concert with the actions of each unit. The basic actions are actually few: a mech can move, it can shoot with primary or secondary fire, it can get behind cover or you can decide to let the pilot flee, if by now the resistance of the vehicle is running out. Often exciting situations arise, in which one can also delight in carrying out reckless and spectacular actions (to be reviewed later in slow motion with the integrated tools), making the mechs act at the last moment or attempting seemingly impossible sorties, strong in the ability to get ahead of opponents just enough to make them feel helpless and humiliate them (or vice versa). Incomprehensible choices The management of the clashes seems complex, but in reality it is not that much, thanks also to the excellent interface After each fight we can recover the resources left by the enemies from the battlefield, including mech parts, fusing what we do not need to obtain materials, so as to be able to improve our units with new technologies, immediately ready to use in battle. The progression at the beginning is really exhilarating and works very well. The improvements you get are important, as well as indispensable to face the incremental challenge represented by increasingly fierce enemies and by the expanding number of provinces that we must first liberate and then hold (calling resistance forces to our rescue). Having escape routes is essential if you are to survive the inevitable setbacks, which require retreat and reorganization. At the beginning everything seems to go smoothly, framed by a graphic style at the Front Mission that is not excellent, but still very nice and satisfying. The mechs are well modeled, the animations are well done, the battlefields, while not very varied, offer interesting and always different tactical ideas and the artificial intelligence seems adequate to keep the interest high. Unfortunately it doesn't take much to discover that the system as a whole is full of flaws and imbalances. The problem is that some advanced weapons are way too powerful and end up completely ruining the tactical aspect of the game, making it a health walk. For example, by finding the miniguns you become practically omnipotent and winning or not a fight becomes only a question of placement. So just put yourself in the spot with the best view on the battlefield and shoot repeatedly to literally tear your opponents to pieces. When the whole team has ultra-powerful weapons, the game dynamics flatten further and the enemy mechs become insignificant, because they are unable to react to our sudden aggression. Keep in mind that shots from some of the best weapons can go straight through buildings and land on target wherever it is, so sometimes you don't even need to move to aim. Some Phantom Brigade weapons are devastating... too much Devastating enemies the first time around, which even when equipped with very powerful weapons too tend to retain an atkmore cautious behavior, as if they do not realize the destructive potential they wield, is also satisfying, but the second becomes a mere repetition of a story already written and from there on the awareness that Phantom Brigade is simply a 'opportunity wasted by the desire to please who knows what players' dreams of omnipotence. our actions, making us really feel like a clandestine resistance force in the face of a powerful and overwhelming enemy, disappears devoured by a repetitive gameplay with battles all the same, in which the opponents appear more and more useless and limited in the face of our brute strength. Limits The mechs are modifiable, but in the end you tend to always choose the most powerful equipment It should be added that when the game begins to show its more repetitive side, it also begins to reveal some production limits that had not been noticed before, taken as it was by the novelty. For example, one realizes that there aren't many enemies in terms of variety and attack patterns and that the scenarios are always built around a handful of biomes that repeat themselves incessantly until the end. The same goes for history, which practically doesn't exist. In the prologue some basics of the scenario are established, but they are never developed within the game due to lack of interlude sequences, dialogues and so on. Not bad, if the gameplay had maintained the same level of interest all the time, but as amply explained, from mid-campaign onwards everything collapses and you find yourself looking for some foothold that justifies continuing to play, a foothold that unfortunately it never comes.", "date": "2023-03-22", "grade": "6.5"}
