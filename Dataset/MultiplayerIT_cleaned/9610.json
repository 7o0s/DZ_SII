Undoubtedly similar at first glance, Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell and the others instead represent different interpretations of the same common universe, various types of gameplay associated with the imagination of the American writer although doubts can be raised about the authenticity of the scripts present in each of the numerous games manufactured each year by the award-winning Tom Clancy company. Ghost Recon, among these, brings with it a purely tactical meaning of the shooter, further distilled in the new Advanced Warfighter series which, in high-definition consoles, has led to a step forward towards the use of cutting-edge technologies that have characterized it even more gameplay. A distant echo of all this is also found in the Wii version that we analyze here, but the structure that usually characterizes the title is here completely distorted, simplified to the max in a rail-based shooter that it shares with the other adventures of the ~ghosts~ , just a few settings and the use (also profoundly different from the usual) of some technological tools that we have already seen in Advanced Warfighter. Mind you, there is nothing wrong with the a priori rail shooter genre: it is certainly a clear simplification of the typical game structure of the series, which is based on tactical movements, cover, accuracy of shots, team management and use of ~gadgets~ but this does not necessarily mean that a new purely action interpretation of the series should be evaluated negatively, on the other hand the ~on-rail shooter~ genre boasts undoubted strengths in immediate and frenetic fun. The problem is that Ghost Recon also has gaps in terms of playability and technical implementation. I reload! The ~light gun~ shooter is perhaps one of the genres that has remained most faithful to tradition among all those that we currently find on the videogame market. Basically, it's about shooting at targets that appear on the screen by aiming the ~gun~ (the Wii Remote, in this case) directly at the precise point where the element in question is located, an old-time skill game like the typical amusement park shooting gallery. The dynamics are well established and work well, with the only variants derived from the possibility of hiding behind the covers offered by the scenarios and switching from one to another as desired within a fraction of the game, but always with a freedom of extremely limited movement by the automatic progress of the screen and by the pre-setting of the shots which, essentially, tell you what to look at and who to shoot at without being so drawn out. The campaign missions, as well as the arcade game, are therefore fragmented into many episodes in which waves of enemies force us into furious firefights, waiting to free the area and proceed to the next fragment. The shift towards pure arcade is held back by the desire to maintain a link with the typical elements of Ghost Recon and its need for realism, therefore even if the action is obviously driven to paroxysm it cannot break free from a certain logical sense and hovering towards the peaks of frenzy and adrenaline-pumping exaggeration of true arcade shooters, leaving this Ubisoft game in an intermediate zone, held back in its action impetus but very far from the typical tactics of the series. The result is a ~point and shoot~ which in the long run turns out to be rather dull, with few varieties of enemies and situations inconsistent with the desire for realism but decidedly more subdued than those found, for example, in Ghost Squad or House of the Dead. The constant presence of a teammate obviously pushes towards multiplayer (offline), variegated by the possibility of using different weapons (light and heavy) and a minimum of team play with the possibility of healing the partner and attacking from points of different coverage. Every now and then the routine is broken by particular levels in which, for example, we control the armed drone, or we find ourselves in critical situations such as rooms full of noxious gas which require us to speed up the action, but the heart of the game basically never changes more than that. Note the support for the Wii Zapper which makes the action more enjoyable thanks to greater shooting precision and a more logical and comfortable arrangement of the controls, also favoring identification with the protagonists.Not quite Advanced Warfighter Despite the name, Ghost Recon on Wii doesn't share much of the characteristic spectacularity of the last chapters of the series seen on the other platforms in high definition, rejoining the typical Tom Clancy atmosphere right in the interludes between one mission and another and in the quick briefings beginning level, but it is a rose water treatment of all the original cinematographic-narrative apparatus, moreover with a decidedly simplistic story, complete with a good old revival of the ~red menace~. The package, therefore, meaning by this both the graphic sector and the extra-ludic support of a narrative type, does not conform to the standards to which Ubisoft has accustomed us in its best productions. Even bearing in mind the different potential that Wii can express compared to other competing home consoles, the lack of care in the creation of the scenarios and the obsessive repetition of graphic elements regarding vehicles, enemies and settings are badly justified. Simplicity can certainly be considered a structural element of the game: the absence of aesthetic frills helps to highlight the threats present on the screen well and to act promptly against them, as the mechanics of this type of game require, but then it would be A more irreverent, colorful or in a word more ~arcade~ approach was preferable rather than this sought-after but awkwardly reproduced realism. Moreover, since it is a shooter on rails, therefore with completely pre-set shots, it would be reasonable to expect greater care in the graphic aspect, with the possibility of enriching and embellishing everything that appears on the screen with cinematic cuts and truly spectacular scenes since In fact, we can't even look around. From this point of view, the introduction of the ~bullet time~ which slows down time allowing us to take aim with greater calm and precision is functional from a playful point of view, but very little satisfying to the eye. On the other hand, the audio sector is of an excellent level, in particular as regards the musical accompaniment which fits into the classic context of the Tom Clancy series with epic and atmospheric orchestral music, as well as well-made dialogues in Italian, although the continuous repetition of the word ~reload!~ on the part of the protagonist and companion is rather shocking after a few hours of play.", "date": "2010-11-26", "grade": "4.8"}
