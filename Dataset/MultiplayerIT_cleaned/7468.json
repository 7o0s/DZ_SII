{"name": "Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125684-baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition-for-the-glory-of-amn.html", "text": "For some time now, the sequels seem to be receiving less and less favor from critics and the public, but old fans of the Baldur's Gate series are well aware that for the BioWare creature it was not like that at all. If in 1998 the first chapter established itself within its genre as the masterpiece that we still remember today, in 2000 Baldur's Gate II managed to at least equal the feat, bringing us back to its endless fantasy universe based on Dungeons & Dragons. Thanks to the magnificent combination, this same universe has become a real cult over the last decade, surviving in the memory of fans even the many other role-playing games that have arrived on the market. But dwelling on the success of Baldur's Gate we would certainly end up repeating what was already said on the occasion of the review of the Enhanced Edition of the original, dating back to exactly one year ago. Twelve months later, Overhaul Games has finally managed to bring Baldur's Gate II back to our screens. Given the opportunity offered to us, we naturally took the opportunity to return once again to wander around the Costa della Spada, in order to see what the developers have done in this new remake. Baldur's Gate II returns to our screens thanks to its Enhanced Edition: it is immediately nostalgic! T is better than uan To make sure you're doing things right, the Overhaul Games guys have included both the basic version of Baldur's Gate II, subtitled Shadows of Amn, and the Throne of Bhaal expansion, dating back to 2001, in this Enhanced Edition. With them the story dedicated to the protg of the wizard Gorion, known during the adventure told in the first chapter, essentially closes. Hoping that even in this case you are already aware of what is narrated in Baldur's Gate II and its expansion, we still make a brief summary for the benefit of those who have only recently played the first chapter (once again, we only justify you if you were too young at the time). This time the protagonist of the adventure wakes up in a dark prison, without remembering how he got there. Soon, however, he will learn that he has been imprisoned by a mysterious wizard named Jon Irenicus, who intends to perform some experiments on him. Just as he is being tortured by the wizard, our hero witnesses the intervention of the old acquaintance Imoen, who frees him from the cage in which he is imprisoned. However, it will only be the beginning of a troubled affair, given that the protagonist's childhood friend will pay the price, who will therefore find himself with many questions and with the mission of finding her again, in an unknown territory like the Amn region. The events of Throne of Bhaal instead tell us the final moments of the struggle between those who represent the progeny of the God of Murder, with our protagonist once again involved in the first person: needless to say that, also in this case, the plot remains of top level even after more than 10 years from its creation. The formula doesn't change The Enhanced Edition of Baldur's Gate II follows quite closely what the development team did for the first chapter, starting with the addition of the new characters: three of them are actually already known, given that they are the monk Rasaad yn Bashir , the wild sorceress Neera and the blackguard Dorn Il-Khan, all once again recruitable within your own game party. They are joined by the mysterious thief Hexxat, who adds her own narrative to the story of Baldur's Gate II, already composed of a main plot and many sidequests that give the game a practically endless dimension. Even the aforementioned trio returns with new quests concerning the background of each of its components, for which some new ad hoc settings have been created both within Shadows of Amn and in Throne of Bhaal. A rather welcome addition, given that it is unreleased game material, even if - we do not want the members of Overhaul Games - the difference with the content originally created by BioWare is quite evident. Continuing the list of similarities with the previous Enhanced Edition, in Baldur's Gate II version 2013 we also find the mode entitled The Black Pits 2, which practically constitutes an evolution of the Black Pits already seen a year ago. Again, the main feature is to make the player fight in an arena. In this sense, the effort of the developers to give the mode a context, such as the parts of the dialogue present and the arrival of a new figure within the arena, that is to say a sort of presenter who comments on what happens during the battle, is appreciable. Despite sWhile the game tutorial is always present, revised for the occasion, it should be kept in mind that even Baldur's Gate II is not among the simplest RPGs ever, so newbies would perhaps do well to recover the first chapter before launching in this. Particularly welcome, given that death is always around the corner, the possibility of using a button to make a quick save. Always towards Infinity We know that we have been repeating it more or less since the beginning of the review: the operations carried out by Overhaul Games on Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition directly follow those of a year ago. The technical sector also fully confirms this statement, within which the zoom remains almost useless, given that the graining of the images persists in the event that the detail is increased. Support for wide screens naturally also returns on this occasion, while the work done to recreate the interlude scenes of the first Baldur's Gate has not been carried out this time: good news especially for the purists of the old role-playing game, to whom the reinterpretation of Overhaul Games comic cutscenes didn't like it. According to the developers, the saved time was spent optimizing and improving the original textures used in the 2000 game: the touch is there and it shows, but we are far from highlighting shocking differences. Also returns multiplayer and the ability to play the main adventure together with other people. Not exactly a bombproof netcode, however, given that Overhaul Games itself warns of some problems that still concern it.", "date": "2013-11-20", "grade": "8.5"}
