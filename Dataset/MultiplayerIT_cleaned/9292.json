{"name": "Una colazione da dio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87095-gods-eater-burst-una-colazione-da-dio.html", "text": "In a not too distant future, our planet is devastated by the attack of monstrous creatures called ~Aragami~, born from a sort of virus capable of assimilating the matter that surrounds it. Since there is no force capable of countering these monsters, the population abandons the cities and takes refuge on their margins, in conditions of extreme degradation. The birth of Fenrir, an organization that aims to counter the Aragami, finally gives some hope to the people: starting from the monsters' own cells, scientists develop a weapon called ~God Arc~, which once connected to the arm of a volunteer establishes a symbiotic relationship with him. Thus the teams of ~Gods Eater~ are born, warriors capable of eliminating the Aragami and freeing the cities from their presence, and our character is precisely one of them. After determining its appearance and gender using a simple but sufficiently versatile editor, we witness its ~initiation~ by the Fenrir and the assignment of accommodation at the headquarters of the organization. At that point, a series of tutorials clarify the functioning of the God Arc, an extremely powerful weapon, capable of assuming three different configurations: sword, shield and cannon. The first form lends itself to the most disparate situations, from close encounters to chases, it allows us to perform various attack maneuvers and finally to awaken the ~beast~ inherent within the cells that make up the ~organic~ part, capable of materializing and to literally bite the Aragami with the dual purpose of causing damage and collecting precious objects which, at a certain point, will form the basis for a whole series of interesting ~crafting~ activities. The shape of a shield, as it is easy to imagine, is used to parry the enemy's attacks or at least most of them. We can activate it by holding down the backbone R and pressing the Circle button, however a lateral swerve is often more effective (just press the Circle only), also because it allows us to assume a different position on the pitch and quickly launch a new attack. Finally, the cannon shape transforms the God Arc into a real firearm, effective both from long and short distances and capable of using a large number of different projectiles, which we can also build ourselves with the materials collected during each mission. With the God Arc in the cannon configuration, our character's mobility is unfortunately very limited, he cannot parry or sidestep. It is therefore a solution that should be adopted only in certain situations, when the group supports us effectively by keeping the Aragami at bay, or as a nice approach greeting when we approach one of the creatures. Ten bites, ten It only takes a few minutes to frame Gods Eater Burst as a title strongly inspired by Monster Hunter, but also capable of focusing on different aspects of the experience compared to the Capcom series. Firstly, the action game developed by Shift for Namco Bandai presents important narrative elements that unfold through numerous anime-style cutscenes, with an interesting background story, which will not fail to involve us thanks to its facets and the many characters that we will have way of knowing between one mission and another, consolidating friendships right on the battlefield. Speaking of missions, the game contains as many as one hundred, distributed within ten degrees of difficulty, and therefore ensures excellent longevity as long as you get used to some limitations of the gameplay and structure. As far as the latter is concerned, in fact, it must be said that the scene scenarios of the clashes are loaded in a single solution but do not boast the extension, detail and above all the variety seen in the latest incarnations of Monster Hunter. We often find ourselves fighting in the same location, therefore, while the opponents change and the objects are generated randomly on the ground. Still with regard to the structure, the genre of action survival in itself confronts us with fundamentally repetitive situations, in this case an almost infinite series of boss fights in which to win you have to get to know the Aragami on duty, its patterns of attack and its vulnerabilities, while making the best possible use of our equipment. Moving on to the gameplay, there's the usual camera management problem that sadly no developer has yet solved effectively on the PSP. The Sony portable console is equipped with a single analog stick, assigned to the movement of the character, and in the case of Gods Eater Burst the view iscontrolled by the d-pad or can be centered by pressing the back button L. This last solution almost never works as it should, especially in the chaos of a furious battle, so you will find yourself really doing stunts to play in a decent way, by operating the analog stick with the left thumb and at the same time holding the index finger of the same hand on the d-pad to move the view (and we dare not imagine how this could work on a PSPgo). It is once again incredible that no thought has been given to the back buttons for horizontal adjustment of the camera (the most important one, in the end), making the controls very cumbersome and compromising mechanisms that are sacrosanct in an action game. The same factor, however, ends up ~masking~ the quality of the combat system, given that there is no way to deal with the clashes using a controller in step with the times. Who knows, maybe one would realize that the movement and attack patterns of the Aragami are not all that sophisticated, and that just walking around them can knock them out without taking any damage, rather than constantly resorting to healing procedures because we are not given way to move with the necessary speed. After an hour or two, fortunately, it is possible to compromise with the management of the view and not to feel the weight too much, even if the problem clearly remains. Which is a pity, because from a technical and artistic point of view Gods Eater Burst is a great sight, with an efficient engine capable of handling graphics fluidly and without uncertainties, an excellent character design and good quality music ( even if few in number) to accompany the action. The polygonal models aren't up to par with those of the excellent Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, but they fare well in terms of both detail and animation. For the scenarios, however, it would have been appropriate to make a little more effort: there are few of them.", "date": "2011-05-10", "grade": "7.8"}
