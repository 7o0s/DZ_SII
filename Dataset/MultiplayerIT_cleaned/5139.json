{"name": "Post brutto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/177374-post-brutal-post-brutto.html", "text": "It is certainly not easy to make valid third-person action games for mobile devices, and it is perhaps for this reason that even important development teams such as Gameloft have begun to set limits in this sense, moving towards less complex, more immediate and with greater possibility of making inroads among casual users. It therefore takes a lot of courage to try this trend on iOS and Android, even more so when you have limited resources, as happens in most cases for independent realities. Hell Tap Entertainment's ambitions for Post Brutal were great: we're talking about an action RPG with a post-apocalyptic setting, in which we control a warrior fighting zombies and jackals through the streets of practically deserted cities, with the aim of completing various missions, interact with non-player characters, unlock skills and buy new and more powerful weapons as you go. Unfortunately the way in which the title was made takes us back twenty years, to the time of the first PlayStation, between angular polygonal models, mediocre animations and inconsistent and slippery combat systems, children of an era in which the developers did not have the necessary familiarity with three-dimensional contexts. The early stages of the game manage to effectively summarize all these perplexities, through a tutorial in which we are explained how the interface works, from the use of weapons to interaction with the environment. Then you are already grappling with some simple quests, specifically the rescue of a soldier and a survivor, actions that will soon lead us to the hub from which to access the subsequent missions. Post Brutal is an action RPG with great ambitions, but with very dated graphics and mechanics It takes guts Among the many elements that Post Brutal offers for sale via in-app purchase there are the inevitable coins, but also a series of extra features such as the one that allows you to record sentences and make our character pronounce them, perhaps after pasting the our facial features using the camera. These are bonuses that actually leave the time they find: much better to invest some change, if you really have to, in eliminating the advertising trailers that start during each loading screen or almost, when you pass from one area to another of the scenario or enter a new mission. The touch control system has two possible layouts, with automatic or manual view, but given the large number of buttons on the screen, it is much better to use the first solution, which makes things simpler and works quite well, following the protagonist without wrap up. The lack of even the slightest physicality of the clashes allows you to move while slashing with the ordinance ax, which has a bit of a ~tank~ effect a la Resident Evil, while for firearms the problem does not exist: just press and hold its icon to automatically hit the closest target. Once inside the hub it is possible to access missions in which we are asked to find certain objects or escort NPCs, always under the threat of the zombies who patrol the streets, but the degree of challenge actually remains quite low. In general, it is the lack of care and attention to detail that drowns the Post Brutal experience, and in this juncture the game's attempt to involve us through long dialogues in English only achieves the opposite effect and further emphasizes all the limits of this production.", "date": "2016-12-07", "grade": "4.0"}
