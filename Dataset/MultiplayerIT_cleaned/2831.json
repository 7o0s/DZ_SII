So unlike the first episode which relied on a very specific legend, and this was in part its weakest point, this time we are going to deal with a more broad-based theme on which it was possible to create a truly new story that could not somehow be anticipated. Strong actor Will Poulter in the role of the protagonist, Little Hope proves to be overall better than the previous one but still loses a few hits along the way by failing to match, nor obviously surpass, the results achieved by the developers with the good Until Dawn. So find out its strengths and weaknesses in our review The Dark Pictures Anthology: Little Hope. History For obvious reasons we can't go too far in talking about the plot, but that doesn't stop us from examining the story and how it was handled. Little Hope chooses a dual narration, which from the present in which the protagonists move sometimes slips into the past where the answers to the questions and mysteries that surround the titular town lie: trapped inside after the bus they were traveling on had a incident, four students (yes, count the forty-eight-year-old lady as such) and their teacher find themselves unable to leave the confines of Little Hope due to an impenetrable fog from which they cannot escape. Between mysterious visions and apparitions that are all too concrete to allow themselves the luxury of not believing them, the five protagonists must prepare for a very long nightmarish night without the certainty of seeing the dawn; the only way out seems to be to find out what happened to Little Hope in remote times dating back to 1692, the year in which the witch trials began in Salem which led to the death - on absolutely baseless grounds - numerous people with the accusation, in fact, of practicing witchcraft. The developers therefore sink with both hands into a very dark cross-section of US history to create an ambiguous narrative, where the past is reflected in the present, moving steps forward compared to the predictable Man of Medan - who in slavishly following a known legend (or for which a search on the internet was enough) influenced the narrative and its developments - this and the fact that in any case the writing was well below the levels of Until Dawn. Little Hope in this sense improves but the story creaks equally in several points. As always, a lot depends on how much you have devoted yourself to exploration to collect the bread crumbs scattered here and there, useful for having a more comprehensive view of the situation; even so, however, and regardless of the ending you get, some accounts don't add up even after almost three games with different outcomes from each other. The past lays the foundations for what should be the curse weighing on the town, yet on some pieces of the puzzle there remain some perplexities that we have not been able to explain, situations that do not coincide with a significant final twist and would have benefited from a greater connection between past and present. Then there are parts where the narrative quality limps, presenting illogical situations, while as far as the protagonists themselves are concerned, there is not enough depth to create real links with them: just like in Man of Medan, they lack the necessary depth to be to notice, taking second place to the characters of the past who, despite having a little less space in the script, remain impressed more easily, also due to the much more dramatic situation that involves them. In short, in its entirety Little Hope is undoubtedly better than Man of Medan but in changing narrative register some elements continue to be out of focus, starting with a rhythm that struggles to take hold: from a slow and rather soporific beginning we proceed gropingly, a bit like the characters trying to figure out what it happens, with occasional sudden changes in voltage which, however, thanks to a wider and less claustrophobic setting than the previous ship, are short-lived. The developers have taken note of the fact that it is not the constant jumpscares that make a horror, measuring them more carefully this time, but that agonizing terror that should seize the player upon discovering himself trapped in a cursed ghost town where anything could attack him from a moment to moment does not filter. It may be partly due to the choice to point to pMore on the relationship between the characters, with situations that challenge each other creating potential conflicts that are somewhat the basis of the narrative of Little Hope, nevertheless even in this case the karma that should decide their life or their death is affected by some gameplay imbalances. The gameplay For better or worse, Little Hope's gameplay does not differ from that of Man of Medan: you can choose whether to play alone or in company, exchanging the pad with people close to you or activating online co-op with another player. In the latter case we have to admit that the first chapter worked better for the issue of conflict due to illusions, which often pitted one against the other without awareness of attacking our partner; here the developers did not want to repeat themselves, and there is, maintaining the mechanics of cooperation in the strict sense (helping each other in times of danger) but precisely going to lose that of possible conflict. Overall, it's still a nice co-op to share. Once in the game you will move as in the previous title, exploring around in search of collectibles and interactions that carry the story forward, choosing with your heart or with your head - you can even remain silent - based on the situation confronts and decides, without being able to know it yet, the fate of the characters with apparently harmless choices. This has always been the strong point of the Supermassive games but we can't help but return once again to Until Dawn, where the internal dynamics of the protagonists could even lead to an unexpected betrayal: here, although the question of relationships is marked personal, we can also be morally horrible but the consequences will be the single character in relation to the game world and not with his companions. A pity that we didn't want to be more daring, creating the same friction as Until Dawn. However, there are some significant improvements in the quick time events, which first of all respond correctly to the input (whereas in Man of Medan it was not a small problem) and have also been softened: before most of the commands we are in fact shown briefly on the screen what we are going to do, if we have to climb, jump, defend ourselves or whatever, and immediately afterwards in the same position, which corresponds to the relative button on the pad, the command to insert will appear. Compared to the more chaotic Man of Medan we appreciated this improvement, which allows a more equal clash between us and the QTEs, which have become much more frequent in excited situations probably to balance the greater accessibility. Another novelty introduced is the transition to a different character from the one we are controlling, in cases where there are moments of danger in which both are involved: a bouncing that is not always obvious and helps to keep us focused, since after a series of commands ringed to perfection we could fall just when we switch to the other character endangering the one used. Makes much more the idea of ??the excitement of the moment. Finally, each character has one or more negative traits that become an integral part of him or her (visually, on his screen, they are in the form of padlocks) based on the choices made and contribute to influencing his or her destiny; considering that Little Hope seems to somehow test its unexpected guests, in a sense it assumes the right to judge our work and act accordingly. There doesn't seem to be a particular limit to the negative traits a character can have - we've maxed out at five, and that would be an interesting mechanic in itself if a single right choice weren't enough to undo everything. Simply put, you can be the worst people to ever walk the Little Hope soil but if you make an altruistic decision at the right time you will be redeemed in a certain sense: it is a mechanic that is not always clear in manifesting its consequences but with some scattered tests we have often come to redemption despite the fact that until the moment before we had earned a one-way ticket to multiple hellish circles. In terms of replayability, Little Hope lends itself as well as the previous ones: there are as many ways to carry on the story as there are possible endings, as well as the presence of unpublished scenes that can only be seen in the co-op phase, so if you want to turn the narrative inside out, you have at least three games available. In this respect, the game is not stingy at all in spite of its ups and downs, and to accompany us in the dark meanders of history we will find as always the inevitableCurator, an excellent guide once again played by the very good Pip Torrens, as usual perfect in the role. Technical aspect Visually, Little Hope takes small steps forward compared to Man of Medan without however making excessive leaps in quality: motion capture is the fundamental aspect of the entire production, thanks to which the five protagonists come to life and give their best above all in the constant play of chiaroscuro that accompanies them step by step in the ghost town. Some are more accomplished than others, like Angela and Andrew, but overall they're all expressive enough. We did not experience framerate drops or loading problems but in a couple of cases the game crashed, both during the game and in the initial menu, forcing us to restart it. Sound design obviously plays a key role but given the size of certain areas it doesn't shine as much as along the claustrophobic corridors of Man of Medan; nevertheless, you will often feel like you hear voices around you, as if Little Hope was never really uninhabited, and indoors this works particularly well. The quality of the Italian dubbing is normal, close to that in the original language.", "date": "2020-10-29", "grade": "7.5"}
