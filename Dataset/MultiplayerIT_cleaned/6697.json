In the various episodes of the game, the goal is always the same: to build a city that can expand over time, welcome an ever-increasing number of inhabitants and guarantee them everything they need. The franchise is not new to mobile reductions, given that in 2009 a spin-off was made for Nintendo DS, namely Anno: Create a New World, which then arrived on mobile devices with the title of Anno - The Harbor. However, the experience proposed on that occasion did not correspond to the traditional mechanics of the series, including only certain aspects, and this made those who expected to be able to create their own empire on the iPhone or iPad turn up their noses. The release of Anno: Build an Empire therefore has the difficult task of filling this gap, trying to translate an interface very similar to the one seen in the browser game Anno Online, including assets, into the touch context. Well, how did it turn out? In terms of the completeness of the offer, there is little to say, in the sense that for better or worse, fans of the series will find all the aspects they know well in this mobile edition, although it is often not very intuitive to access them due to not exactly optimal solutions. Anno: Build an Empire is a rich and potentially infinite simulation, but poorly adapted to the context A year to forget? The difficulties of Anno: Build an Empire catch the eye from the first minutes, because it is evident how the passage from one control system to another has produced such distortions as to make some operations cumbersome, in particular the layout of the roads. The two ~flags~ that mark the beginning and the end of a path are in fact very complicated to place compared to mouse commands, often following lines that are different from the ones we would like and forcing us to make quite a few attempts before being able to get the desired result. The initial stages of the game are characterized by a very tight mission system, which alternates a large number of extremely basic tasks to familiarize us with the construction system, the shop, the resources and the necessary requirements because, for example, the citizens' houses that we build are actually inhabited by someone. In certain cases, inexplicable problems arise concerning the connection between the most important junctions of the city, i.e. the markets, warehouses and various commercial activities, which gives rise to dead times in which one tries to understand what the mistake made and possibly remedy it, or maybe tear down some buildings and rebuild them in another area to avoid problems. The point is that if these obstacles to the use of the experience could be well tolerated on PC, the same does not happen in the mobile sector, where an immediacy is essential that Anno: Build an Empire cannot guarantee in any way, remaining rather nebulous in many of its mechanisms and seasoning everything with the lack of an Italian translation, which inevitably makes access to the game more difficult for many casual gamers potentially interested in trying it. Added to this is a fairly aggressive freemium approach, which forces you to use hard currency unless you want to wait for the production of the resources you need to go on with the missions.", "date": "2014-12-06", "grade": "6.2"}
