{"name": "MX vs. ATV Untamed - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mx-vs-atv-untamed-recensione.html", "text": "Password: variety Skipped the very tamarrissimo introductory movie, you will find yourself in front of the most classic of the menu. As for the Single Player, you will have the opportunity to face the usual ~Quick Race~, a ~Custom Race~ and the ~X-Cross Tournament~. Before dwelling on this last mode, the real fulcrum of the game, it is a must to analyze the customizable games: it is in fact through them that you become familiar with the various driving styles. The vehicles present are divided into 7 categories, each with a particular feeling. Thus, if the Enduro bikes are agile and snappy, the same cannot be said of the Truck Rails, huge cars with great stability. In addition to selecting the location and level of the AI (there are 9 difficulty levels present) it is possible to choose one of the 8 events available, divided into Opencross, Supercross, Endurocross, Outdoor Nationals, Supermoto, Waypoint, Minimoto and Freestyle. Supercross requires a technique-focused riding style, and is characterized by thrilling jumps, ramps and whoop sections. Endurocross is its indoor version, and is full of obstacles such as logs, rocks and tires that require great mastery of the vehicle to be overcome unscathed. The Opencross, on the other hand, is decidedly based on higher speeds, and is characterized by immense and boundless scenarios. The risk of dispersion is heightened by some truly bizarre layouts; fortunately, in case of misinterpretation you are catapulted to the correct path after just 3 seconds. Finally, in Freestyle, you are introduced to both open and closed scenarios where there are no rules; the most disparate tricks will thus dominate, even if, as we will see, the control system is not fully effective. Password: variety The X-Cross Tournament is nothing more than the union of the eight events listed above. To give greater depth, the possibility of modifying the components of the cars has been included, in order to make them even more performing, as well as closer to one's aesthetic tastes. To get your hands on the bodywork, engine, chassis, traction and aerodynamics you obviously have to resort to the god of money, which is obtained thanks to the rewards that are delivered with each tournament won. Longevity is ensured by a large number of events, and by their variety. However, not all that glitters is gold; the enthusiasm brought by the first races risks fading drastically after a few hours of play, given the length of certain events and the almost total lack of bite due to a schizophrenic AI; in fact, he alternates moments of absolute apathy with others in which he jeopardizes his own race in order to throw you off the track. Ridiculous attempts, which you can easily remedy. Road test. Sorry, dirt road As tradition dictates, the control system presents a distinctly Arcade approach, seasoned with some realistic elements. The watchword is immediacy, and the fun factor obviously benefits from it, even if at the highest difficulty levels some precautions are necessary only for the most savvy players. It will therefore be of fundamental importance to learn how to adequately manage jumps and, above all, the consequent landing. Once you have passed the learning phase, you will notice how the physics that regulates the mechanisms is often excessively approximate: it will not be unusual to see your alter ego crash to the ground after a seemingly perfectly set jump, which, in addition to being inexplicable, it's also damn frustrating. To suffer from this defect is above all the Freestyle mode, where the tricks and evolutions that can be performed in the air will only give points in the event of a correct landing. As for the settings, the game includes both outdoor circuits and indoor courses. The latter are immensely more technical, and require many hours of training before being ~tamed~ to perfection. Outdoor events, on the other hand, are more adrenaline-pumping, and feature a remarkable variety of surfaces; in the same race you can suddenly switch from asphalt to mud, forcing the player to promptly adapt his driving style. Multiplayer: When Snake mounts The mainstay of the title is obviously the multiplayer. Through Playstation Network it is possible to compete together with 7 other runners scattered around the globe, both in classified and ~friendly~ matches. In this last case, in addition to the usual modes, it is also possible to take part in 4 mini-games: Graffiti, Section Race, Snake and Tag. Graffiti sees us protagonists of crazy acrobatics in specific points of the track: whoever gets the highest score winsor. In Sectional Race you don't have to cross the finish line first, instead you need to conquer specific sections of the track in the shortest time possible. Infinitely more original are the two remaining mini-games; Snake is a clear reference to the mobile game made famous by Nokia: inserted inside a fence, your goal is to make your opponents crash into the lethal trail left behind you. Finally, in Tag your task is to win a ball and keep it, without being touched, for the pre-established time. Psone's Return The technical sector is probably the weakest aspect of the entire production, so as to recall the results obtained by the previous consoles. What makes one turn up one's nose are above all the textures, roughly spread on the surfaces, and the polygonal models, decidedly poor in details. Anti-aliasing has not been implemented, while the frame-rate is subject to annoying and inexplicable drops, given the poverty of polygons on the screen. Of a completely different tenor is the audio department, which has always been one of the strengths of the series. The reproduction of the various engine rumbles is quite realistic, and will satisfy all enthusiasts. Equally convincing is the tracklist, which includes the presence of prominent groups such as Nickelback and My Chemical Romance. Comment Though billed as the new benchmark of the Off-Road genre, Mx vs. Atv Untamed proves to be a barely sufficient title, and far from the standards of excellence previously touched by the series. To undermine the quality of the product there is a game concept which, now in its seventh incarnation, appears hopelessly stale. The situation is aggravated by a severely deficient technical sector, and a far from impeccable physics management. Given the multitude of modes, and the frenetic gameplay, the regret grows for a product that with greater attention to detail would certainly have graduated the spearhead of the series; the game that we are holding in our hands is rather unconvincing, and in fact will only satisfy the most hardcore fans. Pros Large number of vehicles and events Convincing multiplayer Usual Gameplay Cons same for 10 years Graphically from previous generation. Physics of vehicles disappointing. MX vs. ATV Untamed is available for Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PSP and Xbox 360. The tested version is the one for Playstation 3.", "date": "2008-03-27", "grade": null}
