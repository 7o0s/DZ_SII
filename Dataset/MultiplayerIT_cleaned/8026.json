For a title that bases a large part of its unstable alchemical formula on atmospheres, it is not easy to be able to reconfirm itself, moreover its classic survival horror granite structure tends to clash strongly with the current needs of the market, increasingly flattened on a standardization of the shooter in third person. Even during the approach to the second chapter, the words of the upper echelons of Electronic Arts, who pushed to make the Visceral series a blockbuster of millions of copies, had alarmed the ranks of enthusiasts, who feared losing the elite level of difficulty and tension that characterized the first chapter, but the maximum of mistrust was probably reached with the presentation of Dead Space 3, which with its open and snowy setting and the presence of two-character cooperative multiplayer seemed to definitively condemn to oblivion the extraordinary experience of the first two chapters and from this point of view, even the demo released a few days ago brought more doubts than reassurances. Finally, the coup de grace for the expectations of the fans was the confirmation of the micro-transactions and the release of 11 DLCs at launch. Only then, to prove the facts, the indictment set up in honor of fidelity to the original spirit of Dead Space and, why not, to a way of conceiving the video game more in line with the dictates of hardcore gaming, in good part crumbles. As already happened in the second chapter, whose variations on the initial theme are still probably more sensitive and spot on than those present in this third part, Visceral have managed to introduce a series of innovations perfectly integrated into the fabric of the game, leaving the strong specific identity of Dead Space intact but varying the experience just enough to overcome the threshold of mere more of the same content, partially modifying the play structure without distorting it. The new and open setting itself, which in the presentation materials seemed to dominate for almost the entire game, actually occupies about half of the story, after a first part perfectly in line with the space horror atmospheres characteristic of the first chapters and manages to create a breaking point and a scenographic variation that keeps the interest high even in the most advanced stages, when the amount of hours accumulated could pave the way for monotony. An unfinished business, for two Isaac Clarke isn't exactly the lucky guy, and it was clear that his fight against Sitology and markers wouldn't stop at the end of the second chapter. And so, despite himself, the space engineer finds himself once again involved in a new hellish journey, in an attempt to destroy the markers once and for all and put an end to the horror of the necromorphs. A ~rude awakening~ gives us back an Isaac still alone, torn and essentially forced to take part in the desperate mission of revolt against the markers and the cult connected to them, in a long journey that takes us to the frozen lands of Tau Volantis. The evolution of the protagonist takes a further step: from the cold and silent battle automaton of the first chapter to the mentally fragile but strong-willed character of the second, Isaac in Dead Space 3 is an experienced fighter and the only hope of a humanity now on its knees . It is not a change without logic, on the other hand. After two long trips to hell, the shy and awkward engineer has become an authority on the fight against necromorphs and the information stored in his memory is the key to destroying the markers. In short, the transformation of the character into a hero has been completed, which in some ways seems too spotless and fearless. In this case, the psychoses and mental imbalances fall above all on John Carver, Isaac's grumpy adventure companion who evidently has an unfinished business with the markers and who, despite his military training, seems in some cases to give way to madness during its hallucinatory moments. The presence of a second main character and a support team reinforces the narrative substratum of the game with a greater amount of dialogues and cutscenes, but the sense of loneliness and the general atmosphere, in case of playing solo , have remained largely unchanged from previous chapters. Visceral's choice on the introduction of cooperative multiplayer demonstrates a remarkable coherence with the spirit of the series: instead of placing two persalways appearing on the screen, even if you play in single (as happens for example in the last chapters of Resident Evil), which would have greatly affected the horror atmosphere, Carver only comes into action by selecting multiplayer, otherwise he simply stays on background, as another minor character in Isaac's story. So what is the dreaded impact of introducing co-op? In fact, it is not invasive at all: Visceral have had an extremely attentive approach to tradition, inserting a notable opening to players interested in multiplayer (useful, however, to facilitate insertion into the mechanics of newbies and to dilute the horror climate which could be excessive for some) but keeping it well separated from the original core of the gameplay, which remains practically unchanged in the single player. We are basically faced with two different games, depending on whether you decide for single or multiplayer. In the first case, the game is strongly anchored to the spirit of the original, in the second, however, we are witnessing a classic cooperative action, significantly modifying the experience between fights and puzzles, while remaining within the same level design. The different direction that characterizes both versions also pushes you to play the levels in both single and multiplayer, since various scenes are presented differently in one or the other game mode, as well as some optional missions are exclusively linked to cooperative multiplayer, all material that benefits the longevity and replayability of the title which is also characterized by a good basic duration (by the writer it was completed in about 17 hours, with a certain calm and doing almost all the optional missions). Also note the possibility of unlocking 4 other game modes at the end, which offer higher difficulty levels and some variations on the theme, based on the different distribution and quantity of resources and enemies compared to the standard mode. Old and new nightmares The combat system and part of the puzzles derive directly from ideas already present in the first two chapters, with some more or less cumbersome introductions. There remains the need to hit the enemies with a certain criterion, in particular aiming at sensitive elements such as the limbs or the ~yellow~ areas, a real stylistic feature of the series and a valid basis for enriching a shooter mechanic which, not being able to count on a great dynamism given the relative slowness of the protagonist, he focuses above all on aim, steady nerves and the ability to manage the arsenal. To enrich the system with strategic additions there are the usual special abilities given by the combat suits, or Stasis (ability to slow down or block moving elements) and Kinesis (control of objects from a distance). All things that veterans of the series know by heart, but in Dead Space 3 we also find some more or less successful news. In the face of a substantial constancy in the structure of the fight against necromorphs, whose new types overlap with the usual ones of the other chapters, except for some variants that appear towards the end of the game, an absolute novelty is represented by the clash with human soldiers. This is actually a rather weak introduction, combined with the possibility of using contextual coverage through the new ability to stoop, a barely hinted approach to the prevailing trend of third-person shooters but decidedly little and poorly developed. Taken as simple variants of the normal game process, these firefights can offer diversions and even moments of respite from the continuous and stressful confrontation with nightmares and various aberrations, but it is clear that Dead Space's shooter mechanics do not combine well, so as it is, to the firefight between human combatants. Things change when the necromorphs break in and three factions fighting at the same time are created, complete with mergers between one and the other, in which case the challenge returns to the usual, excellent levels, but the introduction of human soldiers appears accessory and somewhat revisable. The micro-transactions and DLC affair In addition to the mistrust for the cooperative mode, EA has easily antagonized a large number of audiences with some marketing choices that have not sounded good at all to classic gamers: the presence of numerous DLCs and the consequent micro-transactions, which they are then two sides of the same phenomenon. While acknowledging the legitimacy of getting angry with these ways of understanding the traditional video game, it must be said that the presence of micro-transactions in the game is by no means invasive. These allow (at least those present so far) to obtain materials or weapons already built in exchange for an outlay of real currency, which bypasses all the work of eliminating enemies and collecting materials necessary to achieve the same results. Obviously it is a choice that takes away the pleasure of progressing with one's own strength and discovering the possible combinations offered by crafting, in a ~casual~ perspective which in this case seems more self-defeating than anything else. Shortcuts are therefore proposed for content that can still be reached even without spending more money and since there is no competitive multiplayer there is not even the risk of an imbalance of the game towards the infamous ~pay-to-win~, so we can ask ourselves about the meaning of a introduction of the genre, but without necessarily considering it a negative point in the experience of the game, since, if desired, it is totally negligible. Engineer at work On the other hand, the other novelty that characterizes the gameplay of this third chapter appears decidedly more convincing, namely the collection of building materials, the crafting of objects and weapons and the presence of universal ammunition, three aspects of the same, new conception of management of weapons. Even this novelty was not received in the best way and the demo test had not fully convinced on this front, but within the entire course of the game it is possible to appreciate the mechanics which actually provide an enrichment to the general structure. The collection of materials allows the creation of new weapons and their upgrade through the application of new components, abandoning the classic system of nodes and paving the way for numerous possibilities for customizing the arsenal, which made the choice of weapons technically obligatory. universal ammunition, due to the difficulty of associating the right stocks with the new weapons created and to allow for a more frequent change between the different solutions. The upgrade is also particular, which without node management relies on the application of various circuits within slots (of a fixed number depending on the type of weapon), capable of modifying the statistics in the fields of power, rate of fire , reload speed and magazine capacity, combinable with each other. The presence of a limited number of slots alters the possibilities of evolution of the weapons, thus trying to avoid excessive imbalances. This new conception is based on the developers' desire to provide more personalized fire solutions, given that based on the surveys carried out it emerged that users tended to use only two or three of the pre-established weapons for most of the time, in the previous chapters. The idea is commendable and the realization well balanced, also considering the relative difficulty in collecting huge quantities of materials and the crafting actually adds something new and interesting to the gameplay, even if it must be said that it does not necessarily determine a greater rotation between weapons, since it is likely that enthusiasts will continue to use the favorite weapons of the other chapters, perhaps with some applied variations. However, it is also fun just to experiment with the associations between the different components and the application of the various modifiers capable of varying the effects and power of the weapons. Similarly, the materials collected for the levels can also be used to upgrade the suit and to create support items such as medkits and ammo, which tends to create a certain abundance of the latter, contrary to what happened in previous chapters . It's difficult to run out of bullets and energy reloads completely, but this is also offset by a greater number of enemies and longer and tighter fights, so the tension is still high. Xbox 360 goals The loot offered by the game to achievement hunters is made up of the usual 50 objectives for 1000 points. The objectives related to the progression in the story are unlocked in conjunction with particular events, rather than in correspondence with the levels, while many others are connected to exploration, the discovery of secrets and the achievement of certain performances in combat or in the collection of objects. Generally speaking, achieving a high score is quite a challenge. The carousel of horrors Dead Space 3 takes up the excellent pace of play achieved in the second chapter, evolving with respect to the progenitor, presenting a remarkable progression of events and variety of situations. The journey of Isaac and his companions up to Tau Volantis is characterized by more marked changes of setting than those seen in the past, punctuated by extremely s", "date": "2013-02-04", "grade": "9.0"}
