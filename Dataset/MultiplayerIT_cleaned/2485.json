{"name": "Rumble Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rumble-racing_a.html", "text": "Electronic Arts goes arcade I apologize for my colorful commentary but unfortunately I don't have the expertise of Andrea de Adamich nor are we in the presence of a Formula One game. But we are faced with the funniest driving game of recent times. Rumble Racing is simply a distinctly arcade-inspired racing game, born from the tradition of Electronic Arts in the field of simulations dedicated to the typically American series of Formula Nascar. Abandoned, at least temporarily, the simulation component, Rumble Racing proves to be a completely original title and devoted exclusively to immediate fun and without too many fixed schemes. The game gives us the possibility to choose between 36 different vehicles (initially much less), well characterized and different from each other not only for their performance but also for their usefulness. We find flaming Cadillacs from the past, pure ~American Style~ pick-ups, tiny utility cars and a series of unconventional vehicles. Among the latter, Thor (which I have already told you about in the introduction), Interceptor (a futuristic police car) and the amazing XXS Tomcat (real combat aircraft) deserve a mention. For each vehicle there are 2 further ~pumped up~ versions that will allow us to participate in the Pro and Elite category races once we have managed to make the Rookie cup our own. Am I going to go wrong? Once we have selected our favorite vehicle, we have the opportunity to try our hand at some interesting modes: Single Race, Championship, Showdown (a single lap with a single opponent) and Stunt Competition. The Championship Mode is characterized by a progressive series of competitions, each consisting of 3 races, which once won will allow us to unlock new tracks, cars and access the next ~cups~. Both the Single Race and the Championship allow us not only to compare ourselves with seven other computer-controlled drivers but also to face all the routes supported by a friend who will take on the role of teammate and not of opponent. There are 15 slopes at our disposal (initially only 3), a number that should not be underestimated especially for the vastness and variety of each track. I spoke of vastness certainly not by chance. In fact, you will notice that each track will extend for several kilometers along the roadway but will also give us the possibility to choose some alternative detours which, if used properly, will turn into real shortcuts. We will thus pass through a stable on a farm, ford rivers and run along the tracks near the station. The comedy of the situations that follow is difficult to express. A cyclone for all seasons If you add the fact that along the way there are numerous power-ups to collect by passing over them to what I have already said, the resulting result is something similar to Mario Kart or the nice Crash Team Racing. Nitro (extra speed boost), Super Traction (greater grip on the road), Shockwave (shock wave that literally sends opponents flying) and Freeze (momentarily freezes vehicles) are just some of these power-ups. The spectacular Twister deserves to be treated separately, a real cinematic effect, which darkens the sky in a matter of seconds and produces a cyclone of biblical dimensions capable of sweeping away everything that appears in front of it. To see... The main feature of Rumble Racing, however, is the exceptional speed and frenzy of the game. Rarely have I seen a racing game run at this crazy speed and this is even more highlighted by the more or less constant 60 frames per second with which the graphics engine moves. However, such speed would be useless if a simple and immediate control system were not supported. In fact, you will not find any difficulty in getting hold of it, so much so that probably the extreme simplicity of controlling the vehicles could constitute a significant defect for some of you. Let's not forget that this is an arcade game... It's not music to your ears... Graphically Rumble Racing certainly does not represent the state of the art although a pledge was due for the convincing robustness of the frame rate. Some of the graphical flaws of the first generation titles are present in the game even if to a lesser extent than other past productions. The much hated aliasing is still alive but goes almost unnoticed due to the speed of the game. The slopes are relizcreated with a great deal of detail and great imagination but I believe that something more could have been done especially with regard to the textures which more than once appear to me to be rather bland. On the other hand, the creation of the 36 vehicles deserves praise, some of which represent a small design masterpiece. However, the sound of the game did not convince me both for the often anonymous and off-topic music and for some sound effects. Among the latter, many are rather amusing and spectacular. Last lap At the end of this crazy race, all I have to do is give Rumble Racing all the merits it deserved. The excellent playability and speed are undoubtedly the winning points of a game that almost surprisingly manages to win the prize for best arcade racing game available for PlayStation 2. You could ask for something more from the graphic design but what scrolls on the screen however, it is not to be underestimated. Regardless of the forthcoming release of Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec, I would recommend the purchase of Rumble Racing to all fans of the genre. Simulation purists will perhaps turn up their noses more than once but I suggest they take a look at it too. Pros: Too much fun! Fast-paced like few others Awesome vehicles Cons: Too arcadey? The PS2 can do better The first edition of the craziest race in the world has reached its last lap. After a long and very tight race between the best drivers on the planet, Road Trip (a very rickety pickup truck), Thor (an evolution of the Batmobile) and Vortex (a curious vehicle powered by a very powerful reactor) remained to contend for victory. We are at the last bends and the three cars continue side by side... but now Thor manages to fish a powerful weapon from the side of the road which literally freezes his opponents in a matter of seconds! It now seems made for Thor .... but what happens! The terrifying silhouette of Cataclysm emerges from the rear, from whose powerful engine a devastating cyclone is generated which sweeps away opponents and fans in the stands. Guys it's over! Cataclysm passes under the checkered flag and becomes the Rumble Racing champion!", "date": "2001-06-14", "grade": null}
