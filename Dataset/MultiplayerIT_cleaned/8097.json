{"name": "Mass Effect Trilogy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/110719-mass-effect-trilogy-guerre-intergalattiche.html", "text": "Mass Effect, we have repeated it several times on these pages, was an epic and in its own way visionary trilogy, which successfully experimented with various formulas in terms of gameplay, offering users for the first time a great freedom of choice to determine the course of events narrated with mastery and cinematic cut, in a fascinating science fiction context. And this since its debut in 2007 with the first episode, at the time exclusive for Xbox 360, which PlayStation 3 owners can now finally experience firsthand. The game, as well as downloadable for a fee also from PSN, is in fact contained in the Mass Effect Trilogy collection together with the other chapters of the saga and some DLCs. In this regard, however, it must immediately be said that the collection is not that complete package that many fans probably expected. In fact, the trilogy does not include all the extra content released so far for every single episode of the series: in detail, the first game has integrated only Bring Down the Sky, Mass Effect 2 boasts the presence of more material, such as Cerberus Network , Kasumi - The Stolen Memory, Overlord and The Shadow, while Mass Effect 3 is practically identical to the original version released in stores. Having closed the parenthesis relating to the contents of the collection, let us therefore move on to the technical analysis of the three titles, but not before having described the plot of the entire saga in a nutshell, reserving the right to write some further details then within the paragraphs relating to the individual episodes. It broadly narrates the story of Commander Shepard and a group of characters, many of whom belong to different alien races in the galaxy, engaged at a certain point in their existence in the battle against powerful mysterious beings called Reapers. They are half organic and half synthetic in nature, as well as in the shape of huge spaceships, and are ~activated~ by a mysterious entity in particular historical conditions that could over time undermine the ecosystem on which the balance of the Universe is based. . Once recalled, these creatures destroy and eliminate all life to restore order and give rise to a new existential cycle. Mass Effect and interactions The first episode of this real blockbuster in the videogame sector immediately serves to identify and define the stylistic code of the entire trilogy. If the structure of the adventure itself is the classic one for the genre, with the main character controlled directly by the user and two companions in tow, the setting given to the rest is different. In fact, Mass Effect presents a mixture of different genres ranging from the third-person shooter to the western role-playing game, up to some aspects to the graphic adventure, with lots of dialogues available between the protagonist and the various characters he meets, the latter rich both in terms of of content and variety. Rarely ends in themselves, the discussions are not only useful to determine on the basis of the questions and answers formulated part of Shepard's status, to forge alliances, unlock sidequests or to start romantic relationships, but also to better understand the universe in which events unfold, including the cultures of various races. During social interactions, a list of emotions or expressible phrases appear on the screen which vary from a minimum of two up to six possible choices depending on the communication skills of the character or the situation. Once a voice has been selected, it is translated by Shepard into a complete dialogue, which also depending on how good, bad or neutral he was previously, can contemplate for the same joke two tones of voice and two different facial expressions, triggering different reactions, in the short and in the long term, both from his companions and from recurring characters, who consequently can fall in love with the commander, hate him or simply collaborate with him. All this pushes the most curious gamers to try and try again, to talk and interact with every sentient creature that crosses its path, as well as to explore. In this sense, to sublimate everything there are the research phases aboard the Normandy spaceship, the headquarters of Shepard and associates, with which to move in space from one planet to another, and in some cases, those to live in board the Mako, a land vehicle useful for exploring some locations in search of precious minerals, which however are truly repetitive. On a mission Once set off on a mission, the player can select from a large armory the ones he deems the best and which become more and more powerful, as well as differentiated, as the gGame continues and the level of Shepard and co. increases. As mentioned at the beginning, the choice of the two members who make up the commander's team is also important, given that some of them react to places, facts and known people in a different way, making variations to the main plot and in certain situations even to the approach same to the mission and the clashes. These take place in real time and in many aspects, see the cover system, they bring to mind the best third-person shooters of this console generation, with more RPG elements such as biotic powers. The classic skills of defense, blocking and various upgrades are then joined by those that make use of the game's physics engine and exploit real-time combat to use portions of the scenario as blunt weapons to be often launched against opponents. Too bad in these situations the poor artificial intelligence of the enemies which makes the clashes not exactly exciting and in some phases quite repetitive as well. Technically Mass Effect is a little gem from different points of view, with its bewitching glimpses and its scenarios of a future now rooted in the science fiction imagination of millions of fans. With the exception of a couple of woody animations, and a few bare textures to cover certain environments, basically we have nothing short of spectacular graphics, with vivid colors, polygonal models of excellent workmanship both from the anatomical point of view and from that of the expressive range for the characters, as well as a valid reproduction of the skin of the same and of the fabrics of their clothes. In this sense, the porting work done by Edge of Reality, the studio that worked side by side with BioWare on Mass Effect Trilogy for PlayStation 3 and in particular on the first chapter, was good. While featuring the same engine and the same quality as the original on Xbox 360, this version of ME boasts greater stability in the framerate, a few less pop-ups for the textures (in some cases they took a few seconds to appear on the screen in 2007 edition) and an improved light and shadow system. The audio is splendid as always, with the excellent dubbing in Italian in which the voices of Claudio Moneta (Shepard), Silvana Fantini (Matriarch Benezia) and Francesca Perilli (Liara T'Soni) stand out, in addition to the soundtrack that passes ~ nimbly~ and without jarring from the alienating rhythms of the 80's cyberpunk synth to the more classical symphonies. Mass Effect 2 And so we come to Mass Effect 2, the second episode of the saga and second title contained in the Mass Effect Trilogy, whose story starts exactly where the first chapter ended. Without going into too much detail to avoid spoilers, let's just say that after an event that radically marks the life of the protagonist, the usual Shepard, the gamer's task will be to set up a new crew capable of facing an apparently decisive battle for the fate of the galaxy. Small note: it was not possible for us to test it directly due to the amount of game and limited time, but it should be possible to import ME1 saves, with all the implications of the case, in particular on the ramifications of the plot. This is also confirmed by BioWare's Ryan Warden on Twitter. Returning to the product, focusing on a narrative structure that once again focuses a large part of its charm on themes, scenarios and situations that are part of the general collective imagination of every science fiction enthusiast, as well as on the interaction between characters, the title improves those thematic plots seen in the predecessor, giving overall a greater depth to the gaming experience. The choices available to the player, always oriented towards the alternation of good or bad attitudes, are in fact even more numerous and have such consequences that two different games will hardly lead to two identical endings. It being understood that the basis of the game remains unchanged, it is important here to highlight the most striking changes in the gameplay made by BioWare compared to the prequel. In practical terms, first of all we see the elimination of the inventory, so the different types of weapons and upgrades become a sort of common heritage shared between the various elements of the party, which with the related DLCs are thirteen. Furthermore, they are largely synthesized in the Normandy laboratory (and no longer found only in special cases), provided you have the necessary projects to implement them. Then abandoned the exploration of some worlds aboard the Mako, in this sequel minerals and rare objects must be recovered by performing the direct scan of the surfaces of the planets that make up the galaxy, directly from the Normandy. THEIn this sense, an interstellar map is introduced in which to move the miniature representation of the spaceship, complete with fuel consumption and probes useful for extracting metals. Occasionally this procedure can lead users to receive information, radio communications or requests for help from the same celestial bodies they are viewing, and this, after landing, can give life to some of the hidden secondary missions. In addition to this renewed variety of situations and settings, to give depth to the game there is also a much more precise balance of the different classes and a clearer differentiation between them, which forces a much more careful choice of the powers to be develop and, above all, companions to take on the various missions. These missions are decidedly more varied than the first Mass Effect, thanks to the better level design of the environments, the renewed AI of the enemies, a much more intuitive targeting system and greater fluidity in the action derived from a more functional mapping of the commands. As for the technical part, the title uses the same updated engine libraries used for Mass Effect 3 in its ~single~ edition. So we have a very well defined lighting system and shadows that improve the overall vision of the product, and some slight refinements here and there. Honorable mention also in this chapter to the sound that seems worthy of a film production. Playstation 3 trophies Mass Effect Trilogy features a large amount of Trophies divided by games and DLCs, most of which are obtainable by following the storylines related to the main adventure. For example, for Mass Effect 2 we have 56 Trophies, of which 47 Bronze, 6 Silver, 2 Gold and 1 Platinum, while for Mass Effect 3 there are 51: 42 Bronze, 6 Silver, 2 Gold and 1 Platinum. Mass Effect 3 The last chapter of the saga directly takes up the events narrated in the DLC of Mass Effect 2, the Advent (unfortunately absent in the package), and therefore sees Commander Shepard in front of the Earth Council where he was called to provide explanations about the Reapers , minutes before the enemy launches a terrible attack. Mass Effect 3 therefore takes up numerous issues left open, representing the natural continuation of the predecessor in terms of plot, while in terms of gameplay it draws inspiration from both previous chapters. In this sense, BioWare has in fact also recovered some elements from the progenitor, slightly changing the cards on the table and making this latest episode a sort of hybrid between the first two. In addition to the return of historical characters from the saga within the party, such as Liara T'Soni, Garrus and Kaidan Alenko or Ashley Williams (depends on the choices made in the past or at the beginning of the game by the gamer), or in the form of cameos such as the various Miranda Lawson, Kelly Chambers or Thane (always in relation to the decisions made in the previous episodes on their fate), in the game there is also the inevitable presence of the Normandy and the Citadel. The first is, as always, indispensable in leading the players to travel in space to carry on the story, visit new and old worlds, unlock or complete sidequests and collect a real army to oppose the invader, as well as the indispensable pieces to build the Crucible, a very powerful and ancient weapon. Ditto the second, certainly available for exploration, but also to provide it too, in turn, new elements useful for adventure, side missions and an internal market where, among other things, purchase armor and weapons. Precisely this section shows some of the most relevant modifications of the game in terms of gameplay, given that in addition to the numerous spare parts applicable to rifles, armor and pistols, one must pay close attention to the weight occupied by the same objects before equipping them in one of the five slots available, and go into battle. This is because exceeding can lead to an increase in weight which is to the detriment of the recharge time of the powers and in general of the performance of the character. News also for the RPG elements, with the biotic powers made even more decisive in the context of battles, especially the defensive ones, and more customizable thanks to the introduction of a fourth level branch in the upgrade tree. The classes available at the start of the game remain unchanged, including the hybrid sentry, the pure soldier or the engineer. For the rest Mass Effect 3 behaves, in terms of playability, in a way not dissimilar from its predecessor, with the dialogue phases, the exploratory ones and the action sessions that are embellished by the functional omniblade, a blade resulting from the holo vector", "date": "2012-12-21", "grade": "8.0"}
