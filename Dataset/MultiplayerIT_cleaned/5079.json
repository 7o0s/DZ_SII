The epic directed by Cory Barlog managed to convince practically everyone, taking home numerous awards as game of the year and getting a high vote also on the pages of Multiplayer.it albeit mitigated by a series of ~limitations~ related to the variety of its enemies and the depth of the combat that we weren't fully convinced of. In recent years the boys of Santa Monica Studio have continued to work on their work, this time directed by a new director, Eric Williams, a more moderate person, used to remaining behind the scenes, always linked to this series and particularly competent on everything regarding the combat system. And who, among other things, we had the great fortune of interviewing exclusively in Italy. The result is God of War Ragnarok. A sequel strongly linked to its predecessor, which in practice represents a direct extension to the point that the two titles can practically be considered a whole: a single great journey in the Nordic lands where Kratos and Atreus find themselves forced, despite themselves, to fulfill their destiny. In this God of War Ragnarok review we will try to be direct and, as far as possible, concise in analyzing the plot, gameplay, novelties and old elements that return, not failing to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of a game that has very high expectations and which, arguably, also plays the role of the most important PlayStation exclusive of the year. Without taking anything away from Horizon Forbidden West and Gran Turismo 7. We will try to do this with limiting any spoilers but, hopefully this is obvious and justifiable, we will assume that if you are reading this article, you will have already completed God of War 2018 at the very least. If not, well, what are you doing here? One big story arc The relationship between Kratos and Atreus punctuates the entire story of God of War Ragnarok As we had already said in the previous article dedicated to the game, on the occasion of our first test played, God of War Ragnarok closely follows the events told in the first chapter. In reality there is an important time ellipsis as the story begins 3 years after the epilogue of its predecessor, a few hours before the post-credits scene shown in that chapter. This time frame is crucial to justify the ~new~ relationship between Kratos and his son Atreus. The two are immersed in a series of routine tasks that they find themselves carrying out day after day during the constant search for food and heating while waiting for the end of the world, which started precisely because of the actions of father and son in the previous God of War, falls with all its violence on the 9 Norse kingdoms. There is not that subtle, creeping drama that characterized the narrative incipit of the 2018 game, there is not a strong triggering element such as the death of a wife and a mother, but there is an omnipresent feeling of unease, of concern, of anguish: Kratos and Atreus are two fugitives who have to deal with a world that doesn't want them, that is hunting them, they have practically no friends with the only exception of the wise talking head Mimir and the two dwarves, Sindri and Brok, of which, however, traces have been lost. If seen from the outside this is the situation in which we find the two protagonists busy in their daily affairs, it is observed from the inside that the lives of Kratos and Atreus gain a whole other thickness. Ragnarok is in fact, first of all, the story of that indissoluble, critical, complex and always ready to fray bond, which has existed since the dawn of time between a child who becomes a teenager and a father (but this applies to any parent) who feels unsuitable, who doesn't know how to interface with those who are part of his blood and his flesh, who struggles to understand where to place the boundaries of autonomy and independence and where instead to dictate his personal laws of life. Sindri is one of the most important supporting characters in God of War Ragnarok The whole plot of Ragnarok is the metaphor of the growth of a child, of parental needs, of the difficulties inherent in adolescence: that continuous push and pull between the desire for independence that a boy seeks ardently, but which struggles to obtain due to a too apprehensive or simply too cumbersome parent who, by the simple fact of existing and deserving of respect, finds himself stifling any legitimate desire for freedom. Ragnarok tries to explain and teach how every rappgarden may have its secrets and its omissis, but how essential it is that it is based on a relationship of mutual trust because otherwise nothing can resist the inkling of a betrayal or under the crushing weight of a prophecy that someone else has written for us. We are deliberately cryptic because we do not want to reveal anything about the story told in Ragnarok: it is enough to know that alongside the figures mentioned above who return to the scene (and to these we add Freya who plays an incredibly deep and complex role), there will be many new ones that we will get to know. Not only blatantly negative figures such as Thor and Odin, but also secondary characters of great depth such as the Angrboda glimpsed in the first announcement trailer and the surprising Tyr to whom we owe most of the plot twists. To keep you company as the action continues there is therefore a constant sense of familiarity that also affects the exploration of the nine realms, this time all really present even if they can be explored with different degrees of freedom, and which often stimulate precious memories. Midgard is a constant reminder of the events of the previous God of War, but even Alfheim or Muspelheim feeds on a constant sense of deja-vu that is both pleasant and melancholy. Clearly there is no shortage of completely new areas, which indeed represent the vast majority, but it will certainly be interesting for you too to observe the work of Santa Monica Studio in ensuring that this sequel is respectful of the past, but also tries to detach itself from it. Brok perfectly performs the comic shoulder function also in this God of War Ragnarok As has also been said over and over again by the developer, Ragnarok's narrative structure is made up of a single, long main quest and a handful of side missions that will be activated during the exploration of the 9 realms. With the exception of a couple of occasions, all these secondaries offer important insights into the game's story and for this reason we do not particularly agree with Santa Monica and its director when on multiple occasions they emphasized the optional nature of all these activities additional. Not carrying out at least the side quests would be a real shame for a title of this type, given that very often they offer particularly important narrative cues and turns, even in the endgame. Of course, there are also a host of fetch quests, collectibles and activities absolutely suitable only for fans of completion at all costs (between crows to kill and documents, treasures, flowers and so on and so forth, to collect), but progression, in our opinion, cannot be so strongly separated between the main story and everything else that can be done in Ragnarok, as the developers have wanted us to believe on several occasions. For information, it took us 37 hours to arrive to the end credits, completing about 75% of all that the game is able to offer. A linear but open action Svartalfaheim is just one of the freely explorable realms in God of War Ragnarok This is exactly the definition that Santa Monica has always given to the 2018 God of War and, clearly, to this sequel that follows in its footsteps: an action adventure that is linear in the narrative, but open in the way of dealing with it. Ragnarok therefore proposes, once again, a gameplay that skilfully alternates very guided phases with a very high scripting intensity (which in reality are the minority in the total calculation of this sequel), to situations where the rhythm of the action is marked by the player who will have to choose how much time to ~lose~ in exploring the scenario, collecting collectibles, embarking on climbing and environmental puzzles, or simply fighting for the pure pleasure of doing it, perhaps in an attempt to complete a particularly difficult activity or complete a secondary mission. Compared to the first chapter, this time the realms that provide for free exploration are many more and practically all of them offer the same reveal: the game leads us to get to know them and to face them for the first time following the main quest, at a certain point there is an important narrative turning point and we are given the option of continuing with the main story leaving the kingdom behind us, or of continuing to explore it at our leisure by discovering all the more or less accessible areas and moving quickly aboard boats and animal-drawn sled. Compared to the past, the Zeldian component where some areas remain forbidden until we gain certain powers is certainly more marked, but this clearly does not make Ragnarok a metroidvania. It is simply a very clever baitmotage that the developer has implemented to ensure that the player is encouraged to return to a realm over and over again, instead of just completing it 100% the first time the game introduces him to that area. Kratos and Atreus continue to live in their house in the sequel as well However, all this, combined with that concept of activities that are never really optional that we were talking about previously, means that the pace of the game is extremely more staid, almost diluted in a long series of activities that one feels ~forced~ to carry out but which inexorably bring down that feeling of progressive sipped discovery which was instead the basis of the previous God of War. Ragnarok throws everything at you right away and does it repeatedly, to the point that at the fourth realm in which to roam freely aboard a canoe, you begin to feel a little tired. Let it be clear that we in no way mean that Ragnarok is a boring game, indeed, more simply than that triptych of epicness, novelty, discovery that were the basis of the events narrated and played in the 2018 God of War, here they fail a bit because Kratos is now a talkative and insecure father partly because the gods are basically ordinary people with normal problems, partly because between geysers to freeze, wheels to spin and tunnels to explore, everything seems to have already been seen. However, there is a double element that breaks this apparent repetitiveness and which marks a violent cut with the previous chapter. Deep and layered combat In God of War Ragnarok there are a great many shields available to Kratos When you start fighting in God of War Ragnarok, and we guarantee you that you will do it for dozens and dozens of hours, the clean break with the past is evident. Also in this area, for spoiler reasons, we will be forced to hold back, but suffice it to say that this time the combat system is incredibly layered, deep and above all complex to master. The attack options are many, not only within each weapon, but also in all possible combinations and alternations between attack methodologies. Each offensive tool has a charge that acts as an alteration of subsequent attacks, has light and heavy moves , dual runic attacks, skills that unlock combos and more strikes never seen before. There are multiple types of shields, each with its own special strike that charges differently, there's an additional cooldown skill that Kratos can equip in heirloom form, even the God of War's Fury now has a triple mode of consumption and use. And to all this we must add Atreus with two different types of arrows to attack opponents and unleash further combos, in addition to his specific branches of talents that determine his behavior in battle and the special shots he can perform independently. There are dozens of mini bosses in God of War Ragnarok The result is extremely pleasant and varied combat, where the player always feels in control of the actions and is forced to think continuously according to the enemies that stand in front of him, often cleverly positioned by the developer to offer a challenge rate that grows with consistency throughout the story. Hold off the numerous cooldowns, switch weapons on the fly to take advantage of the opponents' bounce so as to keep them in the air, helpless, for as long as possible (we believe that the physics has been lightened in the sequel), unleash fury at the right time to recover precious vital energy, interrupting the most devastating attacks by synchronizing shield blows properly, will make you experience multiple orgasms when the action gets particularly tough or you will have to deal with some optional activity focused on clashes. And all this goes hand in hand with a renewed equipment management system which, inevitably this too, is the direct evolution of what we saw in the previous chapter. There is everything and much more: more pieces of armor, more accessory elements for weapons, a system of gems which, combined with each other, allow you to have access to passive bonuses capable of offering an additional management layer to better configure one's ideal Kratos and so on. And the same goes, clearly, for the management of the talent trees which, in addition to being divided for each weapon, have specific sections for Atreus and allow an additional degree of configurability through some tokens that can be unlocked for some attack skills, so to suit your fighting style. The shield is even more important to properly time the rhythm of the clashes And while we're at it, let's also talk briefly about the enemies: yet another pulverized element of Ragnarok", "date": "2022-11-03", "grade": "9.0"}
