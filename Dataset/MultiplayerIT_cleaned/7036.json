A delicate passage, because balances and times of products born in a portable perspective do not always adapt well to the home context, beyond the original quality. Fortunately, in the case of Pullblox World, the transfer took place almost painlessly, confirming how the formula devised by the Japanese team is completely satisfactory even in front of the TV screen in the living room. And so both fans of the first hour, and those who have never heard of the series before, will be able to spend hours in front of the brainy puzzles of the Nintendo puzzle game, wondering how a product with such a sweet and instead, it is tender to be able to bring out the worst in every gamer not endowed with large quantities of the proverbial holy patience. Pullblox World is also confirmed on Wii U as a puzzle game of exceptional quality Up to the top Pullblox World, precisely because of its function of introducing the series to the world of home consoles, does not in any way affect the mechanics of its predecessors; if therefore the fans will be able to count on an absolute familiarity from the first moments, the novices will instead be gradually introduced to the gameplay studied by Intelligent Systems. Furthermore, it is no coincidence that none of the innovations introduced with Fallblox are present: ~better to start from the basics, start from the beginning~ the Japanese game designers must have thought. The fundamental concept on which Pullblox World is based is therefore enclosed in a very simple ability which the protagonist Mallo is equipped with, an obese sumo wrestler who can push and pull the pieces that make up buildings of various sizes and appearances. Each irregularly shaped tile, when pulled out, actually creates platforms on which Mallo can climb. The aim of the game is therefore essentially to manage the movement of the blocks in such a way as to create a path that takes it to the top of the building, where there is a crying child to save. As with the best puzzles therefore, the basic concept is very simple to understand, as are the controls which practically limit themselves to allowing you to cling to the pieces (to be pulled or pushed with the left stick) and to jump. In addition, you can move the camera (R key) and rewind time (L key) to correct a wrong action. This is the starting point to embark on a long and demanding journey through the puzzles of Pullblox World: long because there are 250 levels present, to which are added those tending towards infinity guaranteed by the community and by the editor present. And challenging because the game designed by Intelligent Systems is not one to be taken lightly, really: if the first stages, also thanks to the sugary and colorful graphic component, can suggest a product aimed at novice kids, it doesn't take long to get started to understand that the dough of which Pullblox World is made can be quite hard to chew even for the most expert. Logic and reflection become essential elements through which it is necessary to pass in order to be able to get the better of the most complex puzzles, and being ~stuck~ is certainly not such a rare event, quite the contrary. But the gameplay formula still manages to be so stimulating that it always pushes for one more attempt, for an extra effort to be able to pass that damned level, despite some difficulty peaks that leave you a little perplexed about the balance of the progression. Of course, the risk of repetitiveness for a product of this kind is just around the corner; precisely for this reason, Pullblox World does not delay in adding further elements to the formula, for the most part linked to the functioning of the tiles themselves and their behavior: therefore, keys appear capable of making blocks of the same color advance or completely withdraw, or of sort of ~portal~ hatches that transport Mallo to another point of the puzzle, and so on. Continuing in the adventure, additional modes can also be unlocked, including the aforementioned editor who makes good use of the touch screen of the Wii U controller to support the excellent interface. In reality, in addition to this, and the obvious mirroring mode with the TV off, the GamePad has been exploited very little in Pullblox World; but we don't really feel like blaming them given the original nature of the product. As far as the technical component is concerned, the leap from laptop to living room does not hbrought about who knows what changes, practically with the sole contribution of high resolution capable of returning an obviously sharper and more pleasant image. On the other hand, the absence of the three-dimensional effect takes something away from a product that had actually been largely designed around it: the compromise is necessarily linked to the management of the camera, which becomes almost mandatory in the more complex levels. Finally, the interesting promotion active until the end of July deserves mention, through which owners of at least one of the Nintendo 3DS chapters will be able to purchase this Wii U version with a 30% discount.", "date": "2014-06-30", "grade": "8.2"}
