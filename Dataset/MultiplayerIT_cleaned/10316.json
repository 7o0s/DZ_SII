On the one hand, the fact that the game developed by Rebellion kept us glued to the screen from start to finish will mean something, on the other hand it is clear that a product sold at full price, also equipped with a multiplayer mode of little substance (only deathmatch and team deathmatch), cannot afford to last so little. It almost seems like playing with the invulnerability cheat, such is the destructive power of our character on the screen, as he makes his way to the sound of stabs and bursts of machine guns with the aim of defeating a small army of Korean soldiers by himself. Experiences like this can perhaps gratify the ego, making us think we are real FPS war machines. In reality, this controversial tie-in combines the aforementioned very short duration with a rather low degree of difficulty, due in particular to the mediocre artificial intelligence of the enemies we are facing. Our opponents are often stupid and distracted, so much so that we can get behind them even running without them realizing it and eliminate them immediately by resorting to the very numerous ~fatalities~ that Marcinko has in his repertoire: after pressing a button, a predetermined sequence starts and we see the protagonist who grabs the enemy by the neck and uses his face as an eraser near a wall, or thrusts the dagger into his forehead, or still breaks his neck silently, or (near a railing) throws two shots and knocks him down. It must be admitted that being a bit of a ~ninja~ is fun, especially since the first-person shooter genre rarely offers this type of tactical solution. In terms of firefights, however, the fun fades quickly. Apart from a general lack of accuracy of weapons and collisions, with entire magazines emptied to eliminate even a single enemy, the concretization of the fights is too simplistic and solving them becomes purely a matter of seconds: the Korean soldiers do not care much about taking cover , and when they do they remain in their place, looking out for the necessary time so that they can be centered with the machine gun. In general, the enemies are very unaccustomed to movement and end up playing the role of ~standing obstacles~ in our relentless march towards the annihilation of the communist regime. ~Rossi is born, dead is made~ As mentioned, Rogue Warrior is based on the autobiographical novel written by Richard ~Dick~ Marcinko, a former SEAL commander with the air of being a real tough guy even at almost seventy years old. In the game we control him as he travels to North Korea with his two most trusted companions. It's 1986, and it looks like this little team of sappers are about to make the ~Cold War~ hotter than usual. Marcinko, brilliantly dubbed in Italian (his voice, in the English version, was even entrusted to Mickey Rourke), praises the qualities of his colleagues and swears that he would never, ever throw himself into any operation without their support. Not even five minutes later, his two comrades die in the stupidest way possible and leave Marcinko alone with his revenge. The calls from above are clearly ignored: the special agent has decided to dismantle the North Korean army on his own and to find out what ~America's enemies~ are up to this time. Each killing is accompanied by catchphrases such as ~Damned you bastards!~, ~Rossi is born, dead is made!~ or ~President Reagan sends you his greetings!~, which in the context of a technically obsolete and playfully poor FPS in content ends up eliciting a few smiles instead of some movement of patriotic involvement (moreover we are in Italy...). Several ~hybrid~ situations have been included in the gameplay, in which the view shifts to the third person, such as when our character falls from a railing or takes cover during a shootout. At that juncture, the viewfinder turns into a dot on the screen and it is possible to open fire even without aiming (with poor results), or expose yourself for a precise burst. The ambush works fairly well, even if the management of the movement in this sense is often cumbersome. The energy system is the classic one without a bar, tending towards realistic: a few hits suffered and it's game over, so it's better not to brag too much when the situation is crowded. ~President Reagan sends his regards!~ On a technical level, Rogue Warrior does not excite, on the contrary. The impression is thatthe feeling of being faced with a product from a few years ago. Now, if for titles like Left 4 Dead 2 this defect is not limiting thanks to the quantitative factor and the gimmicks of the gameplay, the same cannot be said for the title of Rebellion, which does not take off either in terms of quality, quantity or the design in general. Marcinko's polygonal model is discreetly made and boasts a large number of animations (see the ~fatalities~ above), corroborated by the presence of numerous cutscenes or third-person sequences. Everything else, however, is undoubtedly mediocre: from the enemies all the same (will you have made a reasoning like ~they are Asian anyway~?) to the paucity of weapons, passing through a dull level design, devoid of originality and bite. The game campaign runs fast without boss fights, without impact endings, without surprises or elements that in some way can arouse some amazement. The interactivity of the scenarios is below average, the quality of the textures too and there is a very marked tearing effect that we were not able to eliminate even by activating the v-sync. The downside, of course, is a frame rate of sixty frames per second with little dip at a resolution of 1680 x 1050 pixels and details maxed out.", "date": "2009-12-14", "grade": "3.8"}
