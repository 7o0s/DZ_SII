From a content point of view there is everything we played on the flagship versions and even more. In addition to the Career, the fast, quick race, timed, Grand Prix and Championship modes, there is a new, revised and corrected version of the old Controtempo, here called Challenges. This part of the game offer engages us in real mini-games, such as avoiding obstacles or passing through ~gates~ that move on the track, running to the checkpoint or real scenarios in which we have to win, or get to points certain conditions. These challenges are many, we are around fifty, and they represent something welcome and well done, even if they certainly don't represent the main dish of the game offer. All in line Going to test everything else, the idea is that the developers wanted to make the game less demanding in terms of simulation than the main versions, which weren't one hundred percent real simulators anyway. The perfect balance between the two approaches, realism and arcade, which was created thanks to the complex system of scalability of the driving model, seems to have been revised a little below. In practice, only in particularly adverse conditions and without aids does the car turn out to be a bit difficult to drive, while in all other conditions it can be maneuvered rather calmly, apart from a markedly light weight of the car itself. Not that the brake is banned, but curbs and excursions on grass are less dangerous and allow for a ~more relaxed~ ride. This is evident given the lack of the possibility of rewinding time, to correct one's mistakes on the fly. Another difference compared to what was played on consoles last fall is the removal of the complex ~television apparatus~ to support the Career. Everything has now been replaced by aseptic menus, both in the pits and in the closed park, a loss in terms of immersion in the world of the Circus. An advantage, however, in the light of the numerous problems of the technical sector of the game. But the real problem once seated in the single-seater is not so much ease of driving as artificial intelligence. We return to the old and nefarious little train, with negative results both in attack and in defense. Overtaking is therefore facilitated, everyone in a column on the ideal trajectory, and this also involves bumps and clashes with opponents (visiting the pits to change the nose will be something very frequent) given that they practically know no other way to drive. A nice step back in short. However, there is no shortage of content, F1 2011 allows us to vary the game offer thanks to an online mode for four players that helps us forget the mediocre work done on artificial intelligence. Playstation 3 trophies F1 2011 rewards the player with 31 trophies. Almost all of them are obtained with the simple progression in all game modes, as well as bringing home some particular performances such as winning in Montecarlo with the damage activated or finishing first after wasting time repairing the car in the pits. Zigzag racing Unfortunately, however, everything collides with the real boulder that weighs heavily on the Sumo Digital product for Codemasters, or rather a cosmetic that cries out for revenge. F1 2011 therefore does not replicate the ~near perfect~ porting done on Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom or Virtua Tennis 4 by sending cars afflicted by heavy aliasing and texture problems evidently in low resolution, both on the cars and on the backdrops, with a dancing frame rate . However, there are certainly positive aspects, such as the numerous refractions on the asphalt in case of rain, but more generally the aspect is truly disheartening and does not do justice to the potential of the consoles. Regarding the touch controls there is little to report. It is possible to select the camera with quick swipes in the center of the screen, and change gears or give gas using the rear touch screen. Nothing therefore that highlights what new the console offers.", "date": "2012-02-20", "grade": "5.5"}
