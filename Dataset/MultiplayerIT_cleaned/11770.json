{"name": "SimBabe 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/simbabe-2_a.html", "text": "Perhaps not everyone knows that the first SimBabe was a resounding success all over the world, and this sequel is well on its way to repeating the exploit thanks to a structure that remains anchored to the same basic idea. Our parents have decided to go on vacation alone and leave us in a summer camp, so we will face the harsh life of expeditions in the woods, uncomfortable sleeping bags and poor quality toilets. A disastrous situation, but one that could turn into something good if we can at least pick up a girl... And our goal in SimBabe 2 is just that: we'll have to get to know a charming redhead who hangs out by the campfire, and concentrate everyone our efforts to earn her friendship and then ask her out. The game interface allows us to always have an eye on the time, the count of the days we will have to spend on ~holiday~ as well as the money available and the score relating to our experience. All these data are essential for carrying out the action: in the first place we will have to submit to the rules of the field, and then wake up, present ourselves for roll call and go to sleep at predetermined times. Between one appointment and another, however, we will have a lot of things to do to conquer the beautiful Clara and prevent one of our mysterious rivals from overtaking us in the enterprise. You soon realize that simply talking to the girl doesn't produce results, and that to stand out in her eyes you need to increase your level of experience. This is achieved firstly with strength and endurance training (aka forest expeditions), and secondly with a series of challenges that you can participate in by going to the sports field. Once there, we will be able to try our hand at arm wrestling, dancing and potato peeling competitions: in the first case, you have to press the 4 or 6 keys of the numeric pad when indicated on the screen to beat your opponent; in the second case, similar to rhythm games, one finds oneself pressing the buttons when they pass within circles; finally, the competition to see who peels the most potatoes is faced by holding an indicator in the center of a bar with keys 4 and 6, while it runs left and right. In addition to leveling up the character, at some point we can also use the challenges to earn money by betting on our victory. And we'll need the money to buy gifts for Clara and items to use during a possible date... SimBabe 2 is available in three different versions, in which the level of nudity of the girl varies. In any case, the quality of the design is not such as to be competitive in its genre: the characters are drawn in a ~manga~ style but with a far from refined trait, and also the animations are almost completely missing. Let's say that from a technical point of view the game is sufficient, even for a sound that recalls the musical compositions of the 8-bit era and which ends up being deactivated after a short time. Nothing to say about the control system, extremely simple and immediate, which will never be an obstacle during the challenges. In this sense, the creation of the minigame dedicated to the dance competition is curious, in which you actually have to press the right keys at the right time, but without any correlation with the audio ... PRO A good number of things to do Some funny gimmicks It comes out of the sexy game heap AGAINST Repetitive action Technically only sufficient Very limited", "date": "2007-12-04", "grade": "S.V."}
