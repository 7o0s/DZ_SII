This threshold, to be honest, actually seems very low, so much so that exceeding the canonical 0.79 or at most 1.59 euros could give a game the incredible (in an absolute sense) label of ~salty~. We therefore find ourselves, in the role of a developer, at an annoying crossroads: to control prices, thus avoiding weighing too much at the time of purchase but renouncing or limiting ideas, features and contents, or offering a certainly more complete and well-finished title , thus sacrificing the huge share of less prodigal users. The freemium formula fortunately offers a third way: that is, the opportunity is given to download the game for free in the ~basic~ version, fully functional but with the extras reduced to the bone or perhaps with advertising banners; at a later time, after playing and perhaps becoming passionate, it is then possible to purchase optional elements or the removal of advertising, gradually investing small sums. As the success of the analogous Free to Play formula in the MMORPG field teaches us, such a marketing choice can prove to be decidedly spot on, provided however that you know how to balance both the free part and the paid offers. The project that surrounds Hero Academy is, from this point of view, very ambitious and, as we will see, decidedly interesting. Men for free, Elves for a fee The free initial package offered in Hero Academy allows you to lead only a human army: being a rather classic turn-based strategy game (but with some interesting new features), the aim of the game will be to destroy both the enemy army and the crystals of the opponent, while defending their own. The health of the crystals is essentially the life indicator of the game: once it drops to zero, the precious gem will shatter and the game will be permanently lost. All players therefore have the same army of men, which varies only in the color of the clothes and armor; but the customization of the wrestlers is the first of the extra purchases that can be made. In fact, you can choose between various types of accessories, armor, hats, different colors, etc., all for the symbolic but very real figure of 0.79 euros (each, of course). Once the customization is complete, and perhaps after having taken a look at the main game rules through Training, you immediately descend into the arena, facing online a Facebook or Twitter friend or alternatively a random opponent chosen by the system. It must be said that the matchmaking works very well: in fact, the opponent is found in a few seconds but the real problems come right during the matches. In fact, in this sort of chessboard the troops at our disposal must be arranged, selectable from what the CPU initially made available to us in the bar at the bottom of the screen. Wizards, warriors, archers and healers, in perfect fantasy style, are the elements common to all armies: to begin with, only two characters can be placed on the field but, once moved from the starting squares or dead, even any ~benches ~ have the opportunity to take over during the match. Clearly each of the protagonists has specific characteristics to be exploited in each phase of the game: for example, the warrior moves his target one square with each attack, while the archer or the magician inflicts damage even from a distance and without making the enemy move away; each turn allows the execution of 5 moves (choice between movement, attack, healing, summoning characters or spells). Particular bonuses are randomly found on the game board, indicated by symbols such as the shield, which increases the defenses of that particular unit, the sword, which increases the damage inflicted and the Assault tile, which instead reduces the life points of the opponent's crystal. The same bonuses are sometimes given and placed in the lower bar of the units, in order to activate their effects manually on the wrestler you prefer to help. Other randomly donated power-ups are the fireball, to be thrown either on enemy units or on the crystal, and the helmet, which reinforces both in terms of statistics and aesthetically the character who uses it. The big problem, perhaps the only serious one that afflicts Hero Academy, is the biblical waiting time che occurs between one turn and another of your opponent. In fact, being an online title, it is inevitable to wait a few seconds for the human alter ego to reflect before acting. In the tests carried out, however, there were also waits of over 10 minutes before seeing the execution of the moves notified. Even when the other player proves to be particularly active, however, the pace of play is extremely slow. Finally, it is a real pity that there are currently no ~punishment~ systems for unsportsmanlike users who, once the inevitable defeat has been ascertained, leave the game first, leaving it perpetually suspended.
