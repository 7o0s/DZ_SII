It goes without denying that the franchise is the proverbial cash cow for Nintendo, but we have always turned a blind eye to each new revision of the main series because, in fact, they are really good games. The process has almost always been the same: a new pair of Pokmon comes out in parallel and after some time a new neutral title belonging to the same generation also comes out, a sort of crossroads between the two titles. For example, Ruby and Sapphire had Emerald, while Diamond and Pearl had Platinum. The same thing did not happen with the Black and White versions: those who expected the predictable Gray version were stunned by the announcement of the first true sequel in the history of the brand. Finding out that Game Freaks was focusing on this Nintendo DS ~2~ rather than the eagerly awaited 3DS edition left many fans perplexed. At this point we have to ask ourselves how justified this sequel is: is it really something new, or are we facing the most striking recycling in the history of Pocket Monsters? Back to Unova The first Black and White version of Pokmon was distinguished from previous generations by the presence of a more incisive plot and less superficial characters than usual, in particular the mysterious N. At the end of that adventure, some questions remained outstanding and Game Freaks has decided to provide some more answers with this sequel, set two years after the events of the previous episode: Unima has changed a bit since then and the new protagonist, our alter ego, will come across various well-known faces who are now they play different roles. There are those who have become gym managers and those who have moved, and also for Team Plasma the situation has changed, since it has split into two factions, one of which still intends to conquer the world. The problem is that Game Freaks has unintentionally created a real mess: not only is the new story decidedly forced, but also full of inconsistencies that clash with the plot of the previous episode. The aura of mystery that surrounds Kyurem, for example, is barely incomprehensible, given that you have most likely faced him and even captured him in the previous adventure, and the quotes and skits that can be unlocked by importing the old save add nothing particular to the already very weak interweaving. If anything, it's nice to rediscover areas explored more than a year ago, now modified for the occasion, and visit some previously inaccessible areas of Unova. Even from the point of view of the PokDex, the situation is really lean: Pokmon Black and White version 2 adds only five creatures to the now very long list of pokmon, and all five are alternative forms of already existing monsters. Specifically, and this is even more mocking, let's talk about the fusing of Kyurem with Reshiram or Zekrom and the special forms that Landorus, Tornadus and Thundurus can assume... after unlocking them with the Pokmon RAdar software for Nintendo 3DS, available on the eShop . In short, in terms of new creatures to collect, which is the reason why someone should play Pokmon, we are faced with a really weak proposal, based above all on paid software designed for another console. One could argue that the ~neutral~ versions of previous generations of Pokmon offered even fewer unreleased Pokmon... but this is a sequel, isn't it? Collecting issue Not that there are few pokmon to catch, of course. Indeed, the PokDex of this edition is certainly the largest ever: we are now talking about almost six hundred and fifty pokmon and most can be caught right in Unova, regardless of the generation to which they belong. The new paths available in Pokmon Black and White version 2 allow us to catch old pokmon absent in the prequel and the large amount of challenges and areas accessible after completing the game and defeating the traditional Super Four allow us to further flesh out our personal collection. It is of course possible to transfer the pokmon captured in the Black and White versions and in all the previous ones and some pokmon that were closed to us in the prequel based on some choices are now accessible in the same or different circumstances. Just think of the three starting pokmon: you will be able to choose again between Snivy, Oshawott and Tepig, in anticipation of the moment in which you will transfer your previous starting pokmon to this cartridge. As very beautiful and exciting as everything may seem, it must be said that at this point most of the players coming from the White and N versionera will have already traded and obtained most of the pokmon in Unova, including the initials. Therefore, the sense of wonder and discovery of the prequel is missing; everything knows already seen, from the choice of pokmon to the circumstances in which we will be able to obtain them. It almost seems, and in fact from this point of view it makes much more sense, that Game Freaks has designed this sequel to allow new players to get their hands on old pokmon absent in the previous version. For veterans, however, there are not many surprises even from a gameplay point of view: Pokmon is always played in the exact same way and new skills can really be counted on the fingertips. This doesn't mean that it is still an incredibly deep and intricate RPG, despite the childish appearance and light-hearted atmosphere, and in this respect one cannot be disappointed: Pokmon Black and White Version 2 is, hands down, the most complete Pokmon experience ever. And the news? At this point one might think that Pokmon Black and White version 2 is a mere copy and paste of the prequel with some new creatures and little more, but it would be unfair to the work done by Game Freaks which, all in all, added a generous dose of new content. The first and least interesting we have already mentioned: it is the Unima Link, a menu that allows you to import the save of the prequel or Radar Pokmon. However, the Unima Link also allows you to transfer ~keys~, rewards that are received by reaching specific moments in the adventure or by completing particular challenges. The keys can be activated once the first part of the game is completed and basically they are options that modify some parameters of the game, such as the difficulty or access to some special areas. The most interesting feature of this feature is the ability to send unlocked keys to your friends, influencing their games. Similar to the keys, but not as useful, are the medals: in practice, the ~achievements~ of Pokmon Black and White version 2. As you can guess, the medals are unlocked by performing particular actions or satisfying specific requirements; they are of no use but testify to the progress and skill of the player, constituting another collector's item that will delight the most tenacious users. In addition to various tricks and slightly less visible improvements to the mechanics, such as the streamlining of the interface or some new function of the C-Gear, especially as regards the still excellent multiplayer infrastructure, there are two other extra activities that can be undertaken in any time, once unlocked: the Tournament and Pokwood. The Tournament is just what the name suggests: a competition between the best trainers from around the world, the perfect opportunity to strike at the heart of longtime fans, pitting us against Gym Leaders and other familiar faces from previous installments in a series of elimination challenges. Pokwood, on the other hand, is a mini-game like the previous Pokmon Musical, but much more inspired and captivating: our pokmon will be able to become movie stars in a series of scripts that mimic various film genres. The most interesting thing is that simple choices can be made that modify the script, allowing us to personalize the ~film~, in the hope that it will meet the tastes of the public and make us increasingly rich and famous, with a consequent rain of prizes and rewards .", "date": "2012-10-19", "grade": "8.0"}
