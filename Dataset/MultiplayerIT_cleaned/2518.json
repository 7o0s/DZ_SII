{"name": "Extermination", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/extermination_a.html", "text": "Plane crash Christmas 2005, South Pole. The special ~Red Light~ reconnaissance team must investigate a secret American government base located in the cold Antarctic. Obviously something goes wrong due to a disastrous plane crash of the team that loses men and equipment. We are among the only survivors, namely Denise Riley, sergeant of the ~Red Light~ team. In the game, in addition to investigating the base for unknown causes, we will also have to try to get out alive from the bad situation that will be created by proceeding through the various locations. We will have a nice rifle with laser pointing that will give a hard time at least to the first creatures that will welcome us. Yes, you read rightcreatures! The problem is precisely this, the levels are infested by beings of the most varied forms, the result of some cellular experiment gone bad, who will try to suck your blood and make you their daily bread You will see some good ones!!! and some bad ones... Luckily for us, the game is not populated only by bloodthirsty monsters, in fact it happens, even if rarely, to find some human being who enriches the plot with twists and turns. But I don't want to spoil everything for you..... Take aim and shoot! The control system fits perfectly and seems to be the normal evolution of the one seen in the Resident Evil saga. Yes here you can in fact perform many evolutions such as climbing, hanging on the edges of the walls, jumping from different platforms, etc. The layout of the keys is very comfortable and intuitive, and blowing up and watching our enemies perish is a great pastime. The rifle supplied features an automatic aiming laser sight (pressing the R1 button) and a subjective manual aiming (sniper mode, R2) of very high precision, very convenient for long-range targets. The commands given to our virtual ego are executed quickly and perfectly, and we find the presence of the possibility of playing with the analog lever or with the digital cross (both analog) very welcome. Our beautiful rifle can then be upgraded in the sense that by rummaging in the various rooms you will find weapons of various kinds, pointers, zooms, and things of this type ... very, very powerful that can be mounted directly on the supplied weapon which, in the game , it will turn out to be much more powerful Playability also increases thanks to the possibility of having another weapon always available in addition to the primary one (eg rifle plus flamethrower). Playstation 2? As for the graphics sector, the game stands at discrete levels, but nothing exceptional. The animations in the game are very fluid, the graphics are very clean and everything runs at 60 fps with a good resolution without showing signs of fatigue (except in some very rare cases where slight slowdowns occur). Everything seems perfect but, objectively, a graphic like that of Extermination is more suitable for a Dreamcast type consolejust take a look at Code Veronica (DC) to realize that we are dealing with a game without too many cosmetic pretensions . To make a comparison with the DC version of the Capcom game I would say that the latter is graphically superior, perhaps due to the slight absence of seabed elements in the Deep Space game. A nice game to look at then? Yes, but more is expected from the PS2 emotion engine, especially having seen its capabilities with games of the caliber of Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Solid 2 ... Too bad! A few more touches of class would certainly have helped. The thing... Another element that satisfied me in Extermination is undoubtedly the sound. Does the music in a game have to fulfill the function of creating the right atmosphere? Certain! And in the Sony-branded game we find everything that can be asked for from the sound of a game: disturbing musical accompaniment that fits the science fiction film setting (such as ~The thing~ by J. Carpenter) and good sound effects, such as the gas delivery when using the flamethrower or the last moan of the creatures you'll burn The digitized voice samples of the different characters (even if in jap) are also very spot on. In general we are dealing with a good game, especially if you love games like Dino Crisis and the aforementioned Resident Evil, a mix between a lot of action and a minimum of gray matter necessary to solve the simple puzzles you will encounter. Too bad for the longevity ... in fact I have completedor the game in just six and a half hours a little bit for a game that costs what it costs, also because you will hardly replay it. If you are inclined towards this kind of adventures, I recommend you to buy it. If not, check it outyou might like itincluding subtitles. Too bad that for the pal version we have to wait until August/Septemberyes, because the one reviewed is all in jappoincluding the subtitles. Sony says that the western version of the game will undergo changes, namely a slight change of view, there will be fewer healing potions, Denise's look will be more American (longer, lighter hair, and darker uniform). Pros: Smooth and clean graphics; good playability; will keep you glued to the joypad. Against Short; graphics engine not up to PS2 Another breath of fresh air in the PS2 playground after the multi-praised Winning Eleven 5. With this adventure with a sci-fi atmosphere, the lucky owners of the black monolith can finally enjoy a nice survival horror, developed by Deep Space, which follows in the wake of the various Resident Evil about the structure and the technical realization. We are facing the first game of this genre on PS2, and the similarities with the aforementioned masterpiece are justified by the presence, in the development team, of some ex-Capcomian programmers... and the expert hand shows! Lovers of 3D horrors, you will have bread for your teeth... Now immerse yourself in this exciting adventure.", "date": "2001-05-06", "grade": null}
