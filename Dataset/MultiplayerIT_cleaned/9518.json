{"name": "Passione shooter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83981-zeit2-passione-shooter.html", "text": "The Game is available for download on the Steam and Xbox Live serviceTested version: Xbox 360It is undeniable that thanks to modern digital delivery devices we are able to play, or even simply try out, titles that would not find their rightful place on the normal retail market and above all enough space. Zeit 2 is one of these, published by Ubisoft, it brings back one of the most classic types in the history of video games, horizontal shooters made up of devastating firefights and reflex-proof movements-ninjas like in the old and smoky bar halls, but with some graphic twists allowed by today's platforms. A primordial fresco Via Xbox Live it is possible to immerse yourself in the world of Zeit 2, the setting is decidedly particular, futuristic but at the same time very minimal, with more than a few references to the origins of life and to the ~primordial soup~ in which the first organisms began to interact with each other. We control a luminous sphere of variable size depending on the state of health, the more fit we are and with 100% of the shield, the greater our dimensions. It is necessary to defend oneself from the many enemies who after a few moments begin to attack the sphere coming from the right side of the screen. Even the adversaries themselves have abstract and stylized forms, almost as if they were graffiti on the wall or bacteria, and we must confirm that the whole scene is absolutely fascinating thanks also to the screen scenarios always in perfect dark shades to maximize the contrast between all the different elements that come alive on the screen, with clear references to 90s pop and electronic culture. The main mechanics of this shooter, unlike other exponents of the genre, is that we cannot shoot without criteria and without stopping, the bullet discharges in fact bring down the energy level of our sphere. Some enemies, every time they manage to escape us, have the ability to partially suck up our vital energy, so it will be necessary to be careful and perfectly balance the use of fire and the destruction of opponents. Xbox 360 goals The 12 objectives allow you to unlock the classic 200 points, the challenge is quite high since not only must the entire game be completed but the different modes must be tackled with good results. Time travel without a DeLorean Up to here there are no significant news, if not the setting, with the real novelty entrusted to the possibility of traveling through time, a technique that we can activate using the left analog trigger. Once this function is activated, the action is regressed by a few seconds and our alter ego from the past performs exactly all the movements that we ourselves had done. It is thus possible to join our clone in the destruction of the masses of enemies. It is therefore evident that with this function, which obviously lasts for a limited time and can be recharged (a bit like health) using special kits, we can structure strategies of mass destruction by almost completely covering the entire screen between our movement in real time and the action repeated by our clone, as well as it is possible to concentrate all our firepower against specific opponents. By tackling the various levels in a crescendo of explosions and opponents on the screen, you always arrive at the final battle with a Boss, decidedly challenging battles that must be tackled with maximum concentration and using all the weapons and strategies at our disposal. In addition to the arcade mode, which is the main one, there are other types of challenges: Time Limit, Survival, Tactics, Attack for Points and Challenge. It is possible to play against an infinite number of enemies, challenge the CPU for a certain amount of time and face the opponents in an increasing number of increasingly challenging attacks. We can then compete against our friends and leaderboards in a certain level and with the aim of achieving predetermined goals. All these options are unlocked as you progress through the arcade mode, a great system created by the developers to increase Zeit 2's longevity. The new Ubisoft title is certainly not perfect but we are sure that it can be loved / hated excessively and in no uncertain terms. The lack of a story and the high difficulty, with decidedly frustrating moments, are among the main problems, without considering that sometimes there is a real ~orgy~ of colors and bright objects on the screen, which perhaps are too many. The abstract and stylized style is fascinating and certainly successful, but Zeit 2 is not a title for lovers of subtleties, it is the game for those who love impossible challenges, pFor those who want to go to the limit and climb the rankings to be among the first places on the leaderboards.", "date": "2011-01-18", "grade": "7.0"}
