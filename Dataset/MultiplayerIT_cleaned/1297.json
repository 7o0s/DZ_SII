{"name": "CSI: Dark Motives", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/csi-dark-motives.html", "text": "Warrick's first rule: It all boils down to shoe prints The first CSI was a game with a certain number of pros and cons which in the final balance let emerge the picture of a satisfactory title, which, although aimed primarily at fans of the TV show was undoubtedly worthy of being noticed in the current, bleak landscape of graphic adventures. In fact, the term ~sequel~ is not very suitable for defining Dark Motives: it is simply another game that uses the same contents as its predecessor in terms of setting and characters, without any kind of temporal or narrative continuity. The protagonist himself is another, although he is once again a recruit of the scientific police. If one of the limitations of the first CSI was the presence of only 5 scenarios, which can be solved globally in half a dozen hours, Dark Motives unfortunately inherits its brevity and poor replayability. In fact, we are presented with 5 new cases, each capable of engaging an inexperienced player for no more than a couple of hours, thanks to the low level of difficulty. It is dismaying to note how the main obstacle to the already relatively simple puzzles consists in the difficulty in identifying the elements to be analyzed at the crime scene and in the relative locations. It often happens that you want to analyze a detail more closely without being able to do so because the relative ~link~ to the element is not yet active and will only be active after activating some particular event, for example a dialogue with a character or the finding of a particular object. All this imposes an extremely strict and sequential ~modus operandi~, sometimes frustrating because it leaves little room for the player's initiative, who finds himself giving up hypotheses and attempts to solve a systematic sifting of the game screens, looking for a ~clickable~ element. In short, the search for the culprit is subordinated to the search for evidence, but all in all this is understandable, after all it is a game set in the world and with the rules of CSI. However, to the delight of fans of the series, the usual set of detection and collection tools is not missing, from the UV lamp, to plaster casts, fingerprint detectors, etc. Some tools look so similar they're easily confused, but with a little practice it's easy to figure out which fingerprint powder to use for which type of surface. Too bad you're probably halfway through the game by then... [C] Live concussion! vegas! Searching for fingerprints on the computer [/C] From a purely technological point of view, CSI: Dark Motives stands on the same level as its predecessor, without infamy and without praise. The improved 3D models of the characters are well made and recognizable, but not as well animated and beyond a few repetitive gestures, they just stand there dazed, with just an impromptu eyebrow raise to testify that they are not inanimate wax statues . The scenarios are instead static, simple pre-rendered images, in some cases ~rotatable~ thanks to the good old Quicktime VR, a technology that is both outdated and functional. The CSI-style FMV sequences are appreciable, which do not skimp on bloody reconstructions that include broken bones, crushed organs and all kinds of gratuitous slaughterhouse finesse that are somewhat the unmistakable trademark of the television series. Final comment Like its predecessor, CSI: Dark Motives does not present particular attractions for fans of graphic adventures ~as they did once~ simply because it was not created with that target in mind but that of the television series. On the other hand, once you have taken note of its - otherwise obvious and not at all hidden - playability limitations, the game turns out to be an honest choice for the occasional adventurer, perhaps interested in an original detective story with a non-obvious outcome, while for the fan of the show represents a purchase to be seriously considered, which would make a fine show alongside the DVDs of the television saga. Final comment [C] Be wary of overly friendly suspects With a mechanic like this; who would like the car always on point? A somewhat refined place to look for a murderer... [/C] Crime Scene Investigation Of the many American telefilms that seasonally make stops on our miserable television schedules, CSI was undoubtedly one of the most original and ~addicting~ of recent years. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer - one of the best known ~King Midas~ of Hollywood and its surroundings - Crime Scene Investigation has now reached its fourth series and will probably proceedit will go on and on as long as it's rewarded with audience attention, as is the case with ER and other small-screen hits. In every world, the show still seems to enjoy excellent health if it has been decided to proceed with a new video game after last year's discreet adventure. Let's see in detail what it is.", "date": "2004-06-01", "grade": null}
