{"name": "Worms World Party", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/worms-world-party_a.html", "text": "You are a worm Let's start immediately by saying that Worms World Party, in terms of pure and simple gameplay, has remained fundamentally the same as it was ten years ago. A bizarre strategic title therefore, only apparently simplistic considering the minimalist graphic design and the insaneness of the underlying concept. In Worms, the user commands a team of four (or more, depending on the mode) worms equipped with an arsenal as rich as it is ridiculous: alongside more or less conventional weapons such as war axes, grenades and various rifles, they find space explosive sheep, improbable melee moves, air raids and more. The obvious aim of the game is to annihilate the opposing team using these tools, moving their creeping soldiers in turn. A stimulating and intelligent gameplay rests on these simple bases: by exploiting the position of allies and opponents, the characteristics of the seabed (which is destroyed under the blows of the various weapons) and the considerable extension and differentiation of the arsenal it is possible to devise a vast series tactics to inflict as much damage on the enemy as possible. All taking into account the effect of the wind on the launch of grenades, rockets and the like, and obviously the possible reactions of the opposing faction to their attacks. Here, therefore, is that Worms proves to be a far from light strategic one, and which indeed requires a considerable amount of practice before being totally assimilated. In this regard, the appropriate Training mode falls in place, able to clearly explain to the player the different characteristics of the game, the weapons and the objects available. Four is better than uan Worms World Party presents a rather full-bodied singleplayer mode, although its greater appeal lies, as we will see, in the action against other human players. Alongside the obvious Quick Game (in any case made interesting by the random generation of the backdrops), we therefore find the Mission mode, which offers the user a vast series of stages requiring the fulfillment of specific objectives: generally, these challenges are resolved by approaching and knock down the worm opponent before it does the same, but the different conditions that prelude to each level make this section extremely interesting. Then there is the remarkable Custom, in which the player can substantially modify every single game parameter in order to create his own ideal match. As per tradition, however, Worms has always given its best in multiplayer, and this World Party is no exception. The wireless potential of N-Gage is in fact exploited in an excellent way, both as regards the game via Bluetooth and for the use of the N-Gage Arena online service. In both cases - albeit with some negligible hitches - everything works well, with a maximum of four users who can be happily slaughtered, moreover with all the game modification options present in the Custom mode. The confrontation against human players obviously makes Worms World Party much more stimulating and fun, making it rise together with Snakes as one of the best multiplayer titles available on the N-Gage. The THQ title, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired from a strictly technical point of view: graphically, Worms World Party could have been just as functional while not appearing as poor as it is, while the sound sector offers rather annoying music, average sound effects and the usual shrill voices of worms, which get boring after a few plays. Comment Worms World Party is a more than good transposition of the franchise on N-Gage, which combines the classic gameplay of the series with a good variety of game modes and the ability to challenge other users via Bluetooth or via N-Gage Arena. As is to be expected, the THQ product turns out to be much more attractive from a multiplayer perspective, where it is capable of giving sessions of healthy fun, while it tends to become rather boring and repetitive if played alone. It must be said that those who were already familiar with the Worms series might not be thrilled by the idea of a game scheme that is in any case unchanged compared to ten years ago: this aspect and an audiovisual sector that is not exactly avant-garde are in conclusion the only big limits of Worms World Party. Pros Stimulating gameplay Fun and functional multiplayer High modifiability of game parameters Cons Game structure unchanged Technically rather poor Tends to get boring and repetitive in single player Existing for a decade now, the Worms franchise has marked its presence on a vast series of gaming platforms: characterized by a rare technical and structural simplicity, the Team 17 title and related sequels have sbeen able to expand to almost every format available from '95 onwards, including PCs, home consoles and handhelds. Precisely in the latter category Worms World Party fits in, which tries to exploit the potential of N-Gage to offer users a satisfactory multiplayer experience.", "date": "2005-04-28", "grade": null}
