Door Kickers, for those who don't already know the version for personal computers, is a real-time strategy game in which you will have to meticulously plan the actions to be carried out by your SWAT team through the many levels divided into single missions or campaigns: to facilitate the task and give you time to think it is also possible to pause when we want, assign commands and press the 'play' button to see the result of your orders. The top view means that you can literally create the path of your agents with your fingers and that you can assign commands one by one, in a very simple and intuitive way, through the icon menu that is activated by touching each individual agent : you can break down a door, throw a flashbang or wait hidden behind cover. The game allows you to approach the single missions in a completely personal way and you can do it aggressively or in a patient and tactical way: this choice will affect the final score of each single mission and we can assure you that getting the three stars of the maximum score is anything but a walk. The numerous failures you will have during the missions will make you change the placements of the individual agents and their armament: thus changing the tactics, the satisfaction at completing some missions that you were repeatedly failing will completely compensate for the frustration! It's not over, in fact, your team of leather heads will take experience points and it will not be possible to unlock some missions or campaigns up to a certain level of agents. Are you ready to break down the door and give the terrorists a hard time? Door Kickers for iPad is a perfect PC conversion that guarantees hours of quality gaming Avalanche missions The missions, as we said, are many and, despite the constant being the SWAT against terrorists, the situations and settings that will alternate are very varied and range from the liberation of the hostages to the elimination of the terrorist threat who hijacked an airplane or trades drugs in a villa by the sea. Tackling missions in a completely personalized way is the real strength of Door Kickers and, depending on which approach you choose, it will also change the way terrorists react who, for example, will be alerted if you start shooting wildly killing everyone who comes within range or will remain completely unaware if you are good with the silencer and enter ~Hitman~ mode. The field of vision of each single agent is very important and allows us to have visibility on everything that the units are actually able to see: you will very often get hit if you send the agents in advance with a bad face, in fact, cover makes the difference between being machine-gunned or staying safely sheltered. Another element that enriches the game experience, as already mentioned, is the possibility of increasing the experience of the agents (and consequently the team) and of customizing the skills, both through a tree of talents, called ~Squad Doctrine Tree~, freely chosen, or through the purchase of increasingly sophisticated weapons suited to the situation: the skill tree allows you to improve in the use of weapons by decreasing the reaction times of the agents or the reload times and effectiveness of rifles or pistols. You will start with easy scenarios in which you will take control of 2 agents but already when there are 4 agents to control, and you will also have the support of a sniper, things will get more complicated and you will really feel the need for that blessed pause button to plan the whole. The longevity of Door Kickers has significantly increased thanks to the campaign mode already mentioned in the introduction: here the game gets tough as the rules that determine its difficulty are rather restrictive, in fact, you will have only 10 available for all missions agents who, once dead, will no longer be available and will be replaced at the end of the campaign; Wounded officers will heal themselves by 'Benching one turn' and, if you activate the Iron Mode button, the campaign will increase in difficulty again not letting you retry or restart a mission... however, all experience points will be doubled! There are 6 campaigns available and one of them, iTerror Strike, has been specially placed on the iPad version to celebrateare launching on this platform.", "date": "2015-07-10", "grade": "9.0"}
