{"name": "L'ultimo Wipeout per PS2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/69097-wipeout-pulse-lultimo-wipeout-per-ps2.html", "text": "By now at dusk, PlayStation 2 continues to offer excellent products to those who have not yet abandoned their joypad. Developers' attention is certainly concentrated elsewhere, so it's not uncommon for porting to dominate lately, especially of games initially developed for the PSP. The WipeOut series thus finds its worthy conclusion on PlayStation 2, recurring in the Pulse edition released for PSP about two years ago: lovers of the series who don't own PlayStation 3 or the Sony portable console will be delighted with this addition. Faster than light... almost With WipeOut it's always the same story: either you love it or you hate it. Fans of the series will find themselves at ease, while the new recruits will remain bewildered as always in front of the main features of the game, so fascinating: a clear and visionary style, futuristic settings, destructive weapons at will and above all a speed of the races that is still unattainable . The main stumbling block is just that, the unthinkable speed that the cars reach: we are talking about five hundred kilometers per hour, vehicles that shoot like lightning in twisted, complex and excellently designed tracks. The first games are always a trauma for those piloting their first spacecraft in WipeOut: crashes left and right, wrong turns, counterproductive braking... And yet, already after a couple of games you begin to memorize the tracks, the most tricks, the most useful power-ups and the best times to use them. WipeOut is a game that must be assimilated before it can be fully appreciated, beyond its excellent and captivating graphical presentation. WipeOut Pulse on PlayStation 2 is more or less everything that Pulse was on PSP: therefore the ~grids~ advancement system returns in single-player modes, which allows you to participate in new races with the most varied objectives by winning a sort of chain of matches to accumulate the points needed to unlock more tracks, vehicles and decorations. Excellent idea that makes a welcome return on PlayStation 2, increasing player involvement, requiring a more ~tactical~ and less linear decision of the races to be undertaken. From PSP to PS2 On PlayStation 2, the Pulse edition of WipeOut proves to be an excellent port: the unique and captivating graphic style is reproduced on our screens with brighter colors and greater fluidity, while not reaching the 60 fps threshold WipeOut Pulse lacks the slightest slowdown and it turns out to be a flawless gaming experience. However, the graphic detail has not increased and for better or worse we find the same code in our hands, also as regards the sound sector: the musical tracks already listened to on the PSP and created, among others, by Kraftwerk or Aphex Twin are back, and it is still possible to load a personalized soundtrack to play the background of the games. Absent Internet connectivity: in this version for PlayStation 2 it is not possible to connect to the big network to challenge other players online and take advantage of the various compatible features offered on PSP. To remedy this gap, Sony has well thought of including the optional downloadable content developed for PSP in the port: WipeOut Pulse for PlayStation 2 therefore presents a greater number of vehicles and tracks, available from the start or unlockable by progressing in the campaign for a single player .", "date": "2009-07-15", "grade": "8.0"}
