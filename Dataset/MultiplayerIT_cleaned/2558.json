Now far from the technological peaks in which they were placed at the time of Sega and the glorious Virtua Tennis cabinets, or from the ~essential~ console productions such as the old Family Tennis, titles of this type have become increasingly smaller and niche but not have lost their charm, kept alive by the scarcity of offers on the standard market. Obviously, being a mechanic strongly based on PvP, it can easily lend itself to free-to-play style proposals with micro-transactions and this is precisely the case that we are taking into consideration, but with frankly surprising results, considering the very little comforting premises. Mini Tennis: Perfect Smash recovers the most classic interpretation of arcade tennis, filtered through a caricatured representation of the tennis players which further distances it from the realistic simulation but without reaching excessive extremes. The gameplay indeed finds a good balance between probable movements and physics of the ball and clearly arcade dynamics, all based on immediate fun and intuitive control. All the typical superstructure of multiplayer with micro-transactions is then applied to this solid base, which represents the most critical element of the whole package, given that it lends itself to the usual pay-to-win drifts that are well present once you reach a certain point, but it is possible that the lightness and immediacy of the game can overcome this problem, at least for a while. Tennis at your fingertips In Mini Tennis: Perfect Smash the touch screen control system is not bad With the field framed in a ~bird's eye view~, we control our tennis player located in the lower part of the screen, in order to take advantage of a wider view and a more intuitive interpretation of the movements. The controls are based on the typical virtual stick and touch screen keys, but contrary to what one might think, they work quite well, also because the system seems to allow for a certain margin of error in positioning, carrying out an imperceptible but still capable active assistance make the movement and flow of the game more harmonious. As per tradition, it is about positioning yourself in the best possible way and hitting the ball through the classic tennis shots (top spin, drop shot, lob and smash), trying to put the opponent out of action through the right direction, power and timing with which to respond at launches. The matches are rather short, being set on a single 6-point set, which also leads to numerous matches in sequence and lends itself very well to mobile use. The progression system is structured in the typical way of this type of product: for each victory we get experience points to rise in rank and above all ~sachets~ to open in the form of the typical prize boxes, within which we can find virtual money, equipment and new players, placed here in reverse order of rarity. The various upgrades that can be purchased and used in Mini Tennis: Perfect Smash It is obvious that this mechanism can lead to pay-to-win, even if the system still proceeds with matchmaking based on the level and also taking advantage of bots and asymmetrical multiplayer. The main problem is given above all by the consumables (accessories to be applied to rackets and sports suits) which can guarantee temporary bonuses and obviously tend to slightly distort the performances, but the matches still manage to often be balanced since these boosts are marginal and probably included in the matchmaking algorithm.", "date": "2023-04-09", "grade": "7.0"}
