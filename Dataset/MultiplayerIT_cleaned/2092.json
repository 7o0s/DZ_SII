{"name": "Die Hard: Nakatomi Plaza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/die-hard-nakatomi-plaza-4.html", "text": "When the game is hard The flagship of Nakatomi Plaza is certainly the narrative plot: Die Hard remains a classic of action movies and Fox have done a good job to make the game faithful to the celluloid counterpart, as far as possible. A reproduction that starts from the interiors of the maps, passing through music and dialogues up to the characterization of the characters, enhanced by the same lines of the film and by a well-made speech. Thank goodness the dubbing is the original English one, we dare not imagine the havoc that would have been perpetrated in place of a complete localization, at least judging by the ridiculous translation of the paper manual (it takes a lion's courage to translate ~Submachine Gun~ into ~Pistola Underwater let's spread a veil). The final touch would have been the faces of the original actors, but it is unthinkable that the image rights of an entire cast of famous performers could be bought: Bruce Willis's bald head alone would probably have cost more than the game's entire budget. Thoroughbred engine, but not in good shape From Shogo to Alien vs Predator, Monolith's Lithtech has always given us great satisfaction, being a solid engine, relatively light and constantly updated by the development team who have made it a valid alternative to the more famous (and expensive) Epic engines and ID Software. In the case of the new Die Hard however, it certainly cannot be said that this engine does its job well: the amount of polygons is barely decent, dull and messy use of light sources and flat textures even at 32 bit color depth , which complement monotonous and uninteresting locations with an interactivity rate at historic lows. The 3D models are passable, but the animations are terrible, too woody and artificial, with terrorists afflicted by the ~lead feet~ syndrome and completely indifferent to tons of bullets until the moment of collapsing lifeless to the ground without a hair out of place (well, the blood is not missing, at least that). If we add to this a large quantity of graphic imperfections, dancing polygons and various interpenetrations of moving subjects, we can conclude that we cannot be satisfied with the aesthetic aspect of the game. FPS what a passion! It is a pleasure to see how the spirit of the film has been captured at least in part: the character of John McLane is not a simple butcher, a pale emulator of Schwarzenegger, but a hunted, wounded and almost unarmed man who, hidden in the infinite mazes of a Huge prison of glass and steel, he faces a seemingly unassailable threat. A threat he faces with the quick witticisms and dark humor that only this Yankee cop possesses. At least in the intentions of the programmers, pounce on the enemies, chest out and machine gun in hand like the Terminator should have been a decidedly incorrect and disadvantageous approach, especially at the beginning, when the sudden numerical superiority of the enemies is added to our ridiculous offensive potential. For this purpose, tactical elements have been implemented, such as an indicator of physical resistance that will decrease more and more if we exaggerate in jumping and running and a further index that shows the state of your morale. FPS what a passion! Too much lead in the abdomen certainly does not help the mood and finding yourself with morale on the ground should in theory put you at a disadvantage, while facing a fight with a certain boldness should significantly influence the reactions of the opposing AI. In truth, we have not had the pleasure of touching the goodness of this last alleged virtuosity of gameplay, given that we have not perceived substantial differences, nor have we run into difficulties of any kind by perpetrating the massacre of all the terrorists scattered throughout the building. The fact that the protagonist's equipment is reduced to 5 of the most obvious weapons and to some substantially useless additional accessories does not even make the carnage of the very clumsy opponents particularly enjoyable. You will say that the minimal fleet of weapons is due to the need to be faithful to the film and that it would not have been the case to find a BFG 9000 inside the Nakatomi Plaza. Maybe, but I didn't remember the sniper rifle in the film... Hard to die Fox Interactive has proven to be a producer not exclusively interested in the mere exploitation of the licenses of its successful films, but this DH: Nakatomi Plaza does not even remotely approach the level of Alien Versus Predator and all the inexperience of a team emerges in it of development at firstweapons like the Piranha Games. Technically not amazing, it does not offer substantial innovations in a repetitive gameplay in the long run, which only enjoys the image of a captivating and universally known character. If you are a fan of the original film, the charisma of a loose-tongued protagonist able to find the ironic side of a shooting during the shooting itself could be enough in itself to give you a few hours of healthy entertainment. But don't delude yourself that this is enough to guarantee you more than a week of play, given the further lack of any multiplayer support... and to think that the Nakatomi Plaza setting would have been the ideal scenario for a ~males against terrorists~ clash! Sometimes (the Tough ones) come back The Die Hard movie brand has the pride of having spawned one of the most prolific (and dramatically shoddy) video game tie-in strands of the last decade. Landed for the first time in arcades and subsequently on home systems with a 3D scrolling fighting game like Fighting Force, to then continue to the bitter end with lasergames, driving arcades and the like (remember Die Hard Trilogy?) the digital adventures of John MacLane they multiplied successfully, although they had little or nothing to do with the plot of the respective films. I must admit that I have not approached this ~Nakatomi Plaza~ without some prejudice on its actual quality ... fortunately for my conscience the game itself has not turned out to be much more than a trivial FPS, with some hints of unexpressed playability. So let's see what this title has to offer us, which promises to make us relive the emotions of the first legendary Die Hard, (in Italy Crystal Trap) the film that transformed the good Bruce Willis into a star.", "date": "2002-06-14", "grade": null}
