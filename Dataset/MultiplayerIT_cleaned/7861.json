With the ability to control Kirk and Spock in co-op? Let's face it, how many fans of the sci-fi series par excellence have been waiting for this moment for years? The film reboot directed by J.J. Abrams was also welcomed by franchise purists, who obviously had nothing against a video game tie-in that finally gave the work of the late Gene Roddenberry a prominent position in the genre of action games. The fact that the final result of the operation was not so positive, in fact, is another matter; but we'll get to that shortly. The plot of Star Trek: The Video Game takes place after the events of the 2009 film and basically serves as a ~forerunner~ for what will be the second chapter of the new vision, due out this year. The Enterprise finds itself rescuing the members of a space station in trouble and discovers that a device of extraordinary power was kept in their structure, the Helios Device, capable of bringing death and destruction to the galaxy if it falls into their hands wrong. And it seems that the scaly fingers of the Gorn reptilians correspond perfectly to this description: this hostile alien race manages to take possession of the device and it is obviously Kirk and Spock, together with the charming Vulcan commander T'Mar, who have to commit themselves personally to remedy the crime, during a space chase that will lead them, among other things, to visit the evocative landscapes of New Vulcan. Long life and prosperity Let's start with the positives: Star Trek: The Video Game can count on a convincing plot and, above all, on dialogues perfectly in line with the nature of the characters, whose value is obviously amplified by the excellent interpretation provided by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. We therefore have a reckless Kirk, who tries to be ~macho~ to impress the beautiful T'Mar and has to deal with the diplomacy and rigidity of Spock, who is his perfect partner. In the game we can choose to play one or the other, facing the adventure in single player mode (with our partner controlled by artificial intelligence) or in co-op, in a very similar way to the latest episodes of Resident Evil . The early stages of the campaign alternate action and exploration quite skilfully, for example when the dynamic duo has to reach an area of the station by walking outside and taking cover every two or three seconds to avoid the powerful solar emissions. The portable device that allows us to control doors, robots and turrets is also introduced in an intelligent way, possibly by carrying out a hack through a simple minigame of matches to be completed by acting on the two analog sticks of the Xbox 360 controller (perfectly supported and definitely recommended, being of a third person shooter). Further on, we found interesting the phases in which Kirk and Spock have to overcome the barrage of an electronic guard, moving when its sensors are turned away and identifying its generator in order to be able to ~reset~ it. Then there are some Uncharted-style platforming moments, with the characters having to climb up raised structures and jump from one to another to reach an otherwise inaccessible area; or sections in which an energy generator must be found to be inserted into the circuit to operate the doors, which is reminiscent of Dead Space. And then, oh well, the crash Ultimately Star Trek: The Video Game focuses on action, and it is therefore rather disappointing to discover that this part of the experience has not been cared for enough by the developers. We can't talk about bad firefights, mind you, but it's clear from the first fights that there's something wrong, especially in terms of the artificial intelligence of the enemies. The latter remain completely still behind their positions, even when we destroy the protective screen (in some cases it is possible, for example when it comes to glass), waiting to be hit. Or they go crazy, bringing to light design problems that are far from negligible when it comes to close comparisons, with the view that fails to handle the situation in a dignified way and literally gets confused, forcing us to race to restore a minimum distance. Added to this is a lack of enhancement of the arsenal which leads us to collect what we like from the killed opponents and to carry on, without thinking about which weapon does what but simply making do by trying to advance towards the next checkpoint. Bain this sense there was a minimum of attention and a more ~calm~ direction to give greater importance to a sector that is absolutely fundamental in a shooter. What about the only sketchy intention to insert stealth phases while exploring scenarios besieged by enemies? Here too things work rather badly, with the opponents who immediately approach (again confusing the combat system) but who in theory we should put offside in a non-lethal way, with a stun ray and a punch, since they are ~infected~ Vulcans ~. Finally there are the variations on the theme, alternative game sequences such as when we find ourselves at the controls of the Enterprise and we have to open fire on the Gorg ships. Well, these moments underline more than anything else the lack of clear ideas, because they are absolutely bad and end up destroying the already few strengths of the experience. Captain's Pastry So let's face the technical sector, which unfortunately sees a PC version made without too much effort, without optimizations, with low-definition textures and very few adjustable options. The downside is represented by the fact that it is possible to obtain an excellent frame rate even on medium configurations, however we would certainly have preferred heavier graphics but with a level of detail up to expectations. The polygonal models of the characters are well done and faithfully reproduce the appearance of the actors in the film, but leave something to be desired in terms of facial expressions (practically absent) and certain animations, such as the horrible run. The design of the Gorn is effective but for them too there has been little attention to detail, while the scenarios generally feel like they have already been seen, especially when moving inside space stations. It was impossible to expect from a production of this kind splits capable of rivaling those of Dead Space or Mass Effect, for that matter. The situation of the sound sector is decidedly better, which as already mentioned boasts a good interpretation of the original actors, beautiful music and effects of discreet workmanship.", "date": "2013-05-02", "grade": "5.5"}
