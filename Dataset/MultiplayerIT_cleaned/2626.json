{"name": "Final Fantasy IX", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-ix_b.html", "text": "Final Fantasy IX Like all episodes of the series, this Final Fantasy IX is not the continuation of its predecessor. This is a completely separate episode and, for the first time on PSX, a fantasy setting. The seventh and eighth took place in a hypothetical future on an alternate Earth, This one, however, enjoys a number of peculiarities typical of classic fantasy RPGs with more modern features. The story is that of a band, the Tantalus, hired to kidnap Garnet, princess of the kingdom of Alexandria. The group of bandits stage a theatrical show to achieve their goal. The member of the gang in charge of the kidnapping is Zidane, the one who will then be the protagonist of the whole story. Equipped with a tail and a remarkable charm towards women, he will discover that the princess is willing to be captured. During the show, our Zidane meets Steiner, a knight of the court of Alexandria with many muscles but little brain, and Vivi, an incredibly shy little wizard but with great magical skills. The four (Zidane, the princess, Steiner and Vivi) find themselves on the flying ship of the Tantalus fleeing towards the borders of Alexandria and from here begins what will prove to be one of the most compelling plots ever written for a video game. The game! After an introduction that has incredible (as can be expected from the designers of Square), you will find yourself in front of a game that, if it weren't for the characters, you might think you've already seen. Final Fantasy IX does not differ much, in terms of setting the game, from its predecessors. Think that even the names of the spells are the same. The game is basically divided into three phases: ~truce~ phase, exploration phase, combat phase. The ~truce~ phase consists of moments in the game in which you will wander through the menus and cities in search of weapons, items to buy, spells to exchange, and so on and so forth. The game menu is the same as that of FFVII and FFVIII, i.e. it consists of seven submenus: Items, Skills, Equip, Status, Scheme, Cards, Configure. Most of them keep exactly the same features they had in the other FFs. The only changes have been made in Skills, where you will select the ones you prefer through a system of crystals, and Cards, a new menu where you will collect all the strange playing cards that you will recover during your journey. In the exploration phase you will find yourself in the three-dimensional map of the game and you can wander happily through the verdant lands of the world of Final Fantasy IX. You will have two cameras and you will be able to consult the map at any time. Last but not least, the combat phase. It is presented as it is in all the episodes of the series, but this can only be a good thing. Yes, because one of the strong points of this legendary saga has always been the management of fights, probably the most intuitive and at the same time the most effective ever seen in an RPG. Accessing the menus (which will vary slightly from one character to another) will be as easy as swallowing and after a while you will be able to launch attacks of apocalyptic power without the slightest effort. Another important aspect is the strategic phase of the fights: in spite of VII and VIII, in FFIX you will have to manage four characters. Therefore the experience points will be divided by four but in your party there will be room for all the specialties. Playstation? So it is written on the back of the package. But personally I'm a bit dubious. How is it possible that such a great game from a technical point of view lands on a 32-bit console? Someone pinch me! We are dealing with something never seen before on PSX and which can easily rival 128-bit console games. It sounds like a bold statement, but I can assure you it is. The graphics are ultra-detailed, especially in the combat phase and nothing seems to have been left to chance: despite the limited capabilities of the Sony console, the fusion between pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D characters has succeeded very well, giving an idea of perfection in every aspect. The FMV movies will give a hard time to the best productions of the Light & Magic industry and you will be amazed to witness these programming masterpieces. And then the music the composers at Square have once again created the best soundtrack ever heard in a video game. The songs will never be inappropriate and will give you emotions that you would never have thought ofor to be able to try Conclusions. Yet another Square masterpiece that will prove to be a blockbuster and critic. What to say more? Congratulations for the ninth time, Square. pros: Excellent gameplay. Excellent plot. Technique above all schemes. cons: It's addictive Let's do some history.. Final Fantasy! a mythical saga born on the ancient NES, then landed on Super Nintendo and finally on Psx.
