{"name": "Whiplash", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/whiplash.html", "text": "Whiplash is a platformer not without some pretensions of depth, only apparently given by the management of two characters at the same time. After a few steps, in fact, it becomes evident that the nice rabbit is nothing more than the weapon with which the weasel gets rid of its enemies and a multifunctional object that allows it to interact with some elements of the seabed to open doors, to operate switches and to use the various power ups that allow him, for example to fly. The weasel inserts the rabbit into the helium dispenser and the rodent inflates like a balloon making the strange couple soar in flight. The relationship between the two creatures is governed by the clichs of a sui generis comedy, with the weasel as the perfidious ruler and the rabbit suffering its abuses, underlining them with gags and jokes. The problem is that the nice expressions with which the rabbit expresses himself, every time he suffers, become quite annoying, given their incessant and noisy repetition. The distinctive features of Whiplash, compared to a simple platform, also reside in the possibility of making the protagonists evolve. Every time a guardian or a scientist is stunned, their body remains dozing on the ground and our heroes can be further furious by making them release Hypersnacks which are used to level up, or to make the two animals acquire hit points and greater destructive power. At the end of each section, then, it is possible to choose between acquiring a new special shot, obtaining bonus Hypersnack or the possibility of obtaining in advance the maps of other parts of the establishment in which the two creatures are locked up. Yes, because the game takes place entirely in this huge industrial complex and the different stages intertwine between the various areas, connected by long corridors through which you can move at will. However, the three-dimensional map, which should help us move around, is difficult to read and in the rare moments in which the game does not clearly explain where to continue, one feels lost and examining the map is quickly abandoned in favor of a frenetic and a little worried about the passage through which to access the next area. The beginning of the game is rather promising and it is impossible not to smile in front of the skits, well dubbed into Italian, which present us with the unlikely genetic experiments of Genron, but these gradually give way to a serious plot that gets lost in the repetitiveness of the actions that one is called to perform and the anonymous succession of button rooms and endless tangles of pipes. Scientists, guardians, a couple of animals and little else Whiplash's major defect, in terms of cosmetics, does not derive from its technical profile, but from its purely artistic one. The graphics of the Crystal Dynamics title are in fact fluid at 60 frames per second, almost never stuttering, the environments are also vast and fairly detailed, but tend to look too similar. The variety should have flowed from the design of the opponents and animals to save or interact with, but this never happens. In fact, most of the time is spent facing scientists, fleshy guards, some robots and mechanized weasels. Even the animals to be saved are, essentially, hamsters and monkeys, with a few exceptions and, if these were at least well modeled or full of details, one could pass over them, but this is not the case and the flatness of the situations that arise in the arc of the game ends up having repercussions on the rest of the system which could have given much more satisfaction. Also on the audio side, as already mentioned, tiredness comes all too soon, despite the excellent dubbing in Italian, and the sympathy aroused by the rabbit's sentences soon turns into a subtle hatred. The animated skits that accompany the early stages of the game are becoming more and more sparse like the smiles they are able to arouse and, when the game becomes completely serious, it remains only a decent platformer with just enough design. Comment Crystal Dynamics are a team with a lot of experience behind them and it is only this that saves Whiplash from failure. The job alone fails, however, to subtract this platformer from an anonymity that falls silently on the adventures of the weasel and the rabbit too quickly, limiting surprises and real fun to the first sequences of the game. A greater variety of settings and design could have given life to a more than discreet titleor, but which as it is stops in the great sea of games halfway. Pros: Fun and hilarious in the early stages of the game Tested gameplay Cons: No flicker, no surprises Modeling of the characters Genron is a multinational that does all sorts of things to the detriment of poor animals that it keeps as guinea pigs in the recesses of its factories: hamsters used as projectiles for improbable target shooting machines, monkeys perpetually running on treadmills and combed like punks for strange searches and who creates funny pets by genetically fusing pairs of different breeds. The latest creation is the union between a weasel and a rabbit, only that not everything goes as it should and two animals manage to escape, guided by a mysterious voice that comes out of the Genron computers and openly challenges the evil owner and the dozens of scientists and guards who animate the industrial complex. From there on, the two animals run frantically to the heart of the industrial complex in search of a way to stop its horrors with an alternation of less and less funny gags and a long series of platform sequences that certainly don't shine for their inventiveness or capacity for involvement.", "date": "2004-03-29", "grade": null}
