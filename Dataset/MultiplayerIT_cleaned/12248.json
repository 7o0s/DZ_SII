No, not only because it gives the title to the game, but because as such it is suffered due to the ability of the Sega product to keep even the most savvy player busy. Our hero is struck by a curse that turns him into a dragon. Five lizards to be defeated in as many castles in order to return (gradually and through successive transformations) to human form. The structure of Dragon's Curse for Turbograph (enhanced and corrected version of Dragon's Trap for Sega Master System) follows the concept of the game that started, some time before, the WonderBoy series in the Action Rpg vein: Monster Land, for Master System and Turbograph (in addition to the coin op version). The playful basis is that of a platform, our alter ego overcomes the various schemes that appear in front of him by jumping from one platform to another, in order to achieve particular objectives. On our way we also meet villages, where we carry out other actions useful for our mission: buy weapons, life potions, power ups, etc. Dragon's Curse appears extremely complicated from the very first games, overcoming only the early platform stages is a sign of great skills, timing and reflexes above all. But it's also exceptionally straightforward in the control system, with no smudging or any glitches whatsoever. What is it today. Apart from a technical sector that clearly shows the weight of the years, the playability of Dragon's Curse is novel, and is still immediate today: structurally the game is a small design masterpiece and the variety of levels stimulates us to continue, but we feel obliged to warn you that if you don't have your nerves, this product will make you lose your patience on more than one occasion. Longevity is quite satisfactory (if you think that by downloading the game for a few minutes you can spend hours in front of it) unless you are pad-possessed, insensitive to the obstacles that each level will put in front of you. Currently, the titles of the Wonder Boy series with this setting still represent rather original cases, partially taken from other titles of completely different sagas (Zelda Adventure of Link for NES, released between the two Sega games, vaguely recalls them in the phases with side view), but never surpassed in their uniqueness. You will still be able to take advantage of a version which, while not carrying the Wonder Boy brand as on the 8bit Sega console, is practically identical, except for much more defined graphics. WonderBoy, one of the symbols of the 80s Sega, was born as a simple platform before the saga evolved unexpectedly, turning into a real action rpg expertly mixed with the natural lateral view.", "date": "2007-05-28", "grade": null}
