Yes, because this game  la Fight Club not only has a dark and mature graphic design, which differs from the colors, caricatures and puppets of the casual titles that accompany it, but also comes with the promise of a much more realistic experience , precise and satisfying of that Boxing for families that had awkwardly accompanied the debut of Nintendo Wii. Apparently the developers' goal was precisely to give the player more freedom of choice and action, allowing him any type of movement, at the cost of making his life more difficult. After all, punches in the face and hooks in the stomach aren't exactly for a sissy audience. Fistfights in a filthy prison, a spot-on graphic style and a control system, at least in theory, engaging should ensure at least a decent fighting game. But things didn't go as planned... Born in a straitjacket The Fight puts the player to grips with a series of bare-knuckle fights, first against a handful of poor prisoners, and then gradually climb into a pyramid of increasingly fierce contenders. For the occasion, the developers have bothered the Mexican actor Danny Trejo, no stranger to the prison fighting environment, and who has the uncomfortable task of teaching you the foundations of the fight. Throughout the entire tutorial, in fact, some videos alternate in which Trejo, with street language and an angry tone, once insults you and the other as well, while trying in every way to explain how to use the controller. Too bad that, in desperately trying to look like a tough guy, the protagonist of Machete does nothing but appear like a poor clown: seeing him wriggle and punch, while in his hands he holds two Moves illuminated in the dark, only makes any attempt futile to take it seriously. In this way The Fight manages to achieve the opposite effect, and instead of looking like a serious and hard fighting game, it falls sensationally into parody. The botched presentation is unfortunately not the only flaw of a game which, on the contrary, shows all the weak points only once the controller is held. Before each match the player undergoes a long and uncomfortable session to recalibrate the Move: point at the screen, spread your arms, move away from the PlayStation Eye, put the controllers under your chin and remain still; at this point, why not also do a somersault in place? The whole procedure is aimed at obtaining maximum precision, which also works well for the first moments of the game. It's truly amazing how naturally you can mimic the gesture of the umbrella and see your character do the same, but a slightly more abrupt movement or a slight side shift is enough and you have to calibrate the Move again. Fortunately, it is enough to bring both controllers to the chin in guard position and press a button, but having to do it continuously during a fist fight quickly becomes unbearable. Playstation 3 trophies In The Fight: Without Rules the player can conquer 28 different Trophies. Most are pretty mundane, asking to KO'd. a certain number of opponents or to win Career mode, but there are also a couple of decidedly more ingenious challenges. It's almost better than a real fight As if that weren't enough, even in the best of conditions, the actual combat is hell: it doesn't matter how fast your shots are, because the protagonist will always move slower and more awkwardly. Theoretically, this should stimulate the player to earn more and more points and then spend them to upgrade his character, but when you sweat hard to be able to even punch the weakest and pot-bellied opponent, then you understand that something in the development is gone pretty wrong. Many other choices in the control system are decidedly questionable, starting from the way in which one moves in the scenario up to the PlayStation Eye face tracking: in the latter case, in fact, the camera tries to follow the player's head, which he can dodge opponents' blows by moving or crouching. Sadly, the peripheral doesn't take long to ~lose sight of~ you, convincing you that the best choice is to disable this option and rely on the use of a key. Those who don't have two Moves can always combine Move and DualShock, although this combination manages to be even less previsa and reliable. The characterization of the characters and the poverty of the game environment are also bad, so that, despite a decent editor for one's avatar, the impression is always that of getting into a fight with a handful of insipid dummies.", "date": "2010-11-16", "grade": "4.7"}
