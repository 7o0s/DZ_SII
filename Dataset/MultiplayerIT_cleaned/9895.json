The opportunity to realize this wish comes at the hands of the evil Rumplestiltskin, who tricks the ogre into waking up in an alternate reality where everyone seems to have forgotten about him, including Fiona. Shrek immediately realizes what he has foolishly lost and tries to put things right, but to do so he will have to convince his old friends and deal with the troops of Rumplestiltskin, who in this new reality sits on the throne of Far Far Away. With the release of the new DreamWorks animated film in theaters, the video game also arrives promptly in the version for iPhone and iPod Touch, which can be purchased on the App Store for 3.99 euros. It is an action game with a third-person view in which we take on the role of Shrek (but also Donkey and Puss in Boots) through eleven stages that take up the plot of the feature film in computer graphics, and repeatedly mention titles such as Crash Bandicoot. Orc or peramele? Just like in Crash Bandicoot, in fact, our character finds himself destroying crates and barrels to collect coins, an operation he can perform via a rotating attack or by jumping over the objects in question. At the same time there is no shortage of enemies, who must be attacked at the right time (see the woodcutters, armed with a heavy piece of wood) and allow us to perform combos worthy of a fighting game, with Shrek sinking several punches before releasing a final uppercut . The scrolling of the stages is multiple, we are therefore provided with a good freedom of movement and there is no shortage of hidden objects, to be recovered by exploring the scenario with a little attention. Furthermore, the variety of locations is good, with very different settings (even if the swamp scenario tends to prevail over the others) and generally well done. The developers have included a large number of variations on the theme that also involve the accelerometer of the Apple device, for example in some cases you have to tilt the iPhone to allow Shrek to walk on a beam or slide along a stream. The game structure, therefore, on paper is certainly valid. The problems arise from the realization of the various ideas: the management of the view is rather problematic and creates great difficulties, but above all the virtual d-pad proves to be tremendously inaccurate, giving rise to a series of accidental deaths when it is necessary to jump and below is the classic abyss (which happens very often). It's a shame, given that on a technical level the Gameloft product defends itself very well: the graphics are colorful and lively, with good animations and an excellent level of detail. The scenarios are well populated, the visual rendering of the shadows is decent and the simplicity of the polygonal models is hidden quite well (apart from during the cutscenes). Furthermore, the sound sector boasts numerous sentences sampled in English (subtitled in Italian), a pity only for a very repetitive musical accompaniment (but it can be replaced with a personalized playlist).
