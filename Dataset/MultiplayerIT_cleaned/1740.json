{"name": "Splinter Cell", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/splinter-cell-3.html", "text": "When the wait ends... Georgia, year 2004: the peaceful coup that brought the billionaire Kombayn Nokoladze to the command of one of the richest and most technologically developed ex-Soviet republics, can only worry the senior leaders of the NSA, especially after the disappearance in T'Blisi of two American agents infiltrated into local crime. We are sent on their trail, in the role of veteran Sam Fisher, top agent of the NSA and in particular of the brand new experimental section Third Echelon, with the specific aim of collecting information on behalf of Uncle Sam, in search of the skeletons in the closets of Nikoladze and of his accomplices directly in the field, where modern computer techniques cannot reach them. My name is Fisher. Sam Fisher. If we want to consider tactical action as the only consistent innovation we have witnessed in recent years in the world of video games, then Splinter Cell can only be seen as one of the highest peaks reached by the genre, which counting titles such as Thief, Deus Ex and Metal Gear Solid, represented and represents one of the best arguments in favor of singleplayer gaming on PC. The Sprinter Cell experience is firmly based on two sturdy pillars: the first is adult and convincing gameplay, which draws heavily on the best that the genre has offered us in recent years and at the same time reworks and inserts new elements that you define as inspired it is little; the second is, so to speak, the ~package~ in which it is presented to us and that is not only the graphics, but the entire scenic setting, the level design, the direction of the animated interludes and scripted sequences: everything is aimed at making it spectacular, to make the game as much like a movie as possible. If Max Payne came to your mind, you've nailed it. But if the latter was the gaming equivalent of John Woo's action films (guns, pigeons and that ~Matrix~ touch that cannot be missing), the atmosphere in Splinter Cell is that of the characters and of the situations that have decreed the success of Tom Clancy's books and (coincidentally) of the films that inspired them. The game action is therefore always perfectly realistic and even the most heroic gesture made by our character is not only perfectly plausible, but it is even more exciting as our perception of danger is enormously accentuated compared to what years of shooter have accustomed us based on the now abused concept of ~carnage~. My name is Fisher. Sam Fisher. Furthermore, if Max Payne seemed short to you (as it probably is since it is), I guarantee you that Splinter Cell will last you more than enough, not only for the considerable number of missions included, but also and above all for their difficulty and the intrinsic need to play it in small doses. And then trying to finish it in one go is the best way to deprive yourself of the pleasure of discovering the background of the story piece by piece, combining the fragmentary information obtained from superiors with what we will collect on our own by interrogating enemies and stealing their electronic correspondence. Alone - but never completely, with the best of Yankee spies always in contact with us - on the battlefield, we are equipped with the latest military technology (from fiber optic cameras to directional microphones) and the most lethal and advanced weapons, yet it is never the case to be too sure of ourselves. At every instant we walk a razor's edge, a slight mistake and the enemy will become aware of our presence, we are deprived of any medical and logistical support and have barely enough ammunition to resolve the unexpected, let alone engage in a solitary war. The only truly effective weapon in our hands is therefore discretion, the extraordinary ability to go unnoticed obtained thanks to a training that has transformed us into real nocturnal ghosts, capable of hiding a few steps away from a sentinel without it having the slightest hint of our hidden presence. Leave no traces or witnesses, this is our way of acting. Move and act as if we didn't exist. Like two drops of water? How to start a fruitful examination of the quality of a conversion? Perhaps starting from the points in common, since later we will have enough time to devote ourselves to the differences, both positive and negative. Well, what do the Xbox and PC versions share on a purely technical level? To begin with the sound, worthy of honor and prestige, as those who have already tried the game will know, both for the music (engaging, non-invasive and perfectly appropriate to the differentsituations as they change effectively according to the level of danger in which we find ourselves) and for the effects, of which we can cite very little except their indisputable realism. Finally, the localization is impeccable, not only for the masterful dubbing, which counts the intervention of 30 professionals (including Luca Ward, voice of Keanu Reevs, Russel Crowe and Pierce Brosnan, etc.), but above all for the quality of the translation and the adaptation, for once up to the original. An excellent test by Local Transit (here and here you can find our interviews). Like two drops of water? What distinguishes the PC conversion from the console original instead? First of all the graphics, where the question begins to get delicate. As is obvious on PC, the game has the opportunity to be embodied in the most imaginative resolutions depending on the user's hardware availability, as opposed to consoles, bound to the television standard. The point is that the high resolution and greater definition of the monitor tend to accentuate small defects and imperfections of the engine (slightly ~stretched~ textures, aliasing on the edges of the shadows, interpenetration of polygons) which to a large extent remained completely unnoticed on ordinary TV screens, with the result that the game is generally less beautiful to look at than its Xbox counterpart. These are to a large extent impressions also aroused by being closer to the video, but there are also aesthetic differences of a more quantifiable nature. Testing the game on an Athlon 1800+ with 1 Gbyte of DDR memory and an attached GeForce Ti 4600, Splinter Cell actually shone for fluidity and speed, but as far as dynamic lighting is concerned, some defects have become evident that are not exactly up to par of the hardware available. An example is the gradual passage between the shadow and light areas: in Splinter Cell lights and shadows are calculated in real time (very well I would add) but it happens to witness the typical ~flicker~ caused by the sudden replacement of a texture with a another of a different shade. For example, it may happen that part of the protagonist's uniform, once he suddenly enters a shaded area, suddenly passes from gray to black: the difference in gradation is so accentuated that it cannot escape a careful eye and is annoying if juxtaposed to the rest of the elements of the scene, which go from light to dark much more smoothly. Naturally, these are details of merely circumstantial relevance, but the evidence of some of them justified the release of a first patch which has already significantly improved the visual quality of the game. Power is nothing (without <i>control</i>) Now let's move on to what most players will care most about, or what has changed in terms of the control system and therefore playability. The conversion of a title from PC to console is typically a delicate process given the lack of a mouse, especially in the case of FPS and third-person action (let's skip over the unpleasant RTS episodes bent on the inflexible law of the joypad). In the case of Sprinter Cell, the situation is the reverse: belonging to a genre particularly congenial to the mouse+keyboard combination, but which vice versa was born on consoles. This certainly didn't please us skeptical and traditionalist PC users, yet the control system turned out to be absolutely flawless, especially since the game rarely requires instant mouse precision during firefights. A control system so good and well calibrated on the potential of the latest generation joypads that importing it to the PC has aroused (and arouses) more than a few perplexities. An example: as in any self-respecting action, the protagonist boasts two different speeds of movement, which correspond to running and walking - in the case of Sprinter Cell - circumspect and silent. Well on consoles they correspond to two different degrees of ~pressure~ of the analog stick (the best innovation of recent years in the field of game peripherals, other than vibrations and trifles of this kind), which allows you to control the movements with a single quick and natural gesture. On PC the matter is not a little complicated given that the digital nature of the keys of our austere kayboard implies only two states, i.e. on / off or pressed / not pressed. An additional key is therefore required to activate or not the ~run~. And what is the problem you will say? After all, that's what we've been doing for years in all FPS, or rather, that we *don't* do since in the vast majority of cases we cut the bull's head off with a nice ~always run~. Power is nothing(without <i>control</i>) The point is that in Splinter Cell the difference between walking and running goes far beyond the patience or time available to the gamer: running means making noise and attracting dangerous attention, while advancing slowly and circumspectly is the only way to approach the enemy or notice traps and cameras in time. It often happens that you have to suddenly sprint to avoid a guard after a long and slow journey in the shadows or vice versa instantly crouch and advance unseen after a breakneck run with soldiers on your heels. Adding an additional key to the (many) already provided would have been far too chaotic and the default solution was to use the mouse wheel to decree the speed of the protagonist. Functional but not as comfortable, especially, not counting users without a mouse with scroll wheel. Similarly, the use of the arrow keys is sometimes inaccurate in an attempt to correctly position the character (equipped with multiple degrees of orientation) for a millimeter jump or to enter a narrow passage, just as the first attempts to pick the locks could cause you to moderate hysterical crises. Yet the PC control system also has its undeniable and invaluable advantages: the use of the mouse allows you to look around more easily and more naturally, change direction with greater timing and of course aim faster and more precisely, so that the likelihood of emerging victorious from a firefight increases dramatically on PC compared to consoles. In short, each control system has its pros and cons, it's up to the player to choose the one most congenial to him and the best advice we can give you is to try the demo that has been released on the net for some time. The final verdict Despite the various small imperfections found, we can only recommend Sprinter Cell to anyone who wants to invest their money in something extremely similar to a good movie, but capable of entertaining you much longer. However, if you should find yourself in the situation of having to choose between PC and console, the dispassionate advice of the undersigned, far from any sterile favoritism for this or that gaming platform, is to adopt the game for Xbox or Ps2. On balance, this conversion has on its side only the not negligible possibility of saving at will at any time, not only at the checkpoints. A more balanced choice and in line with the tastes of the PC public. Pros Excellent graphics and sound Unparalleled playability An in-depth and engaging story to be discovered Rightly challenging Cons Some technical flaws compared to the Xbox version Control system not very suitable for the keyboard When the wait ends... Splinter Cell is one of those titles that make it worth buying the Xbox and in the light of this fact, the significant delay with which the PC conversion presented itself at the appointment with its fans seems justified. Considering the more than considerable space that we have dedicated to this killer application on our pages (as well as the constant hype dedicated to it), even the less attentive reader should have a fairly precise idea of what kind of game Splinter Cell is, therefore we will try not to spend too many words on the introduction of the game itself and once the game mechanics have been properly explored, we will devote ample space to the comparison with the Xbox version, asking ourselves on which platform the game gives its best.", "date": "2003-02-27", "grade": null}
