{"name": "Il canto del cigno", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/164642-stella-glow-il-canto-del-cigno.html", "text": "Imageepoch is a little-known developer that Nintendo 3DS owners will probably remember most for Yoshi's New Island, the latest adventure in chronological order of the green dinosaur created by Shigefumi Hino. In reality, Imageepoch has carved out a place in the hearts of true fans of Japanese RPGs with some much lesser-known titles, such as 7th Dragon, Sands of Destruction and, above all, the Luminous Arc trilogy. The latter, which began in 2007 on the Nintendo DS and then continued over the next two years, was aimed at two particular niches of enthusiasts: those who were looking for a turn-based isometric strategy game in the style of Final Fantasy Tactics, a category that is almost extinct today, and those who adore fantasy adventures based on somewhat stereotyped characters who, thanks to a good script, still manage to impress the player. The success of the new Nintendo handheld had prompted Imageepoch to start a new saga strongly inspired by Luminous Arc, a sort of reboot focused on the same themes: magic and music. Debts got the better of it, though, and the Japanese developer was forced to close its doors shortly after completing the work. In short, its swan song was Stella Glow, a strategic RPG like we hadn't seen in years. Stella Glow is the latest game developed by Imageepoch, but also one of its best strategy RPGs The Witches of Regnant If you read our hands-on a few weeks ago, and tried the related demo available on the eShop, then you already know how this story begins. Otherwise, it is easy to say: the young Lisette finds a dying boy in the woods, takes him to the village of Mithra where she lives with her mother and takes care of him, baptizing him Alto. The latter, in fact, remembers nothing of his past, but thanks to his selfless and full of energy Alto manages to carve out a place in the community of the country, excelling as a hunter. Everything changes when Hilda arrives, a witch who crystallizes all the inhabitants of Mithra. In fact, in the world of Stella Glow, a legend tells that men had risen up against God and that, to punish them, he had deprived them of the gift of ~song~. Only witches can still sing, unleashing deadly magical powers like those of Hilda ... and Lisette, who discovers that she is actually the witch of the water. And here the demo ended, with Alto and Lisette escorted to the castle of Regnant to meet the empress. The story continues without sparing some decidedly interesting twists. In fact, the Empress intends to thwart Hilda's evil plans by resorting to the powers of the other witches of Regnant, which is why she appeals to Lisette and Alto, starting a journey that will reserve many surprises. Initially our heroes, accompanied by the best warriors of the kingdom, will have to find and recruit the various witches, who will prove to be decidedly eccentric and exquisitely Japanese characters in their idiosyncrasies, but then the plot will take a far from obvious turn, questioning the protagonists themselves and their beliefs. All in all, a script already seen in a compelling story is transformed by sparkling dialogues and over-the-top characters. Stella Glow is what can be defined as a ~well written~ RPG, in which every joke has its weight and every character his why. Sometimes it takes itself a little too seriously and from time to time the narration goes too long - if you don't speak English, stay away: it is not localized in Italian - but the ten chapters of the story offer an adventure that lasts right, without dead moments, which also allows you to deepen the narrative through a system that recalls the Social Links of Persona 3 and Persona 4. In fact, between one battle and another, we will be able to spend our limited free time in the city, talking with the supporting actors to get to know them better: it is an activity that is not exactly an end in itself, given that it determines the ending of the story among the various possible ones, not to mention that it allows us to work part-time, earning some pennies after having witnessed some nice gags, and to enhance the witches through the so-called Tuning. You call them if you want emotions The witches of Stella Glow are decidedly complex characters and behind the various stereotypes that fans of Japanese animation will know by heart lie concrete fears and rather disturbing backgrounds. To expand and control their powers, the witches will have to get rid of their emotional baggage, and in this sense Alto and the others can help them physically: their psyche will become a dream battlefieldin which to defeat the enemies blocking them. By completing these ~side quests~, the witches will learn new spells to use in combat, because one of the strengths of Stella Glow, inherited from Luminous Arc and old-school strategy RPGs, is the fact that each character is completely different from the others. You cannot choose the classes, as in Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre, nor can you change the weapons held, which at most can be modified with special accessories that give bonuses of various types. Each character wields a certain type of weapon and has access to different attack or defense skills therefore, when possible, the party should be chosen with due caution before the mission. Not that Stella Glow is a particularly severe strategist, on the contrary, but sometimes it can be really challenging, and in fact it is possible to ~grind~ a few experience points between one story mission and another, if needed, even if in most cases it is enough to encircle the enemies with anomalous state coups and directional attacks. The lion's share in the fighting is played by the positioning of the units. Attacking enemies from the side or from behind will allow us to inflict more damage, but the same goes for them, so we'll have to be careful in which direction we face the unit on duty after moving it on the checkerboard map. Additionally, some abilities affect the positioning of the character using them or their targets, providing some strategic flexibility. From this point of view, Stella Glow knows her stuff and if you overlook the intrinsic repetitiveness of the genre you find yourself facing particularly surprising enemies and maps, especially from mid-game onwards. The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect is pleasant but adds nothing in terms of gameplay, merely ~detaching~ the interface from the game sequences. On the map and during combat skits, the added depth provides a little extra drama, so it's worth activating. Battles between Nendoroids At first glance, Stella Glow certainly doesn't look like one of the best exponents of the genre on Nintendo 3DS, and in a comparison with titles like Fire Emblem: Awakening and Bravely Default, Imageepoch's game could hardly come out on top. Most of the narrative sequences are told through text dialogues - almost always dubbed in excellent English - and illustrations that portray the characters in their various expressions and the scenario in which they find themselves at that moment. It's nothing particularly sophisticated, and the cartoon sequences in between are very few. The style, however, is decidedly delicate, clean and ~Japanese~ to the right point: the trait of the character designer Eriko Fujiwara is soft and spot on, but imaginative and full of details both as regards the protagonists and their enemies. In battle, the situation changes drastically since, during the combat skits that the game reproduces every time we interact directly with the enemies, the various characters take on super deformed features - or ~chibi~ - which could make those who prefer the proportions turn up their noses realistic. The polygonal models, however squat and miniaturized, are nevertheless full of details, and the special effects of the more pyrotechnic abilities hide the general woodiness of the animations. The skits in question tend to become repetitive after a short time, as often happens in this genre of strategic RPG, but fortunately you can skip them by pressing a simple button. However, this does not speed up the flow of turns, which in the case of enemies appears a little too slow at times and can weigh down longer and more complicated missions. However, the maps deserve a small commendation, very colorful and full of tiny details that embellish them but which the developer could very well have done without including. Finally, being so focused on music and singing, Stella Glow certainly could not disappoint in the sound accompaniment, also because the soundtrack was composed by the great Yasunori Mitsuda, a musician who needs no introduction and who worked on some of the most popular Japanese RPGs ever: Xenogears, XenoSaga and Chrono Cross, among others, but also Luminous Arc, coincidentally. At the time a frequent collaborator of Imageepoch, Mitsuda gave an edge to the music of Stella Glow, and even if it didn't seem to be among the most memorable of his career we are still talking about an absolutely over the top soundtrack.", "date": "2016-03-19", "grade": "8.5"}
