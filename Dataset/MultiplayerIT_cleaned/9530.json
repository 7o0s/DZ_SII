This time the platforms chosen as trailblazers were the Apple mobile ones which can therefore enjoy, a few weeks ahead of the PC and Mac OSX release, the graphic restoration work and to a small extent the content of a graphic adventure loved by the public of the time but perhaps even increased in popularity in the following decade, thanks to the lack of great alternatives and above all the not excellent turn taken by the series with the third and then the fourth round. A commercial renaissance which, particularly on iPhone and iPad, devices very different from those for which Broken Sword and its sequels were initially designed, is also strengthened by the work being adapted as well as some good ideas, such as the possibility of sharing saves via the DropBox service which allows you to continue the game in progress on multiple different devices. Half successful The protagonist of Broken Sword: The Prophecy of the Mayas is once again George Stobbart, an American traveling to Paris where he plans to meet Nicole, a female figure who is the cause of endless amorous torments throughout the entire saga, but who will soon have to review his plans given the request by the latter to meet in the home of Professor Oubier, an expert on pre-Columbian civilizations. Having skipped the meeting and disappeared the beautiful (charming?) Nicole, in the second part of the adventure which is also controllable, the player will only have to embark on a journey across multiple continents, between ancient deities and narcos, film sets on the beach and city art galleries. The mechanics of The Prophecy of the Maya follow slavishly those of the first chapter thus relying on a traditional setting made up of objects to search for, collect, combine in some cases and then reuse in the right place, enjoying in the meantime the amount of dialogues written to animate an adventure movie plot. In reality, despite a first glance and despite the qualitative level of the story as well as the gaming experience being quite high, there are several aspects that separate the subject of this review from Il Segreto dei Templari. The general tone of the narrative here undergoes a sharp shift towards a humor which, dosed in the first chapter in order to break the tension at the right moments, perhaps becomes excessive in the characterization of the secondary characters. Similarly, the level of difficulty has been lowered not so much by simplifying the puzzles, which are always affordable as per the tradition of the series, but by restricting the areas that can be visited during every single moment, thus making it easier to progress through attempts. The experience loses a few hits compared to the past from a narrative and playful point of view, to instead acquire them from a graphic point of view: even before appreciating the work done for this remastered version, complete with boxes and balloons to simplify the reading of the dialogues as well as an unprecedented system of facial animations, Broken Sword: The Prophecy of the Maya has in common with its predecessor a series of excellent tables created thanks to the work of some artists who came out of Don Bluth Studios - Dragon's Lair and several cartoons for cinema - but surpasses it for the use of different levels of parallax as well as some refinements such as a system of shadows, drawn in a ~dynamic~ way in accordance with the objects that populate the backdrop. The adaptation of the controls to the needs of the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad remains the same as already described in the previous review, with a long press on the screen showing the points of interest with which to then interact according to the chosen action; a system that, combined with the good work on the interface, gives great satisfaction. The tested version is 1.0. Price: 5.49 App Store links", "date": "2011-01-11", "grade": "S.V."}
