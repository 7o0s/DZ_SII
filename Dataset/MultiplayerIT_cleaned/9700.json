{"name": "LEGO Star Wars: Castaways", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lego-star-wars-castaways-recensione.html", "text": "Over the years, the videogame license of LEGO has been the exclusive prerogative of Warner Bros. and TT Games, who have been able to create a now consolidated formula both on the narrative front, with a humor that has become typical and recognizable, and on that of the mechanics, characterized by a great accessibility even at the cost of an approach that is anything but demanding. We were therefore surprised to see how Gameloft managed to make this approach its own, crafting a premium-style adventure for Apple Arcade, which would also look good on PC and console and that does not fear comparison with the previous tie-ins: we talk about it in the review of LEGO Star Wars: Castaways. History LEGO Star Wars: Castaway, one of the ~reward~ sequences for completing missions The story of LEGO Star Wars: Castaways sees our character land on a remote planet at the end of a daring space chase, and there he finds a lively community of star castaways ready to welcome him. However, there is a serious threat on the horizon and soon we will have to fight to save the new world we now call ~home~. Before that happens, however, we will have the opportunity to try our hand at a large number of activities thanks to simulators scattered throughout inside the city, which plays the role of a large hub and boasts various characters to interact with to carry on the progression, linked to a traditional list of objectives that we will be able to check at any time. The humor of the Gameloft title reproduces in a very faithful way that of the tie-ins developed by TT Games, using in this case the expedient of the ~mute~ protagonists who nevertheless elicit a smile with their expressions and with the strength of the situations in which they are continually involved, in the context of the classic entr'actes between one mission and another. To reiterate the charm deriving from such a famous intellectual property we also find the original soundtrack by John Williams, which accompanies what happens on the screen as usual in an epic way, as well as a series of nice videos that reproduce classic scenes from the first film trilogy . Gameplay LEGO Star Wars: Castaway, a four-player cooperative mission The hub we mentioned earlier is the beating heart of LEGO Star Wars: Castaways, with a large open map through which you can access everything the game has to offer, but timed according to your progression. In fact, at the beginning we will be able to try our hand only with certain ~on foot~ simulations, playable alone or in a cooperative together with a maximum of three other users; then it will be the turn of space flight sequences aboard a Y-Wing or a TIE Fighter. If the latter have the flavor of the classic shooters of the series, such as Star Wars: Rogue Leader, the standard missions resume the action of the tie-ins developed by TT Games, with a similar combat system but enriched by twin stick shooter-style mechanisms, in which, however, the classic sections are missing in which you have to reassemble the finished bricks on the ground to build any devices useful to move forward . LEGO Star Wars: Castaway, one of the many points of interest in the city Speaking of fighting, this aspect of the experience hides a depth that at first glance ends up escaping, thanks to the presence of four different classes (Soldier, Adept of the Force, Support and Agent) that we will be able to grow separately, unlocking new ones for each equipment and customizations. It is therefore a pity that we often have to repeat the same tasks, thus trying to artificially lengthen the duration of the campaign.Like practically all the games available on Apple Arcade, LEGO Star Wars: Castaways also supports bluetooth controllers, and it is obviously a good thing because in this way it is possible to rely on a higher precision of the inputs. The touch controls work well but the virtual stick tends to have too low a sensitivity and there is no way to increase it. Graphics and sound LEGO Star Wars: Castaway, a space mission around the Death Star As mentioned at the beginning, the Gameloft developers have done an excellent job in appropriating the LEGO Star Wars license, following what has been done so far by TT Games and thus packaging a truly very pleasant visual product, also full of cutscenes that will make the joy of long-time Star Wars fans. Also considering the music by John Williams, in the end the only criticism that can be leveled at the technical sector of Castaways lies in the impossibility of adjusting the graphic parameters in order to aim for 60 fps on deviceshigh-end factors: the preset applied is automatic and on the iPhone 12 Pro the game does not go beyond 30 frames, which is a bit disappointing.", "date": "2021-11-25", "grade": "8.0"}
