{"name": "Non solo erba", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71254-fifa-manager-10-non-solo-erba.html", "text": "Let's face it, if a few years ago an acquaintance had confided in you that he preferred the Fifa series to Pro Evolution Soccer, that would have been enough to brand the miserable wretch as a gaming illiterate worthy of abandoning video games in favor of a healthier life in open air, to hoe the earth. Today, if that same hypothetical shady figure returned from rural life to devote himself to the same passion of the past, his speech would no longer hold up only on the PC front, given the progress made by Electronic Arts demonstrating its willingness to probe the tastes of gamers and , despite a long and tortuous path, being able to offer a complete and mature product. Don't be afraid: you haven't got the wrong page and, above all, whoever is writing hasn't got the wrong game. Simply, in the light of the advances made by the sister series and retracing the history of the managerial one from EA - when the brand was still called Total Club Manager - it is impossible not to notice the decisive improvements highlighted by each new iteration and this year, with Fifa Manager 10, don't be too surprised to find yourself, perhaps for the first time, in front of a title capable of fighting on equal terms with sacred monsters of the genre such as Football Manager himself. Mind you, the essential comparison with the benchmark of the genre could mean that the latest work of the Bright Futures still has to surrender against the more expert Sports Interactive but, never like this time, we would feel like recommending Fifa Manager 10 also to football scientists simulated. At least between one championship break and another. All-round simulation The richness of the playful offer proposed by Fifa Manager 10 is evident from the moment the game is created. In addition to selecting the championships to simulate (perhaps the Chinese inter-regional one is missing) and entering personal data, you will be asked whether to create a club from scratch and take it from suburban fields to the Champions League, rather than playing as a real Player Manager (a few moments of silence for Dino Dini and his Anco), also more commonly known as ~field coach~. And if it weren't enough for you to manage life on the playing fields alone, you are also given the opportunity to start a family or perhaps simulate the unruly existence of the viveur coach, dedicated to the good life and unbridled luxury. Maybe trying not to lose everything in the bag. Sticking to the football section - and leaving out, for example, the nice quiz extra - Fifa Manager 10 does not only grant you control of the dressing room but, on the contrary, will give you the opportunity to get your hands on almost every single aspect involved in team management in a sense more side. From the administration of the structures to the management of relations with sponsors, press, fans and any satellite teams. All this going through a myriad of micro-managements that will drive management game lovers crazy, to say the least. All this mass of numbers, information and statistics are offered with a user interface which, despite its efforts to guarantee a pleasant and visually coherent graphic environment, often fails to be intuitive. Even after hours of playing it may happen that you don't remember how to reach a given option or, worse, you have to use the left mouse button for some actions and the right for others. In short, from this point of view the amount of information on the screen can only be partially an alibi. In case some of you are intimidated or prefer to devote yourself to the relationship with the players, their training and the management of tactics, it will be possible to delegate these tasks to one or more collaborators. Obviously the level of skill of the latter will affect the quality of the work done, but the player will always have the last word. More generally, the detail and accuracy of each simulated element appeared to us to be of an excellent level and able to offer a degree of challenge equal to the situation. Seeing things from another perspective, in practice the possibility of delegating sports management to coaches and technical staff is not even precluded in order to concentrate instead on the more managerial components. In short, it's up to you to decide whether to step into Ferrara's shoes, Galliani's or both. Every damn Sunday Suspicious of the level of detail of the, let's say, accessory parts, it is natural to wonder about the goodness of the technical management and of the competitions rather than of the football simulation. The truth is that the developers, at least at the implementation level, do not seem to have left anything out. In addition to the management of the preparation (complete with the choice of the place of retreat), training, dn the transfer campaign and the youth sector, the coach is given the opportunity to interact with his players even on a psychological level: before, during and after matches. Once you arrive - finally - on the playing field you will be able to witness a three-dimensional representation of the match, rather than a useless textual summary that fails to exhaustively summarize the progress of the match. Excluding side clashes, the use of three-dimensional graphics is therefore indispensable, compensated by the fact that the matches, even in full length, will never exceed ten minutes of play and that the graphics appear, especially in the case of stadiums and teams most important, unexpectedly faithful to the real counterparts. Compared to the previous edition, it is now also possible to see the game action from the sidelines, with the result that it seems to be sitting on the bench. Or almost so. The control over all these aspects is practically total while their effects are... playful and sometimes not entirely realistic. It is precisely in this context that the conscious choice made by designers to differentiate themselves from the competition is highlighted. Fifa Manager 10 offers a game environment more suited to mere entertainment and giving something from a purely simulation point of view. And this is not always a bad thing.", "date": "2009-10-15", "grade": "8.5"}
