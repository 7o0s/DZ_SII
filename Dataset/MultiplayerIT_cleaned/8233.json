We advise you to read it to learn more about the latest effort by Game Freak, the very first Pokmon to boast that magical ~2~ in the title that identifies it as a full-fledged sequel to the latest generation Nintendo DS. The commercial aspect of this latest Nintendo experiment has been much discussed, even in the field of a series as commercial as Pokmon in itself, and this premise is important because it allows us to better understand the identity of Radar Pokmon, an app for Nintendo 3DS at low cost available on the eShop. Pokmon in reality RAdar Pokmon is one of the few software almost entirely based on augmented reality technology: if you already own a Nintendo 3DS, you will almost certainly have played Face Hunt, one of the nice software pre-installed on the portable console. In fact, Radar Pokmon is played practically the same way: the two cameras of the console record the surrounding environment, to which colored clouds are added that float in space, a bit as if they were in the room with us. This is where we come into play, in every sense: equipped with a special device provided to us by the Pokmon scholar on duty, an inevitable figure in the series, we will have to hit these clouds by pressing a single key, looking for them around us. The idea is that some very special pokmon are hiding in a secret dimension between dream and reality: the clouds that we will hit could hide one of these pokmon and at that point our task will be to trap it thanks to the beam emitted by the device. The pokmon freed from the cloud will move frantically in space and it won't be easy to keep up with him and capture him before time runs out. Alternatively, the bubbles could also hide useful consumable items and, almost always, a certain amount of dream drops. These luminous globes must be hit and accumulated to purchase convenient upgrades which, for example, will increase the duration of the capture phase, increase the power of the device or unlock more clouds at the same time or other very useful gadgets. However, it is not possible to play indefinitely: once a stage is completed, it will be necessary to wait for some time (about an hour) before all the clouds are regenerated. Alternatively, it is possible to immediately regenerate the clouds by spending the game coins accumulated in the Nintendo 3DS: in any case, this option is also limited and can only be used twice a day. The limit imposed on the use of the game is quite annoying and places Radar Pokmon as a sort of short pastime to be devoted to, perhaps, between a game of Pokmon Black and White version 2 and the other. They come out of the cloudy walls After all, this app is closely linked to the latest edition of Pokmon: the objects found and the Pokmon captured during our research can in fact be sent to the cartridge. The process is very simple and requires only two steps, one in Pokmon Radar and the other in the White or Black version 2, to complete. This connection, called Axis with Unima, is important because it allows you to add some otherwise unobtainable little monsters to the pokDex: we are mainly referring to the three ~Therian~ forms of the divine pokmon Landorus, Thundurus and Tornadus. These legendary pokmon will appear on the screen in physical form and attack us with abilities that we can repel with our laser. The three-dimensional effect of the polygonal models in these cases is very pleasant, but unfortunately it is limited only to these three battles. In Pokmon Radar there are about twenty pokmon in total; unfortunately most are quite common, but some of them have special abilities that make them particularly attractive. Furthermore, some types of pokmon that can be acquired in Pokmon Radar, such as the psychic ones, would not be obtained in the Black and White 2 version before a few hours of play, therefore they represent a discreet advantage for those who have just started playing and transfer them to their own match. What's more, after completing the game by defeating the divine pokmon, it is possible to insert the fourth generation games (Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, SoulSilver and HeartGold) into the Nintendo 3DS to capture the related legendary pokmon, otherwise inaccessible in the White version and Black 2, except by trade. It is clear that RAdar Pokmon was not designed as a stand-alone game, but as a useful app to complete the pokDex of the Black and White version 2 of Pokmon. As a result, it may interest gamers more than youborn who have decided to catch them all, including alternative forms and old legends. Unfortunately, however, the lack of variety of creatures and the superficiality and excessive simplicity of the gameplay make it an absolutely useless title for anyone else.", "date": "2012-10-24", "grade": null}
