We are therefore at the third revision of a product capable of getting noticed thanks to some good ideas, above all the multifaceted crafting system and the abundance of missions available, but in this case the developers have seen fit to change perspective ... literally . How to Survive: Third Person Standalone represents the clear attempt to take the original gameplay and structure and reshape them to create a different experience, which abandons the three-quarter top view in favor of a third person approach (precisely ) which seems to mimic State of Decay. The final result, however, is contrasting: let's see why. How to Survive: Third Person Standalone puts Eko Software's survival game from another perspective Survive first Let's start from the characterizing elements of the game, which as mentioned has become a third-person survival game in this version. After selecting a character from the four available (Kenji, the balanced option; Jack, a sort of surly wrestler; Abby and Nina, the damsels of the situation, elusive but lethal), we will find ourselves on the beach of a tropical island far from deserted, as for the most part its inhabitants have been mysteriously transformed into zombies hungry for human flesh. The threat appears immediately evident and so, having grabbed a stick, we will have to make our way through the undead (also pulling off spectacular combos to tear them to pieces) to reach different areas of the scenario and interact with some other survivors, each with a story to tell and a call for help. On the island, however, we will also find the expert Kovak, a man of many resources who has disseminated his survival guides around and who, during the early stages of the adventure, will take us under his wing to teach us how to look for raw materials right and build even rather sophisticated weapons, such as pistols or air rifles. After this introductory part, clearly boring for those who have already spent a few hours with the previous incarnations of How to Survive, we will be able to move around the map, face different types of enemies and use a modified combat system for the occasion, which enhances close shots but inevitably distorts the use of firearms and the bow. Horror on the island How to Survive: Third Person Standalone, we can say with relative certainty, is not a product designed for those who have already completed Eko Software's adventure, although the developers have conveyed the message that it is a revision created on the basis of criticism of users. The reason is easy to say: beyond the new approach introduced by the third person view and the consequent changes to the gameplay, the experience is unchanged in the structure and in the events, which means that playing it over again is a practice reserved for those who he really appreciated the original game very much or, more likely, to those who were intrigued by the title but not by its initial setting, preferring a solution similar to that of the aforementioned State of Decay. Having tried both incarnations of this survival game, we can say that we appreciated the latter more, even if some technical and design limitations catch the eye. The Steam community appears very divided on the issue, with the aficionados of the first edition unable to accept the changes and pointing the finger above all at the problematic management of firearms and shooting, but beyond some inconvenience with the bow we can say that the third-person view makes it easier to face hordes of zombies, thanks to the possibility of hitting the ~boomers~ from a distance (whose explosive touch often proves fatal) and have better control over our surroundings. Having left the controls unchanged, with the triggers activating aim and attack (at least on the perfectly supported Xbox 360 controller), on the one hand it avoids traumatic changes for those who had memorized the original layout, on the other it shows some inconsistencies with respect to up to the standards of the action genre. Added to this is the impossibility of jumping, which creates quite grotesque situations when, to reach a point on the map, you have to make a huge turn instead of climbing overtake a small obstacle. Furthermore, even in this version, a cooperative multiplayer mode is missing: yes, that could have really relaunched the contents of the product. Another perspective The strengths of How to Survive, represented as mentioned by the crafting system and the many quests, have remained unchanged despite the change of view and still constitute a valid reason to buy the product, even more so considering the reduced price. However, one cannot speak of a perfectly successful transformation, both from a technical and gameplay point of view. The fights have in fact preserved the ~slipperiness~ of the first version of the game, which however now stands out due to the new perspective, giving the sensation of a poorly finished production and even less attentive to the rendering of the impacts, which has not been received. As far as graphics and sound are concerned, it is evident that many animations have not been conceived for something other than the camera from above, and the lack of advanced options for visual adjustments only confirms this thesis too. The game runs at a frame rate that often exceeds 120 frames per second, but for detail and polygonal modeling the rendering is that of an older generation title. On the audio front there are good dialogues in English and decent sound effects, but the music can be really annoying and you'll find yourself turning down the volume in no time. Ultimately, we would like to recommend this new version of How to Survive to those who have not tried the original edition and much prefer a third-person approach to a top-down view, even if the final result looks like the traditional ~ mixed bag~.", "date": "2015-07-08", "grade": "7.0"}
