The one where a girl arrives at an outdoor party with her friends, she places the console on a table and suddenly everyone stops what they are doing to play? ~What nonsense!~ we would have thought in chorus, wouldn't we? Imagine if Katie, who has been hitting on Lonnie for three quarters of an hour, puts down her booze and drops her prey to be able to play a game of 1-2-Switch. Yet the same excitement of those actors paid to star in a commercial we really felt during the GDC days of San Francisco, when in one of the city parks we let small groups of people and friends try the console and have a game of 1-2-Switch. The reactions have all been positive, but the truth is that the 28 mini-games included in this collection can never extend the enjoyment beyond the first game with the same group of friends. After all, Wii Sports teaches that sometimes it's better to do little but well. 1-2-Switch is insane and also manages to entertain, but the enthusiasm lasts very little Controller milkers Every time you start the game, a screen informs you that ~1-2-Switch is always played looking at the opponent~. That's not exactly true, given that more than one minigame expressly asks you to interact with what's happening on the screen. However, this collection of small multiplayer challenges is at its best when on-screen cues are completely removed from the equation. Duel in the West, one of the most publicized mini-games in the past months, is a challenge of reflexes in which, at the sound signal, you have to be faster than your opponent to lift the Joy-Con and pull the trigger. It's intuitive, fast and fun. There is also a silly variation called Trick in the West, in which the game tries to trick players through misleading announcements (instead of saying ~Fire!~, it will say for example ~Pretend~, ~Fruit~ or ~Smart~). Another certainly successful is Samurai, in which a player swings a katana while the other has to block it with the right timing by joining hands. Too bad that, once you understand what the right feint to do is, it's so easy to deceive your opponent that there's no more fun and you move on to something else. Perhaps this is one of the big problems of 1-2-Switch: almost all the mini-games, even the most successful ones, have some weaknesses or must be played in particular conditions. Games like Table Tennis, or Duel in the West itself, require the two challengers to pay attention to the sound effects coming from the console, which therefore makes it more difficult to play during a party or other places where there is a lot of noise. Others need to place the Joy-Con on a flat surface, excluding them completely if you don't have a table at hand or are sitting on an uneven surface (at the park, for example). Then there are games that don't work at all and are there taking up useless space in the console's memory. In Yoga, whoever moves first loses, but the detection of movements is so inaccurate that the only way to lose is to give up deliberately. It's exactly like the game of silence: whoever gets bored first loses. There's a game where you have to rock the console so that a newborn baby falls asleep and, of course, it cries and screams the whole time. The brief experience is so disturbing and annoying that one wonders how it jumped to the head of the development team. At least it's a great tool if you want to make your partner give up the desire to reproduce. It's a real shame that 1-2-Switch has so much wasted potential - a minigame where you have to guess the number of marbles in the Joy-Con is the best demonstration currently on the Switch of the potential of the HD Rumble. There are also a handful of rather dubious games, like the one where you milk a cow or the one where you eat a sandwich, which the first time elicit mischievous laughs from the people you're playing with. The second time, on the other hand, it's already old.", "date": "2017-03-07", "grade": "6.5"}
