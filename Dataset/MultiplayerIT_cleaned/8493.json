Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent. A mysterious scenario, which hides a secret, is the backdrop to Cuboid, the action puzzle developed by Creat Games and available on the PlayStation Network digital platform since 2009. The game puts reasoning in the foreground, confronting us with a fundamentally geometric dilemma in each stage. In fact, our goal is to move a block of stone, overturning it on its six faces and making it roll in various directions, so that it fits perfectly into a ~hole~ present on the path. The experience has a total of four scenarios (~dome~, ~altar~, ~catacombs~ and ~extra~), each consisting of about twenty levels characterized by increasing degrees of difficulty. Now, if on PlayStation 3 the gameplay was based on traditional type controls, for the transition to iOS devices the developers have seen fit to adopt a gesture interface, which with simple ~swipes~ of the finger on the touch screen allows us to roll the block in the desired direction. To make things easier for us, a short but complete tutorial has even been included, which illustrates not only the philosophy behind this interesting production, but also some of the variations that will be introduced as we continue in the adventure. However, let's deal immediately with the issue of free: Cuboid can be downloaded from the App Store without paying anything and can also be completed without any outlay, but it has an in-app purchase system that allows us to buy coins useful for quickly unlocking the levels , as well as the purchase of ~tips~. The latter, visually represented by a light bulb icon, quickly show us the moves necessary to complete each stage, moves that we will however have to try to memorize and which, from a certain point on, will become quite numerous. As far as the unlocking of the levels is concerned, the Creat Games title makes use of the classic system that sees our performances rewarded with one, two or three stars depending on the time spent. The stars make us earn coins proportionally, to be used to ~buy~ the next missions. It goes without saying that we will always have to try to get the best possible evaluation to access all the scenarios and shed light on the mystery we mentioned at the beginning. Shall we cube? In short, Cuboid's gameplay is very simple in mechanics but complex in substance. The first puzzles are clearly trivial and require a few moves to complete, but soon the movements necessary to reach the ~finish~ will multiply and we will have to evaluate our moves well, proceed by trial and error and, sometimes, repeat a stage from scratch to be able to complete it quickly and get the three stars. It is even possible to save the progress of the game, which suggests what kind of complexity the game is capable of achieving. Don't think, however, that rolling the block taking the measurements of the path will be the only thing we will do, because there will be many variations on the theme: normal switches, switches that require a particular pressure, bridges to be opened to connect platforms and even devices that ~halve~ our block into two cubes will appear during the campaign, enriching the experience with many interesting facets and mixing the cards on the table just enough to keep the involvement high. Finally, we must add a technical achievement of excellence, certainly the daughter of the PS3 version, which boasts an essential but inspired musical accompaniment and detailed, fluid and convincing graphics.", "date": "2012-06-16", "grade": "8.0"}
