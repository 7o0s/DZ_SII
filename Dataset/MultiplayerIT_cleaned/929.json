And yet here it is, in front of our very curious little eyes, ready to be appreciated or hated. However, there is a novelty, even if it is no longer very fresh: although obviously the logos and trademarks of LucasArts continue to appear generously in the game, in reality with the acquisition of the rights this is all UbiSoft's sack flour, and precisely of the his team dedicated to laptop development in Montreal. So there are the premises for a game to follow, let's see how they develop The conditions for a game to follow are therefore there Is two the perfect number? Ok, the episode is the third, but already the fact that we are talking about the second trilogy Actually the recurrence of number 2 in this review is curious, starting from the fact that we are judging not one but precisely two versions of the same game, the DS and the GBA; and the reason is simple, they are the same game. In the body of the article we will focus on the Dual Screen version (and here's the 2 again) deepening the peculiarities of the GBA one in a box because in fact on DS there are several extras, but the substance does not change one iota: RotS is a 2D fighting game in the wake of the immortals Double Dragon, Golden Axe, Final Fight or whatever you want, in the course of which Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi (you see, two selectable characters) will have to contend with hordes of droids, clones, Sith, combat tanks and various obstacles. The characters are not freely selectable without consequences, as apart from the initial phase the levels they face are different. Even the style of play to be adopted will be different, because the effects of the numerous moves present are different, both the more classic ones of combat and those that exploit the powers of the Force, and also the classic bar which, once filled, unleashes the moves-end- di-world fills in a different way: working with the lightsaber (attacking and defending) for Anakin, using the Force for Obi Wan. RotS is a 2D fighting game in the vein of the immortal Double Dragon Is two the perfect number? You can also choose to quickly tackle a level without going too subtle or linger and make yourself beautiful by facing the threats that face you in pure Jedi style, and then performing complex combinations, exploiting the powers of the Force, using the lightsaber to defend yourselves perhaps by sending back to the sender the blows that arrive ... Both approaches pay off: at the end of each level your performance will be calculated based on Style, Speed and certain power ups collected, and the higher the scores the higher the possibility of advancing in one of the three characteristics of the character and to make their powers more effective. The game action is generally fun even if repetitive, but there are variations on the theme such as timed levels, various obstacles that are impossible to break down and which therefore must be overcome in another way, mechanical bosses whose attack patterns are quite pressing, and epochal duels with the Sith of the Dark Side with lightsaber blows: the latter have favorably impressed us since they require careful observation of the opponent's movements and a remarkable quickness of reflexes, ~like a Jedi~ we would dare to add if the joke weren't so inflated . The game itself is not long at all, it could take you a couple of hours to finish it, but the presence of two characters with different paths and styles of play, three difficulty levels and the possible desire to complete each level with honors it is sufficient to obtain a good result also in terms of longevity. Rogue Squadron DS? You can find all this on DS as on GBA: the only difference in terms of play is that on DS you can choose the move to perform among those that become available as the Fury/Meditation bar increases with a simple touch on the Touch Screen which is actually convenient. Graphically, the two editions do not differ one iota, and although the realization is remarkable for the animations and fluidity of the characters, a little less for the backdrops that would have benefited from a few more details, for DS owners the disappointment is understandable: with in all likelihood a 2D that really took full advantage of this system would have given far more impressive results. The graphics of the flight sessions are amazing Rogue Squadron DS? What you won't find on the single-screen laptop are the Rogue Squadron-like 3D flight and dogfight sessions that are naturally unique to the DS version. Not only do they intersperse combat levels approxnonici, but they even constitute a separate mode, which would then be the multiplayer one (with multiple cards) to be tackled individually using bots. The control of the shuttle (many available and to be unlocked also from the films of the old trilogy) is surprisingly good with the directional pad, since the touch one has not been implemented; the opponents are never in large numbers and moreover the challenge they offer tends to be low, nevertheless these sessions are able to dispense a lot of fun, if only for the fact that they offer a type of experience not possible up to now on a laptop. Furthermore, with more players, we will also magically obtain the challenge and the true value of these levels will emerge. The touch screen is used to display elements such as the radar and the HUD of the shuttle, as well as to decide to distribute the shields front or rear, an innovation that adds almost nothing in single but which can prove useful in multiplayer. The graphics of the flight sessions are surprising: the programmers have clearly favored fluidity, 60 frames per second rock solid, but they didn't have to give up a fair amount of polygons (although the fog effect is visibly present), as well as fancy effects such as a fake calculation of the light on our shuttle, which is also well represented. Therefore, an almost entirely positive judgment on what Ubi Canada's real effort was on the DS version, perhaps waiting for an entire game entirely based on this engine. Is it a bird? A plane? No, it's Spoilerman! Still remaining within the ambit of differences, a huge one is the sound: on GBA they are midi of the classic music of the series, on DS, finally for the first time on a laptop, glorious integral samples which, above all on headphones, make a splendid effect and which increase quite a lot the feeling of involvement and exaltation. The decision to bring the release date of the game forward compared to the film will undoubtedly have been based on solid and convincing economic reasons. However, the problem remains that the game seems to follow, until we see it in the cinema we can not be sure, the plot of the film with sufficient accuracy and the necessary emphasis on the most important moments, with quotes and dialogues that could very well have been taken verbatim from the film. The result is that anyone who finds himself playing Episode III before seeing the film will have already known most of the things to know; I will personally take my revenge by making up for the poor viewing colleagues in the room: uncommon, half joy. In any case, the style used is curiously cartoony, very pleasant but perhaps unsettling for those who expect a faithful reproduction of the film; however, it cannot be said that the features of the actors are badly reproduced. The plot advances above all for dialogues, but there is no shortage of animated cut scenes that retain the same cartoonish style of the game phases. The flight phases are slightly more realistic, which however do not give up touches of class such as the 2D explosions that almost look like cel shading: very beautiful, but risk making the gap between 2D cartoon-style phases and 3D phases even more noticeable realistic. Comment It will be due to the general lack of trust around the tie-ins, to the low quality of the PS2/Xbox counterpart, to the question of the similarities between the DS and GBA version, it will be what it will be, but the quality of this Episode III was a real nice surprise. It is a well-made, enjoyable, fun, sufficiently challenging game and also capable of giving remarkable moments of involvement, especially on DS where the graphic-sound first fruits are more present. Although it cannot be said that it particularly excels in any area, the most serious problem with the title goes beyond the game itself and is a problem with the expiration date, as it will cease when the film is finally available in theaters and the game can be played quietly without spoiling the surprise. The very little use of the touch screen remains, but paradoxically the presence of such canonical games is an indication of the success that the Nintendo machine is achieving. Recommended unreservedly to Star Wars fans and in general to those looking for a good Action: the dynamic portable Nintendo duo boasts at the moment of the presence of the best tie-in of one of the most anticipated films of all time, and sorry if it's not much. Pros Fast, rich gameplay Well-crafted 3D stages Great use of the license Cons 2D can be much better on DS Touch screen almost ignored It came out before the movie! Don't touch me Star Wars! Everything you read in the DS version review applies to the GBA edition, apart from the touch screen, I knowcolors and phases in 3D. Obviously the discourse on graphics, although identical in itself, changes considerably, as it can well be said that the hardware of the small laptop has been exploited properly. In addition, the GBA can count on a multiplayer interpretation of the 2D game action, which was strangely omitted on the DS: this mode can be undertaken both in its cooperative version, the classic one of all games of the genre, and on a competitive in which whoever stays alive the longest wins in an arena literally invaded by clones, droids and so on and so forth.", "date": "2005-05-26", "grade": null}
