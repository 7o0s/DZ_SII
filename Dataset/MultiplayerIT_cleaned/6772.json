{"name": "Woah Dave", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/140498-woah-dave-meglio-un-uovo-oggi.html", "text": "Developed by MiniVisions, a group of developers focused on small experimental games and three years ago acquired by Californian Gaijin Games (now renamed Choice Provisions), Woah Dave has no problem declaring his inspiration to Mario Bros. for Atari. From the structure of the level to gameplay solutions, passing through small graphic tributes, it is an unashamedly retro style, references to the classic Nintendo arcade game abound, yet thanks to a few simple ideas, the developers have brought a small game to tablets and smartphones which, although derivative, oozes personality and offers a fast-paced and fun experience. Arrives on tablets and smartphones Woah Dave, a frenetic arcade that refers to Mario Bros and Super Crate Box ...than an alien tomorrow Those who have played Mario Bros or the more recent Super Crate Box will find a long list of similarities in Woah Dave. The mechanics are so simple that the player is thrown directly into the action without the need for a guide or tutorial. As a little man named Dave, you find yourself hopping across a series of platforms suspended over a pool of lava, trying to survive as long as possible by eliminating an endless stream of enemies that appear from the top of the screen. In short, the basic structure is more or less the same as the two aforementioned games, but it is the way in which this is elaborated that makes Woah Dave so interesting and all in all unique. From above, two types of objects come into play: on the one hand there are the alien eggs, which remain motionless for a few seconds before hatching and giving life to a little monster that begins to wander around the level; on the other there are huge skulls that can be thrown at enemies but which explode after a while, eliminating anyone nearby. However, in order to earn points, it's not enough just to kill your opponents, you also need to collect the coins they drop when eliminated. This creates a frenetic and constantly risky experience, in which it is essential to try to eliminate enemy aliens in a hurry before they become too many. The simplicity of the mechanics also hides a pinch of strategy, with the player who can decide whether to amass more eggs next to a skull ready to explode, whether to throw them into the pool of lava or whether to use them in turn as weapons to be thrown, with the risk, however, that they hatch just as he holds them in his arms. As you get carried away you manage to survive longer and collect more coins, with the game slowly throwing some other ingredients into the cauldron. The lava pool begins to rise towards the top of the screen, forcing Dave to take cover on the upper platforms and make up for it by throwing some enemies into the sea of magma. Likewise, some annoying UFOs start popping up, fluttering around the screen firing devastating laser beams. And it is at this point that things get really interesting, with the player having to constantly adapt strategy and priorities, understand which danger to face first and what to use to counter it. UFOs are certainly among the most annoying but, as in Super Crate Box and Mario Bros., enemies who reach the bottom of the screen will return to the field more annoying than before. A clear homage to its ~Nintendian~ inspiration is a WOAH block (the equivalent of the POW block in Mario Bros.), which once destroyed makes a clean sweep of all the aliens on the screen and resolves the most chaotic situations with a bang; pity that this block only remains in play for a short time, thus prompting the player to wonder whether to use it immediately or whether to wait for more enemies to arrive, but thus risking seeing it disappear. In short, everything in Woah Dave is designed to put haste and urgency to those who play, but although the new Choice Provisions game is based on solid mechanics, the team fails to make the experience varied enough to keep the player glued for more than a few match. If Super Crate Box gave a sense of progression through a large number of unlockable items and arenas, Woah Dave always remains the same, except for a very difficult mode that is unlocked once you have collected 150 coins in a single game. Furthermore, the mobile version we tested lacks the competitive option for two players present in the PC and PlayStation 4 editions, a mode that perhaps few would have exploited locally, but which is a shame not to have.", "date": "2014-11-11", "grade": "7.8"}
