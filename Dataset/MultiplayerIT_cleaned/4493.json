In reality it is not the case of Halfbrick Studios: in 2010 the company broke the bank with Fruit Ninja and its three hundred million downloads, to then repeat the following year with a completely different experience, Jetpack Joyride, a game capable of catalyzing the attention of over five hundred million users. Resounding successes, which have allowed these Australian developers to devote themselves to interesting experiments, such as the recent Dan the Man and this latest project, which presents itself as something completely new for the studio: Shadows Remain. In fact, we are talking about an augmented reality horror adventure, which uses the camera of our iOS device to ~anchor~ a sort of diorama on a surface of the house and there, inside it, tell a disturbing story: that of a mother whose son is suddenly taken away.

Turn and hope Available for free on the App Store, Shadows Remain is only the first part of an experience that Halfbrick Studios intends to offer in episodes, testing the ground to avoid using excessive resources within a courageous and original project. Once the scenario has been positioned according to the typical augmented reality modalities, the opening sequences of the game show a woman who receives a strange phone call from her husband and realizes that her son has disappeared, taken away by a mysterious evil force. In an attempt to find it, the protagonist herself finds herself projected into a sort of parallel reality, perhaps in the past of the house she lives in and which has evidently been the backdrop to a terrible tragedy. So are those ghosts who look out from time to time in the mirrors and seem to animate puppets? +5 To find out, we'll have to find a series of clues in each room, rotating the view with our fingers and moving the iOS terminal to literally navigate within the scenario, looking for different points of view. This mechanic is undoubtedly the aspect of Shadows Remain with the greatest potential, and it is therefore a pity that the developers have exploited it less than necessary, carrying out the story in a more traditional and predictable way than we would have expected. The little credible recitation in English, the very nature of the application and its excessive brevity did the rest, removing tension and restlessness from an experience that should have been based precisely on these elements to convince. It's a pity, but the last word has not been said: with the second chapter, Halfbrick Studios is still in time to find the right path and perhaps be more daring, making convinced use of a technology that certainly has something to say, accompanied as in this case from an excellent technical realization.", "date": "2017-12-16", "grade": "7.0"}
