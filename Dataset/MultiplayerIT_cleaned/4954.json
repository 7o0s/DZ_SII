This is what plausibly happened to many of us, even if we only really became aware of it after the launch trailer for PaRappa the Rapper Remastered shown during the last PlayStation Experience, where a young boy enjoys this splendid PlayStation classic first in his bedroom as a teenager in 1996 and twenty years later with his two children. It's obviously not the first time that the slim Sony mascot has popped up here and there as the first game was followed by a spin-off, a sequel, an animated series and the very respectable presence of the protagonist in the roster of PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. And yet, contrary to what happened to us, which is useless to deny that we have grown up (~grown up~ is a more delicate way of saying that we have aged), PaRappa does not seem to have blamed the past twenty years and returns armed with his unmistakable optimism on PlayStation consoles for reliving his very first adventure as if it were the first time, to remind us once again how unique his flow is. Missing the 90s? PaRappa the Rapper Remastered is ready to cure this nostalgia with Rap! Beat and flow As much as this little pearl is loved by the public, not everyone knows it, so before dealing with what was added to the title on the occasion of the Remastered, let's briefly explore the game dynamics. In this bizarre rhythm game, the adventure advances through a progression of stages, within which the player must perfectly emulate the flow of the rap master on duty, playing the role of PaRappa. Each stage (six in total) is in turn made up of five different lessons which progressively increase in difficulty and each phase of the level is made up of a question and answer between the teacher and the player: for each rhyme of the non-player character, represented by a bar at the top of the screen corresponds to PaRappa's answer. The rhymes are concretely composed of a series of keys (triangle, circle, cross, square, right dorsal and left dorsal) that the player must press in time to make PaRappa ~speak~; those who have never tried it will surely be thinking that we are dealing with a very limited game but those who have played it, on the other hand, know very well that this is not the case. In fact, all the gameplay is not based simply on pressing the keys ~in time~ at the exact moment they appear on the screen, but it is pressing them in rhythm with the music tracks that makes the difference. In fact, the indication of the buttons to press mainly serves to show the correct sequence and is rendered graphically to direct PaRappa, but the rhythm with which the rhyme is composed is at the discretion of the player. For this reason pressing all the keys correctly is not automatically synonymous with a high score and even if you are apparently doing ~everything right~ your ~U Rappin'~ points counter could go down. In the lower part of the screen, in addition to the subtitles completely in Italian (the audio is always in English), there is a four-item list and the points counter. Cool, Good, Bad and Awful are the criteria by which the game will calculate your score: finishing the stage in Cool and Good you will go to the next one, finishing it in Bad you will have to repeat it and as soon as you finish in Awful the stage will stop and start all over again . If you keep a high score you will always be in the Good level but if you want to break the points barrier and aim for the Cool level you will have to put your heart into it by experimenting with your personal flow. This is the essence of the gameplay of PaRappa the Rapper: the Remastered fortunately respects it faithfully and the game feedback is the same as twenty years ago, without adding any extra ... at least, not to the game dynamics. Playstation 4 trophies To win the platinum trophy you must first collect twenty-seven trophies between gold, bronze and silver. In fact, the total amounts to twenty-eight, but don't be fooled by the modest number because to platinum PaRappa the Rapper Remastered you will have to roll up your sleeves and get busy. Except for a handful of secret trophies, most are unlocked by completing the various levels in different ways: any result on normal difficulty, good result on normal difficulty, Cool result on normal difficulty. Something new This review, as we mentioned, leaves the gaming experience unchanged but adds some decidedly interesting extras that can be found by sifting through the menu item. The first screen is made up of two different rows of options where from left to right we find the language, the record index, options, practice, select level, replay and load game: these last two points of the menu refer directly to the manual save that the game always offers at the end of a successfully completed level. The options item, on the other hand, refers in turn to another menu screen where you can find the new features inserted specifically for the occasion. Still navigating the screen from left to right, we find two panels dedicated to graphic resolution and difficulty, where you can respectively choose between 3:4 or 16:9 and a difficulty level between easy and normal. Perhaps the most interesting part of the Remastered is condensed in the row of options below and we find Hear the Beat, See the Beat, extra songs and help. Leaving aside the last point which simply represents the game manual, the rest are little goodies that justify the celebration of the anniversary, even if the extra songs are not exactly new. In fact, before landing on PlayStation 4 this game saw a previous revision for portable consoles where a multiplayer mode for four players was added plus a series of add-ons that offered new music tracks for the six stages of the game. These have thus been included in the recent Remastered for a total of four different variants for the first stage and only one alternative for each other level of the adventure. What really struck us is the ~Feel the Beat~ item, a simple mode that introduces the vibration during the stages: while you play, the pad will emit vibrations following the master's flow and increasing in intensity right at the emphasis points of the verse, then leaving a moment of stillness on PaRappa's track which will be marked by our inputs. Perhaps it's too far-fetched to talk about an accessibility feature for people with severe disabilities, but this is undoubtedly a clever addition that can make the game more enjoyable for those with mild vision and hearing impairments. A party that doesn't take off Speaking of a similar work, it is also important to highlight the technical upgrade compared to the original: the game supports dynamic 4k for PlayStation 4 Pro while the stage scenarios have been completely restored, keeping the original design unchanged. From a graphic point of view, the factor that is most exalted is perhaps the chromatic one because the color rendering is really excellent, even if the most enjoyable technical improvement is obviously that of the audio sector. Negative note, however, on the non-interactive part of the title because the care taken in improving the game scenarios is not visible for the cut-scenes, which remain in their frame with an unchanged resolution, we presume, to that of the 2007 port... and the glance is really ugly since the background of the frame in which the movies are projected is in high resolution. Another sore point is the longevity: remaining unchanged, the game offers the same duration as the original which, including the animated scenes, is less than an hour. Obviously the extra tracks, scores and trophies increase the hours of play but everything is quite similar to what the PlayStation 4 version of the sequel also offers, available in HD since December 2015 on the PlayStation Store, yet sold for a slightly lower price . The problem is not the price, mind you, but given the occasion of the twentieth anniversary we would have preferred more content even if that would have meant a higher price... Since PaRappa the Rapper 2 was already available why not add it to the package, perhaps with the lesser-known spin-off Um Jammer Lammy? Here, it seems like a bit of a wasted opportunity.", "date": "2017-04-04", "grade": "7.5"}
