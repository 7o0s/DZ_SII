After granting the legendary Firebird the rights to convert R-type to C64, Amiga and all the popular formats about fifteen years ago and developing, obviously on his own, the sequels (the third exclusively for Snes and in the conversion for Game Boy Advance is coming), Irem has slowly disappeared from the gaming sector, except for Undercover Cops (nice scrolling fighting game, mutilated in the conversion for Snes of the obligatory 2-player mode) and the difficult shooter In The Hunt ( highly appreciated in the Playstation and Saturn versions). Year 2002, Irem makes its debut in the difficult and tangled 128-bit console market with the adventure Zettai Zetsumei Toshi (confined, at least for now, to the Japanese market only) and the atypical shooter named Sub Rebellion (Underwater Unit in Japan ). Will he be able to revive the illustrious glories of the past? The background: In The Hunt fans (like the editor of said article) get ready, since although we cannot speak of an official sequel, the Sub Rebellion present here could very well be the spin-off of the nice shooter Irem, taking shreds plot from Hostile Waters of Rage (coincidentally, also equipped with an advanced submarine): due to a terrible event, the globe is completely (or almost) submerged by water, decreeing the killing of the majority of lives human beings of the Earth and the loss (although not complete) of the technological level, until then with great difficulty achieved. About fifteen years later, mankind is now moving from one area to another using submarines, similar (so to speak) to our dear old cars, without knowing that a faction of shady individuals was about to make the coup, or proclaim themselves The Empire and subjugate the world. As per script, the few rebels organize themselves accordingly to give life to the Alliance, bearer of the ideal of liberation of humanity from this scum of madmen. As the hero, aboard the powerful Chronos submarine, you will have to bring down the Empire, through 23 missions of anxiety, fear, strategy, reflection and pure blasting (and go!). Fun? Sub Rebellion is an arcade and it certainly doesn't have to struggle to prove it but it does give a few winks to the simulators: in addition to moving the Chronos left and right (left analog pad), as well as using the 2 types of shots at our disposal, it is essential manage the running speed and constantly keep an eye on the navigation depth with the 4 back buttons of the Sony Dual Shock 2. Like aircraft simulators, it is possible to shoot down the various types of enemies with an underwater machine gun, with truly marked efficiency only in the event of an enemy in a frontal position with respect to our vehicle and the classic search missiles (read torpedoes), although there slightly less effective than usual: it is really difficult, especially at the beginning, to easily take down our opponents, if you ~lock~ and shoot an enemy too far away or in the semblance of moving suddenly. After all, Sub Rebellion is a shooter, as mentioned a few lines ago, much less chaotic than so-to-speak genuine shoot'em'ups, generating a game action based mainly on calm and perfect aim: although there is a sonar ( capable of sending wireframe screens to video in order to identify the Empire's henchmen or any hidden treasures that increase the money raised at the end of each stage), the player, wrapped in the darkness of the sea, feels in constant anguish ( as if we were in the various Alien Vs Predator), not knowing where the attacks come from. Fun? Furthermore, the missions (as happened in Namco's nice Ace Combat 4), never reveal completely (or at least not all) what one can fully expect, starting to do research or patrol certain areas, ending with heavy blasting that would make even the good old In The Hunt, always from Irem, jealous. Gameplay, therefore, atypical, certainly to be tested thoroughly, although the vast majority of hardcore shooter fans could feel, how to say, betrayed. Graphics and sound Graphically, we are faced with the classic two-sided coin: on the one hand we have a fascinating underwater setting created with care, where huge submerged buildings stand out, disintegrated bridges, submarines ranging from modest to abnormal which frantically spew out all their power of fire at your time, special effects (occasionally) well implemented and some impressive end-of-level bosses; the other side of the coin contains mediocre textures, with an exaggeratedly low definition, a sometimes disappointing number of polygons, a not exactly accentuated variety of stages (also disappointing are the, few, outdoor sections) and, coup de grace, an engine graphic designer unable to handle the already unacceptable (for the graphic quality, far from exciting) 25 frames per second, as if that weren't enough, far from stable, on the occasion of real rains of fire. Graphics and sound Finally, trivial and not excellent quality music, combined with sound effects of the same level (with very few exceptions), conclude the technical side, far from exciting, of Sub Rebellion. Conclusions The return of a historical brand like Irem was not, unfortunately, as could be expected: like Zettai Zetsumei Toshi already, Sub Rebellion also misses the set target, due to a mediocre technical realization and gameplay, at the beginning for sure interest, thanks to its atypical nature, but tending quickly to repetitive and unrewarding, despite the fact that it is really difficult to solve all the missions included in the videogame package in question, due to the replayability deriving from wanting to find all the artifacts hidden in the various levels. Provided that someone actually engages in this enterprise . Pros: At first it captivates Very long-lived Cons: technically poor It can lead to repetitiveness R-Type's mom is back! Shooter enthusiasts have been waiting for this moment for years: Irem, the software house that developed that masterpiece called R-Type, is back among us. For all under 20s, R-Type was a horizontal scrolling shooter that revolutionized the genre thanks to the use of a support pod, very original weapons for the time (bouncing laser and the loadable beam in primis) and some of the guardians of end of the biggest and baddest level of the videogame.", "date": "2002-10-24", "grade": null}
