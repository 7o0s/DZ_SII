You can count on your fingertips the Japanese titles that manage to reach the West without sinking under the weight of the ~niche titles~ label, games that are (often) valid but bought by four people in total. Not so for the Yo-Kai Watch series: two official chapters plus a reissue in less than five years, not counting manga, anime, toys and various accessories. Level-5's little son managed to reproduce some of the magic of the Pokmon series, without entering into competition with it, thanks to a more accentuated RPG heart, greater freedom in the exploration of the environments and a decidedly refined technical sector. Yo-Kai Watch 2: Psychospectres offers itself as the definitive experience of the second chapter, as well as as a summary of all that the series has to offer. We then went back to wandering around Valdoro and its surroundings in the company of Nathan, Whisper and Jibanyan: below is the psycho-verdict. Perfect for newcomers Let's clarify the concept: the time has not yet arrived for Yo-Kai Watch 3. The title that you will soon be able to have in your hands is instead an enriched edition of Yo-Kai Watch 2: Spiritossi e Pulpanime, published last spring always in exclusive to the Nintendo 3DS family. This means that the plot of Yo-Kai Watch 2 Psychic Specters will be the same. Indeed, almost the same. Already in Spiritossi e Polpanime, through small choices along the way (like the taste of a couple of brioches), it was possible to slightly vary some details of the events. The possibility returns in Psychic Specters, enriched with minor variations in the appearance and speech of the main characters. The real innovations, however, are those in terms of content, to which we will return shortly. In any case, Psychic Specters plays the role of a self-contained chapter, perfect for introducing newbies to the world of Yo-Kai without suffering trauma. During the first hour of the game, through the narrative mechanism of deja-vu, you pretend to forget everything that happened in the first chapter of the series: the player gets to know Nathan for the first time, a nice little boy who soon comes into possession (or better, get it back) of the Yo-Kai Watch. It is a device similar to a clock, whose lens allows you to see the invisible creatures called Yo-Kai, prankster and mischievous spirits that populate our world. Some of them, however, have slightly more ambitious and less noble aims than others, and our hero will soon learn this the hard way. After five hours of what represents a long and at times dull tutorial, dedicated to learning all the game mechanics and the characteristics of the little monsters, the story of Yo-Kai Watch 2 starts to mesh and buys bonus points in terms of variety and possibility as it progresses towards its climax. The veterans of the series will turn up their noses believing that everything they knew has been abruptly erased, but the deja-vu is functional to an introduction to the game world of Level-5 that is affordable and understandable for everyone, even for The smallest. The beauty, of course, comes later, once you start to master the mechanics, and consolidate into an incredibly long-lived post game made up of battles, collecting and side missions. Catcher make friends with everyone! The heart of Yo-Kai Watch 2 lies in the role-playing component of the production and in the collecting factor. We are only in the second chapter of the series and the Yo-Kai have already exceeded three hundred specimens, almost all with a refined and immediately recognizable design. The completionists will have their work cut out trying to find them all and fill the album of invisible creatures that will be provided to us at the beginning of the adventure. Psychospectres also puts his own with the welcome addition of the fifteen ghost-type Yo-Kai, the first exclusive of Japanese players. But the Yo-Kai, we mentioned it at the beginning, apart from the exorbitant number and the possibility of powering up by leveling up and transforming, have little else in common with Pokmon. First of all, they don't necessarily hide in the tall grass, but they can slip practically anywhere, from Pulishido who infests garbage cans to Jibanyan who has a passion for busy intersections with trucks. Furthermore, the sprites cannot be captured: only the strength of friendship will be able to entice them to join our team. Furthermore, many of them, at the time of the first meeting, will simply ignore us and will not want to have a chat even after being defeated in battle, an almost always essential condition for recruiting them. It's in the combat system, however, that Yo-Kai Watch breaks new ground for RPGs on Nintendo 3DS. In fact, our heroes will fight alone, in real time: it is up to us to deploy them with criteria on the field to unleash their full potential, based on their type and their eight tribes of origin, as well as deciding which enemy to direct the attacks against. We will also be able to load the special attack with which each of them is equipped, game stylus in hand, by performing simple QTEs. It is possible to deploy up to a maximum of three creatures on the field at a time, and the attacks of adjacent ones will suffer bonuses (or malus) based on their type. Special attacks can also be combined into devastating but strategically dangerous executions: the sprites will be left without defenses for a certain period of time. For the record, Yo-Kai don't have to fight and don't always feel like fighting. Sometimes they prefer to hang around merrily for a few shifts. The strategic component is enriched thanks to a large number of consumables available in the inventory, with which we will be able to spur them on, enhance them and heal them. Or we will be able to feed the opposing Yo-Kai with them... who knows, impressed by our generosity, they will not decide to become team members. After bones and souls come ghosts, with lots of new features Yo-Kai Watch 2 does not return to store shelves empty-handed: as can be understood from the subtitle Psychospectres and the fascinating and unlikely Dark Jibanyan on the cover, Nintendo has enriched the offer with a fair amount of additional content. A further convergent step towards the Pokmon series, but if you believe that it is a mere commercial move or the classic collector's package, you are very wrong. First of all, the plot gets a small positive boost in variety and duration thanks to the introduction of twelve new missions, one of which, in particular, will explore the origins of the mysterious Darknyan. Then there are new places to explore in what is in effect an already vast game map, so vast as to require the use of public transport for travel: among the most significant additions, the Gera Gera village it will take a lot of time to be explored in every nook and cranny. And of course yes, there are also new sprites to find and make friends, for a total of fifteen ghostly Yo-Kai. To be honest, they are not completely new creatures: they already appeared in Spiritossi and Pulpanime, but while before they only appeared as opponents to be defeated, now they can become team members and enrich Nathan's collection of spirits. And if this reissue still doesn't convince you, Spiritossi still has a couple of arrows left to his bow. The first: an enrichment of the Yo-Kai Busters mode, dedicated to local multiplayer, now expanded in terms of mechanics and with new bosses to face. The second, which will delight those who have already purchased the game versions of last spring: having the saved data of Spiritossi and Pulpanime available, you will be able to unlock a new themed dungeon within Psychospectres. This means access to more additional (and exclusive) bosses to battle, and even more Yo-Kai to befriend. And if you don't have a cartridge available, don't despair, you can always take advantage of the data saved on a friend's console.", "date": "2017-09-29", "grade": "8.8"}
