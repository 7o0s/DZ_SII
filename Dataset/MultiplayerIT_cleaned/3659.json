{"name": "Redout", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/redout-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "The futuristic racing game is now almost a genre in its own right, well structured and codified by years of tradition, starting from F-Zero to get to the refinement path of Wipeout up to the recent indie productions that recover its concepts and mechanics. Considering the closure of Studio Liverpool which does not bode well for the future of the old Psygnosis series and the absolute silence of Nintendo regarding F-Zero, all the expectations of fans of this genre - which are also varied - now focus on indie productions , among which it is still possible to find real heirs of this particular tradition, especially in recent years. Among the most interesting proposals recently released is Redout, the protagonist of this review and a game also produced in Italy by the young 34BigThings team, which finally also reached the Nintendo Switch version after a conversion path that was not at all easy and immediate. The game has already been analyzed in depth at the time of its first release on PC and is re-proposed in this new edition substantially equivalent in structural terms, equal to the Enhanced Edition in terms of content and therefore presenting itself as the complete experience by Redout, containing all the DLC and add-ons available for the other editions. The publisher Nicalis had initially announced the release for the launch of Nintendo Switch and instead we find ourselves having it in our hands two years later, just to make us understand the complexity of the path crossed by the developers. 34BigThings made no secret of the thing, underlining the numerous technical challenges they had to face to transport everything to Nintendo's hybrid console and perhaps even risking having to completely cancel the project, given the considerable lengthening of the times. In the end, the mission is accomplished and it is also of considerable impact, considering the context in which it is found and the intensive use of the Unreal Engine placed at the service of a racing game that puts speed above all else. Inordinate speed For the basic features of Redout, we refer you to the review by Luca Olivato, published almost three years ago on these pages and relating to the first PC version. Since then the game has gone through an Enhanced edition and further evolutions, coming to offer in this Nintendo Switch version a total of 60 tracks that extend across 12 different environments, 28 vehicles, 11 types of races and 100 events for the Career in single player. Beyond all these numbers, the game experience can be summarized in different variants of standard racing against opponents or the clock, with additions provided by any obstacles on the track, absence of respawns, direct elimination, multiplayer and the presence or absence of power-ups. In total, however, the variety of situations in which you find yourself is remarkable, also considering the fact that a game of this kind often (and this is the case) relies above all on the dynamics of the driving model, on the exaltation given by the extreme speed and on the ability to drive the vehicle as cleanly as possible, all things that can very well also be found in the simple time attack. However, everything else provides a nice variety of racing experiences, enhanced by the Career mode and the progression system that favors single player commitment and experimentation with all the various types of race in order to unlock new vehicles and tracks as you progress through the game . All of Redout's gameplay is obviously expressed on the track, darting at over a thousand kilometers per hour and ringing perfect trajectories, seeking absolute mastery of the vehicle. This is achieved with practice and experience because it requires control of various elements: standard steering, inclination on the longitudinal axis when cornering, ~pitch~ or fluctuation on the horizontal axis, drifting, but also the strategic choice of active and passive power-ups, all elements that go hand in hand with a continuous learning of the characteristics of the tracks. From this point of view Redout behaves admirably, offering a deep and reasoned driving model, as well as a remarkable design of the tracks, aesthetically very beautiful although in some cases a bit anonymous (we notice a certain lack of branches, special conditions or possible shortcuts). The driving system and vehicle management therefore offer different interpretations, immediate and satisfactory already in the early stages but with the need to study its characteristics well in order to be truly competitive: and with the amount of content to unlock there is necessarily also very dto learn, to the full advantage of longevity. An unexpected result Given the bumpy development path and the fact that Redout hasn't really stood out in the past for very solid performance in all conditions, especially as regards the frame-rate, the final result of this Nintendo Switch version is almost surprising. The game remains locked to 30 frames per second in both handheld and docked modes, which is quite remarkable considering that the standard console versions and especially the Xbox One have exhibited quite a few fluctuations (even at the base Xbox One's criticized 30fps) . It is clear that the past has allowed 34BigThings to better refine the engine and focus everything - rightly - on fluidity even at the expense of visual quality. In fact, from this last point of view, the Nintendo Switch version is behind the others, with the dynamic resolution that drops dramatically especially in portable mode and, combined with the ~low poly~ look of the game, often tends to confuse the figures on screen, even if the elements that matter - the main shuttle and the edges of the runway - are still clearly visible. This creates a strange mixture of colors in the most agitated and fast situations which is not exactly pleasant to see, even on the TV with the console in the dock, although the extreme speed helps not to pay too much attention to the details. Considering that the frame-rate remains stable and equivalent to that visible with the console in the dock, the portable mode still manages to offer the full experience and the compromises in terms of image quality can be bearable also given the scarcity of similar games on Nintendo Switch. Few competitors but decidedly aggressive from a technical point of view, if we consider that Fast RMX is able to offer 1080p and 60 frames per second almost constant, although with a generally lower graphic complexity than Redout. It is a comparison that leaves its time, considering that the 34BigThings game also focuses on different characteristics, with a driving model that is certainly more complex and profound than that of Shin'en, but it is right to push the Italian developers to do even more on Switch, perhaps with a next chapter of Redout. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is really excellent, which continues in the tradition of the genre but also introduces interesting rock and even country hybridizations, bringing out truly remarkable pieces capable of perfectly underlining the action on the screen.", "date": "2019-05-22", "grade": "7.6"}
