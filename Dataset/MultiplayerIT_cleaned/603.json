{"name": "Guilty Gear -Strive-: la recensione dell'atteso picchiaduro di Arc System", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guilty-gear-strive-recensione.html", "text": "Fighting games are at an inflection point. It is a simple evolutionary necessity: aware of how difficult it is to spread the word of virtual blows among the mass of gamers, due to the complexity that distinguishes the genre, many renowned developers have been trying to soften it for years, with the clear desire to open the doors even to those who have normally always looked the other way. However, such a step is easier said than done... an oversimplified title does not have sufficiently layered mechanics to capture the historical fanbase and quickly loses its appeal, while on the other hand, an intervention that is too marginal to the systems leads the ability barrier to rise rapidly, excluding all newbies within a few months. The main objective in operations of this type, therefore, becomes the achievement of a perfect point of equilibrium: the creation of an immediately enjoyable system, but at the same time so well calculated as to offer even those who want to explore it in depth a sea of possibilities . For their part, the Arc Systems have already made quite successful experiments in this field: Dragon Ball FighterZ (despite its speed and extreme technicality at high levels) greatly simplifies the execution of inputs and can be approached without too many problems by anyone, wherever Granblue Fantasy Versus manages to get around the inaccessibility problem with shortcuts for moves and an easy to understand classic system. Now, however, the well-known team of fighting game luminaries has decided to put on the table an incomparable load to what has been done in the past, with the new chapter of one of their most beloved series. The game is predictably called Guilty Gear -Strive- and dares to transform according to the canons described above a system that has been capable of capturing an extremely passionate (and vocal) community over the years. Today, after playing it for a long time, we are ready to tell you in the Guilty Gear -Strive- review if we think they hit the mark. History Given what has just been said, it is quite clear how the combat system decides or not the overall quality - and the probability of prolonged survival - of Strive. Yet the work of Arc System rests on a narrative background of rare complexity, practically incomprehensible to anyone who has never approached the saga. Eager to carry it forward and aware of not being able to release a fighting game completely devoid of modes outside of online battles, the developers have therefore worked on a spectacular story mode, which follows the same structure as Xrd and Revelator. Put simply, Strive's story mode is a long anime that takes advantage of the game engine and tries to close the huge lump of events that the previous chapters have formed. It's not interactive in any way (outside of being able to save during cutscenes) and is really only there for those who enjoy the Guilty Gear universe. Clearly this is a solution designed to ensure that those interested only in the competitive element can ignore everything without regrets; for all the others, however, something more elaborate would not have been bad, perhaps with special battles scattered here and there just to give the illusion of a decent single-player mode. Guilty Gear -Strive-: Nagoryuki prepares to fight In our opinion it is in fact a wasted opportunity, because where Xrd had at least the M.O.M. Mode (a series of singleplayer fights with the growth of one's alter ego and equippable skills), Guilty Gear -Strive- from this point of view is really skin and bones and, outside of the inevitable battles against the CPU, offers exclusively a survival mode not particularly inspired or original. If nothing else, the Arcs seem to have taken a step back from the initial statements related to the tutorial, which many feared to be very limited in this chapter. In reality, the solution adopted by the team was to insert each explanation in the Missions, which represent the new real guide for those who want to learn the title system and offer repeated exercises that explore each mechanic, from the simplest to the most advanced. Guilty Gear -Strive-: Chipp performs a Roman Cancel As far as the actual quality of the plot is concerned, an impartial evaluation is quite difficult. The Arcs are not exactly writing luminaries and in the Strive campaign there is no shortage of dialogue pulled by the ears, clichs, excesses of exposition, and fairly predictable events (moreover, an Italian localization that is anything but impeccable does not help the immersion). Nonetheless, the story is at times spardent, worthily rhythmic and full of fanservice done properly, so we do not doubt that some longtime fans will be able to appreciate it despite its flaws. Furthermore, the game contains a very valid compendium of information, which shows the links between the various characters with (messy) tables and almost always explains in detail who it is (it can also be accessed during the movies). Combat system As we have already highlighted just now, however, in Guilty Gear -Strive- the fundamental thing is the gameplay, precisely because of the revolutions implemented by the Arc Systems to what was the perceived system of Guilty Gear with this chapter. Attention, that ~perceived~ is simply linked to the fact that Guilty Gear, like most of the other historical series in the genre, vary significantly from game to game, mainly maintaining guidelines considered by the fanbase as integral and essential parts of the brand . Strive, on the other hand, initially seemed to want to distance itself so much from the past that it seemed like a completely different fighting game, and as you can well imagine the pill did not go down gracefully to many veteran players. And, let's be honest, on the one hand it is true: Guilty Gear -Strive- completely changes the approach to corners, the management of okizeme (basically the pressure on the opponent when he is knocked down), and even distorts the ~gatling~ - the fixed combos of the various characters that represent an element badge of Guilty for a lifetime - yet it miraculously manages to keep much of its original spirit alive with a series of conscious choices, which also refer to some of the original chapters of the saga. Guilty Gear -Strive-: Axl is a constant danger from a distance But first let's go into more detail about the new mechanics, because even if they are unique, these are not elements inserted into the system at random, but integrated precisely to make the experience less frustrating for newbies without ruining it for experts. The wall break is, for example, a piece of the puzzle that must be absolutely analysed, since now hitting an opponent several times at the edge of the arena leads to ~crushing~ him on an invisible wall that breaks with the next attack, and brings the fight back into a situation of parity. Already this choice, predictably, has triggered various complaints, since for obvious reasons it limits the pressure in the corner and eliminates much of the advantage for those who are particularly good at carrying out a constant offensive; only...that's exactly the point. In fact, there is nothing more frustrating for a new player than being held to the edge of the screen throughout a match and forced to defend perfectly while waiting for a tiny response window. Precisely for this Strive puts in place a mechanic that guarantees at least one reset of the situation by putting things roughly even again, and making games against those who are more aggressive less frustrating. If we consider that the game also has a mechanic that allows you to break combos at least once per game called Burst, Guilty Gear -Strive- guarantees at least two chances of recovery per match when you play with a fair cunning, and is therefore more welcoming for those who want to learn. That wasn't enough, it's not true that it is a completely limiting mechanic for those who love non-stop assaults: breaking the wall not only allows you to maximize the damage of certain combinations, but guarantees a great voltage bar recharge bonus, and in this title with this source of energy it is possible to do so many things that in all likelihood it is always better to aim for broken lines rather than artificial maintenance of position. For the record, the game allows various characters to maintain pressure in other ways with partial loops and absurd repositioning, but the core of Arc System's reasoning remains the one just described and, in all honesty, we believe that the choice made makes their last creature much funnier. Technical gorilla Speaking of tension, this energy bar practically represents a turbo boost within the combat system when used. Load 50% of it - with a constant offensive force or even simply by moving towards the opponent - and you can use a super, or the distinctive mechanics of Guilty Gear: the Roman Cancels, as easy to explain as they are complicated to use properly. To all intents and purposes, these are maneuvers that exploit tension to cancel an animation, so as to immediately allow the execution of a new action; based on when they are used they change color, and with color their usefulness also changes. The beauty is that their usefulness is almost unlimited: qureds allow you to perform normally impossible combos after hitting a hit, purples allow you to continue attacking safely or move away after a parried attack, blues allow you to avoid the vulnerability of missed shots and yellows allow you to gain defense advantages during the attack of the enemy; only that in Strive the Roman Cancels have been further improved with time slowing effects (provided they are activated in the vicinity of the enemy) which facilitate the execution of the moves, and allow you to do impossible (or simply very difficult) things naturally in most past Guilty Gear. Guilty Gear -Strive-: Potemkin says no to dolphins And if you think that's all you are wrong, because in addition to all the features listed above the Roman Cancels also retain the movement commands entered before their execution - which reposition your character, ensure to confuse the opponent or perform series of hallucinatory blows - or they can even be canceled in turn with an attack, a feature that makes them work like in the first Guilty Gear (without the ~slowdown~ facilitation) and leads to maintaining an unnatural aerial acceleration in some cases. In short, their applications are numerous and fabulous, and in a high-level game of Guilty Gear -Strive- it is possible to see flashes of genius that few other combat systems are able to support. normal moves, since as we mentioned at the beginning of the review in Guilty Gear -Strive- the ~gatlings~ have changed, to be replaced by less harmful and exploitable mini-combos (light punches, for example, cannot be linked to other moves by most part of the characters). It is a practical necessity, because if connecting fast hits to damaging combos were a walk, Roman Cancels would become even easier to exploit, but the limitation of the base combos actually limits the possibilities of an offensive approach a bit. However, it is certainly not enough to ruin the experience: there are another sea of defensive and offensive mechanics in the game that contribute to enriching the whole, and the very high damage guarantees rather rapid games that flow without problems. In addition, we do not believe that the choice of calibrating the damage upwards is wrong: in addition to giving a little extra spice to everything, it is a system that refers to titles such as Guilty Gear +R - where the most devastating combos were all 'just check - except that here it seems to make more sense due to the limitations on the tension free combos. Jump what passes you Curious, however, that the Arc System have managed to create such an apparently granite combat system now of the end, considering that from the betas they had seemed rather confused regarding some aspects. Consider, in fact, that until the end the team was undecided on the issue of movement, modified here due to the different functioning of the aerial shutter (initially it also had variable trajectories and was nothing short of unpredictable), a rather limited backdash and a shorter jump arc than other Guilty Gear, not counting a few fall recovery frames. They may seem small, but in a series that has always been characterized by the many movement options and its speed, it didn't take long for the community to complain about a certain general slowness. So, after gathering some feedback from the last beta done, the software house has decided to opt for a good middle ground: improved jumps and less delay in the start of the sprint, while maintaining the fall recovery and backdash ~ short~. The final result, probably also due to the flexibility of the Roman Cancels, is a title where the mobile characters are in any case splinters, difficult to predict, and the offensive from above is powerful without being excessive (which was the reason for the limitations). Guilty Gear -Strive-: Chipp is my president The circumstance capable of making us really happy, if nothing else, was the will of the Arc Systems not to exaggerate with the nerfs - that is, the weakening of the characters deemed too powerful - also because, given the variety of the mechanics and the youth of the game, at the at the moment it is almost impossible to evaluate the real strength of each character outside of the simplest ones to use (which is why Sol is currently considered a sort of monster). The fear stemmed from the possible elimination of the various fighters' tools, which would have meant more balance, to the detriment of variety and fun. Thankfully, after making that choice in the second beta, the Arcs backtracked", "date": "2021-06-08", "grade": "8.5"}
