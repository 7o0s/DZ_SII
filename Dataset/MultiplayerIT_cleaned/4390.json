Here on Multiplayer.it we welcomed it as it deserved, firstly publishing the review of the PC version, where we were able to appreciate its strengths and weaknesses. The evaluation article was then followed by a special dedicated to the setting of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, to analyze its historical location which, together with some design choices, has not failed to raise some controversy in recent days. There is therefore still a lot to say about the project funded with over one million pounds (which has multiplied over the months) on Kickstarter, without forgetting the world of consoles. In addition to PC, Kingdom Come: Deliverance has in fact also arrived on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, thus prompting us to take a look at how it behaves when we have a controller in our hands instead of the mouse and keyboard combination. To return to the Middle Ages again we resorted to the Sony-branded console: here is our review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance for PlayStation 4. Life in the Middle Ages We have already dedicated all the space it deserves to the plot of Kingdom Come: Deliverance in the review of the PC version, which can be reached at the link in the introduction. By virtue of this, in this new article dedicated to the PlayStation 4 version of the game, we will limit ourselves only to making a brief refresh on some elements, referring you to what was previously published to learn more about this and other aspects that do not find changes in the transition from PC to console . The year is 1403 while the place is the Kingdom of Bohemia, where we find ourselves in the role of Henry, the son of a simple blacksmith who will soon end up involved in the middle of the struggle for the throne: Sigismund of Hungary has indeed invaded the lands passed from the late Charles IV to Wenceslaus IV, nicknamed Lazy and not exactly frowned upon. Kingdom Come: Deliverance makes realism its main aspect, starting from the setting: although it may look like Skyrim or The Witcher at first glance, Warhorse Studios' effort does not bring dragons or mutant beings with it, limiting itself to telling a story placed in a precise scenario of Europe that was. For a very specific choice linked to the same context, the player starts in the role of a character already completely defined in the physical aspect, however having the possibility of influencing his growth in various aspects, destined to define his way of approaching other people and the inevitable quests. There are so many factors to take into account while playing Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and thus they define a series of alternative paths that allow the player to continue following different paths. Never forget to stay full and rested, to avoid nasty surprises: after all, realism also means eating to sustain one's efforts and staying wide awake, an important factor in a dangerous era like the Middle Ages. My sword is the controller The game mechanics of Kingdom Come: Deliverance have lights and shadows, with the latter mainly related to the bugs currently present in the code. The level of realism desired by the developers sets very specific stakes, which however pay for their ambition when you find yourself dealing with some game dynamics. The lock picking mechanism is certainly the most complicated one, and as noted in the review of the PC version, there is no escaping it even with a DualShock in hand. If your intention is to become experienced thieves in Kingdom Come: Deliverance, know that you will have to arm yourself with holy patience, or at least wait for the patch already promised by Warhorse Studios to solve the problems that afflict these dynamics. Fortunately, there are alternative ways to obtain what is necessary to move forward: on balance, the art of speaking is certainly the one that currently guarantees the best yield, as unfortunately even combat has various limits. Primarily among these we find a management of the R2 key that is not exactly optimal, which leads Henry to deliver blows late, or worse still not to move at all. An aspect to be reviewed with a certain urgency, given that in phases where defense and attack alternate, losing the right time seriously risks punishing the player. Also because the level of challenge presented by the fight phases of Kingdom Come: Deliverance is still high, as realism dictates: in the event that you find yourself facing multiple enemies without having allies on your side, run away like hell. The physicality of the clashes can be improved, while in termini positives it must be said that the use of the controller and its analog sticks improves the management of the starting directions of the blows, considered by many to be too sensitive when using the mouse. Kingdom Come: Deliverance in fact uses a combat system similar to that of For Honor, within which you must choose a starting position to deliver the blow from a precise direction. Playstation 4 trophies The PlayStation 4 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance has a total of fifty trophies. The inevitable platinum-type final recognition is accompanied by two more gold, eleven silver and thirty-six bronze. In case you want to try to get them all, know that it will not be a walk of health at all, and that this will require more than a foray into Henry's story. Many Trophies are linked to aspects of the protagonist's personality, such as his addiction to alcohol or the excessive propensity to overeat, while there is no lack of objectives dedicated to the results obtained in combat. Winning the love of some girls will also bring its bonuses, as well as remaining unsullied until the end of the adventure. Thirst for patches If in terms of narrative and game dynamics between PC and console it changes little, of course it is from a technical point of view that the major differences are noticed. Even before Kingdom Come: Deliverance goes live, we realize that the limitations of the console hardware compared to that of a good PC have their weight: starting the game takes more than a minute. Better to resign yourself to the uploads right away, given that the indicator located in the lower right part of the screen ends up keeping us company often and willingly, even interrupting the game for several seconds. We seriously hope that Warhorse Studios takes the situation head on, streamlining these loading phases that break the pace of the game too much. Hourglasses aside, on PlayStation 4 Pro Kingdom Come: Deliverance looks more than worthy especially when viewed from a distance, with glimpses of medieval life in the village accompanied by beautiful landscapes painted by well-crafted lighting effects. Going into detail, however, we begin to notice the first defects, headed by a share of frames per second which ends up dropping from a maximum of thirty even in not particularly agitated phases. Since the first raids around Skalitz, there have also been problems loading textures that lead to pop-in effects, as well as some glitches that are fortunately harmless in 99.9% of cases. For the rest, the considerations made by analyzing the PC version are valid: since we are not faced with a production of the caliber of The Witcher 3, it must not appear so strange if some models of the secondary characters are not at the level of the primary ones, or if in the dialogues lip-syncing ends up following its own rules. As for the sound, however, what was said in the review of the PC version is valid.", "date": "2018-02-23", "grade": "8.5"}
