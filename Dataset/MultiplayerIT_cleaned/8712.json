We talked about it in a recent Monograph and we also told you about the dramatic divorce from Square, when Sakaguchi abandoned it in 2001 due to the disastrous performances of his cinematic dream, a flop that practically bankrupted one of the most powerful software houses of the nineties . Since then Sakaguchi has worked in Mistwalker, a company that has become famous more for its collaborators, the Gooch in the first place, than for the fluctuating quality of its productions. Among the most famous we remember Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon for Xbox 360, but also a quartet of titles for Nintendo DS: you will therefore understand the importance of a game like The Last Story, a title already melancholic in itself, appropriate for the last months of the life cycle of the Nintendo console. But is the return of Sakaguchi and his team really the incredible success everyone was hoping for? A final fairy tale There is an important premise to make that initially may cause you some confusion, but everything will soon be clear to you: The Last Story is not a real jRPG. Or rather, it is not a jRPG in the sense in which we are used to understanding the most important works of Hironobu Sakaguchi and in fact it is a video game that distances itself quite a bit from its traditional modus operandi. The Last Story is actually a real fairy tale, even told by a narrative voice that brings to mind Peter Falk sitting by Fred Savage's bed with the book in his hand in The Fantastic Story. An excellent prose and excellent dialogues (subtitled in a well-kept Italian) frame an unfortunately excessively banal story, the daughter of clichs to which we have been accustomed for decades, especially in the field of Japanese-style role-playing games. The protagonist, Zael, is a young mercenary on the island of Lazulis, one of the few fertile territories left in the world. With his companions, among which the ~big brother~ Dragan stands out, Zael dreams of becoming a knight and leaving behind a life of misery, solitude and battles; Calista, on the other hand, is the naive niece of Count Arganan, a noble family that dominates Lazulis and who has promised her in marriage to an unbearable and cowardly rich man. The paths of Zael and Calista cross almost immediately and Zael will discover that the mysterious power of the Unknown that he obtained during a mission is doubly linked with the fate of Calista, the island of Lazulis and the world itself. So here's a carousel of clichs: the tormented young hero, the brave girl with a heart of gold, the effeminate and obnoxious unscrupulous nobleman. Absurdly, the two protagonists, around whose love story all forty-four chapters of the story revolve, are undoubtedly the most dull and stereotyped characters of the cast; the supporting actors, especially Zael's group mates with a special mention for the amazing Syrenne, immediately stand out for their peculiar characters and their way of chatting and interacting during explorations and fights, embellished by an intense, distinctly Anglo-Saxon dubbing and high-end. The plot of The Last Story is by no means unpleasant but is unfortunately very predictable and obvious (at least until the final sensational twists) and is told through an all too frequent use of cutscenes, which interrupt the action literally every handful of steps, transforming most of the already small twenty hours needed to complete the main portion of the adventure into a sort of interactive film, in in which the player only occasionally fights, explores and actually controls the actions of Zael and company. This structure weighs down the already frequently slow and cloying script of the Sakaguchi, making some narrative sequences literally soporific, it is no coincidence that it is possible to press a key to directly accelerate or interrupt the unfolding of the cutscenes. The soundtrack was entrusted to a less incisive Nobuo Uematsu than usual: in general, the songs are of superb quality, but the composer's style has a touch this time that is decidedly more ~experimental~ than usual; in fact, the music tends to be contextualized to the events in progress and during the explorations silence often reigns, interrupted only by the sound of our steps or by the chatter of our companions. Consequently there is no song, apart from perhaps the introductory one and the eccentric accompaniment to the final fight, that is truly memorable. An interactive story It is not only the story, fragmented and overtold,to distance itself from the style of the more traditional jRPGs to which Sakaguchi has accustomed us, influencing the development of an entire videogame genre for years. The chapters into which the story is divided play the role of real micro-missions or stages, to use a term more suited to action games, a genre that shares a lot with Mistwalker's latest effort; the player is in fact guided by the hand and led from area to area and from one to the other, in a linear but quite organic development of the events in which Zael and his associates are the protagonists. Forget free exploration, open worlds, free-roaming: when accessible, the map of The Last Story limits itself to showing us already explored locations that are configured as real ~mini-dungeons~ in which enemies meet in fixed points, well defined by the unfolding of the narration and introduced in most cases by the inevitable cutscenes. The player only controls Zael in the third person while his companions, up to a maximum of five, are managed by a decent artificial intelligence. Zael's attacks are launched in real time by repeatedly pressing a button on the controller (a solution that we strongly recommend as an alternative to the default automatic attack) and can be chained into classic combos. By combining the pressure of the correct keys it is possible to equip the crossbow and aim in first person against enemies and elements of the environment which in some cases can be destroyed to obtain precious advantages and inflict collateral damage. The various battlefields offer numerous elements that can be exploited as cover in pure Gears of War or Uncharted style, to name two famous titles: behind cover Zael is hidden from surrounding enemies and can repeatedly use this position to launch devastating surprise attacks . What actually looks like a distinctly action and even a bit trivial combat system is influenced by an important mechanic that gives it a healthy touch of strategy: most of the damage is in fact produced by the devastating spells of the companions and some of them they are essential to heal the group and confer bonuses of great importance. However, the casting time of the spells is damn long and the slightest attack can interrupt the formula, forcing our companions to start the rite from the beginning: therefore the power of the Unknown comes into play which allows Zael to attract the attention of the enemies. In short, the player plays the role of ~bait~, removing the enemies from his companions so that they can recite the magic formulas in peace, taking advantage of the shelters to strike by surprise, confuse the opponents and isolate them at the right time. Furthermore, the spells cast produce luminous circles that can be exploited in a system very similar to that of Tales of the Abyss (PlayStation 2, Nintendo 3DS): an ability of Zael allows in fact to expand the magical effect of the circles, for example by healing all companions on the field or by generating protections and buffs. Within a few hours the fights of The Last Story acquire a considerable strategic depth, unfortunately inexorably affected by the confusion generated by graphic effects, enemies and characters in the fight: also due to a really questionable camera, one often has the feeling of fighting at randomly, attacking in an almost random direction to hit enemies often hidden from our own field of vision by obstacles or unfortunate camera angles. The challenge offered by the enemy forces is also sensationally low, thanks also to the automatic resurrection system which can be exploited up to five times per fight; the situation improves instead in the case of the bosses that we will generally face at the end of each chapter: these enemies must be defeated using particular strategies that exploit their weaknesses or particular combinations of weapons and magic, in a style that is not a little reminiscent of the memorable bosses of The Legend of Zelda and which offers more than satisfactory battles. A controversial story When The Last Story offers the player greater freedom, its nature as a typical jRPG emerges in which the management of equipment, side missions and exploration becomes an activity of great importance. The equipment of the characters, which can be colored at will, can be purchased or found on the battlefield, often chosen randomly by the game through a disturbing roulette system which should, at least in theory, encourage the repetition of the various clashes. Items can be upgraded for cash and materials, and nearly all gain secondary abilities as you upgrade. The mMost of the shops and sidequests are accessible from the main city of the game, an immense hub that is not particularly easy to navigate which also includes the typical arena to test yourself in battles of increasing difficulty. This gameplay circle is closed by a pleasant online multiplayer mode that allows you to face other players in battle as if they were common enemies, or to join them to take down enhanced versions of the most menacing bosses in history: at this juncture The Last Story assumes the identity of a Monster Hunter sui generis, in which it is necessary to dodge enemy attacks and coordinate spells and skills to get the better of the opponents on duty and earn experience levels and rare items at the end of the game otherwise impossible to obtain. It seems clear, at this point, that The Last Story is a game that tries to offer various types of experiences and to break away from the tradition with a different structure and gameplay than usual; unfortunately, however, it only partially succeeds, and this conflict between being and appearing is even clearer through the analysis of a truly fluctuating technical sector. The highly sought-after style and the remarkable attention to detail present in each game screen fight with results that the developer AQ Interactive has decided to achieve without perhaps taking into account the technology available. The visual rendering of The Last Story is a continuous alternation of ups and downs: the polygonal models of characters and enemies are wonderfully accurate and defined, yet they enjoy woody and unrealistic animations, especially in combat, and they move in locations where the contrast between the high resolution reflections of the liquids and the chilling textures applied to surfaces such as walls and floors places the game in an unpleasant limbo halfway between Nintendo Wii and Sony PSP. Probably the most serious problem is characterized by the frequent and heavy frame-rate drops that occur in practically any situation, in combat or during exploration, whether outdoors or indoors. The adoption of multiple lighting effects, shaders and filters of various kinds weighs down the engine frequently and consistently, causing unpleasant slowdowns that are difficult to get used to even after many hours of play. The immediate visual impact is remarkable but the actual results really leave a bad taste in the mouth.", "date": "2012-02-29", "grade": "8.0"}
