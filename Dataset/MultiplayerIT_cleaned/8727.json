Indeed, it is precisely from Canabalt that some of the most famous games on the App Store have found inspiration, and if Electronic Arts also decides to transform Mirror's Edge into a 2D running game, the impact that the one-button game by the Texan developer Adam has had is clear Saltsman. Originally released on PSN in the Mini format and eventually landed on iPhone, iPod Touch and Android devices, One Epic Game is proof that the winning formula behind Canabalt is much more difficult to replicate than it might initially seem. Epic Fail? Those who have played Halfbrick Studio's Monster Dash find themselves faced with a well-known formula: in One Epic Game the protagonist runs autonomously from left to right, and the player's interaction is limited on one side to jumping over obstacles and ravines along the way , on the other to shoot all the enemies that occasionally appear in front of him. The aim, at least in the main campaign, is obviously to reach the end of each level without falling off precipices or losing all the energy at one's disposal, but while Monster Dash managed to propose a balanced formula (the same one that was later refined and enriched in the excellent Jetpack Joyride), the developers of the Czech team Grip Games stumbled awkwardly into a long series of design errors, first of all the randomness with which the obstacles appear on the screen. Many almost overlook the perfect balancing act behind an apparently simple game like Canabalt, in which the size of the ravines is constantly in balance with the player's speed, while some obstacles are even anticipated by a sound effect so that always a chance to avoid death. This concept is completely missing in One Epic Game, and already from the first minutes we find ourselves cursing the almost total randomness of the traps and jumps: it is not uncommon to lose a level due to a cliff that is too large or too small, while several times we found ourselves having to choose whether to crash into a wall or jump it to end up straight into the arms of a zombie. A checkpoint system ensures that longer levels do not become impossible to overcome, but now the omelette is done and the running game of Grip Games is ruined due to excessively frustrating moments and enormous superficiality. And it's a real shame, since if nothing else the game can boast of a good variety, both thanks to numerous weapons and power-ups, and for the different options available to the player: in particular, the Story Mode offers a series of levels set in four different worlds, each characterized by scenarios, enemies and traps taken directly from the most well-known video game clichs, starting from an invasion of aliens up to the ancient Middle Ages, passing through the inevitable zombie apocalypse. It must be said that the developers have really worked hard to season the entire campaign with humor and, although the jokes and puns are not always successful, those who find the strength and patience to go on will be rewarded with a few amused smiles. The wiry protagonist and the supporting characters are the first to never take themselves seriously, so much so that the dialogues of One Epic Game are a continuous irony about video games and nerd culture. In addition to an Endless mode, in which you continue playing until you are killed, the game offers a series of interesting alternatives that must be unlocked gradually in the Campaign: in Acrobat mode, for example, you have to eliminate as many enemies as possible by jumping on their heads, while the Pacifist option challenges you to get as far as possible without killing anyone, whereas in Time Loop you have to avoid any obstacle in order to increase your speed as much as possible.
