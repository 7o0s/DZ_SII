{"name": "Sherlock Holmes versus Arsne Lupin - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sherlock-holmes-versus-arsene-lupin-recensione.html", "text": "Elementary watson SHvsAL is a classic point and click adventure, from which canons differs only in the first person view, closer to modern titles and based on the classic WASD to make the movements of your character. For the rest, the game is presented in the usual way, with the cursor able to change when you pass over elements of the scenario that are interesting for the unfolding of the adventure, and the use by the investigator of an inventory and of a diary where dialogues and particularly useful clues are noted. The main flaw of the gameplay is precisely constituted by the positioning of the elements in the environment, a little too often unnerving due to the so-called pixel hunting, or the meticulous search using the mouse in all parts of the screen in order to find how to continue in the adventure. For the rest, however, we are faced with a fully appreciable title, perhaps a bit difficult for casual gamers due to some puzzles that are a little too difficult, even if it must be said that as in the best Sherlock Holmes novel, even in the Frogwares production very often it is enough to use the head to get to the bottom of situations, without having to invent who knows what to solve unrealistic puzzles. The parts in which the protagonist is asked directly by one of the other characters to solve a puzzle are also particularly stimulating, typically through a question to which the player must answer by typing the right word directly on the keyboard. Sherlock Holmes is obviously the main protagonist of the story, but this does not mean that we will necessarily find ourselves always and only in his shoes: in an alternation that can only do good for the variety of situations and the ways in which they are faced by the various people, for example the player has the possibility of slipping into the clothes of the nice Watson or, as in the case of Lupine's first theft attempt, into the police chief, to order the men in view of the announced attack by the thief. Still on the subject of characters, Frogwares has done an excellent job, above all considering the difficult task of dealing with elements of certain depth such as the two main protagonists, created in a way that perfectly corresponds to how one can imagine them, both graphically and as far as the behavioral side is concerned: Holmes' marked English accent, with a pinch of classic English phlegm in addition, does not fail to elicit a few smiles. The Ageia in Victorian London Although working on a graphic adventure, the programmers have not neglected the technical sector, equipping the game with a video system capable of perfectly reproducing Victorian-era London, complete with carriages, stray dogs, pedestrians and elements of everyday life in this period, also exploiting the Ageia routines for the purpose, albeit without some small imperfections such as for example the blocking of the character in front of a group of pigeons, which normally should obviously fly away instead of ~put up resistance~. Be that as it may, SHvsAL's graphics are generally appreciated also thanks to a fairly accurate attention to detail, despite several shadows being cast on the engine by the partial lack of some character animations, which therefore prevent it from fully promoting a graphics sector that remains in any case good level for a graphic adventure: for example, it happened to see Watson stationary, quite far from Holmes, only to find him immediately behind him once he got out of the protagonist's field of vision. Similar speech, if not better, deserves the audio, composed of an excellent dubbing in English and a soundtrack that fully does its job. The voices chosen to impersonate characters such as Holmes, Watson and Lupine appear to be fully guessed, while for those who are not familiar with spoken English, a subtitle system is available, also in the same language, as well as all the menus of game: at the moment it is not yet known whether the title will be localized totally, partially or not at all in the future, although this is probably one of the classic cases in which a dubbing in an idiom other than the original one could paradoxically lower the level of the gaming experience. Comment SHvsAL is a more than appreciable title, based on the excellent experience gained by Frogwares in the creation of the other titles in the series dedicated to Sherlock Holmes. Without adding anything in particular to a genre that has now become almost niche, the game is enjoyable in all its aspects, starting from the plot, passing through the graphicsca to get to the playability, also counting on the characters certainly thick as Holmes and his assistant and, of course, the antagonist Lupine. Some criticism goes to the puzzles, sometimes quite difficult, and to a graphics engine that shows some too obvious gaps, slightly obscuring the rest of the work done by Frogwares, still of a good standard: SHvsAL is a product to keep in mind for the upcoming Christmas holidays also considering the growing desolation within the panorama of graphic adventures, once glorious but now almost forgotten, except for some pleasant exceptions like the one we are facing. Pros Excellent setting Good technical sector Challenging puzzles Cons Difficulty sometimes high Some graphical glitches Pixel hunting, we hate you! PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Operating System: Windows 2000/XP/Vista Processor: Pentium III 1.3 GHz or higher RAM: 512 MB Video Card: 64 MB DirectX9 compatible Hard Disk Space: 3 GB Test Configuration Processor: Athlon 64 X2 3800+ RAM: 2 GB Video Card: GeForce 7900GT Sherlock Holmes versus Arsene Lupine is available for PC. Despite the evident decline compared to the golden years of their genre, graphic adventures always keep the old charm intact, especially if based on a convincing story and charismatic characters: there is no doubt that Frogwares has hit the mark in this optics, offering the public a popular series of video games with one of the most famous literary fruits of the world, Sherlock Holmes. Now in its fourth chapter with Sherlock Holmes vs Arsne Lupin, this series now proposes what, not surprisingly, has been subtitled as a new challenge between the eternal rivals England and France: in fact, the game begins with a letter written by the French thief to Holmes and his inseparable assistant Watson, in which he promises to steal 5 symbolic works of the English nation, thus making fun of the entire population. Just to make fun of the British as much as possible, Lupine decides to give Holmes the opportunity to thwart his thefts, through a series of puzzles capable of leading the investigator to prevent Lupine from carrying out his plan, however risking in failure to permanently compromise the proverbial English seriousness.", "date": "2007-12-20", "grade": null}
