{"name": "Tinykin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tinykin-recensione.html", "text": "Are you looking for a simple, fun platformer with a pleasant cartoon aesthetic? Then go no further, because the game we are about to tell you about could be just what you need. Let's talk about Tinykin, the new title from Splashteam, published by tinyBuild (very appropriate, let's face it). As Milo, a student of the future of a planet where humanity lives, we go in search of Earth, the long-forgotten planet of origin of human beings. When we find it and reach it, however, we realize that we are tiny and that we are trapped in a house full of intelligent insects. What happen? How will we get home after losing our ship? We certainly won't give you the answers to these questions (no spoilers!), but we will explain in detail how much good there is in the game in our Tinykin review. The tinykins Milo and the tinykins Milo's adventure will force him to explore the various rooms of the house, with the ultimate goal of building a sort of new ship, with makeshift objects such as a funnel, a pair of scissors and a tea infuser. He won't have to do everything alone, however, because he will have the tinykins on his side, the little creatures that give the game its name. These are small creatures, colored balls with unique abilities that, for some reason, respond to Milo's commands. The house is also inhabited by a thriving insect civilization, divided into various rooms. We will have ants who have created a religious cult based on music in the living room, grasshoppers who defend a terrarium, party bugs in the bathroom who organize raves and more. It is a cheerful and positive cartoon world, where everyone is happy and worships Arwin, a sort of divinity. The plot is simple and doesn't go much further than ~go there to find the next item~. However, the ending takes an almost dramatic turn, with a sci-fi explanation of the game world, without there being any inkling of what was hiding beneath the surface of Tinykin. We believe that the plot takes itself too seriously during the closing stages, but it is still a minor element that can easily be ignored. Powers and platforms Milo and the tinykins atop a big flower In fact, Tiny is above all a game that doesn't waste time and that makes you play right away. Milo can jump, use a bar of soap to move fast, and use a strange bubble of air to glide. As mentioned, it also has the help of tinykins, which are divided into five variants. There are reds that work like bombs, pinks that lift and move, greens that create a vertical ladder, and more. From room to room we are introduced to these little creatures that must be collected by exploring. Exploration is central to Tinykin, which relies heavily on collecting items and collectibles, rather than completely complex platforming sections. Each room is a large, pleasantly intricate environment, full of paths, structures, passages, shortcuts to unlock and objects to collect. Tinykin is very easy to complete, with many areas where you can't even die (and in case you respawn on the last platform, without punishment). The game simply makes us run around as fast as possible, collecting tinykins to use to move objects, knock down obstacles or activate interactive elements, collecting nectar which is used to increase the maximum glide duration. There are many characters in the Tinykin settings Tinykin is a light adventure, well thought out and leaves a smile on your face after you finish playing thanks to the small insect world that inhabits it. At the same time, for many players it risks being an adventure that is too easy and without peaks. Secondary sections where to test the manual skills of more experienced players would not have spoiled, but we understand that the goal is to create a game for everyone, even for the little ones. Even with that assumption, however, Tinykin loses some edge in the last area, where it doesn't introduce a new type of tinykin and repeats various ideas presented in the previous sections. It never gets tiring or boring, mind you, also because it is quite short: in five hours we completed the story, having also collected 80-90% of the secondary elements. In about seven hours you can do everything the game offers. This is the perfect length for the amount of ideas present in the game: just one more hour would have made everything too repetitive.", "date": "2022-08-31", "grade": "7.9"}
