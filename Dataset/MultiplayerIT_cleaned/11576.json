After two rations of brain training, eye training, English courses, crossword puzzles and Sudoki, sui generis musical synthesizers, here comes fresh from Japan the digitized incarnation of professor Hideo Kageyama, professor of mathematics at the Ritsumeikan University of Kyoto and a member of the education council for the Japanese ministry. Don't let the credentials scare you, you don't need to rush to dust off the heavy high school tomes. In fact, this Mathematics Training will not bore you with functions, limits, derivatives and integrals. Everything is much simpler, fortunately. Too simple, maybe. Structurally, the software is very similar to Brain Training, as it provides tests to be performed daily and the progress of which will be saved to access exercises of higher difficulty. Interesting, isn't it? To enrich the dish is the flagship of this prof. with almond-shaped eyes, i.e. the calculation exercises with the ~hundred boxes method~. Well, if that doesn't pique your curiosity either, chances are nothing about this title will. The interest aroused by the book of exercises and by the Kageyama method is destined to run out very soon As we said, the approach is very similar to the infamous brain workouts, with the difference that all the exercises involve numbers exclusively. The DS is held ~book-like~, i.e. vertically, and all the answers to the quizzes are provided by writing on the touch-screen. Needless to underline the importance of a tried and tested number writing recognition system, which when tested by hand does not seem to have enjoyed improvements compared to that of Brain Training, occasionally denouncing some uncertainty. A slogan on the cover of the packaging calls this TdM an effective math review for students and non-students alike. However, unless you're younger than eight and you're still doing math by looking at your fingers, none of the exercises included in TdM will put you off, and eventually your daily workout will become a mere race against the clock. You can consider it a refresher from elementary school, since you won't find anything more complex than addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, all strictly within the set of natural numbers. To be clear, we start from 9+5, 7-6, 8x4, 10:2 but we don't get very far in terms of brain effort. And I think the same can be said of fun. There are column multiplications (in which one of the factors has two or more digits, e.g. 72 x 7 = ?), there are operations of which we are given the result and one of the factors (asking in response for the missing factor, 9 - x = 5), there are subtractions and additions to scale that at first could embarrass someone (like 381680  38168 = ? - 38168= ? and so on), but really nothing that can't be refreshed in a few minutes, canceling hence the potential appeal. For each exercise completed, a medal is awarded, the metal of which varies according to the correctness of the quiz and the time taken to complete it. Good results allow you to access quizzes of higher difficulty. In addition to the daily quizzes, there is a section entitled ~Kageyama Method~, which is itself divided into two subsections. The first is the split marathon, a tour de force against the clock to complete a series of 100 splits that are required to supply result and remainder (55:9= ? 6 with remainder of 1). The second part of the method devised by the Japanese luminary is the grid of one hundred boxes: a matrix of ten rows by ten columns to be filled in as quickly as possible, inserting in each box the result deriving from the factors already provided on the row and column of the frame. Um, we assure you that it is much more difficult to explain it than to deal with it. But above all, it is enough for you to know that it is so boring as to leave you baffled. Comment All geeks with math training. The gist is this, but don't misunderstand the meaning. Easy quizzes result in easy en-pleins. Any of you who have completed compulsory education will find every quiz in this title maddeningly simple. It goes without saying that the interest aroused by the book of exercises and the Kageyama method is destined to run out very soon. We didn't expect Nintendo to invent math-that-entertains, but we would have expected a product capable of at least being attractive to a wider and heterogeneous audience, instead TdM proves to be a shallow and suitable application forer a pre-school age audience, for those who are not yet masters of the glorious multiplication tables, or at least for those who feel a little rusty calculating the rest of the shopping. Pros Learning by playing Suitable for a first approach to mathematics Budget price 29.90 Cons Too simple tests Repetitive forced play Lack of depth Prof. Kageyama's Math Training is available for Nintendo DS. Who among you does not remember your prof. of maths? More than one probably still has to deal with it in court every day... and pardon the pun. Others, like myself, have left it behind for several years, keeping a clear memory of it, which for some may take on the connotations of a real nightmare. It is no coincidence that mathematics is by far the most hated school subject. The furthest thing from a pleasant memory. Well, if we can quote a movie title, just know that... sometimes they come back.", "date": "2008-03-11", "grade": null}
