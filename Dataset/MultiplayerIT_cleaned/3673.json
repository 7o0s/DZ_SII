{"name": "A Plague Tale: Innocence", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/a-plague-tale-innocence-recensione.html", "text": "Although Asobo Studio has existed since 2002, before A Plague Tale: Innocence and this review, the name of the team based in Bordeaux was mainly linked to the production of licensed video games concerning some Pixar animated films. Scrolling further through Asobo Studio's curriculum, one can actually also see a list of minor projects and collaborations, such as the one carried out with Armature Studio for ReCore. And there is no shortage of independently developed titles, such as the racing game Fuel. Fans of the genre will probably remember the latter for its boundless map, at least for 2009 in which Fuel was released, but also for failing to maintain the expectations that many had created about it. Exactly ten years later, A Plague Tale: Innocence therefore represents a new opportunity for Asobo Studio to attempt to make the definitive leap in quality. Since the announcement made two years ago, the guys led by creative director David Dedeine have been able to attract more and more gamers' attention to this project, focusing above all on the strong narrative component that has given the impression to feature A Plague Tale: Innocence. Our last meeting with the game before the review, which took place about a month ago, gave us the opportunity to have almost definitive confirmations of its strengths, but also to renew questions already asked in the past, which we can finally answer today after having spent about eleven hours in the company of Amicia and Hugo. Setting and plot in power The story told in A Plague Tale: Innocence takes place during the Hundred Years War, so called to collect the long series of conflicts between France and England from 1337 to 1453. A period at the end of which in some areas of France the the population even found itself halved in numerical terms, not only because of the war: in 1347, in fact, the Black Plague epidemic began which involved all of Europe in the Middle Ages. In a fast and tremendous way, death arrived in practically every corner of our continent, including the small French village from which the story of Amicia and Hugo, the two protagonists of A Plague Tale: Innocence, begins. The fifteen-year-old girl is introduced to us in the very first moments of the prologue, in which we find her engaged in a peaceful wild boar hunt accompanied by her father and her dog. An accident forces Amicia to return to the estate of her family, the noble De Rune, where her mother Batrice and little brother Hugo also live with the servants. The latter is a five-year-old boy suffering from a mysterious disease, due to which he has practically never left the house, remaining under the surveillance and constant care of his mother herself, an expert in alchemy. A situation that over time has not passed indifferent in front of Amicia, who grew up far from the maternal figure due to a younger brother who in practice she doesn't even know, and towards whom she will demonstrate genuine jealousy. Without going into further detail, we limit ourselves to saying that the arrival of the Inquisition in the vicinity will precipitate the situation in a short time, forcing Amicia and Hugo to run away from home together without even knowing why the soldiers are looking for the De Runes with so much determination. The story of A Plague Tale: Innocence confirms what we expected, with very emotional moments linked above all to the forced growth of the two brothers. A growth that takes place in a different way, primarily involving Amicia, a girl who actually knows her stuff when it comes to using the slingshot, but who has always had a contact with the outside world filtered by her noble origins. For Hugo, however, anything can be a fascinating novelty, even in a world like that of A Plague Tale: Innocence where death is a constant companion. It is certainly no coincidence that the word ~innocence~ was chosen to give the title to this game: for both protagonists, the story is in fact about the loss of their innocence, albeit in different forms. For Amicia, escape marks the entrance into adulthood, anticipated in its time by the horror that accompanies the disease and by the war that brings violence to constantly knock on her door, as well as the need to make up for the absence of her mother in taking care of Hugo. The need to defend her little brother leads Amicia to carry out actions that will mark her for the rest of her life, and A Plague Tale: Innocence manages to convey all the sensations experienced by the girl in this sense. For Hugo however, the story is alloyto the loss of that ingenuity typical of pre-school children, accentuated by the particular situation of total protection in which the child was previously forced to live. The events of A Plague Tale: Innocence are destined to make inroads in the player's head, both from an emotional point of view, given the maturity of the story, and in more profound terms by addressing educational and existential issues towards children. From this last point of view, some passages will strike you especially if you are parents and as such you have necessarily confronted yourself at least once about the most appropriate way to face an unpleasant truth with your children. The desire not to make spoilers does not allow us to go further, so before going further, let's spend a few words on the creation of the characters: beyond the path taken by Amicia and Hugo, the game includes other support figures characterized very well by Asobo Studio, which therefore proves to be up to the task from this point of view. The same discourse also concerns the main antagonists of the two brothers, able to instill the right level of fear mixed with disgust. Stealth-tinged gameplay In terms of pure gameplay, A Plague Tale: Innocence is proposed as an action game strongly oriented towards the stealth component. Controlling Amicia we actually find ourselves also controlling Hugo holding him by the hand, with the possibility of indicating to the little one whether to stay still in one place or to come towards our position, also giving him some commands in case of need to carry out some precluded to Amicia. In most of the time our goal is to sneak unseen by the soldiers between tall grass and other hiding places, if necessary using some diversions related to the environment and the ability of the older sister with the slingshot. Even if the latter can be used lethally against soldiers who do not wear a helmet, A Plague Tale: Innocence encourages the player to make use of all the tools that will gradually be possible to obtain through the crafting system, linked both to weapon upgrades, and to the creation of alchemical compounds that allow you to light fires, put opponents to sleep and more. In the light of the adventure lived to write this review, the biggest perplexities concern the level of difficulty set up by the developers, really too low especially in the first part of the game: the first hours almost seem like an extended tutorial, in which even in situations more dangerous, the feeling of shiver gets lost just because of the simplicity with which it is possible to continue. Just to give an example, when we found ourselves having to run away from rats or other human beings we never had the sensation of having them breathing down our necks, going our way too calmly for what was happening in theory behind us. Even the crafting system is involved in this choice to make everything affordable: materials are practically never in short supply, and it is consequently very difficult not to have available materials and objects on which Amicia can count. Fortunately, it is precisely the various possibilities we have in dealing with situations that keep interest in the game's mechanics alive, allowing us to change the way we interact with enemies and the environment depending on the situation. Things start to go better in the second part of A Plague Tale: Innocence, when the narrative component starts to be more pressing and the videogame dynamics end up on the one hand putting themselves at its service in a better way, and on the other hand getting a little more challenging. In the most agitated phases, it was a bit too complicated for us to quickly change the ammunition in use with the slingshot, even at times when the situation expressly required it. Based on what has been said, we would like to advise especially the more experienced players to deactivate some aids of the interface, in order to make the game dynamics a little more difficult and consequently everything more stimulating in purely videogame terms. The way of experiencing history will also benefit from it. Playstation 4 trophies A Plague Tale: Innocence takes us through the dangers in medieval France to get a total of thirty-six Trophies. The usual Platinum that is due to us after obtaining all the others is accompanied by four Trophies of the Gold type, nine Silver and twenty-two Bronze. Most of them can be collected simply by completing the story, but to get to one hundred percent you need to carry out some very specific actions within the game, finding particular places or damagedoses to do with crafting. On the road to Platinum, the various collectibles available also play a role. Graphics and sound Having tried the PS4 version of A Plague Tale: Innocence, we are left curious to see how the game behaves on PC, but this does not prevent us from appreciating the work done by Asobo Studio from a technical point of view. On the Pro model of the console the game is presented with a good hold in the number of frames per second, allowing the player to appreciate in a fluid way the artistic vein inspired by the paintings of Claude Lorrain, a seventeenth-century painter who presented landscapes with soft and tending tones to orange. Some scenes actually look like they came out of a painting, prompting us to admire the scene for a few seconds before continuing. In the transition from interiors to exteriors it is possible to notice some less refined contours in the models of the characters, but the attention to detail is always appreciable. The hordes of rats hungry for meat that populate streets and buildings are represented to us in all their horror through nests ready to burst like pustules, embracing the supernatural component of the plot to complement what is instead an extreme realism in the historical representation offered by A Plague Tale: Innocence. From this point of view, the creation of the villages as they were at the time in which the game is set undoubtedly stands out, with considerable attention also to the less relevant aspects of roads and houses. A similar precision has been placed in the creation of the faces, not only those of Amicia and Hugo but also those of all the other characters, accompanied however by facial animations that are not always at the top. The soundtrack was composed by the old wolf Olivier Deriviere (Obscure, Alone in the Dark, Vampyr) with exclusive use of string instruments: undoubtedly the best choice to accompany a game with the setting of A Plague Tale: Innocence.", "date": "2019-05-14", "grade": "8.2"}
