Shadwen takes a clear path, in which the action component has been largely circumscribed, deprived of combat sequences and supported by time rewinding dynamics. The game debuts today on PlayStation 4, PC, Mac and Linux, at the price of 14.55 euros. So let's try to understand together if the new experiment deserves the attention of us enthusiasts. In Shadwen you have to decide whether to kill everyone or go unnoticed To kill or not to kill? Shadwen is a murderer, or rather a regicide. We see her in the introductory movie, intent on taking justice into her own hands on the skin of the ruler of Rivendon. The bloody act is consummated before the frightened eyes of an innocent little girl with blond hair. We are immediately catapulted back a few hours, to the moments in which the two protagonists of the adventure meet for the first time. Lily is looking for food at the outer walls of the city and, just as a guard approaches her accusing her of theft, Shadwen gets rid of the man and decides to take the little one with him, partly out of pity but also to prevent the l 'inconvenience could blow your cover. During this first encounter, the moral choice already emerges which assumes the leading role of the entire gaming experience: to kill or not to kill? The presence of an innocent man serves to give further credibility to the two alternatives and, in this way, opens the way to two options located at the antipodes. The first involves preserving Lily from the vision of the murders, trying to conceal all the crimes or not to commit even one, while the second hypothesis assumes a total lack of scruples and leads to the elimination of anyone who intends to hinder the completion of the assignment. This choice, undertaken by the player, will therefore have some effects on the epilogue of the adventure, since it will be possible to reach an ending in which the girl is absolutely unaware that she has helped a murderess, or to a variant in which the little girl has already been able to realize the reality. The narration takes place almost exclusively through the dialogues of the guards in the dungeons and in the city streets that lead to the royal palace, while the two protagonists confront each other during the loading sequences that take place between one level and the next. Obviously the content of these exchanges follows different paths, depending on the approach selected in the incipit. Playstation 4 trophies The Shadwen Trophies are mainly oriented towards the completion of the 15 levels and the two opposing choices: kill all the available guards or spare them and go completely unnoticed. Pure stealth Shadwen's stealth dynamics are particularly linear and develop following the same reference points throughout the adventure. The presence of structured maps on tracks, with slight variations of the route, in fact does not allow that variety of approaches which can usually be an effective added value for the genre we are talking about. At the same time, Frozenbyte must be acknowledged for having developed a very traditionalist experience, completely unrelated to drift action. Every time we are identified, the game forces us to retrace our steps, through a time rewind function. By doing so it is possible to repeat some of the actions just carried out, by pressing the L1 button, and opt for a much more effective strategy. Time distortions occur seamlessly, even during planning: in order to continue the flow of time, it is in fact essential to move Shadwen with the analog stick, or to keep the right backbone of the pad pressed while you are behind the covers. In doing so, the patrols continue their reconnaissance and it is possible to select the most suitable moment to enter into action. While no longer playable from the tutorial on, Lily provides her support on various occasions, for example going from small holes to open gates or pulling levers to unlock certain passages. The girl is perfectly able to move independently towards the end of the level - provided that the road is free from threats - but if necessary, it is allowed to suggest where to go or in which position to stop and wait. Moreover, we have repeatedly encountered a problem of managing the allied artificial intelligence, in fact it very often happens that the little girl starts running right from theup to guards or pass nearby without being detected in any way, a bit like what happened with Ellie in some segments of The Last of Us. Enemies can be attacked stealthily, or evaded by dragging some objects with the help of a grappling hook. If from this point of view the mechanism works quite well, the same cannot be said if the grappling hook must be used to move or climb some platforms. In these situations, the environmental interaction mechanics have been implemented in a very approximate way, making it extremely frustrating to be able to climb the raised platforms or reach the subsequent holds unscathed. The variety of enemies is another factor that partially made us turn up our noses, since there are only two categories of soldier. The first is very easy to evade, the second cannot be stabbed in the back and makes it necessary to take advantage of suspended objects or assaults from above with movements similar to those of Assassin's Creed. Even the opponent's artificial intelligence has its ups and downs, in fact we found a remarkable reactivity in the identification from the medium distance, but a greater difficulty of the patrols to extricate themselves when the crates and the other elements of the scenario were moved to attract attention. Shadwen's equipment involves the use of the knife but also involves the creation of blueprints for some additional weapons, which can be built by collecting items from chests. Once you have obtained the necessary material, you can build nail traps, pressure mines, baits and poisoned darts. With a little mastery and inventiveness it is possible to exploit every single resource properly, but it is equally true that the fifteen levels of the game can be completed in full even using only the primary weapon. From a technical point of view, Shadwen offers a rather suggestive fantasy scenario, in which gloomy environments and very limited light sources prevail, to the point of suggesting completely dark game sessions if you want to orient yourself properly. Nonetheless, the global impact turned out to be moderate and nothing more. Details such as the animations of the protagonist and the management of the cameras do not fail to create some embarrassment, and they would undoubtedly have deserved more specific attention.", "date": "2016-05-17", "grade": "7.8"}
