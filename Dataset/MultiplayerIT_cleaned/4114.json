{"name": "Left to Survive", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/left-to-survive-recensione.html", "text": "Left to Survive is undoubtedly one of the titles of the moment on the App Store and Google Play. It is a zombie-based shooter set in a post-apocalyptic scenario, where society has been wiped out following the spread of a mysterious virus and a ruthless multinational corporation has set up some kind of totalitarian government to control the survivors and test on of them the effectiveness of the undead created in the laboratory. A not exactly idyllic situation, therefore, the one in which we will have to move: in the role of a shrewd fighter, we will join the resistance and we will be sent from time to time to clean up the streets from the presence of the pathetic and aberrant creatures that populate them, or to oppose hostile factions that threaten our survival. Furthermore, between one mission and another, we will be asked to manage the camp and its structures by drawing on classic management mechanics, including the inevitable freemium elements that generally characterize the experience of the title developed by the Russian team Whalekit. This aspect in particular is predominant, given that the value of food supplies as a ~ticket~ to be able to face an internship, gold as a hard currency to quickly unlock or speed up construction work and building upgrades is clarified right from the start and weapons, as well as materials and virtual currency as a further requirement to be able to proceed in the single player campaign. There are also two extra modes, a raid and a competitive multiplayer for one-on-one or two-on-two matches, but even they are not outside this rule and indeed have an independent progression system. Gameplay and structure Such a marked freemium approach could make anyone give up, but the quality of Left to Survive manages to keep the experience engaging, at least until the gameplay starts to get a little too repetitive. The missions of the single player campaign, divided into four chapters each consisting of various stages, main and secondary (the latter often essential for carrying out a bit of grinding), are presented as a shooter on rails, in which therefore the movement of the character it is predetermined, even in the limitation of its movements. By touching the left side of the touch screen we can control the viewfinder in a precise and reactive way, while on the right side there are the buttons to open fire, reload, use the knife in case of a close attack or the grenade (but these are consumable resources , watch out!) and possibly change stakeout, in case of a boss fight or multiplayer match. The gunplay, however simple, returns excellent sensations: zombies can be eliminated quickly if you hit them on the head, and there are different types of enemies, such as explosive ~blobs~ or creatures capable of spitting acid from the distance , or even the undead who come running. The presence of the traditional explosive barrels adds a further element of fun and strategy in view of missions that are completed quickly, suitable for mobile gaming, without leaving that sense of dissatisfaction that sometimes appears in the face of situations that are resolved too quickly . There is also a decent variety of weapons, and the difference between machine guns and shotguns is emphasized very well, with stages where you use one tool rather than another, as well as extra missions that allow you to try out weapons available for free purchase with real money. Thanks to the predetermined nature of the shots, the graphics of Left to Survive are really excellent: the characters appear detailed and well animated, the textures that cover the surfaces are always clear and the lighting system also provides a good proof, thanks to the different sources of light present in day and night scenarios.", "date": "2018-08-03", "grade": "7.5"}
