This operation often leads to a rediscovery of turn-based game action, forcing the player to move along pre-set paths and thus allowing for a rather schematic construction of the levels and the game structure in general. Something similar also happens in Looty Dungeon, where a dungeon crawler-style RPG becomes a kind of obstacle course to be tackled by moving one square at a time within a sort of chessboard using the four main directions, to be taken with quick taps directional on the touch screen. There are no real shifts but the movements are obviously schematic and calculated, timing being the main element to take into consideration to avoid self-propelled traps, defend yourself from enemy attacks and get the right moment to strike. All further complicated by the need to move quickly given the continuous collapse of the boxes at the bottom of the screen, which forces you to always move forward and even quickly. The result is therefore an extremely basic game, in which we essentially have to be able to reach the door at the end of the level and open it by reaching the objectives that are proposed to us at the beginning of each screen, usually connected to eliminating enemies or collecting particular objects. With such a structure, the strength of the game should derive from a careful placement of obstacles and a generally stimulating level design, but on this point the title of Taco Illuminati fails to affect that much, remaining above all an interesting experimentation equipped with a graphic characterization of excellent workmanship. The simple mechanism of progression however gets the job done by easily starting the addiction between levels. Looty Dungeon makes us explore fascinating squared dungeons, one box at a time Boxy charm As with any game with a steady progression and simple structure, it's not easy to pinpoint a real purpose behind the action, which essentially justifies itself with its mind-chasing intuitiveness and willingness to simply see what lies behind the action. yet another door. Curiously, the loot that is also mentioned in the title does not turn out to be a key element in the Looty Dungeon mechanism, given that as you progress through the levels you are limited to collecting coins which, however, do not lead to a real evolution of the main character. Instead of proposing the classic role-playing customization of the fighter, the game focuses on another increasingly popular feature in mobile games: the possibility of buying new characters, which are obtained by spending coins inside a sort of slot machine from which they the new heroes in their beautiful packaging. This does not only aim at the collecting impulse, because each character brings with him some specific characteristics that modify the approach to action in the dungeons, proposing new weapons and skills with which to face enemies and obstacles and thus giving a new dimension to the collection mechanism coins and buying new characters. A further expedient that enriches the game experience is the continuous proposal of objectives to be completed on different levels: there are immediate ones, the achievement of which is necessary to open the door and reach the next level, and longer ones term, which require certain performances to be completed over a greater amount of levels and which represent to advance. As for the micro-transactions, which obviously have to come out somewhere since this is a free-to-play, it must be noted that they are not present in an obsessive way, forcing you to watch an advertisement in order to be able to resume the game after losing of lives or by purchasing the possibility of freely continuing the game.", "date": "2016-04-13", "grade": "6.8"}
