Even then, with the Nintendo hybrid console at the starting points, it was clear how a game of this caliber could shine with its own light especially in portable mode, where hit and run games would have dominated. It didn't take long to convince 505 and Keen Games to port their protg and Portal Knights is now available to purchase digitally from the Nintendo Store, with the physical version arriving in early 2018. The bad news, sadly , is that the price has magically risen to around thirty euros, ten euros more than seen on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. To justify, but not too much, the increase in the price list is the usual problem of the higher production costs of the Switch titles, linked in a double way to the price of the cartridges. But what does this thing have to do with digital products? The crux of the matter is unbridled only by observing the Nintendo policies which ask developers to keep the same amount for digital and physical, and the arcane mystery is solved. There is therefore no need to raise the pitchforks against 505 or start yet another witch hunt: as long as this policy, unfortunately, remains between the lines of Nintendo contracts, the consumer will always get involved. But let's see together what this port has to offer. Face to face with the portals Aware that arriving six months later on a new platform - and moreover with an almost doubled cost - was not a great idea, Keen Games and 505 have decided to include all the DLC released so far within the package, giving their audience a kind of all-inclusive special edition. Unfortunately there are no new characters or changes to skills but the additions still bring dozens of new objects, new monsters and new materials, very important elements for a game essentially based entirely on the creativity of the players. Portal Knights, for those who don't know it yet, is a sandbox where combat and exploration are always put in the foreground, which however disowns the classic open world beyond Minecraft to take refuge in smaller and more controlled ecosystems. Instead of having to deal with immense worlds, the islands of Portal Knights are designed to offer different challenges and landscapes from time to time, unique raw materials and specific enemies to face. Thus a more linear structure is created than that proposed by the giant Mojang but, precisely for this reason, much more digestible even by a young audience. 505 could therefore have focused a little more on the narrative and built a much more substantial story around the play system, so as to give a greater stimulus even to those who want more depth from this point of view. Portal Knights for Nintendo Switch, however, offers portability on its side and this changes things quite a bit. While on Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC the repetitiveness factor is highlighted by the long game sessions, on Switch, thanks to the peculiarities of the console, the hit and run games manage to hide the problem under the carpet, offering the player an undoubtedly improve. However, not all that glitters is gold and if on the one hand there are enormous advantages, such as more content or better usability, on the other the Nintendo console shows its side in terms of performance. The frame rate has been halved compared to previous versions and the resolution goes from 1080p in the dock version to 720p when we use the console on the go. Not a big deal, as the vibrant colors and great lighting look great despite the lower definition, but when the action heats up the frame drops will become repeated and noticeable, making even the most demanding gamers turn up their noses . It is therefore a pity that it is precisely when playing in four, both online and locally, that the biggest problems arise because the title really manages to give its best if consumed with friends, while facing bosses or trying to knock down opponents tougher. The possibility of playing in split screen is also back on Switch, an optimal solution that impressed us positively for immediacy and fun. However, what really shines in this new version in our opinion is the inventory management, completely reinvigorated by the presence of the touch screen, which allows you to avoid those very tedious moments where you have to scroll through dozens of objects during the creation of materials or tools, now replaced by simple taps on the screen. A veiltouch it and we will be able to select the resources, drag them into the inventory or give orders for the creation of the tools, a plus that absolutely cannot be underestimated for a title that has a reason to exist on Switch and which finds new lifeblood in this dimension.", "date": "2017-11-28", "grade": "8.0"}
