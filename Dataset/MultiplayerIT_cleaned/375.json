It is necessary that the actions of the players are motivated and directed towards a clear and incontrovertible enemy The whys of a war Having said this, it is easy to understand why few playful reductions were dedicated to the First World War (but if you think about it, even the other arts were more sparing towards it) and, in many cases, they were minor productions made by developers second floor. It should also be noted that the genre chosen to represent this war has always been that of strategy (turn-based or real-time, it doesn't change much) which, in its objectifying necessity, implicitly tends to cool down the emotional impact, while, for example, it does not there are many action games set during the Second World War (just to give two famous examples: the Medal of Honor series and the Call of Duty series but there would be many other titles to mention). Minimalism and confusion It is not for nothing that the game produced by 1C Company, developed by Dark Fox (authors of only one expansion of Sudden Strike) fully fits the framework outlined in the previous paragraph: it is a strategic (in real time) and it is a small production. The first thing that catches the eye when starting the game after installation is the lack of a tutorial. I don't know about you, but I'm so used to having a tutorial available to introduce me to the games that I immediately felt this lack. What's more, this forced me to consult the manual (which I hadn't done since time immemorial... and thinking about it, I didn't even miss it). Nothing transcendental, actually, given that there are few controls to learn and it would have been enough for me to play a little to get used to it (oh well, it was just to dramatize). Having solved the ~how to play~ problem (which if you think about it is the barrier that often does not allow us to fully appreciate some titles) I started the first campaign of the three available (that of the Entente, the other two are the German campaign and the Russian one). At the beginning, one is more baffled than displaced. World War I has very minimal graphics, not to mention ugly. Accustomed to ultra-vivid colours, ultra-detailed troops and three-dimensional battlefields, this 2D graphics with tiny, poorly drawn sprites that move around bare-bones scenarios when not stark brings to mind some old strategists from the late 90s. Even the control system is reduced to the bone, despite being the classic RTS one. In short, an interface in the lower part of the screen allows you to give orders to the troops, both via the mouse and via the inevitable keyboard shortcuts. On the left there is a minimap in which our units (in green), the units of the enemy (in red) and the objectives to be achieved (red arrows) are indicated. Also in the same area, some microscopic meters inform us about the state of our army (or of the single selected troop) allowing us to know if we have to go in search of ammunition, if any soldiers need to be treated and more. If desired, with a special key, we can view the description of the objectives, which usually consist of destroying a bridge, escorting prisoners, conquering a strategic area, defending sensitive areas, plus other variants that always revolve around the classic stylistic features of the genre . The first battles are rather confusing and immediately show the biggest flaw of the First World War: the difficulty of managing troops and finding and recognizing them. These have been trained by Oronzo Can I'll explain. The minimal graphics are not an absolute evil and you can digest them after a few minutes, what you really can't digest is the difficulty in finding a troop among the others and in moving it effectively on the battlefield. That is, when it comes to where to move a handful of men, the control system does its duty, but when you try to implement strategies that involve studied movements, you find yourself having to fight with patterns that taste very random and a chronic inability of our soldiers to act in sync. Let's take for example the attack on a city (a very frequent eventuality): well, if you are not painstaking in planning your moves (and often even this won't be enough), you will strongly risk seeing your men stuck behind some house or in some courtyard, while the enemies have a lot of fun shooting at them. The problem is mainly due to the fact that the troops move overlapping and that, on the basis of an unclear order of precedence, when they find themselves passing through occupied areas, they do not study an alternative pathernative but they move the ~obstacle~ generating a certain chaos. Imagine a tank that has to pass through about twenty infantrymen and that forces them to move suddenly instead of looking for an alternative route. The end result is men stuck in absurd maneuvers while, perhaps, the enemy is lashing out against them when trying to implement strategies that involve studied movements, we find ourselves having to fight with patterns that smack very random and a chronic inability of our soldiers to act in sync These have been trained by Oronzo Can But we also talked about the ~lost~ troops for the map. This thing happens especially when they are in a city or in the middle of the woods. As we said, the individual soldiers are really very small and not very detailed. This involves easy ~camouflage~ (but perhaps it would be better to say confusion) with the game scenarios. Now, a summary picture of all the troops at our disposal would have been very welcome, in which to select even those off-screen or particularly hidden. Unfortunately we were not satisfied and, in some maps, before starting to make our moves, we will have to go around viewing various portions of the battlefield, to realize our actual forces. As we said before, doing this in the city is very difficult and often we realize that we have left someone behind only after a massive move or after having underlined half the map with the mouse. The strategic map at the bottom left is of very little use, given that it is small and impractical. It's never enough for me But it doesn't end there. Another element of ludic rage is the fog on the battlefield. Obviously we will only be able to see the areas where our men are (and so far nothing strange), but often their field of vision will be so limited that... it will not even allow us to see the troops who are shooting at them. It's not nice to be riddled with bullets by someone who is standing straight in front of us, on level ground, without being able to see him. This happens very often with enemy artillery that makes real massacres before being identified. Obviously the opposite is not possible since we can only fire at troops that we see. This forces us to very slow rather boring explorations, which only serve to visualize troops whose position we know perfectly. Combine it all with the uncoordinated movement of the army and the difficulty in selecting a single troop and you will understand why the extremely negative vote at the end of the article. it's not nice to be riddled with bullets by someone who is standing straight in front of us, on level ground, without being able to see him It's never enough for me There is something positive in this disaster: after all, the historical reconstruction of the strengths and weaknesses of the different troops of the three armies is well done and requires a very different tactical approach than the standard ones we are used to. For example, the ~weakness~ of the armor of the tanks of the time, which could also be damaged by simple machine guns, entails a different use of these means compared to any strategic one on the Second World War. It is also true that there are some interesting game options, such as the possibility of building trenches, obstacles for enemy troops, both on foot and on transport vehicles, which make some maps very enjoyable provided you manage to overlook the big flaws previously listed. However, I refer you to the final comment for the usual conclusions. Hardware boxes Of course, World War I doesn't require a large computer to run. The minimum configuration is truly ridiculous by current standards: a 500 MHz PIII, 128 MB of RAM and a DirectX 8.1 compatible 3D card with at least 32 MB of memory. For best gaming, boost the processor to 1.6GHz, RAM to 256MB, and double the memory on your graphics card. The case is solved. Final comment Compared to what has been said in the body of the article, there is little to add. The First World War is a production full of flaws that will not satisfy lovers of the genre accustomed to much else. The only spring that could lead to the purchase is the little-traveled historical setting, even if, to satisfy it, it would perhaps be better to buy a good history book, given that Dark Fox's work also lacks any in-depth information sheet worthy of the name. Pros Seldom used in video games Good reconstruction of war vehicles from the Great War Really runs on all computers Cons Confusing control system Troop movement bordering on frustration Bad AI The whys of a warThe First World War has never been understood by anyone. From August 4, 1914 to November 11, 1918 the greatest conflict that humanity had ever seen (until then) took place in which nations and empires arranged on all continents confronted each other. The war, to simplify to the bone, was the culmination of nationalistic drives and never fully resolved rivalries from the previous century. There were several million dead and, the conclusion of the war, pushed some nations (such as Germany and Italy) towards a crisis that would culminate and explode in the Second World War. Video games have never paid much interest to this conflict. The cause of this is probably the difficulty in simplifying and reducing everything to a clash between ~good~ and ~bad~ as it is possible to do (and is, unfortunately, regularly done) in all games set during the Second World War. In short, it is difficult to propose the rhetoric of the liberator in a conflict like this which has started the decline of Europe (a decline we are still experiencing) but which lacks a recognizable ~villain~ ... it lacks its Hitler. Video games thrive on simplifications. It is necessary that the actions of the players are motivated and directed towards a clear and incontrovertible enemy. I am not claiming that WW2 is less complex than WW1; but I am convinced that the collective imagination cannot avoid being subjected to the implicit fascination of a character like Hitler, in whom it is possible to coagulate the image of absolute evil, while it can safely ignore the diplomatic movements and the political / nationalist motivations that led to the Great War.", "date": "2006-09-11", "grade": null}
