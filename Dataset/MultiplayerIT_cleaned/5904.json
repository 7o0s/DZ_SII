Indeed, let's say better, Clandestine has one of the most original and most successful cooperative modes seen for some years now, which has the gender to which it belongs as the only limit. Before talking about the game mechanics, let's get the plot question out of the way, which is a mere plot useful to justify the infiltrations of the protagonists. We are in 1996 and in the role of the agent Katya Kozlova or the hacker Martin Symborski we will have to follow some faint traces that will lead us to the source of a series of information stolen by some mysterious characters, intent on making money on the political chaos created after the collapse of the Soviet Union. All this translates into a series of missions of progressive difficulty in which it will be necessary to penetrate environments protected by guards and various technological tools (cameras, armored doors with secret access codes and so on), using the skills of both characters. Clandestine is one of the most original co-op titles on the market. Find out with our review Agent or hacker? Clandestine has two distinct game sections with peculiar characteristics, which serve to articulate the gameplay. Using Katya, you find yourself in the role of the classic operative who must physically infiltrate the mission locations, moving silently behind guards and the like to evade them or put them out of action in more or less bloody ways (you can choose whether to kill or stun). In the tutorial at the beginning of the single player campaign it is explained how to make the most of the characteristics of the character and how to use the objects at his disposal, for example to distract his opponents. If you want you can also shoot, but the developers of Clandestine have created heavy penalties for direct combat and resorting to violence is almost never convenient. Translated into game terms, it's really easy to get killed, as it should be. Only in this way is the stealth approach favored and the gameplay makes sense. So you have to get busy and get into the mindset of a spy, favoring slow movements and trying to observe the opponents' moves before acting. The only way to cope is to anticipate dangers and move accordingly. Fortunately Katya is not alone in her mission, since she can count on the help of the skilled Martin, a hacker capable of penetrating any computer system on the face of the earth. Apparently this is a classic combination, given that we have already seen Snake and Fisher various helped by support teams ready to field all their professionalism to pave the way for him. The difference is that in Clandestine it is the player who manages this aspect directly and in real time, via a dedicated interface. This is where the Logic Artists title differentiates itself and in a sense breaks away from the competition. Martin has various tools at his disposal to do his job. On the one hand, it can connect to the enemy's computer network and violate its nodes to open firewalls, obtain passwords, access private messages and so on. On the other hand, he can enter the cameras scattered throughout the game and observe the environments before Katya's arrival, marking opponents, who will also become visible to her, and observing the other defenses present. Wishing Martin also has a text chat, with which to send messages to Katya, but the feature that makes the gameplay of Clandestine incredible is another and is not provided by the game... at least, not directly! Play with a friend In co-op mode one player takes on the role of Katya and the other as Martin. Well, now imagine the scene. The player playing Katya enters an unfamiliar environment and connects a terminal to the computer network to grant Martin access. She doesn't yet know what awaits her ahead, so she advances cautiously towards her goal. In short, he creeps warily to a corner where he is confronted with various directions to follow. Follow the corridor north? Go east? Enter the door just to the north? This is where the player comes into play as Martin, who in the meantime has taken control of some cameras and knows what's in the areas surrounding the operative spy. But how can he help Katya? Talking to give her directions, describing the enemy's moves, telling her where she should go so as not to encounter resistance, giving her access codes to locked doors, warning her of someone unexpected arriving, and so on. In short, a strong synergy is created between the players which translates into continuous communicationua, with the player who plays Katya having to constantly interface with his colleague to understand how to proceed. The gameplay of Clandestine is inseparable from this extremely engaging collaborative relationship. No game had so far managed to offer similar cooperative mechanics for a stealth title, i.e. that they worked really well as in the Logic Artists title. Where many cooperative titles actually require only the presence of the other players, i.e. without the need for direct communication outside the game, here the voice becomes an essential tool, the real plus of the entire title. It is true that it can also be played alone, managing both aspects, but the only way to fully enjoy Clandestine is with a friend, with whom you can share the joys and sorrows of the spy profession. Operational problems Unfortunately Clandestine also has some problems that penalize it a bit. The most obvious is the technical part, worthy of a PlayStation 2 title. Indeed, it is difficult that after a few hours of cooperative play one pays too much attention to the ugly human models and the woody animations, but there is no doubt that there is nothing nice to see. However we would like to clarify that this is not the most penalizing aspect of the game, which is instead the repetitiveness that emerges after finishing it. As explosive as the gameplay is when you first take on a map in co-op mode, it drops when you return to it. It is true that some elements are generated at random, but when you know the maps well, the figure of the hacker loses some of its importance. The replay value is there, but interest falls naturally. Unfortunately, the alternative would be procedurally generated maps, which however do not reconcile with the stealth genre, a genre that requires a strong map design to make the most of the game system. Clandestine is still excellent and certainly recommended if you are looking for an innovative experience, but it is shorter than what we would have hoped for.", "date": "2015-11-11", "grade": "8.7"}
