It is no mystery, on the other hand, that some houses (we're looking at you, Electronic Arts) mask real money-sucking systems behind this inviting formula, which let you play for free just enough to fascinate and then - zac! - hit the wallet under penalty of the almost total impossibility of moving forward. And what about the so-called ~pay to win~, i.e. those games, very often online, theoretically very usable by anyone but which give an enormous advantage to those willing to buy power ups, characters and so on in cash. But there is little to do, the market is buoyant, and although up to now the consoles and the software houses historically linked to them have been rather impermeable to the thing, the first failures are starting to be seen; could not, even for all the latest financial issues, escape Nintendo, which, however, as always, decides to do things its own way. A way, as we will see, at least from this point of view decidedly satisfactory. What is the free to play model chosen by Nintendo? We find out with Steel Diver: Sub Wars! We all live in a yellow Nintendo 3DS You may recall that among the launch titles of the Nintendo handset was Steel Diver, a strange hybrid between submarine simulation and action shooter, with a nice 2D side view. Certainly not the most memorable title in history, but quite entertaining and able to build its large group of supporters. For this first foray into the world of free to play, the Grande Enne has decided precisely to fish out the brand and the underwater setting, however giving a decisive change to the gameplay which is now presented in first person and totally in 3D, with a tactical component flashier than in the first title, though certainly still very arcadey. Let's go in order: having spoken in first person, you will immediately understand that on the upper screen there are the game arenas seen from the ~eyes~ of the submarine, while on the lower one the command bridge stands out in all its apparent complexity. There are many things you can do: you can move left and right, you can adjust depth and speed (three levels going forward and three ~reverse~, plus one level of stasis), you can throw normal torpedoes, which are infinite but must be reloaded after a certain number of launches, and, after locking on to a target, self-guided (these however are limited and can only be regenerated by finding some crates scattered around the level), you can use the very useful sonar to identify the various targets on the radar, you can see the world through the periscope and finally you can even use a very useful, albeit limited by the consumption of one bar, ~masker~ function which makes you totally invisible, at least until fire a shot. It all seems very complicated, and instead it takes a few seconds to acclimatize with the control systems present: whether you prefer the touch screen, the buttons (there is also support for the Circle Pad Pro) or a combination of the two, in no time it is said you will be experienced admirals, testifying to a pleasant arcade nature of the game. Arcade nature that is also reflected in the actual action: you certainly have to deal with physical elements such as inertia and the current of the water, which concern both the submarine and the normal torpedoes (don't think that simply aiming is enough to land a hit), and with the characteristics of each craft - a topic we will deal with later - but, although we have never flown one ourselves, we tend to think that controlling a real submarine is a slightly more complicated matter. And of course this, since we're talking about a console game and not an ultra-complicated PC simulation, is a good thing. I dived! All these commands will come in handy both in single player missions and in online multiplayer, the true heart of the game. There are 21 solo missions, divided into seven types, each of which has three different difficulty levels: in reality, it is not only the challenge level that changes, but the shape of the arenas and the presence/disposition of the enemies, which is why it seems right to us talk about 21 missions. That's not enough, because in addition to the basic objective, each one also has an extra one, usuallyIt is a question of completing it within a time limit, which, once satisfied, rewards you with an honor which in turn allows you to unlock new submarines with different and better characteristics. The typologies are the most varied: from the path to be carried out by hitting all the circles to the classic battle in which to eliminate all the enemies; from the confrontation with a ~boss~ up to... the Morse chat! Well yes, a nice complement to the game is the presence of the Morse code chat, which in addition to being at the center of a mission is also the means used to fraternize before an online battle. With all the limitations of the case, of course, but we know developers who would be able to build an entire game on Morse code alone. A single player therefore quite large and also quite difficult, at least if you want to complete everything with all the medals. Nonetheless, the heart of the game is the online mode: four-on-four fights with no holds barred, in arenas of the most varied form, with the possibility of choosing whether to play with only European users or from all over the world, of a similar level to the ours or without limits (the level obviously rises on the basis of our online curriculum, faithfully recorded in the Logbook, and also entitles us to new underwater vehicles). Here the title, obviously, really gives its best: the battles against human opponents present the right mix of tactics and action, alternating moments of frenzy with others that are calmer but full of tension, perhaps in ambush with the masker activated waiting for the arrival of the enemy. We read around of various lag and disconnection problems, but honestly in the many days of testing we have never had such an occurrence: based on our experience, the netcode is also promoted. The 3D effect Definitely well done, even if it won't make anyone cry for a miracle. As with all first-person games, an extra dash of visual depth is always welcome, and frame-rate doesn't drop with the stick engaged. Nevertheless, if you deactivate it or if you have a Nintendo 2DS, it is not that you will sit in a corner crying for its absence. Free to dive However, what we have described so far is the complete game, which can be purchased from the eShop at the price of 9.99 euros. So what is Nintendo's original approach to free to play? There is a free version of Sub Wars, limited in features but, surprisingly, perfectly enjoyable; a sort of large demo that gives access only to the first six missions of the single player and only to two submarines among the many present, but which allows you to enjoy the online play without any limits whatsoever. Of course, among the fifteen single missions of the full version there are some of the most successful ones, and, sure, the more advanced submarines are something else compared to the first two: stronger, more manoeuvrable, faster, with the ability to embark more crew (little men that you will find around the levels and which improve the characteristics of your personal Red October). Furthermore, by downloading the free version, none other than Peppy O'Hare of StarFox will try to convince you to take the next step, and in our house this is called ~psychological blackmail~: the fact remains that we are dealing with an extremely honest. Download for free, try extensively and, if you're passionate, then ten Euros for content, even of a certain importance, is a very justifiable expense. There are also five models of historical submarines that can each be purchased for one Euro, but their attraction lies in the fact that they are reproductions of reality and do not give any concrete advantage in online challenges. We end the review as usual with a brief account of the technical aspect, which is nothing transcendental. The graphics can sometimes even recall a Nintendo DS for polygonal modeling of some elements and cleaning of certain textures, while some effects related to the aquatic setting are very nice; the sound, for its part, is limited to doing its job, substantially average but with some effects, such as that of the sonar, of atmosphere.", "date": "2014-03-07", "grade": "7.5"}
