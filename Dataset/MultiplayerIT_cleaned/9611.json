It's true that everyone looks to Wii when they think of Nintendo's renaissance, but it's with the dual-screen console that the big N has begun to experiment with a new way of conceiving video games. And above all, it is here that he understood that the dollars of the masses are worth as much as those of the most hardcore players. They are just attracted differently. Hence the birth of series such as Nintendogs (23 million copies sold!), Professor Layton and above all Brain Training. This multimillion-dollar franchise tried to translate some theories of the eminent ~brain scientist~ Dr. Ryuta Kawashima into a video game. Thanks to some clever exercises, Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training: How Old is Your Brain? it promised to clear some of the cobwebs from our computer-, calculator-, and smartphone-numbing minds so that they would be a little brighter. Needless to say, it was a resounding success that was able to go beyond the confines of the video game world and reach the ears of mothers, grandparents and even other professors. But there was a problem: Dr. Kawashima also had to follow his academic career and could not only develop video games. So how to ride the wave of success? Obviously creating a game that resumed the same principles of Brain Training, able to entertain even without the seal of the famous luminary. Among many more or less successful clones, Nintendo has also tried to exploit the trend with Big Brain Academy. Developed by Nintendo EAD in 2005, just a few months after Brain Training, and capable of selling more than 6 million copies, the series remained in Nintendo's drawer for 14 years, after Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree sold more than 2 million copies on Wii. How will it fare on Nintendo Switch? Find out in the review of Big Brain Academy: Challenge of Minds. Train your mind At the end of each exercise of Big Brain Academy: Challenge of Minds a score will be assigned You don't have to be old wimps like us to have a more current yardstick than the Nintendo DS classics: Nintendo Switch users have already been able to remove the dust from their synapses with Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training for Nintendo Switch, released in January 2020 . In a nutshell, it is a series of mini-games (we counted 20, but others could be added through updates or hidden in the folds of the game) divided into 5 macro-groups: Intuition, Memory, Analysis, Algebra and Perception. As it is easy to understand from the name, each of these groups aims to improve a specific aspect of the mind, so as to get it back in motion and regain the lost brilliance. Amazon offer BIG BRAIN ACADEMY - Nintendo Switch 29.99 See Offer Compared to Brain Training, in this case we are faced with a much more playful structure, both in the presentation and in the choice of activities. In fact, the whole game is made with colorful doodle graphics, embellished with Animal Crossing-style verses. This makes Big Brain Academy: Challenge between minds much more captivating to approach especially for the little ones. Challenges against other players in Big Brain Academy: Contest of Minds are the most fun In addition to the colors and the ~drawings~, the exercises are very often very graphic, something that allows even the little ones to play without major limitations. The ability to choose the level of difficulty, as well as between digital and touch controls further opens the door to an unknown number of contenders, who could find themselves around the console or in front of the TV to find out who has the fittest brain. The playful presentation is not synonymous with simplicity: it is true that you have to find birds in a cage, count animals, or add flowers and balloons, but the required operation is not always immediate. In Binari pazziti, for example, you have to complete the route of a train by choosing the missing ~pieces~. All very simple, except that at higher difficulty levels not only are the paths more intricate, but the chessboard will be presented from different angles or the path will have to be built starting from the bottom. In Cubolandia you have to count the blocks shown on the screen: from 1 to 10 they are all capable, but when there are more than 30 it will not be easy to guess the right number in a few fractions of seconds. Multiplayer Big Brain Academy: Contest of Minds also has an online multiplayer mode The heart of Big Brain Academy: Contest of Minds thus becomes the party game experience. The present exercises, however entertaining, may not have appeal for a long time. Okay unlockThere are clothes and accessories to spruce up your avatar, increasingly difficult exercises and it's also okay to challenge the brainiacs online with performances, but after a while the exercises will begin to repeat themselves a bit. Different, however, is the multiplayer challenge. Thanks to the ability to customize the level of challenge before each minigame, it will be quite easy to find the right balance between the participants. Grandma is a dragon with sudoku, but has the grandson just started arithmetic? One will be a beginner, while the other will place the elite level. Are the children pro players, while the last video game dad picked up was Pong? The parent uses the console's touch controls, while the youngsters use the Joy-Con. With a little tricks, the challenges will always be balanced and consequently fun until the end. The fact that calculation capacity, lateral thinking and memory are being exercised are also bonuses that could push parents who are more rigid or less accustomed to video games to make an exception to the rule. Technique The style of Big Brain Academy: Challenge of Minds is very recognizable As we have said, no one would buy Big Brain Academy: Challenge of Minds for its technical sector. This is not to say that the game is not very clear and functional. More than beautiful to look at, for this kind of game it is important to be able not to put obstacles in front of the player: it must be readable in every situation, without too many colors or frills, especially when there are 4 players sharing the same screen. In this the Nintendo product works very well and guarantees an always fair challenge, even for the little ones.", "date": "2021-12-01", "grade": "8.0"}
