Starting with the famous Pub Games that accompanied the second chapter, each episode was linked to a game that allowed you to accumulate money to then spend with the packaged product coming out near Christmas. The next Fable: The Journey for Kinect is no exception, which will also be Peter Molyneux's last collaboration with Lionhead, since he has now gone on the hunt for new adventures. Fable Heroes, unlike its predecessors, however, does not try to integrate with the economic or gameplay structure of the final game, but rather distances itself from it with the dignity of a title that could very well stand on its own, an action game , an almost slash'em up scrolling that sees up to four players participate in a slaughter through the most famous locations in Albion. Sword passing you The structure of Fable Heroes is anything but trivial. The protagonists of the game are embroidered rag puppets, it must be said, on the likeness of all the most famous characters of the entire saga, including, of course, the Hero who is represented armed with a shield and sword. The action always and in any case requires that there are four characters on the screen and, if there are no friends within reach of the pad or that you are not playing on Xbox Live, the console's CPU moves them. Starting from a map that closely resembles those of a Super Mario with different boxes representing the explorable worlds that are gradually unlocked, you access some of the most famous locations in the saga, such as Bowerstone or the desert city of Aurora, each made with a delightful style halfway between subtle textures and cell shading. The puppets all have two shots, the fast one and the other that corresponds to the choreographic moves typical of Fable and are distinguished between close shots and characters who, instead, cast spells at a distance or strike with firearms. The screen is soon crowded with Balverini and Hobbe, generating a chaos of no small importance and transforming the action, and this is perhaps the biggest flaw of the game, into a simple and continuous button mashing, i.e. continuous pressing of buttons with very little strategy. The two blows, in fact, do not combine and, given the relative ease of the game, he soon falls back on just the quick attack, while often his character is surrounded by total confusion. There is also an area move that consumes one of the hearts of energy, but there is very little need for it, even when, after the main stages, you start over in the evil version of the world, which should be more difficult , but which is not by much. However, longevity is helped by the fact that each level forks towards the end, leading the player to choose whether to face a boss fight or rather a sort of company mini-game, modeled on some of the more classic ones seen in games such as Mario Party, so to speak. When you die, you turn into a stuffed ghost who has the only drawback of not being able to collect the coins that stack up (the graphic effect is really nice) in hoards to be collected on the fly, perhaps resorting to the somersault that also serves to avoid enemy attacks, since there is no parry. This excessive simplification goes against the trend with Fable's combat system which has always provided for firearms, magic and melee shots to be combined as desired and quickly, with a fair variety of solutions. Precisely here that it is a question of, almost, just fighting, greater depth would certainly have helped a game which, however, in four is joyous. Xbox 360 goals Fable Heroes is one of the first titles to give a whopping 400 points to the player and it does so sparingly. In fact, finishing the levels leads to achieving less than half of them and to get to the total, you have to replay even in the dark version of the world and fulfill all the objectives that lead to unlocking the second row of boxes on the board Coins for what? As mentioned, one of the things that catches the eye almost immediately is this tinkling of coins that stack up in a way that has never been seen in a video game. The problem is wondering what all this is for, apart from the possibility of transferring them to the assets that will be spent in Fable: The Journey. Every time you finish a level, a winner is decreed among the four puppets based on the money collected and for each accumulation step, there are four, you get a dice roll to make in what is in all respects a kind of game of the goose. There are no malus, but only boxes on which to finish and buy upgrades for the character, upgrades ranging from better weaponsiori, to increased movement speed in fights, up to perks that increase the damage inflicted on different types of enemies. By carrying out sub-missions and unlocking a series of objectives, the board is enriched with another series of boxes on which to further enhance the heroes and greatly extend the replayability. Even when playing alone, these upgrades can be bought and managed for other characters (there are four selectable at the start, by playing six more are unlocked, plus two more that will be unlocked by playing The Journey and all of them can be hung on the cart), given that at any time you can decide to change the puppet to move and given that you can transfer money from one to all 'other to shop. The feeling of being in a party game increases in the levels thanks to the chests that activate random bonuses or penalties on the players and thanks to those that give extra temporary powers, essential for scoring more points or losing less energy. Without forgetting the quality of the sound commentary (the soundtrack is beautiful as usual) and of the graphics that are more reminiscent of packaged productions than those of digital delivery, aided by the price which is attractive in any case.", "date": "2012-05-04", "grade": "7.0"}
