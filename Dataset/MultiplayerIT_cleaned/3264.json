{"name": "The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-walking-dead-saints-sinners-recensione.html", "text": "Perhaps this game shouldn't even exist since it was born and grew up in an absolutely atypical context. The development team was in fact set up by two cross-media companies, Skydance Media and Skybound Entertainment which mainly deal with cinema (Star Trek In To Darkness. World War Z, the next Top Gun: Maverick), TV series (Altered Carbon, Jack Ryan), animated films, comics and video games. These two entities are the typical production houses that try to do everything and succeed in little, let alone pull a quality video game out of the hat. We have seen quite a few in the past, Dreamworks for example, but perhaps never like these two: Skydance in fact is moving very well and Skybound, a company founded by the creators of the universe of The Walking Dead of which it naturally holds the precious rights , with equal shrewdness and passion. It's Skybound resurrecting Telltale to finish the final season of The Walking Dead game, helping Beamdog deliver remastered versions of Baldur's Gate and co. to consoles. A few years ago the company also jumped into VR, thus laying the foundations for this surprising title and therefore for the review of The Walking Dead Saints & Sinners. Parallel dimension Do you think we fired it big? Not at all because despite some trimming we had never come across a game designed specifically for virtual reality so mature, so dense, so intense. Take for example Resident Evil 7 and its VR version (inexplicably never arrived on PC): the Capcom one is clearly a great game, one of those with the highest budget to try with a headset on, but it is also forced to work on a normal television and equally normal control systems, and this terribly limits its scenographic and gameplay potential. The Walking Dead Saints & Sinners on the contrary was conceived from the very first moment as a virtual adventure, allowing it to exploit all or almost all the possibilities granted by this technology. First of all, we will be able to manipulate each object and weapon with realism, that is to say that to open the inventory it will be necessary to take a virtual backpack from our shoulders, to use the flashlight we will have to remove it from our jacket and the same goes for the notebook with the missions, the latter positioned in the right shirt pocket. Also to reload the weapons it is necessary to interact directly on them, a key is not enough as in other games and under pressure this change has rather important repercussions, and which make identification, terror and consequently the fun soar. In normal games, the protagonists are often super heroes capable of extreme multitasking, just like in reality here instead we only have our two arms available and we'll have to make them enough: imagine advancing slowly in a dark room with a torch in your left hand and the pistol in your right hand, suddenly you have to take a look at the notebook realizing however that if you put the flashlight away you will find yourself almost in the dark, on the contrary by sheathing the weapon you will inevitably be unarmed, what to do at this point? You look around, you strain your ears for any suspicious noise, and then you act accordingly. Specific weight The developers of The Walking Dead Saints & Sinners have gone a step further by trying to convey to the user the weight of the objects that will be held, succeeding brilliantly: by moving a heavy object, the movement of the arm and hand will be slower, less responsive and when it stops, the object will tend to sway, also moving the wrist. For obvious reasons, this does not physically happen in reality, yet they are gimmicks that work terribly well, especially when we are dealing with rather heavy white weapons. For example, an ax can also be used with one hand, in some cases we may even be forced by events to do so, but in doing so we will hardly be able to exert enough force to split the skull of a zombie, which will respond to blows simply by stepping back ; moreover, with each swing of the weapon, its heaviness will force the wrist of our virtual arm to continue its run, making us slow and awkward. However, as soon as we put both hands on the handle, the inertia of the blows will be reduced to almost zero and, with a nice clear movement, it will finally be possible to open the skullcaps and cut off the heads of the dearly departed, provided that we peck the neck at the right height. The firearms are made quite well, but fail to convey the same galvanizing feeling. What if a zombie grabs you? You'll have to scrollphysically get him off your back otherwise his bite will take away part of your energy, at least until you have used the right medikit. New Orleans sinks The Walking Dead Saints & Sinners is an adventure with a rather elastic structure: New Orleans as reproduced in the game is now almost totally flooded, except for the ten areas that we will be able to explore more or less freely by carrying out main and secondary missions, as well as exploring in search of objects that allow us to take advantage of the interesting crafting system. The weapons that we will be able to create ourselves are in fact much more effective and durable than those that will be found around, but they are not that easy to assemble. Furthermore, in this game the backpack doesn't have enough space for everything and we won't be able to wander around indefinitely: running, fighting, climbing we will consume stamina and over time it will be increasingly difficult to restore it without eating something first; then at night things become unmanageable and we will therefore be forced to return to base before it is too late. It is therefore a real first-person action role-playing game, also equipped with excellent graphics: exactly like the comic and the previous games, the scenarios aim at realism while the characters and zombies more closely resemble the its origins from comics. The final effect is excellent, as are the controls but with one big, huge, gigantic exception: crouching to silence requires a button, any attempt to do it physically will not only make us enter stealth mode, but with our crouching the entire game world will follow us towards the ground, an effect that those who know VR know well can give rise to terrible feelings of disorientation. The developers are fortunately already at work to put a patch on this gross error: while we write there is already a patch in beta version to be downloaded via Steam, and which represents only a first step in enabling physical stealth and in solving the problems associated with the his lack. For the moment, just know it and avoid trying.", "date": "2020-02-05", "grade": "8.5"}
