Bewildered, alone, they wander the world, souls in pain, arousing disgust and respect in the living at the same time. The dead who rise to punish us for our sins without expecting us in the afterlife are still strong in our imagination. But the Zombie Apocalypse may have exhausted its first wave of energy. The theme of man forced to choose between survival, at the cost of degradation, and the salvation of his humanity, at the cost of his life, has been explored in abundance. And among the works that have investigated this theme in the most convincing way, it is right to mention The Walking Dead, both the comic and the video game. The latter in particular managed to express himself by exploiting the unique qualities of his medium and therefore, at least in our opinion, deserves to free himself from Kirkman's legacy to live as an autonomous work, without always having to deal with the superb source of inspiration . Well, it could have ended here, but if not even the great champions know how to stop at the pinnacle of success, it is understandable that a company must raise cash to continue to survive (but once again, at what price?). Here then is that Telltale announces the second season of The Walking Dead and, opening its ravenous jaws, releases a paid DLC that should act as a bridge between the first and second series. It seems that the choices made previously echo in this expansion (even if it didn't seem that much to us) but above all that the decisions made during this interlude weigh on the events to come. In fact, the five protagonists of 400 Days form the new group of the second season, although the presence or absence of a particular member could change depending on how we behave now. Is it worth a peek into the future of next season? Let's find out together, approaching a bulletin board outside a gas station, on which photos of some missing people are hung. Five of these are in colour. It's up to us to choose which one to examine first. 400 Days is just a long interactive trailer for the next season that takes five euros from us give me five The events of the five characters of 400 Days take place within the first four hundred days of the new era in which the dead have ceased to rest forever. Even though we enter their lives at moments apart from each other, these people's lives are connected to each other and all revolve around a gas station in Georgia. An intriguing prospect, even if - we are sorry to say - this time Telltale has sinned of presumption. The talent of the screenwriters is undeniable: in a few minutes we are hooked by each of the five stories, but the narrator limits himself to yanking us here and there for a scant fifteen minutes and finally abandons us. These aren't stories, they're slivers of stories. Beacons that come on to focus on the personalities of the characters long enough to force us - and therefore them - to make an irreversible choice. Then the darkness returns to suck up their sketchy lives. And not all choices are touching. Vince's, for example, falls within the sphere of external needs and does not seem to touch his deep chords. Perhaps only Bonnie, the former drug addict, manages to make us uncomfortable, precisely because she is forced to make a choice that reveals which demons torment her. The long-haired Wyatt is ambiguous, but his story is too uncertain to captivate us. The rest of the cast travels paths already known. After such an intense and painful season of The Walking Dead, with a perfect and terrible epilogue together, there is little left to explore in terms of feelings in the world devastated by the awakening of the dead. The fight to defend loved ones, the group leaders who become jailers, the theft of supplies and the lunatics who first give you a ride in their car and then prove to be cold-blooded killers are now familiar events to long-time players, all the more so if they loved comic book pages first. Furthermore, these five fragments speak of individual lives which, like rivers flowing into the same sea, are destined to merge once the group is formed, as seen at the end of the expansion. So what's left of this DLC? Just a taste of their personalities and the echo of a choice that will, at some point, resonate again in season two. The world to come But whose hand is it that picks up the photos one by one from the bulletin board at the gas station? It only turns out at the end. He could be the new lead of the group, but we doubt it. It may well be that the main hero of the second season is already among those five. Or maybeand we'll switch from one to the other, which would be a welcome change, since playing some of them feels uncomfortable and is a new sensation for a player. We'll see. Without anticipating too much we just tell you that from the end of the expansion it would seem that in the next season we will meet many people, and perhaps the story will take place in a town rather than traveling. From a graphic point of view there are no changes: the style is always the same and the production still has to deal with the limits of a small studio. It is also true that 400 Days was advertised as DLC for the first season, so something may change in the second. The game system has remained identical and, despite efforts to propose some other type of interaction, such as the scene of Bonnie's escape, we are still faced with trivial quick time events, perhaps even rarer than usual as regards moments of action, while we have a lot of space to indulge ourselves in the dialogues. It could be argued that the developers make us intervene in seemingly secondary but actually intimate moments for the protagonists, such as during the card game between Shel and his sister. This is true, they are appreciable refinements, but the fact remains that we are more often spectators than actors. Once again there is the case that it is a legacy of the first series suffocated by the limited time of the expansion, which must leave more room than usual for the hidden director. Hard to say, because this is an abnormal product. With 400 Days, Telltale has packaged a very long interactive trailer and put it on sale for five euros, boasting the presence of five stories, when in reality it is just five cinematic cuts artfully directed to tickle the player's curiosity. Had it been offered as a gift to those who already owned the first series or bought the second season in bulk, we would have applauded it as a sign of thanks to the fans. So it's just an inelegant attempt to get into their wallets.", "date": "2013-07-10", "grade": null}
