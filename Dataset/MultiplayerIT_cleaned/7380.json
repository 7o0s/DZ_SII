Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. We had tried it some time ago, but we wanted to wait for the various updates to transform Respawnables into the product it is today, or a third person shooter capable of involving many people on iOS and Android, despite the fact that it has been a while since the release of the first version. Fixed presence in the rankings of the most downloaded titles, both on the App Store and on Google Play, the game puts us in the role of a mercenary who has to face a series of opponents within three settings, for a total of six different stages. The experience can be enjoyed in single player, thanks to a campaign made up of a certain number of increasingly complex missions, but it was in fact designed for multiplayer, so much so that the single player stages only play the role of tutorial compared to the online action, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with the mechanisms that regulate the gameplay, primarily the control system. Entirely based on the touch screen, the controls of Respawnables are of the traditional type, with a virtual analog stick on the left and one on the right, which respectively allow you to move the character and manage the aiming reticle. Unfortunately, among the various customization options, the one we would have liked most is not present, which is an automatic fire function that pulls the trigger for us when we frame an enemy. Despite this lack, it must be said that the separate key proves to be quite functional and that, above all, it puts all players on the same level and with the same difficulties in attacking the opponent instantly. It is even possible to opt for a layout that provides for the activation of fire via double tap, but in this case we really didn't like the solution adopted by the developers. Respawnables is a staple in multiplayer TPS for iOS and Android devices Group fortress The style adopted by Digital Legends for Respawnables clearly recalls that of another famous free to play shooter, Team Fortress 2. The characters and settings in fact boast a design very similar to that seen in the Valve title, with bright colors, squat figures and the feeling of being in the middle of a cartoon. It is a pity that we have chosen not to enhance single player missions in any way, given the presence of such a solid structure in support of the experience, but it must be admitted that the multiplayer works very well, with quick and effective matchmaking, as well as comparisons that are rarely marred by the presence of excessive latency. In short, it is possible to shoot enemies and eliminate them without too many problems, net of skills and equipment. And here we open a dutiful parenthesis, because as a good freemium product Respawnables cannot escape the concept of ~pay to win~, i.e. a situation in which users who pay to buy weapons and upgrades find themselves at an advantage over those who have no intention of shell out real money. The very nature of the game lends itself to this interpretation, therefore such repercussions are unfortunately inevitable, even if during our games we have never been led to think that we have no hope against certain opponents: there was always the feeling of being able to play it in some way. After all, even ~free~ users have the opportunity to collect experience points and virtual money, unlock improvements for their character and buy better weapons, they simply take a little more time and effort than those who want everything and right away.", "date": "2013-12-28", "grade": "7.8"}
