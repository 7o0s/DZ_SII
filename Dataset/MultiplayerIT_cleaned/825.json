{"name": "Biomutant", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/biomutant-recensione-titolo-thq-nordic.html", "text": "After an extraordinary number of postponements also for the video game sector, Biomutant is finally among us, bringing with it all the great expectations and the enormous unknowns of this very long development. We spent about thirty hours in the company of Experiment 101's action RPG, the first work of a team actually made up of veterans, which surprised us above all for its scope and its beating heart, although it sinned in numerous details. Before telling you our impressions in this review, it is good to remember how inappropriate it is to put Biomutant on the same level as the open world blockbusters we have been accustomed to in recent years by gigantic teams and popular franchises. The project's ambitions are huge, but Biomutant isn't that game; Experiment 101 is not that team, and its relatively small size accounts for many of the project's limitations. The story of a raccoon Biomutant is above all a great declaration of love to the world, to nature, to biodiversity, and an indictment of all the harm that man is causing to the planet. In an undefined future, humanity is now a distant memory, unable to evolve and survive its own mistakes. Animal species have instead evolved, new ones have been born, and some of those we already know have changed to become surrogates of our past. We move in this panorama, a sort of anthropomorphic raccoon raised with a strong discipline and sense of honour. Following a series of tragic events - which we will experience firsthand thanks to playable flashbacks of dubious quality and fluctuating rhythm - we will find ourselves without memory to retrace our path in search of the one who ruined our lives. To do this we will be called to explore a vast post-apocalyptic world in which the territories are divided between different clans and is safeguarded by the World Tree, a clear reference to that Yggdrasil of Nordic memory. Biomutant: Powers are as diverse as they are not always useful The Tree is dying, slowly extinguished due to the presence in the four corners of the map of as many World Eaters, enormous creatures thirsting for life and death that we will be called upon to defeat. During our journey we will be able to decide which factions to join, which clans to declare war, and every moral choice we make will tip our bar towards light or darkness. Precisely this aspect will totally change the cards on the table, giving the possibility to radically change things and even decide not to save the Tree, but to destroy it together with the world as we know it. During the main campaign, which can be completed in one fifteen hours without giving weight to secondary tasks, we will be able to explore different biomes, some splendid and luxuriant, others destroyed by the actions of the so-called ~Mondochefu~. Although I have not yet verified all the differences that exist by following one moral rather than the other, it is clear that the Experiment 101 guys have tried to give weight to their choices, and the presence of different endings, as well as the changes to the interactions with world and factions, are elements that clarify the will of the team from a role-playing point of view. Animal gameplay Biomutant: references to past cultures are always present As for the actual gameplay, Biomutant is an action RPG done and finished and, as such, it allows you to create your own character starting, literally, from his DNA. You can choose the class, the features and even the specific initial resistances, but what characterizes the Biomutant editor is precisely the possibility of going to modify the genetic code of your alter ego, and the customization of some statistics will also define its characteristics physical - such as height, musculature or the size of the skull. Completed the editor we are immediately launched into a short dungeon that serves as a tutorial, and during which you can become familiar with some of the peculiar characteristics of the title. The more you advance, the more items are unlocked within the Biomutant menu, reaching an almost overwhelming amount of options. During the exploration it is possible to open a good amount of chests, bags, shelves and lockers, all useful for recovering loot which varies from new pieces of clothing, up to weapons and modifications for them. Biomutant: there is no shortage of emotional moments, despite a fluctuating direction From the point of view of personalizing your inventory, Biomutant can be considered more than complete, also considering the possibility of going through a well-structured crafting section right from the start.at the very first hours. To each weapon and to each dress it will be possible to add particular characteristics dictated by the object with which we decide to personalize them, for example being able to use a broomstick as a handle for a sword, or a radioactive object can make one's own weapon even more lethal. The possibilities are really many and all in line with the philosophy of the game: fun, but constantly stimulating to think. Defeating enemies, completing main and side missions and recovering certain objects will obviously level you up. With each increase, you are rewarded with a characteristic point to spend on one of the main ones - the classic vitality, movement, luck, etc. - and occasionally it will be possible to accumulate different types of skill points. The latter can be spent on the relevant trees and will correspond to a specific characteristic. The active and passive skills that can be unlocked are different, especially as regards psionic powers and passive talents to be exploited in battle. Speaking of the combat system, Biomutant expresses all the quality and superficiality of its production. Shooting or using white weapons is fun and, once you have learned some skills and become familiar with the movements of your alter ego, it is possible to open up to dances of a certain level. The problem is all in the depth and feedback of the hits. Also thanks to a deficient artificial intelligence, you will often find yourself using those two or three moves to quickly get rid of your opponent. Not to mention that there are few really useful powers that contribute in a functional (and not just stylistic) way to the clashes. Biomutant: to infinity and beyond! Complicating the situation is the level design of the dungeons, the environmental puzzles and the use of means of transport. Everything in Biomutant makes us perceive this strange double nature: on the one hand the desire to do many things and all in a big way, on the other hand the awareness of having to compromise with the resources at one's disposal. The structure of the various labyrinths is so basic that an indoor location will hardly remain impressed or leave you with any positive vibrations, while secondary paths do not stimulate the sense of discovery, but only give the impression of wanting to stretch a broth perhaps made of too many ingredients . Even the means of transport suffer a bit from this same approximation: although they are fun and widely customizable, the impossibility of deciding where and when to use them and some interpenetration and animation problems only lead the player to prefer their own paws. In short, everything affects the structure and the general success a bit, leaving a bad taste in the mouth for what could have been, and which instead is reduced to yet another fun open world but unable to shine among the others. Technically speaking Biomutant: Friends are everything in the world of Biomutant Biomutant thrives on splendid highs and unquestionable lows, as often happens in productions with great ambitions. Stylistically speaking, the game is a pearl: the different biomes, the atmospheric agents, the day-night cycle and the care for some aspects demonstrates obsessive attention. There are times that it's hard to think that such a rich open world comes from such a small team. At the same time, all this richness must necessarily come down to compromises: compromises that can be seen in the scarce interaction with the environments, in the constant reproposition of assets that are always very similar, and less repetitive and uninspired interior environments. But also in the directorial aspect, with poor kinematics both in terms of staging and impact, and which reach their lowest point during the various flashbacks. Even the most emotional moments, those that should move and create empathy for the characters, are presented in such a rough way as to leave one indifferent, to the point that one becomes more attached to the dying world than to the protagonists of the story. The moral choices really change the result, but you will hardly feel guilty, due to a directing, dialogue and rhythm work that deserved a better direction. Biomutant: time to exterminate! The whole game is in fact narrated by an off-screen voice - and totally dubbed in Italian - which can be contained through a choice in the menu, but which unfortunately cannot effectively accompany such an adventure. The effect is that of a bedtime story, but applied to every single line of dialogue for a game capable of lasting dozens of hours. The sound and musical accompaniment does not help, which draws inspiration from the oriental atmospheres that inspire the game but it is inable to leave an imprint or to enhance the most important moments. Finally, given the doubts that emerged in the days leading up to the release of the game, we can feel comfortable reassuring you regarding optimization, at least based on our experience. Biomutant performed beautifully on PC, played at 1440p and never dropped below 60 frames per second.", "date": "2021-05-24", "grade": "7.5"}
