{"name": "Rogue Spirit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rogue-spirit-recensione.html", "text": "In recent years, the proliferation of the roguelike genre (or roguelite, for those who prefer the distinction) has been quite evident. Just searching for the word ~rogue~ on Steam brings up almost eight thousand results. Not all of them belong to the genre derived from the 1980 Epix title, but there is no doubt that there are indeed many around. Some would say too many, but let's skip it. Procedurally generated maps, two distinct progressions (one in the game and the other made up of permanent boosts that spread over the entire game), often very advanced character customization and a generally very high level of challenge (complete with permanent death) are some of the traits that characterize what has now become a real fetish genre of the independent scene, which has really re-interpreted it in all its guises, almost to the point of paroxysm. In the Rogue Spirit review we try to understand how the Kids With Sticks team tried to stand out from the tide, with a game launched in early access about a year and a half ago and now arrived at its 1.0 version. The premise of Rogue Spirit Coins are collected by playing, there are no microtransactions in Rogue Spirit In Rogue Spirit you play the ethereal role of the ghost of Prince Midra, called to defeat the armies of chaos practically alone. In reality as a spirit he would be completely helpless, were it not for the fact that he is able to possess the bodies of dead humans, assuming their appearance and abilities. We are in feudal Japan, and to explain the situation to him we find some monks of a remote monastery, who send him practically alone to face the enemy, giving him support made up of paid skills, paid familiars and paid extra features (this trend of video game dealers to raise the prices of the shops even in the face of the possible end of the world we will never understand it). He can't die anyway, so they aren't really worried about his health and still want to make money on it. At most, the race to explore the ten large levels, divided into five biomes, which make up the game world, will have to start over from the beginning. Extra abilities can be collected around the procedurally generated maps Possessing the bodies of enemies is as easy as pressing a key. However, don't expect Messiah-like refinements, because here the bodies are only objects to be used to fight and to be evaluated as such. Incidentally, a large part of the game time is spent looking at the values of the corpses to decide whether or not to change the body already in use. Considering that possession of enemies is also the main way to heal, you will understand that it is a central system for the entire game experience, even if in the advanced stages you tend to become more conservative, trying to keep the best bodies as much as possible. as long as possible. Combat system The bosses are the best part of the game, though not too challenging The combat system itself is very simple and straightforward. The action is in real time and the characters are viewed in third person. Each enemy has its own basic attack and secondary attack. In total, there are eighteen enemy types to own and use, ranging from beefy, claw-wielding beasts to nimble female warriors wielding a bow or razor-sharp fans. It must be said that the variety is not very high, a problem that is felt in particular when you get to the last levels after very long game sessions. Even the combat system itself creates a certain weariness with time. At the beginning, little attention is paid to it, because it is still in the phase in which everything is very difficult to do, one often dies and approaches enemies with a certain circumspection. However, when you begin to have some familiarity with the mechanics, you understand by heart the functioning of the bodies and you have acquired many fixed skills, you realize that despite the eighteen usable fighting styles and despite the transient active and passive skills that they are collected from the sanctuaries scattered throughout the maps, the techniques to be used to move forward are always more or less the same, also because the enemy's attack patterns become easily predictable (they are not very intelligent, let's face it). Having said that Rogue Spirit never gets too easy, although it is never really difficult, but the difficulty of the advanced stages is determined more by the damage done by the opponents with a single hit and by their quantity, than by the remodulation of their attack patterns. However, the gameplay never becomes unbearable, but a bit of repetitiveness takes over. The five bosses, enemies from the cards, take care of breaking up the action a bitattack mes, stronger than normal opponents and whose bodies are not possessable (also because they are very large). Their greater resistance and the uniqueness of their moves make them particularly interesting, because they require different approaches depending on the possessed body. Without giving big advances, we can say for example that facing the first boss with a strong but slow body requires you to develop a good ability with parries, while facing him with a weaker but fast body allows you to play everything on dodging and attacks quick. Nothing revolutionary, conceptually, but at least it's something different. The stealth mechanics Between one level and another is a passage area that allows you to shop and heal yourself by spending spirit Rogue Spirit also integrates a very simple stealth system, which paradoxically makes traversing levels faster. Midra's ghostly form can be summoned during gameplay with the press of a button. The advantages in doing so are many, not only because he is faster in the movements of human bodies, he can see hidden objects and can use an orientation skill that tells him the way to follow to reach the end of the level (complete with a directional line that appears in the game world), but also because it is less detectable and can display the vision cones of enemies. In this way it is not only possible to understand when you are within their range of action, but also to act to get behind them and carry out often lethal attacks by quickly returning to the possessed body. The paradox, of course, is that usually the collective imagination links the stealth mechanics of slower game moments, when instead here the exact opposite happens, a trend that is furthermore favored by some fixed skills that can be purchased in the temple area which make Midra even less detectable and increased sneak attack damage. Without infamy and without praise Technically Rogue Spirit isn't bad, but there's nothing particularly exciting about it From a technical and stylistic point of view Rogue Spirit is without infamy and without praise. The cartoon style is not bad, but it inevitably tastes like it has already been seen. The 3D models are adequate, but have relatively weak characterisation, with strong references to some Japanese stereotypes and nothing more. The bosses do a little better, but without too much imagination. Basically they are represented as the opposite of their nature. For example Famine, the first boss, is portrayed as a fat and voracious woman. In general, there is nothing really despicable, with the maps which, despite the random generation, offer a really pleasant glance, but there is also nothing that stands out for particular authorial choices. Let's say that this is the underlying philosophy of the entire project, very careful never to go beyond the boundaries it has set itself. In the end it is impossible to say that it failed, but the feeling is always that something notable is missing due to an excess of control, with the experience that is solid, but at the same time destined for rapid archiving in memory once concluded .", "date": "2023-03-14", "grade": "7.5"}
