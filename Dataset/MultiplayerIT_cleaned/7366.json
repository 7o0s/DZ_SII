Raiden belongs precisely to this category of subjects, but has chosen to make his skills available to protect the weak, and so he moves from one part of the world to another as an agent of Maverick Securities, coordinated by colleagues Boris Popov, Kevin Washington and Courtney Collins, as well as German scientist Wilelm ~Doktor~ Voight. Unfortunately, during a mission in an African state, things take a bad turn and Raiden is faced with the ruthless members of the Desperado, an organization that aims to destabilize nations to generate conflicts from which to profit. The duel with Jetstream Sam, in particular, proves fatal for the protagonist of the game, who is seriously injured and is saved only thanks to the last-minute intervention of his companions. A few weeks later, having undergone new and more invasive cybernetic interventions, Raiden is however ready to return to the field, stronger than ever and determined to follow in the footsteps of the Desperado to destroy it. Almost a year after its release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, here is Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance debuting on PC with the traditional ~superior version~, which is not only sold on Steam at a very attractive price (19.99 euro) but natively includes the Blade Wolf, Jetstream and VR Mission DLCs, as well as a series of extra skins for the protagonist (White Armor, Inferno Armor, Commando Armor, the Metal Gear Solid 4 skin and the Cyborg Ninja skin). Viuleeeeeenz We all remember the genesis of this project, born as an episode of Metal Gear Solid, albeit an alternative one, and then became a ~pure~ action spin-off when Kojima Productions entrusted its development to the expert hands of Platinum Games, the team behind games like Bayonetta, Vanquish and Anarchy Reigns, therefore an expert in representing the dynamics that belonged to the unforgettable genre of scrolling fighting games, enhancing every blow thrown by the characters and inserting highly spectacular sequences into the mix. All ingredients that also find a place in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, which immediately proves to be really excellent in alternating different opponents, involving us in frenetic duels and introducing interesting innovations such as the ~bullet time~ for use and consumption of the sword, with which literally shredding enemies and possibly tearing out their ~robotic innards~, an operation that allows you to restore vital energy and increase the traditional fury bar. On PC, once the Xbox 360 controller is connected, this mode is entered by pressing the left trigger and then making the cuts using the right analog stick or a combination of the X and Y keys, respectively for the horizontal and vertical slashes. There are basically two problems that emerge after a few minutes of play: the first is a management of the view that is anything but punctual, and which despite the lock-on function on the target puts us in a position to often and willingly fight ~blindly~ , at least until we can put our hand back on the right stick to center it; the second is a general lack of references regarding the combos, which can be ~purchased~ using the credits earned on missions (in the same screen from which it is possible to upgrade weapons, buy new ones - where available - and change the skin of the character) but which are never properly introduced and valued, with the result of perhaps ignoring their existence until we go to check the list of moves from the pause menu. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a must buy for PC owners who are passionate about the genre Parade yes, parade no Another problem of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, at least as far as our personal interpretation is concerned, concerns the solution adopted by the developers to carry out the parade. In fact, it is not a question of pressing a back button when someone tries to hit us, but of combining the ~light~ attack button (in this case X) and the left analog stick in the direction of the impact, obtaining an opening of the enemy guard where the maneuver is managed with perfect timing. It is not a matter of feeling, given that after a while you get used to this system, but rather the suspicion that this setting represents a concession with respect to the accessibility of the experience, given that in fact you don't even need to carefully observe your opponents to understand when they are per launch your own blow, but just press the attack and the analog stick repeatedly to get a practically automatic guard on every occasion, or alternatively a normal combo. In short, the risk is that everything turns into the most vulgar of ~button mashing~, precisely because as a strategy it proves to be successful, even at the expense of balancing the difficulty (at the normal level a shrewd player could never run into game over). The management of the special weapons, which are obtained by defeating certain bosses, clashes a bit with the development of the sword combos (the use of which remains assigned to the X button) but we appreciated the particular diversification of each tool: the spear that is poses as an excellent ~all round~ weapon, the sais that represent the fast but not very effective alternative, the heavy double blades that express all their power with each blow, and so on. Much less brilliant, on the other hand, is the solution adopted for grenades and missile launchers, which turn out to be cumbersome and slow to use, so much so that you will find yourself practically never using them during the game. Finally, let us spend a few words also on the narrative component. Being a project linked to Hideo Kojima and the Metal Gear Solid franchise, the presence of themes such as freedom, bioethics and personal choices was to be expected for Revengeance. The point is that we are dealing with a spin-off action, and these long pipponi (allow us the term) via codec - which in a different context would also have been appreciable - inevitably break the rhythm of the action, so much so that more than one occasion will seem to be in the classic situation where you are about to do something and your cell phone rings. Except it's Raiden's. The PC version Small preamble: we are increasingly seeing the opening towards the PC platform by publishers generally accustomed to producing exclusively console titles. It is no coincidence, and with the advent of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One we will see a proliferation of operations of this kind, to the benefit of the Windows platform due to the many similarities with the next gen architecture but with hardware on the superior card. In short, we will be able to enjoy titles natively designed for components of a certain level, and which on personal computers will boast further improvements in terms of frame rate, definition and effects. How does Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance stand in relation to this reasoning? Well but not very well, in the sense that the development was born on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on the occasion of the PC debut, the guys from Platinum Games clearly didn't invest in a texture resampling job (if it was possible to do it), which therefore remain in low resolution, and opted for the traditional pre-rendered kinematics which increase the weight of the download without adding quality, indeed often showing lower graphics than the in-game one. The design of the characters and their animations undoubtedly represent the strong point of this production which, however, aiming for sixty frames per second even in the original format, inevitably ends up neglecting the scenarios, which are often bare and devoid of personality. The polygonal count has remained unchanged in the new version, with all that follows from it, even if the fluidity in this case finds no compromises (whereas on consoles, PlayStation 3 in particular, there were quite evident drops) and there is the advantage of the highest resolution, as well as adjustments that allow a certain scalability of the experience towards medium-low-end configurations. In short, we are faced with the usual ~superior version~, even relatively sparing in terms of requirements, but the ~boost~ compared to the console editions is not very marked. The matter relating to the convenience of the offer is different, which at this price and with all the extra contents is not to be missed.", "date": "2014-01-13", "grade": "8.0"}
