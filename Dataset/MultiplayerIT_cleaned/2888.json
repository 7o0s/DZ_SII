{"name": "PES 21", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pes-21-recensione-versione-pc.html", "text": "We had understood for some time that eFootball PES 21 Season Update would not have been a particularly innovative chapter or in any case extremely different from its predecessor, from Konami's editorial choices and from our review of the console version. On the other hand, the Japanese company had been clear from the start: given that the Covid-19 emergency has heavily impacted the world of real football and everything that revolves around it, therefore including video games, and the tight development times, he preferred to concentrate production efforts on the next generation of consoles. For the current one and on PC, however, it has therefore decided to ~limit itself~ to proposing a product that is structurally and technically strongly anchored to the 2020 edition, a sort of eFootball PES 2020 2.0, at a decidedly competitive price. A wrong choice for some, for others quite understandable, at least from the point of view of those who, like Konami, want to greet the eighth Era of the consoles by creating (probably) one last title, without however passing it off as a new production. But beyond all, how much does this stand-alone update justify a possible purchase, and how much does it not? The answer in the next few lines thanks to the PES 21 PC review. Level playability eFootball PES 2021 requires an update immediately, available from launch day and in the first live update. The data included in the package reflects those of 08/31/2020: in this way the Konami-branded title updates some jerseys, rosters and championships, waiting for a more substantial free DLC scheduled for 10/22/2020 and others that will complete the work later. A choice, we say it immediately, incomprehensible if we consider the very nature of the product, which does not focus on new methods and mechanics to motivate the purchase, but on updates which, however, are in fact incomplete. In any case, once this is done, you access the now classic interface from where you can then select any type of mode, from competitions available in all guises, including UEFA Euro 2020, to MyClub, to Become a Legend, up to the one that gives always is the beating heart of the series, namely the Master League. Like the others, it obviously has an identical structure compared to last year, but with the addition of some options that streamline certain steps, and three new selectable coaches, namely Lampard, Guardiola and Giggs. The eFootball section and the online section are also the same as the 2020 edition. Therefore, to find some real novelty, albeit sensitive, one must turn one's attention to playability. The latter does not present any particular upheavals compared to the 2020 edition, but has still been slightly retouched. These are those typical filings that do not immediately catch the eye, but which are noticeable after at least a handful of games. In fact, the feeling that one has after the first few matches is that of greater and more immediate control over the players, and a better responsiveness of the latter to the commands received, at least using the manual settings. The result is a slow but more fluid pace of play, where shots, passes and plays are more natural, all to the advantage of fun and rewarding gameplay. For the rest, the title maintains all the positive elements that characterized it last season in eFootball PES 20, especially after the various updates, namely realistic physics, artificial intelligence that ensures a good level of challenge, and credible movements of digital athletes , able to ~read~ and decently support the action, so as to ensure greater variety in maneuvers, both defensive and offensive. Technique, only minor adjustments As always, the graphic sector defends itself very well on PC, although it does not present noticeable differences with that of last season. In order to better enjoy the aesthetic peculiarities of the game, however, it is necessary to have graphics cards not unlike an NVidia GTX 670 or a Radeon R9 270X, better if paired with an Intel Core i7-3770 4-Core processor, or AMD FX- 8350. The result is a visually splendid game, which runs at 1080p and smoothly at 60fps, with every minimum detail clearly highlighted thanks to the resolution and the possibility of intervening on the individual graphic options that can be set to medium or high quality, such as in the case of shadows, textures and various effects, such as ambient occlusion, and so on. The dynamic natural lighting system was particularly valued, which optimally simulates the position of the sun in the sky or of the headlights at night, to create realistic shadows and natural colors in every racing context. Likewise, the optimizations and hardware of the best performing computers allow for even more polygonal models beautiful, with the official faces that border on photorealism, like the textures of the licensed shirts, some of which are updated for the upcoming season (others should be fixed with future free packs: here for the details). Ditto the stadiums, where, given the absence of Milan and Inter (Konami has lost their image rights), and the arrival instead of Roma, the San Siro ~rossoneroazzurra~ version has been replaced by the ~giallorosso~ Olympic stadium. In short, the FOX Engine, which with the next generation of consoles will retire to make way for Unreal Engine 5, gives us one last pearl, at least in PES. Finally, on the sound front, the usual commentary by Fabio Caressa is the same as in the last edition, with several introductions out of context and disarmingly banal, and the absence of many call names. Furthermore, there remains the age-old problem of a report that is not always ~close~ to the action in progress. Better, then, the soundtrack, as well as the stadium effects; however, the chants of many teams and the generic ones can be improved: between the first and second courses there is a certain difference in quality and realism, as well as the absence of well-defined and characteristic chants of this or that club.", "date": "2020-09-21", "grade": "7.8"}
