Well, this is essentially the plot and I challenge anyone not to appreciate it, at least for the originality. It can also be seen how the characters are very well characterized (as well as being very well drawn, but I'll talk about this later): from the somewhat braggart and thinker general, up to the very lively Justin himself, who has the only desire to become a adventurer, like his father and all his illustrious ancestors. Although I have never appreciated RPGs, I was happy to have been able to try this latest effort by GameArts, defined by several people as a masterpiece; in my humble opinion it could also be appreciated by newbies of the genre, being equipped with nice characters, comic moments and an exciting plot; in addition there are also some interesting gameplay elements such as fighting in a place created with special shots and magic available or having sequences of spoken cutscenes. The technical side On the technical side we can applaud the developers again: the sound adapts to the atmosphere, for example with ~appropriate~ music for a maritime place and sound effects very inspired by Japanese anime / cartoons. Same thing in the graphic part, very accurate thanks to the very well drawn characters (also of clear Japanese inspiration as for the Puffy animal) and with 3D environments similar to those already admired in Xenogears and Breath of Fire 3. Unfortunately the only truly noteworthy flaw is the fact that sometimes the engine is inadequate tending to snap, for example while the characters are running or the shot zooms in on a detail or on a panorama: note the sea seen from the quay at the beginning of the affair. Conclusions We are undoubtedly faced with a game that, if it had come out in the early days or in the golden age of the machine it runs on, would certainly have become a classic. Right now, with the advent of the new generation consoles, I fear that it will be played and taken into consideration, at least in the western market, only by fans of the genre, given that neophytes and beginners will orient themselves on the new console. A applause to the underlying story and the development of the plot. Great at last! Attention the screenshots are small, do not click on them! In a now remote past, seven divine presences gave the human race, more precisely to the beloved people of the Icarian, the legendary Spirit Stone as a sign of blessing. As the land prospered under the magical influence of the stone and led by a more than wise people, the internal struggles between the various cities devoured what was a different world leading to the disintegration of all the benefits and of the stone itself, which it split (like the spirits) into seven parts and the different pieces ended up in different locations around the world. However, it was not over, because the peoples were divided into two large factions: one devoted to science and technological progress and another more ~devoted~ to religion and magical rites. The latter often forced to suffer the exhausting attacks of the immense army of General Baal, aided by his son Myuren. Meanwhile, in a town made up exclusively of maritime traders, fourteen-year-old Justin meets his friend Sue and her pet Puffy (but is it a pig?) and, with other friends, goes to explore some ruins; he soon discovers that he has hindered the plans of the aforementioned army, in search of the secret of an ancient civilization: Justin's job is to prevent ~the secret~ from being discovered and only he can succeed, as he is destined to save humanity , with the Spirit Stone around his neck as an amulet... Will he succeed?", "date": "2000-11-27", "grade": null}
