{"name": "NBA Live 09 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-live-09-recensione.html", "text": "Despite being one of the longest-running basketball simulations ever, NBA Live has left many fans with a bitter taste in the last few episodes: the game has not been able to organize itself in the best possible way for the transition to new generation platforms, and this happened particularly on the Wii. The Nintendo console is clearly a special case, for a variety of reasons; and many developers are only now trying to react and adapt to a situation of commercial dominance that they never thought possible. The sports division of Electronic Arts is trying to optimize its productions for Wii in order to meet above all the tastes of the so-called ~casual gamers~, and the introduction of the acronym ~All-Play~ is proof of this: it is a system which makes the game simpler and more immediate, and which in some cases even allows you to enjoy the experience using only the Wii-mote. We have to compromise with a series of more or less annoying gameplay flaws. Game mode From the NBA Live 09 start screen, it is possible to play the classic quick game, access the standard game modes or the ~party~ mode, typical of EA Sports All-Play products: in this case, there are four minigames (~21 ~, ~Slamdunk Contest~, ~3 Point Shootout~ and ~2 against 2~) to try with friends, more or less fun depending on the company but rather limited in mechanics. Among the standard game modes we find the inevitable ~Season~: you have to choose an NBA team and face an entire championship with the aim of winning it. We will be able to adjust the various game parameters as we see fit, increasing or decreasing the length of the quarters, changing the level of difficulty, selecting the presence or absence of injuries, etc. If we don't have much time available, we can eventually fall back on the ~Playoffs~, i.e. play only the preliminary rounds in the form of a tournament. Then there are the ~Superstar Challenge~ and ~All-Star Match~ modes: in the first case we will be faced with scenarios to be ~solved~, historical matches that must be faced in progress and won in order to move on to the next phase ; in the second case, we will be able to organize a match between two teams made up of basketball stars of the present and the past: a boon for enthusiasts and nostalgics. The ~Rookie Challenge~ mode (in which we will have to play using non-professional teams) and the online mode complete the picture, which as usual for Electronic Arts products is based on the EA Nation system and allows us to challenge players from all over the world in ranked and unranked matches. The developers have done a good job in this regard, creating a series of ~thematic~ rooms that users can enter if they are looking for a certain type of match. The search for opponents is quick and intuitive, you can play even without registering (by logging in as guests, but limiting yourself to unclassified games) and generally there is little lag: the Wii has never been the ideal machine for online challenges, but at least there are those who have been able to put a piece of it... Control system and gameplay With FIFA 09 for Wii we have seen an abandonment of the classic mechanics of football games in favor of an approach more similar to the one created by Konami for PES. NBA Live 09 partly follows this trend, allowing us to manage passes using the Wii-mote's infrared pointing system: by pointing at a player on the screen and pressing the A button, we will be able to quickly pass the ball to him. Unfortunately, this doesn't work very well, in the sense that the controller has a little difficulty changing the launch destination (which is confirmed by an icon) because the pointing is less precise than the average game for the Nintendo console: just navigate on the menu screen to notice. The analog stick of the Nunchuck is used for the movement of the player in possession of the ball, while to shoot you have to pull up the Wii-mote and then ~press~ it down, with a movement that is represented on the screen in a rather faithful way, especially for jump shots. Dunks must be performed when you are at the ideal distance from the basket, with the same movement but holding down the B trigger. On defense, raising and lowering the Wii-mote translates into jumping to block, while waving the controller sideways simulates the act of stealing the ball. Everything works quite well, in practice, but you have to compromise with a series of more or less annoying flaws in the gameplay: the difficulty in stopping an attack without committing a foul, the superiority of certain players especially from the three points, the presence of a for the alley-oop too simplistic, etc. Technical realization From a technical point of view, the 2009 edition of NBA Live for Wii unfortunately doesn't work miracles and doesn't differ much from what we already saw last year: the graphics are undoubtedly ~old gen~, with discrete polygonal models but a general lack of detail, average animations and poorly defined textures. The good thing is that fluidity remains high even in the busiest situations, so at least the engine doesn't miss out and manages to do its job in a dignified way. The sound sector was created in typical ~EA Sports style~: signed soundtrack (not very rich, but with some rather famous songs), good effects, commentary in English quite ~participatory~. The online mode, as previously written, performs quite well thanks to the EA Nation system: finding opponents is simple and exciting challenges can be organized in a few seconds. Comment If for some series (Madden NFL, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, FIFA itself) the developers of EA Sports have found the right compromise between depth and accessibility, unfortunately the same cannot be said of NBA Live. This 2009 edition presents itself as a still immature product from many points of view, with some more or less serious problems (the infrared pointing detection, to name one) and a gameplay that often lets itself go to unpleasant situations. There are good ideas, the control system works quite well (although by now everyone is hoping for a rapid advent of Motion Plus) and there is no shortage of classic modes, so ultimately less experienced and demanding players could consider this last title EA for a few games with friends or to try online. For the more savvy, however, we will have to wait for next year, hoping for an enhancement of the series from all points of view. Pros Some interesting control ideas Well organized online mode Good number of modes... Cons ...but last year there were more Technically less than spectacular Limited and sometimes simplistic gameplay", "date": "2008-10-31", "grade": null}
