{"name": "Contra Returns", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/contra-returns-recensione.html", "text": "The Contra Returns review gave us the opportunity to take a real journey into the past, going back to the times of the original cabinet and those heroes clearly inspired by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone who fought against hordes of aliens to save planet Earth from a dangerous invasion. The incipit has remained practically identical, as well as the bulk of the mechanics that regulate this new incarnation of the Konami-branded action shooter. Of course, visually the game abandons the pixel art of the late 80s to offer us often ugly and somewhat generic polygonal solutions, but the spirit of the origins is all there and not even the most important thing is missing: support for Bluetooth controllers , which earns many experience points. Structure Contra Returns, one of the campaign boss fights. Available in the traditional freemium format on the App Store and Google Play Store, Contra Returns immediately highlights a rather rich structure, which does not just include a long single player campaign, but also introduces a whole series of extra contents and modes which it is possible to unlock along the way. In fact, we will be able to try our hand at the One-Life Mode, which as the name suggests is a mode in which you die at the first damage suffered; or with the Endless Mode, made up of endless waves of enemies and the goal of surviving as long as possible; or the Boss Challenge, in which we will be able to challenge the already defeated bosses again. Contra Returns, a taste of competitive mode. There is also a competitive online multiplayer, to create frenetic one-on-one battles, and the traditional cooperative, also online, which allows you to truly relive the atmosphere of the original arcade chapters, when together with a friend we tried to fight hordes of enemies and bosses, inevitably filling the coin-op with 200 lire coins because the matches were a continuous game over. Finally, on the unlockable elements front, there is the long list of playable characters in Contra Returns, which goes far beyond the dynamic duo made up of John Matrix and John Rambo ... that is, we meant by Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, inserting a large number of unedited fighters, each with unique skills that make the style of play different. Gameplay Contra Returns, one of the alternate levels. Completed a tutorial phase that literally takes us by the hand during the first few minutes, showing how the Contra Returns commands work and how weapons should be managed, with the inevitable possibility of buying more powerful ones by making in-game purchases (however attention: the microtransactions did not seem pressing or mandatory in the first hours), it is possible to jump into the fray and rediscover the dynamics of the Konami franchise between enemies of various types, traps, vehicles and huge bosses. One immediately realizes that the touch controls represent a more or less obvious obstacle from the point of view of the precision of the movements and the agility of the character, and although many elements are customizable (see the virtual joystick, which can be made repositionable instead of fixed) the general feeling continues to give back the sensation to often remain vulnerable in the face of the most chaotic situations. Contra Returns, Bill grappling with a freeze cannon. Fortunately, as mentioned at the beginning, it is possible to connect any Bluetooth controller to the device and significantly improve the gaming experience. The layout is not modifiable and there are some distortions (see the jump to B instead of A on the Xbox joypad), but it really takes a few seconds to get the hang of it and understand the true potential of Contra Returns. In fact, the game does not lack nothing: the classic situations are presented in an all too generous way, there are several variations on the theme, the boss fights work exactly as you would expect and, in general, you play for free without problems or expectations: from this point of view not even the mechanisms gachas are somehow a nuisance. Technical realization Then, as already mentioned, from a technical point of view, Timi's developers chose the path of a somewhat fake modernity, with polygonal graphics which, on the one hand, try to be as respectful as possible of the original materials, on the other often ends up showing the side to decidedly ugly or dated solutions. In short, visually Contra Returns is more functional to the action and it is a pity that on this front it was not possible to make an extra effort, although at the end of the count the game runs well and without blunders, despite the constraint of always online. The discourse on the music is less clear, chand in theory they have been taken from Contra's classic soundtracks, but they don't shine in quality.", "date": "2021-08-04", "grade": "8.0"}
