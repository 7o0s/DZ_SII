{"name": "Tenchu 3: Wrath of Heaven", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tenchu-3-wrath-of-heaven.html", "text": "The charm of the ninja Rikimaru and Ayame, the ninja of the Azumi clan in Godha's service, and later the doctor Tesshu, are the characters made available to unravel the events that will see them oppose the evil Tenrai in an attempt to unleash the fury of the skies on his head , the WoH in fact, a move so devastating as to kill the opponent, but also to leave those who use it exhausted. Between villages and castles, cemeteries and mines, snow-covered reed beds and Buddhist temples, K2 prepares ten levels in which the player can test his infiltration skills by trying his hand at achieving objectives that vary in relation to the choice of character with whom he it is preferred to face the title. However, fairly diversified missions do not correspond to the same variety of game: whether you have to punish a corrupt merchant, save a princess or recover a particular artifact, WoH, for better or for worse, you always play the same way. Except for very rare occasions with the flavor of in-depth intuitions, it all consists in applying oneself to those athletic adventures that are essential for a good ninja: approaching from behind to strike by stealth, aiming from a distance with poisoned darts, sparingly using the few gadgets that are possible carry and flatten on walls by pressing the R1 key. An action that is always equal to itself, however, finds its raison d'tre thanks to a conscientious level design: anyone who accepts the role of silent assassin that Tenchu imposes on him cannot fail to appreciate how much the weighted dislocation of ravines and guards is able to maintain interest and tension. However, significant innovations are lacking and the gameplay remains more than faithful to tradition. However, it is appropriate to underline how much stealth game mechanics prove to be similar to the proposed universe: WoH represents a very rare case in which all the elements form a coherent corpus. Small welcome adjustments also concern the combat system enriched with potential and thickness by new skills and, above all, by the lock on the opponent: finally orienting the controlled character towards the enemy against whom you are fighting is no longer as difficult as before. On balance K2 succeeds in the task of keeping intact the particular charm that had characterized the first chapter of this series. It is a charm of nature that is extraludic in a certain sense; perhaps it is the exoticism of the setting, feudal Japan, with its castles and its stories of honor and betrayal; perhaps the quality of the music; perhaps the pleasure of stepping into the shoes of a distant and mythical figure, yet so rooted in our imagination, like that of the ninja. Generational leap From a purely technical point of view, K2 offers a product that is completely in line with the average standard of PS2 games; the engine without hesitation draws characters and environments composed of an adequate number of polygons so as not to appear gaunt and covered with textures that are sometimes a little repetitive, but rarely out of place or annoyingly grainy. The animations of the protagonists, especially those that reward the player with each stealth kill, are of a good standard and do justice to the motor skills of the ninjas; the guards on the contrary are often characterized by movements of rather low quality and poorly connected to each other. It is therefore a title which, although it does not lend itself to criticism not dictated by an excessive and stubborn search for the defect, does not even present qualitative peaks capable of surprising: nothing that makes you indignant for neglect, nothing that leaves you amazed for its visual attractiveness. It is however - it must be emphasized - a step forward for a series which, in its previous incarnations, appeared marked by an absolutely disheartening technical achievement. The real weak points of the game remain the management of the camera, especially in the narrowest environments unable to clearly resume the action, and the artificial intelligence that governs the behavior of the opponents. Considering its importance in this specific game genre, it doesn't seem that the AI has received the attention it would have needed. While some choices understandably appear aimed at keeping the usability of the title intact, others seem naive that would have gladly been done without. Thus, even if we willingly accept guards with highly limited sensory possibilities and unable to maintain their state of alert for more than a handful of seconds, it is difficult to forgive excessively anomalous behavior: there are those who persist in walking against walls in the ( vain) hope of returning, after a chaseWhen, at the assigned post, those who spot the intruder throw themselves into a cliff in an attempt to reach him, while others, after having surrounded him, accidentally hit each other... Comment WoH, without aspiring to set new standards, manages to bring the franchise back on its tracks, certainly repairing some deficiencies, but also limiting itself to following only paths already beaten: it is largely the philosophy of the sequel, the philosophy of the more of the same. However, this is not an observation of an exquisitely negative nature: although not without defects, the first 128bit incarnation of Tenchu presents itself as a solid game, fairly long-lived and capable of captivating by virtue of the successful union between the setting, the role of ninja and stealth-based game mechanics. A title that will probably be able to excite fans of the series, aspiring ninjas and not too demanding players, leaving the fine palates unsatisfied who demand quality in a video game capable of freeing it more decisively from mediocrity. Pros: Intriguing atmosphere It's the ninja simulator Cons: Defective artificial intelligence and camera Poor Italian dubbing In 1998, when Acquire proposed Tenchu, aligning itself with titles that would soon leave their mark, the idea of a stealth game appeared as a completely original variation on the action game theme. Cheating instead of confronting: brilliant! But now that the sense of Kojimian intuition peeps out in the most varied productions, from Tomb Raider to Zelda, from SpiderMan to ShenMue, the ninja simulator, in its third incarnation, can no longer boast the use of game mechanics to a certain extent alien from the context of the remaining videogame offer. Furthermore, after the partial disappointment represented by Birth of Assassins, the second chapter of the series, one of the fears that had taken shape with the approaching release of Wrath of Heaven was that the franchise was not able to present itself with renewed vigor to the appointment with the 128bit Sony.
