Either for the immense possibilities given to the player, called to build a new civilization from the ashes of the previous one, or for the possibility of creating suggestive and imaginative game environments, the charm of this genre of post-apocalyptic video games continues to captivate thousands of fans. ready to try the latest invention in this area. This time, Vile Monarch takes us to devastated lands, with a title that does everything to stay afloat in a sea of competition. Dive into the quagmire with us in this review of Floodland. Causes and effects Floodland - a new world with new rules Floodland immediately presents itself as a game strongly attached to the narrative component. The world as we know it is long gone, plagued by unprecedented floods that have crumbled the last bastions of society. Years after the Event, our task is to make a small group of survivors thrive in these ~new~ lands. Our ~adviser~ has led us to a place that she considers very important. In fact, he thinks there is a highly efficient, state-of-the-art power plant in the area, which, if put back into operation, could help us give humanity a fresh start. Once given a at least livable home to our community, the goal will be to go in search of this phantom energy source. Along the way (or, better, the waterways), we will obviously meet other groups of survivors (who could prove to be great allies as well as bitter rivals), as well as a whole series of information that will help us understand what actually happened at the time of the great cataclysm that has essentially annihilated society. It is not a particularly intricate or original plot, but it is functional to a title like this, much more interesting in the relationships between individuals and clans than in the search for all-encompassing knowledge. Not just survive, but thrive Floodland: Rebuilding civilization, one island at a time The gameplay of Floodland puts us in front of various choices right from the first moments of the game. First, we need to select a clan to lead in these wastelands. Each clan (initially four, but you will meet others during your games) has its own peculiarities and, above all, its visions of the world. There are the more traditionalists, still tied to ~old habits~, while there are those who would like a new beginning for humanity, far from the decisions that led to the end of the world. Choosing our group, we are catapulted into a randomly generated map, which leads each game to appear different from the previous one (obviously, don't expect big changes, just a repositioning of points of interest and possible new encounters along the way) . The game then follows the standard of the most famous management games, with the collection of objects and the day-night cycle that marks the working hours and those of leisure. Returning to the meetings with other groups, the peculiarity lies in the fact that, if desired, you can invite the clans you meet to join your community, but still remaining two different community realities. This means that you will have control of one or more external groups, which will join the one initially chosen and which will bring a whole series of bonuses and maluses, as well as different needs and often very conflicting worldviews. Floodland: Each map is procedurally generated Therefore, we need to be careful who we choose to let into our settlement, because a greater workforce, in the long run, could turn against us and create ~unrest~, with a consequent increase in crime and dissent towards those who make the decisions ( that is us). The situation becomes even more complicated when our community is large enough to need laws for a common and prosperous coexistence. This diplomatic branch expects to choose from a large number of edicts, some of which present irreversible crossroads (for example, whether to establish a police force or an armed militia). Ultimately, much more than the search for resources and survival, what makes the difference between prosperity and defeat is the peaceful coexistence of community members. Technical Problems Floodland: from a technical point of view the game is not at its best If Floodland presents itself as an interesting title to play, which in many ways recalls another important exponent of the genre released in recent years, Frostpunk (from the introductory video, to some game mechanics, up to certain aspectsects of the artistic style, the elements that refer to the atmospheres of the 11 bit Studios title are different, including the more concrete use of Piotr Musia, composer of the Polish team's greatest hits), from a technical point of view the first critical issues arrive. to underline that what we tried was not exactly the final version of the title, given that the developers decided to take every minute of time available before the release to work on optimizing the game and on some finishing touches. However, we should be based on something and what we were able to test first hand left us with a bitter taste in the mouth (but, we repeat, these are all elements that could be fixed through future updates). Floodland: The game has obvious performance issues First of all, the game was very expensive in terms of hardware resources. Our test setup is certainly not the best, but still more than sufficient to handle such a title at 1080p and 60 frames per second. Still, the instances of slowdown and poor performance increased as we progressed through the story and thus expanded our community (and screen elements). A drop that does not seem at all justified by a particularly relevant graphic complexity given that, at the highest quality, Floodland is certainly not a game that amazes for details and visual effects. We are in the area of the ~common~, which is more than good for a strategic of this kind. However, performance issues persist even at the lowest level of graphics quality, so the flaw is more likely to lie upstream, in the development team's poor optimization of the game. Our experience has been a rollercoaster of frustration and elation as as we progressed in the story because the more we expanded our community, the longer the automatic saves got (which led to the entire screen freezing even for more than half a minute). These that we highlight and that have undermined our healthy enjoyment of the title are critical issues that will in all probability be fixed in time for the release, but for the moment that agonizing doubt remains: the possibility that the game actually comes out in these conditions, slightly improved , but still quite afflicted by at least annoying technical problems. The sonorous protagonist Floodland: the atmosphere that cloaks the game is very suggestive If under the mere computational aspect the game has convinced us little, from an artistic point of view, Floodland knows how to defend itself very well. It seems strange to say, but the most visually interesting sides of the title are probably the menus, screens, interfaces, with very particular hand-drawn elements, vaguely already seen, but still characterized enough to be strongly related to the work of Vile Monarch However, what stands out the most is the musical commentary, indeed, the sound sector in general. The soundtrack is delicate and at the same time bombastic, with even some original songs specially created for the occasion, masterfully produced and performed. Your ears will keep you glued to this narrative universe, more than anything else, creating around you an atmosphere that is unique in our opinion, which is strongly linked to the game and enhances its (perhaps a little too much) hidden qualities.", "date": "2022-11-14", "grade": "7.0"}
