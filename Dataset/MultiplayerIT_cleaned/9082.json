In the case of Infinity Field, created by ForzeField Studios for Chillingo, we can speak of a real cloning of the popular Geometry Wars, the arcade shooter created by the now defunct Bizarre Creations in 2003 for Xbox and revived two years later, in HD version , on Xbox 360. However, the operation was carried out with a certain respect for the original and certainly wants to pay homage to its great merits, trying to build on its own personality, thanks to an interweaving of dynamics and methods of great depth, especially considering the genre of belonging. The game winks at psychedelia with its acid colors on a black background, offers great entertainment thanks to the numerous light effects (and the possibility of displaying the graphics in a ~static~ way or in a sort of tilting movement in the three size) and, in general, a style that suggests the most accredited productions on the App Store, despite the fact that the genre is basically that of ~ultra arcade~. Infinite field. Holly and Benji? Infinity Field offers two different modes: campaign and survival. The first winds through three substantial ~zones~, each consisting of twelve levels of increasing difficulty, complete with a final boss to defeat. The second presents us with six original variants, ranging from the more classic survival to the one in which it is possible to eliminate enemies only by reaching the bombs that appear on the screen, passing through the mode in which one is equipped with a sort of ~laser arc~ to destroying opponents, and so on in a blaze of delightful experimentation. But how does the game work, exactly? By acting on two virtual sticks (very well implemented) placed on the edge of the touch screen, it is possible to move your ship in space and direct its fire, as in any twin analog shooter. As you progress through the levels and earn points, the vehicle can be upgraded and consequently earn different weapons than the default one, to be activated by pressing a button on the right of the screen. In the most complicated cases, a quick double tap can drive us with the release of a smart bomb, but in general the stages are fairly full of bonuses and extra lives to collect. The mechanics therefore appear to be those of an old school shooter, even if the action takes place in a single screen. What undoubtedly enriches them, making them truly engaging, is the large amount of different enemies that move in small swarms, each with its own modus operandi, and which force us to change our strategy at any moment, risking perhaps the crossing of the seabed to escape a sudden sortie. The goal in each level is to survive for the established time, and try to score as many points as possible during this interval, so as to complete the stage deserving three stars. An operation that often turns out to be anything but simple, and which therefore triggers an important stimulus to replayability. Moving on to the technical sector, the work done by ForzeField Studios is excellent, a feast of colors with many psychedelic implications which, however, unfortunately, is not accompanied by music up to the situation. Furthermore, the ~readability~ of the action on the screen is problematic in some cases and sometimes it happens that you run into game over simply for not having distinguished the silhouette of an approaching enemy.
