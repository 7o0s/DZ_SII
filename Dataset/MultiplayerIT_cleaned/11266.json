{"name": "Tales of Arise", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tales-of-arise-recensione.html", "text": "After the release of Tales of Vesperia Definitive Edition in 2019, the popular series of JRPGs disappeared from the radar for some time. The game wasn't even new: Bandai Namco was limiting itself to re-proposing a ten-year-old title on all platforms. To locate the last original production we have to go even further back, to 2017 and to Tales of Berseria, which was in all respects the last Tales to come out before a long hiatus that will finally end on September 10th. We wrote this review of Tales of Arise keeping in mind that the series, loved above all by manga and anime fans, needed a sound rejuvenation, especially on the technological front: the new Bandai Namco title promised exactly this, but in the end it gave us positively surprised for completely different reasons. The story: six characters in search of freedom Tales of Arise, Rinwell and Law's Assault boost The people of Dahna have long believed that its sister planet Rena and its satellite Lenegis were the home of the gods. Then the Rhenishes, a technologically more advanced civilization, invaded Dahna and subjected the population for three hundred years: now the Dahnan slaves exist only to produce astral energy for the five Lords who have divided up the planet. Alphen is a young slave in the kingdom of Calaglia, he wears a mask he can't take off and he doesn't remember anything from his past, but above all he doesn't feel any pain. Shionne is a Rhenish who descended on Dahna to assassinate the Lords and take their primary astral cores. The curse of the quills rests on her: whoever dares to even touch her feels excruciating pain. And in fact only Alphen can do it and this allows him to extract from the primary nucleus inside Shionne the mysterious Burning Sword, a weapon of extraordinary power. The two thus forge an alliance moved by a common goal: to free Dahna from the Rhine yoke. During the journey they will be joined by some memorable characters, among which a young sorceress seeking revenge and a repentant Rhenish Lord stand out. To triumph, the party will not only have to fight hordes of monsters and beings of boundless power, but also the resentment and prejudice they harbor towards each other. It is not the first time that a Tales deals with the theme of racism. Tales of Rebirth had also done it in 2004, but that had never come out of Japan. There is a difference, however, between the old Tales and this Arise: despite the anime style, the mega explosions in combat and the names of spells and special attacks screamed at the top of their lungs, Tales of Arise is a much more adult, epic and dark title than its predecessors, which tackles the horrors of discrimination and slavery from a decidedly more mature perspective. Tales of Arise, Dohalim's Attack boost is effective against agile enemies Mind you, there is no shortage of shonen manga shots and some - such as the very nature of the Burning sword - are not even explained in a too convincing way, but Tales of Arise is a story that tells more about the path that the protagonists take and the way in which they change perspective towards complicated matters such as racism, in fact, but also revenge, death and regret. The moral is obvious: we are all the same on this ball of mud and you can't make a bundle of all the grass, but the protagonists of Tales of Arise arrive at this conclusion in a sensible and... experienced way, so to speak . The merit is also of the numerous optional dialogues that delve into the characters and the bonds they establish over time. Abandoning the old half-length illustrations, Tales of Arise prefers a comic setting in which the cartoons follow one another dynamically on the screen while the characters argue with each other: an elegant solution that makes these short interludes much more enjoyable than in the past. Tales of Arise, Alphen is the protagonist of the story By contrast, the narrative of Tales of Arise appears a little weaker in terms of the antagonists, certainly less interesting than the six heroes in the cast. Being focused on the clash between different cultures or civilizations, without a specific villain upstream, Tales of Arise only superficially characterizes its ~disposable villains~, who appear very stereotyped, but still hateful in their atrocities. The often solemn tone of the narrative, accompanied by the sumptuous score by Motoi Sakuraba, made up of choirs and engaging orchestral tracks, finds a balance and maturity that the series has long needed, without encroaching on the edgy angularity that ended up debasing the drift ~ mature~ than some previous titles such as the aforementioned Tales of Berseria. The fighting milesgold of the series? Tales of Arise, Kisara can't dodge, but she can parry with her shield To complete the Tales of Arise campaign it takes between forty and fifty hours, depending on the difficulty level selected and your interest in the side missions, but most of the time you will spend fighting in the arenas in which the game delivers team and enemies whenever you come into contact with monsters roaming the maps. It is certainly a retrograde solution that betrays the cross-generational nature of the Bandai Namco title, which we played on PlayStation 5, but which, all in all, is functional to the gameplay: the developer has also tried to make the transition as painless as possible, removing the classic victory skit to accelerate the return from arena combat to third-person exploration, effectively lightning fast on the next-gen console. Despite this, the fights remain anchored to an old-fashioned setting, with the player actually having to meet the polygonal models of the enemies to start the fight, without the interaction possibilities offered by games like Dragon Quest XI or the recent Monster Hunter Stories 2: for example, it is not possible to gain an advantage by getting behind the enemy. Tales of Arise, the oil painting effect is due to the Atmospheric Shader That said, the combat system of Tales of Arise is absolutely among the best in the series, if not the best, full stop. The Japanese developers took inspiration from fan-favorite titles, taking the best and also adding something new in this re-imagining of the iconic Linear Motion Battle System. Tales of Graces would appear to be the cornerstone of it. Arise abandons the classic TP / MP to use another resource, the BA, which recharge over time and allow the casting of the Arts, practically special attacks and spells. The only exception is represented by the healing arts, which instead draw on the PCs, a single reserve shared by the whole party which is restored only by sleeping or consuming the special (and very expensive!) jellies. The player must therefore micromanage PC consumption to avoid being in combat with no health care or full of jellies but no money. Tales of Arise, a fight scene It is no coincidence that the combat system relies more than in the past on dynamic movement and dodges which, performed at the right moment, trigger a slow-motion effect and the possibility of a counter-attack. By alternating the normal attacks and the different types of Arts, long and spectacular combos are ringed together, but behind the chaotic nature of a frenetic but unquestionably fluid action - the game travels at 60 granite frames on PlayStation 5 by setting the frame rate priority in the options - there is a interesting strategic aspect. The six playable characters are already sufficiently different in terms of Arts and functionalities, but the new Boost Attack system further layers the fights: the enemies are divided into categories against which specific Boost Attacks are more effective, so that Rinwell's is the The only one able to interrupt the casting of Astral Arts, Law's one can break through armor, Dohalim's one can paralyze the most agile enemies and so on. In addition, the Boost Attacks recharge the BA of the character we are using, allowing you to prolong the combos, so you often have to decide whether to keep the charge of a Boost Attack for the moment when it will be needed or consume it immediately to continue a combo. Tales of Arise, Alphen's Mystical Art is called Flaming Pillar And combos are important because they weaken enemies, making it easier to deploy Boost Strikes, cinematic tandem attacks that can even end combat in one fell swoop. As the adventure continues, Tales of Arise enriches this repertoire with more and more features - such as the Over the Limit condition which unlocks the very powerful Mystical Arts - which are offered to the player in an organic and cadenced way, without confusing him but respecting his times of learning. The same Arts, very numerous per character, can be configured for a maximum of three at the beginning of the adventure, but as you continue you learn additional shortcuts. It's an intuitive and intelligent combat system that has the only flaw of appearing difficult to read in the advanced stages of the adventure, when the screen is filled with explosions and special effects and it's hard to understand when it's time to dodge or change target . Tales of Arise, Ufotable made the anime interludes In this sense, personalized artificial intelligence comes to meet usskillful. As in previous Tales, it is possible to switch controlled characters on the fly and even change the team in battle with the two characters left on the bench, but the other three protagonists continue to act on their own. If in the old Tales it was possible to set up some kind of generic or individual strategy, Arise takes a different approach. Each character behaves in a specific way, forcing the player to form a team with a minimum of logic depending on the enemy faced: Shionne, for example, focuses on flying enemies, while Kisara attacks those that target companions with less HP . In addition, the player can set a series of priority rules that induce the artificial intelligence to behave accordingly. It's not the highly detailed Gambit of Final Fantasy XII, but it's an ingenious solution that makes the right difference when facing the most challenging bosses in the game. The GDR outline Tales of Arise, the dungeons are filled with crossroads and collectibles The better you fight, the more AP you earn. It's another currency that we can spend in the Skill Panel to unlock new Arts and other tasty bonuses that allow us to further customize the combat system, for example by speeding up the recovery of BA or the casting time of Astral Arts. Each character unlocks these thematic bonus clusters by simply continuing the story or by completing some secondary objectives: once you learn all the skills in a cluster, the excellent central bonus is also unlocked. Tales of Arise is a fairly traditional RPG from this point of view and in fact offers tested dynamics such as the craftsmanship that allows you to manufacture weapons and accessories, fishing at the appropriate docks, cooking around the bonfires scattered around the world, even managing of a miniature ranch for the supply of raw materials for our delicacies. Tales of Arise, the city of Elde Menancia The structure is that of a typical Japanese RPG. Having abandoned the initial open world claims suggested by the first teasers, Bandai Namco has preferred an old-school solution, with large maps to explore in search of resources and collectibles. The story guides us by the hand from one area to another in an organic but linear way, opening the doors to free exploration of the areas already visited almost immediately, thanks to a convenient fast travel system between points of interest: this system allows to quickly reach the known areas, especially when undertaking tasks that send us on the hunt for monsters or collectibles. The side missions are marked by small icons in the shape of an envelope above the heads of the NPCs but they are almost always pretexts for us to fight or explore: the narrative in these cases is just sketchy, although it helps to better understand the main characters and the world in which they move, but it must be said that often these assignments practically complete themselves and require a minimum commitment that makes them old-fashioned in presentation, but attractive for those looking for money, consumables or even new skills. Tales of Arise, Cyslodia is a snow region Even in terms of level design, Tales of Arise is a title without gigantic pretensions, but it does its job perfectly. The maps are designed quite intelligently and as you progress through the game they abandon more and more of the linear structure of corridors to embrace more complex floor plans, sometimes even small puzzles. The presence of crossroads, shortcuts and optional passages all to be explored in search of new collectibles represents a pleasant diversion even when the map clearly shows the destination to be reached from the first screen. We are a little sorry that Bandai Namco has maintained the division into thematic areas, separated by uploads, especially when we played semi-open world titles like Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on less performing platforms, but it is clear that the Japanese developer has preferred a less dispersive setting and ambitious to revolutionize Tales a little at a time and without rushing too much. A cross-gen oil painting Tales of Arise, this mysterious swordsman hunts down the protagonists And in fact Tales of Arise certainly represents a step of decisive importance towards the future of the series, if not in structure, at least in appearance. Bandai Namco has finally preferred the more versatile Unreal Engine 4 to its proprietary engines, and the result can be seen. The innovative Atmospheric Shader camouflages the edginess of the older generation thanks to the super refined art direction. Tales of Arise is beautiful to look at; each screen looks like a moving oil painting, detailed and colorful, especially in the scenes", "date": "2021-09-08", "grade": "8.5"}
