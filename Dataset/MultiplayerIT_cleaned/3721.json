{"name": "Hearthstone: Lascesa delle Ombre", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hearthstone-ascesa-delle-ombre-recensione.html", "text": "Last March, Hearthstone celebrated five years of life by finding itself in a rather particular situation. As mentioned a few days ago when we asked ourselves what was boiling in Blizzard's cauldron, 2018 was not a simple year for the card game: if on the one hand it is true that Hearthstone's numbers are always important, on the other the decline in interest in him is there for all to see. In fact, the increase in the quality and number of competing titles was accompanied by a natural physiological decline, fueled by the weak response obtained from the last two expansions The Challenge of Rastakhan and Operation Apocalypse. Those who expected from these two sets the spark necessary to awaken attention to Hearthstone could not do anything but take note of the bogging down of the waters of the meta, which remained mainly firm to the archetypes born following the release of Boscotetro. If, as per the regulation, all three expansions from last year remain part of the Standard even in the Year of the Dragon that has just begun, the decision to send Genn Greymane and Baku the Mooneater into early retirement comes precisely as a consequence of the need to renew a meta which has tired many players, intending to return to the field with the release of The Ascent of Shadows. In addition to the news relating to its cards, the arrival of the new expansion has in fact decreed the end of the ~odd~ and ~even~ decks, almost making a clean slate in a meta that has thus been redefined these days. For this series of reasons, the appointment with the rotation of the month of April is this year more important than ever: let's go and see together what Blizzard's Team 5 has in store for us. 135 new cards The idea behind Rise of Shadows is to bring back some of the characters known in the expansions now played only in Wild to the Standard decks. We therefore find well-known figures such as that of the unforgettable Dr. Boom, accompanied by Hagatha, Rafaam and other shady types. However, their presence is not in the same form in which we met them, but inspired by the sets that brought them to life: even if in a different way, Boom still remains tied to his Robo-Bombs, while Rafaam takes over from the Golden Monkey the ability to transform cards in your hand and deck into legendary minions, and so on. To what is the conceptual vision behind The Rise of Shadows, Blizzard has also added some new dynamics that start from the presence of lackeys, a series of cards that cannot be created and can only be obtained by playing other cards present in the expansion . The cost of each lackey is a single mana crystal, and even though they are 11 minions, the interest in them is due to the skills they are able to bring into play. Not all powerful in the same way, we must say, but at the moment still adequate to ensure that many decks play the cards from which the lackeys are obtained, especially among those of the thief. The reason is obvious: in addition to exploiting the skills of the lackeys, the one cost in fact allows them to be excellent activators of the dynamic combos of this class. Continuing in the list of new features we find the so-called twin spells: when cast, they allow you to obtain an exact copy (except for the twin spell ability) of the original one in your hand, which can also be played in a turn other than the current one. An undoubtedly interesting dynamic, capable of contrasting the advantage offered by the possibility of actually having two copies of a single spell with the awareness of what is in our hand on the part of the opponent, who can thus look for a strategy that allows you to manage the second copy. To conclude the novelties we find the so-called floors, cards linked to the classes of belonging of the bad guys mentioned above, which are strengthened in each turn they pass into our hand. It is perhaps the least exploited mechanic among the three new proposals of The Rise of Shadows at least for the moment, even if in the current meta there are still decks that make use of it, especially for the shaman with the Plan of Hagatha. Speaking of meta, at least for the moment the answer seems quite comforting: apart from the advantage that the druid token can enjoy, tier 2 currently has decks from practically all the classes present in the game, including the new bomb warrior who seems to have what it takes to play it in the coming weeks with the deck dedicated to Malfurion as his main preference. If at first the magician seemed to have paid the pawn, the dragon mage with Khadgar seems to have met the players' interest, inwhat is nonetheless a scene capable of satisfying most tastes. The only class to appear penalized is that of the priest, traditionally among the most difficult to build decks. Beyond individual preferences, the variety present at the moment is certainly an encouraging factor, waiting to see how the meta will settle after the initial experimentation phase. Adventure coming As per tradition, The Rise of the Shadows will also bring with it a new adventure to be experienced by confronting the CPU. For the occasion, Blizzard has announced that it has important news in this area as well, which however we will only be able to appreciate in May. What we know for the moment is that the new adventure will use the dynamic dungeon run already seen in some of the previous expansions as a starting point, supported by the intention of the developers to grant players a greater level of customization. The upcoming free chapter will allow us to get to know the first of the characters introduced by Blizzard specifically for The Big Heist in Dalaran, from which players will be able to obtain packs of the new expansion plus a golden pack and a card back after completing all five chapters. Having not yet had the opportunity to touch the adventure that accompanies The Rise of Shadows, we can do nothing but trust Blizzard's promises, given that there is still about a month left to see everything at work. Instead, what we have been able to observe is the design of the new cards, rather in line with the fluctuating quality found in the previous expansions of Hearthstone: we pass from some very beautiful or witty designs to slightly less inspired artwork, those of the piano cards in first. The decision to give the cards belonging to the individual classes a chromatic style that recalls the base color is appreciable, thus reinforcing the identity of each of them.", "date": "2019-04-15", "grade": "7.5"}
