Of the latter over the past few weeks we have had the opportunity to play the sequel in installments, given that the title was released with the particular formula of weekly episode distribution via digital download, as if it were a mini series along the lines of the television ones at The Walking Dead. The result of the project was not bad, especially considering the fact that it did not aim to revolutionize the saga or the genre, and the cost of each installment. And now the game also comes in a packaged edition for the joy of all those who have not played it yet or wish to have it on physical media. In addition to the four chapters that make up the game, the two additional episodes focused on the stories of Moira Burton and Natalia Korda, Resident Evil: Revelations 2 in retail version contains other content, such as the characters of Hunk and Albert Wesker for the RAID mode, four alternatives for each of the protagonists and the ~RAID mode Throwback Stage Pack~ with a poker of stages inspired by the settings of the recent episodes of the Resident Evil series. Resident Evil: Revelations 2 arrives in a retail edition with the stories of Claire and Barry and lots of content Curiosity The title of each episode of the game is inspired by some of the works of Franz Kafka, of which quotations abound during the adventure, including the mysterious hidden drawings to be highlighted with Moira's torch. ~In the penal colony~ is for example the title of a story by the Bohemian writer, in which the theme of guilt is presented under the banner of a radical ambivalence. ~Meditation~ is instead that of a collection of 18 short stories and apologues. ~The condemnation~, also known in Italian as The verdict or The sentence, is a novella centered on the theme of the conflict between father and son, while ~The metamorphosis~ tells of a man who woke up one morning transformed ~into a gigantic insect~. Deadly experiment The premises are very intriguing, since the whole adventure is set on a mysterious island, presumably ex-Soviet, called Zabytij, which gloomy and silent stands out over the surrounding sea without any more human voices capable of responding to the calls by radio. Everything that staggers, crawls and moves on that portion of land, behind the walls of houses, factories, medical facilities or trees, has nothing natural anymore. Inside the cells of a dilapidated penitentiary awaken Claire Redfield and Moira Burton, members of the organization against bioterrorism called TerraSave. The two girls were kidnapped together with other colleagues during a party of the non-governmental organization by a group of paramilitaries and left imprisoned with a mysterious bracelet on their wrist. This, it will be discovered practically immediately, reveals the emotions of the wearer and changes color accordingly in relation to moods, and is linked to a terrible experiment carried out by a mysterious tormentor. Realizing the danger, a long adventure begins for Claire and Moira whose aim is to escape from that terrifying place, perhaps after having laid hands on whoever captured them. Six months after the kidnapping of the two friends, Barry Burton arrives on the island, apparently to have intercepted an SOS from his daughter. Once the former S.T.A.R.S. he comes across a mysterious girl named Natalia, who from that moment becomes his traveling companion. Barry's primary objective remains only one: to find his daughter at all costs, but from that moment another one is added, namely to bring the little girl to safety. The story of Revelations 2 is generally flowing in its ups and downs, while never resulting astounding, and even if at the end of the four episodes the facts stand out better, they take on more light, they intertwine and influence each other, giving a complete and better articulated picture , on balance it remains not very thorough in some passages and too anchored to certain stereotypes. Moving on two different time frames, the player finds himself exploring the island by controlling the two pairs of characters (alone, with the support of artificial intelligence, or with the help of a friend, in local co-op) in a title focused on the level of playability on the alternation of the protagonists and their interaction. Indeed, each couple has its own action figure, in the sense that it is skilled in combat, Claire on one side and Barry on the other, and one as a support to find useful objects, distract enemies or help solve environmental puzzles. However, the one formed by Barry and Natalia seemed to us the most complementary, perhaps also in relation to the fact that the campaign of the BSAA consultant is structurally the most interesting due to the variety of scenarios and situations, and the role of the young companion grows in importance gradually continuing the adventure. Above all thanks to his ability to perceive in advance the presence of the creatures that infest the island, proving to be useful for being able to plan more reasoned and less rash and risky actions. The island of horrors The rest of the gameplay in general instead maintains what are the classic dictates of horror adventures with a third person view, proposing for most of the mechanics already seen in other similar productions. Resident Evil: Revelations 2 tries from this point of view to keep alive a certain link with the origins of the genre, without however closing the doors to the modern, updating but not distorting, where possible, situations that open up the perspectives of the gameplay more. The need to rationalize the use of ammunition and weapons, which can be upgraded by collecting special kits and using a modification counter, the attention to be paid to one's own health and that of companions, the need to explore areas characterized by gloomy and sometimes distressing atmospheres, they are all elements that cannot fail to remind you of the old Resident Evil. On the other hand, being able to break crates to collect bullets, the possibility of dedicating yourself to a little crafting to create more effective gauze for wound care or explosive and incendiary bottles, earning points to spend to unlock new skills, bring to mind the most recent episodes. Hour after hour the gameplay becomes interesting, managing to alternate traditional exploratory phases, even within the same mission, with others that are a little more stealth or dynamic. The variety of settings certainly contribute to this, not very original, it is true, but the same able to keep the player's interest high, and the good use of sound effects, which literally accompany the protagonists in their progress towards a destination with noises claims, complaints and other surrounding elements. Effectively forcing the user to often strain his ears for fear of seeing some monster pounce on him. If this happens, the action becomes more lively, but never overly action, and even with old Barry it is wiser to often adopt more cautious moves, taking the enemies from behind and then killing them by thrusting a knife into their bodies. The behavioral patterns of the creatures that infest Zabytij, especially those of the disturbing Revenants, at a high game difficulty level recommend acting in this way, then conserving as many resources as possible for the boss fights that close each act of each episode. These turn out to be quite difficult to deal with, sometimes even frustrating, and there are a couple with a very apt design, whose clash structurally well-designed by the developers will mean that it will take some effort and a lot of patience to be able to eliminate them in the end. Other modes To increase the longevity of the product, and also to offer a diversion from the mechanics of the main campaign from which it is completely unrelated, there is the Raid mode. Characterized by fast and frenetic rhythms, each of the missions to be faced in this context are able to engage players for hours. In each episode, in fact, the mode gives access to a certain number of raids, each of which can be tackled with one of the available characters, alone or in company via the local cooperative option. At the end of each mission and depending on how he played, the user is rewarded with costumes to unlock and coins to spend to buy new weapons, upgrades or skills, which can then be used on the next round to get even higher scores than the precedents and get your hands on other prizes. If desired, you can also resort to buying weapons and bonuses with real currency, but the microtransactions in this case don't affect performance that much, in the sense that even without buying certain gadgets you can still get excellent results in the game. In addition to the Raid mode and the possibility of replaying the individual episodes with different options, such as Invisible Enemies and Countdown, Revelations 2 offers, as mentioned at the beginning, also two extra mini-episodes. One is titled The Trial, and puts the player in Moira's shoes by delving into a certain point of the storyto his story. The other, Little Woman, lets us get to know the character of Natalia better, who, accompanied by a mysterious figure, finds herself busy finding her favorite teddy bear, lost in the sewers. The episode with Barry's daughter has a slightly more action-focused gameplay, but nothing excessive, and includes timed hunt sessions, while the gameplay of Natalia's story is stealth. However, both episodes are uninteresting and let themselves be played just out of curiosity. Closed the large parenthesis dedicated to the part played, let's analyze the technological one. From this point of view it must be said that the title does not offer real qualitative peaks. On the one hand we have 1080p graphics, well-characterized polygonal models of the protagonists, the good design of some enemies, especially a couple of bosses, and some not very original but particularly evocative locations from the point of view of the atmosphere; on the other, a certain poverty of detail in some of the surrounding textures, especially those covering portions of the environment, a realization of the particle and volumetric effects not up to the hardware possibilities of current consoles, and in general a level of detail lower than other more recent products of the kind. As for the frame rate drops that had particularly tormented the first episode at the time of its release in digital download, everything seems a distant memory, and the game on PC at 1920x1080, 60 frames per second and all details at maximum runs smoothly , without apparent declines, as it already did after the appropriate patch released by Capcom in recent weeks. Finally, for the sound part, we have a technically good dubbing in Italian, despite the not always valid lines of dialogue written by the Capcom screenwriters, especially for the character of Moira. But above all, the title boasts excellent audio effects such as the moans of the monsters, the noises of the metal that writhes due to rust and decay, the environmental sounds and an almost perfect soundtrack, which accompanies the various phases like in a horror film adventure, emphasizing at the right moment the more agitated or tense ones compared to the apparently quieter ones.", "date": "2015-03-24", "grade": "7.8"}
