{"name": "Valorant", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/valorant-recensione.html", "text": "Riot has really pushed hard for the publication of Valorant and almost surprisingly comes out with the definitive version of its competitive shooter after giving birth to a rather short closed beta, if we think about current standards. Three concentrated months of playtests, with the much-discussed Twitch Drop mechanics but which brought incredible visibility to the title. If you have followed us in the last period you will know that we have already discussed it abundantly in all ways about Valorant: we have told you about the best Agents to take the first steps, about the irrepressible will to leave a mark in the eSports sector and also about how this new production is just one of the arrows in Riot's quiver to invade every market segment in the coming years. The Valorant review therefore comes after many hours of play and is also an opportunity to analyze the new injection of content released on the occasion of the official launch on June 2nd. Summary of previous episodes Valorant is a completely free to play team-based competitive shooter. It is strongly inspired by Counterstrike both in the way of shooting and in the management of the firing lines but manages to distinguish itself thanks to the implementation of the agents, characters that the player can impersonate with special abilities capable of revolutionizing the basic strategies, while offering great depth to the game. Everything is therefore based on the composition of one's own team, on communication and on the synchronicity of the action. At the moment the game offers eleven agents, a number that does not seem so impressive at first glance but which already manages to bring great variety to the games. Thanks to the design of the skills, the Valorant Agents impact the matches much more than the League of Legends champions, just to stay in the Riot house, and having one in the team rather than another means completely rewriting the management of the offensive phases and defensive, for a game mechanic capable of making the games always very dynamic and never too equal to each other. Discussing hero balancing or the meta on the day of release of a shooter like this is rather inappropriate, especially considering how quickly and frequently Riot updates its titles. Even Valorant itself has seen multiple stats change in the transition from the beta version to the final one, with the rework of Omen and the fix to several skills that seemed excessively incisive. What we can guarantee you, however, is that all the agents present have well-defined strengths and weaknesses and even the less used ones like Viper in the right hands can make disasters. So what matters at the moment is to have found a good character design in the production, both aesthetically and in terms of mechanics, and on this factor we can only promote the work done by Riot with full marks. Of course, some skills are derivative and already seen in other titles, just as the appearance can recall the protagonists of other games (raise your hand if you have not associated Reyna with Sombra as soon as you have seen her in the presentation artwork) but the general set of contents is overall satisfactory and well done. Valorant offers skills to be used as a utility for the vast majority of the time. We therefore find agents with healing abilities, many able to create obstructions to the lines of fire through smoke grenades and others instead equipped with poisonous or flaming areas to slow down the advance of the enemy. There is also the ignorant character with grenades and integrated rocket launcher, adorable to play during the first sessions but complex to manage as things get more difficult given the almost impossible to provide one's companions with knowledge of the agents' position on the map opponents. With a well-studied pool of heroes, it is legitimate and obvious to expect an equally technical type of gameplay, but which does not disdain even a pinch of randomness to meet a wider audience. From this point of view, Riot has worked well, however, risking creating a hybrid that is not able to fully satisfy the pro player scene. Basically the range of shots is manageable but with a good component of randomness on the address of shots, a situation that often leads to still having accidental headshots today. Compared to the beta, however, the situation has been further improved and hit detection also seems to have made progress, with the servers running great on launch day as regards the games despite the exaggerated amount of people eager to try the game . Situation that will gradually settle down over the next few weeks.Some news to keep you busy Valorant almost seems to have gone back in terms of content compared to the beta, having in fact lost the entire ranked match system at the moment, which we will definitely review as soon as a good portion of players have obtained the experience necessary to make it interesting. balanced and fun games. In fact, it is useless to underline how for the moment there is an enormous disparity in the matches, also due to the total absence of matchmaking and that the risk of being in a heavily disadvantaged team is a concrete problem. The matches, lasting 40 minutes, don't help the situation with the risk of being entangled in a frustrating debacle and not being able to do anything to get out of it. We wanted a lighter mode at launch and Riot has satisfied us with the Spike Assault, where, with the same concept as always, two teams of five players face off in the best of seven rounds. Here the games are fast, adrenaline-pumping and fun but fail to properly teach the coordination basics necessary to triumph in the main mode. In Spike Assault all attackers are provided with a spike and there is no shop or economy to account for, with skills reloading at the start of each round and weapons automatically provided to all players equally. Then appear on the map enhancers of various kinds to make the games more varied, spheres that poison or are able to increase speed, but which remain precisely mechanics very far from the core gameplay of Valorant. Riot also wanted to flesh out the basic roster, with a new character: Reyna is an agent capable of absorbing the souls of the fallen and after having tried her for several hours we can safely say she is one of the most difficult characters to use around Valorant, precisely because it is inextricably linked to killings. He is one of those characters who can hardly lead you to victory in case you find yourself crushed by your opponents, but who can instead give a significant boost towards victory when things are already looking better. A nice addition that fits perfectly between the agents already present without overlapping the other choices currently available. In all of this we would have had the pleasure of finding a shorter version of the classic mode, perhaps at the best of 9 or 11 rounds instead of 25. Also peeping out is the classic Season Pass, sold for around ten euros and containing thirteen skins and over forty aesthetic elements divided between cards, sprays and pendants for your favorite guns. Two things in this case make us turn up our noses: the impossibility of obtaining credits with the season pass to be able to buy the next one, remaining in line with what has been offered up to now on Teamfight Tactics but deviating from the successful Fortnite model, and the prices individual skin generals. Absurd to think of having to spend over 70 euros for the Prime Collection which includes five weapon variants and little else. However, the average price remains that of 10 euros per extra weapon model with peaks of 35 euros in case you want to replace your knife with the new axe. Really exorbitant prices in our opinion, for a choice in stark contrast to the possibility of unlocking all the heroes by spending only hours of play. Finally, the package of Ascent novelties closes, the fourth map on Valorant set in our beloved Venice, able to distinguish itself strongly from the others present in the game thanks to the presence of shutters that can be controlled by the players to open and close shooting lines at will and at some passages through the windows hitherto unpublished. It's yet another map with lots of hairpin bends and blind corners, a design solution that forces players to always explore the various areas in pairs to avoid being caught from behind, a solution that still satisfies us and that amplifies the feeling that you are dealing with excellent handling of maps, especially those with two control points. The colors and the setting in general are beautiful, perfectly integrated with a recognizable style from the very first steps and a hallmark of a title decided with all the strength to remain on the scene for a long time.", "date": "2020-06-03", "grade": "8.0"}
