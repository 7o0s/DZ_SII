Yet our clothing, our food and our cars, just to name three of the most popular topics ever, still manage to successfully cross national borders, overcoming the aforementioned obstacles - with many difficulties - and reaching the hearts and minds of who ~undergoes~ the charm and qualities of an exclusive style. Well, from this very last remnant of autumn, there is another brand that enters with full merit in the same and elitist tricolor firmament, in which it shines with an even more intense light than others, considering the modern roots and above all the field of membership, engulfed by billionaire multinationals with the power to address an increasingly rich and impressive market. The small software house Kunos Simulazioni, led by Marco Massarutto and Stefano Casillo at the ~command~ of a dozen talented guys, with its Assetto Corsa has also managed to establish itself in one of the most complex and loved genres of the videogame medium, where to carve out a space and making a name for yourself among established giants is anything but simple. The foundations laid with netKar Pro and Ferrari Virtual Academy, supported by business strategies that are as intelligent as they are fascinating such as the headquarters located inside the Vallelunga racetrack, have made possible the birth of one of the most profound, satisfying and technically valid driving simulators. After months of previews, tests and video articles, here is finally our review of Assetto Corsa. Assetto Corsa writes an important page of driving simulations on PC Home track day Do you like driving - perhaps even on the track - and are you fascinated by the irresistible charm of four wheels? Well, then you can stop reading this article and rush to update your PC, while recovering a good steering wheel and, of course, a copy of Assetto Corsa. Yes, because even though rivers of digital ink can be wasted (so to speak) in illustrating the immense qualitative qualities of the driving model of the work Kunos Simulazioni, the only thing that can fully explain them is to get into the car and take a nice stroll, lingering on the genuine pleasure you feel holding the steering wheel in your hands. If you are lucky enough to own one of the cars featured in the simulator and have the opportunity to take to the track, even better, since the appreciable experience on Assetto Corsa is completely comparable to that of a track day, net of the absence of G forces that behind a monitor, in the vast majority of cases, it is impossible to replicate. In fact, if you were wealthy enough, you could consider purchasing the rSEAT RS1 M4A Full motion peripheral with hydraulic jacks (15,000 Euros) and leave your car as a Sunday driver at the dealership: no fuel or tire consumption, no road tax and insurance, no broken bones in the event of unpleasant accidents and the same driving pleasure. Do you want to put? In short, all this to tell you that the physical-dynamic model of Assetto Corsa is so well designed, profound and exhilarating, that there is no reason why a racing game enthusiast should give it up, especially after the umpteenth stroke of the chisel of the version 1.0. After all, the exceptional qualities of the Italian simulator were perceptible from the original ~Technology Preview~ launched at the beginning of 2013, a sort of playable benchmark for netKar Pro buyers who, in just 260 MegaBytes, with only one track and one only cars, namely the Mario Umberto Borzacchini racetrack in Magione (Umbria) and the gritty Lotus Elise SC, were able to give a delightful taste of the enormous potential of the work, which has literally blossomed in these last months of development. In addition to the obsessive care that emerges in the simulation of the tyres, aerodynamics, weight distribution, elasticity of the chassis and suspensions, supported by the technological support and the continuous exchange of information with pilots, telemetrists, track engineers and car manufacturers , the show orchestrated by Kunos Simulazioni is further enhanced by the delightful Laserscan technology, adopted for all licensed circuits and capable of returning to the driver any interference and imperfection of the asphalt, for an all-round realistic experience that also enhances the very elegant replay, perhaps to be enjoyed in slow motion. Observe the rottire olation, influenced by effects due to consumption such as graining, flat spots and blistering, among other things, as well as suspension work, perhaps on open wheel cars such as the biting KTM X-Bow R and the Lotus Exos Type 125, literally manages to kidnap and bewitch the gaze of the most attentive to detail enthusiast. The precision and sensitivity in the response to commands are absolute and specific for each of the fifty cars made available by the developers, where the variables involved are not only attributable to weight, aerodynamics, traction or power, but also to technologies more intimate and subtle than the various models. Just think of the active aerodynamics of the Pagani Huayra and the KERS system of the Ferrari LaFerrari - with its twelve meticulously simulated TCS levels - or the Torque Vectoring that the team is studying to replicate the differential of the Nissan GT-R, a highly appreciated racing car that we will see in the future. Each car gives a unique driving feeling and you don't feel that sort of smoothing out of the dynamic model that emerges in other similar products: try the legendary 1,200 horsepower Ferrari 312T and then get into an Alfa Romeo Giulietta Quadrifoglio Verde, a GT3 class or a Gran Turismo like the Mercedes-Benz AMG SLS, offers completely different experiences and sensations, which translate into months of practice necessary to master each of them to the fullest; while bearing in mind that some models, such as the legendary Lotus Type 49 which we talked about in our special Auto in game 6, you will probably never be able to tame them to the end. If this were not enough, it is possible to intervene on a plethora of settings to customize the driving experience in detail, based on one's skills and available peripherals: there is no doubt that Assetto Corsa is designed to be fully enjoyed with the steering wheel and pedals, however for those who wished, the title is easily playable (in this case the term is appropriate) even with a joypad or keyboard. Among the configurable electronic aids we find the classic ABS, Traction Control (TCS) and Stability Control (SCS), for which, with the exception of the SCS, it is even possible to insert the factory setting, to perfectly replicate the behavior of the cars real. In support of the simulation it is also possible to decide whether to enable the tyrewarmers, tire wear, the incidence of the wake effect, fuel consumption, the automatic clutch and even the classic automatic ~heel-toe~. Already from these settings you can perceive the depth and versatility of the driving model, but it is possible to go into even more detail by tinkering with the advanced configurations of the steering wheel and, above all, with those of the pre-race menu, where the most passionate mechanics the doors of a very refined set-up open up. At the start of each race, the most suitable configuration for the chosen circuit is loaded, however it is possible to put one's hands on practically every component of the car: on a very powerful Ferrari 458 GT2, for example, it is possible to configure the gears, the type and tire pressure, the liters of fuel loaded, the front splitter and rear wing adjustment, the camber and toe of the tires, the shock absorbers, the suspensions and even the differential, for almost total control of the vehicle and with tangible consequences on driving. Although such depth may appear daunting for the less shrewd player, on Assetto Corsa it is still possible to calibrate the driving experience with very comfortable fast settings suitable for novices, for whom we also recommend taking a look at this special interview of ours, in which it is reported some useful suggestions provided to us directly by Aristotelis Vasilakos, the main architect of the sublime physics engine together with Stefano Casillo. There's a trail for you Having ascertained the astonishing solidity of the driving model, which can be translated, paraphrasing Marco Massarutto's words at the official presentation, as ~the technology of simulators costing millions of Euros in a videogame costing a few tens of Euros~, it is right to say a few words about content that this fascinating gaming experience has to offer. Added in the Release Candidate and replenished with numerous additional events in the very fresh 1.0 version, the Career mode provides a series of dynamic scenarios to be unlocked in sequence, where the player, aboard ever faster and more performing cars, is engaged in single races , championships, classic time attack and so on, in which it is necessary to earn points and unlock the inevitable medals to progress. Bench the core of the experience is represented by online competitions, the main mode for single player is still enjoyable and exciting, also thanks to the aggressive artificial intelligence (definitely improved compared to the debut), the cutscenes that introduce the events and the renewed level of proposed challenge, now adjustable to multiple levels of difficulty, which pushes you to constantly improve to obtain the most precious metal. As with any other component of the title, the Career mode is completely open to the modder community, who can, for example, introduce new events as well as create totally customized series. There is no doubt, however, that the attention for mods is directed above all to liveries, cars and circuits, but there are also the ~App~ features in Python that can be called up on the right of the screen, which are proving very successful among enthusiasts. As specified, the title Kunos Simulazioni offers about fifty cars divided between road and racing cars, a number destined to rise also officially through DLC and expansions planned throughout 2015, both paid and free. The latest arrival in the Assetto Corsa garage with version 1.0 is a variant of the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Q.V., while by the end of the year and free of charge for everyone, the legendary Ruf Yellow Bird, a very elaborate Porsche 911 from 1987, will also be added For those who are not satisfied by the official numbers, the quality level of some mods is practically comparable to the professional work of the developers: just think of the Shelby Cobra 427 SC by The Meko and Pankykapus, purchased by Kunos Simulazioni and introduced - after the necessary adjustments - officially in the garage of the title, or the more recent and splendid Lamborghini Miura P400SV, characterized by a superb polygonal model (although it gives some headaches with force feedback and is not yet complete). Among the circuits available we mention Silverstone in several variants, the marvelous Spa-Francorchamps, Monza (modern and 1966), the Nurburgring GP (with the Dream Pack the legendary Nordschleife will also arrive), Imola, Mugello and others, including Vallelunga and the already cited Magione racetrack. The seventeen-kilometre long time trial of Trento-Bondone is also very interesting, although it doesn't have the same refinement as the tracks just mentioned. If that weren't enough, both on the Assetto Corsa official website and on other portals it is possible to download dozens and dozens of new circuits for every taste and type, including real, totally invented or perhaps ~fished~ with both hands from other titles, such as the 'Autumn Mini Ring by Gran Turismo or Prato by netKar Pro. Among the most recent showcased, the Australian Barbagallo Raceway is undoubtedly the best published to date. The senior programmer Giovanni Romagnoli, also responsible for the excellent compatibility with Oculus Rift, told us that the team is working hard to support the Steamwork platform, which will benefit the cataloging and updating of the huge mod pool. Returning to the game modes, in addition to the aforementioned career, it is possible to embark on totally personalized competitions, complete race weekends, challenges against time, drifting competitions, special events and above all online sessions, as mentioned, the beating heart of the entire experience. Although still under development, the online component is quite solid thanks to the many dedicated and private servers, with dozens of races that you can take part in at any time of the day. The filters to access the different competitions are numerous and varied, it is also possible to program free practice sessions and qualifications complete with a pit stop, still not available in the single player due to the additional work required on artificial intelligence. With version 1.0 of the game, however, the possibility of making races longer than ten laps was introduced, although this is an incomplete feature pending the addition of the aforementioned pit stops, given that it is necessary to disable tire wear and of fuel to proceed. The mechanical damage system is quite deep and embraces various components, including the engine, while the aesthetic ones, as we have already explained in our previous specials, closely resemble those present on Forza Motorsport 5. There are still some small details to record, but overall they work very well, as does the penalty system for those who cut corners and the like. Fortunately, playing online, the vast majority of virtual pilots are correct, and guarantee sessions that are decidedly less ~chaotic~ than other similar products.", "date": "2014-12-22", "grade": "9.3"}
