At the time, the Switch still didn't have an official name, and nobody imagined how troubled the development would be: the version for the Nintendo hybrid console would be released only four years later, a couple of years after the others and several months after the version pc. To justify the crazy delay, Square Enix enriched the Switch version with content, also implementing the dubbing - absent in the first version - and the orchestral soundtrack by Koichi Sugiyama: despite the graphic downgrade compared to PlayStation 4 and PC, the so-called Definitive Edition for Switch represented the best possible version of what is probably the best Dragon Quest of the thirty-year JRPG saga. The owners of the previous version have hoped for years that Square Enix would publish an update or even a paid DLC with extra content added to the Switch version, really many and of quality, but the requests remained unheard until the announcement of the same version not only for PlayStation 4 and PC, but also for Xbox One. A bolt from the blue which, on balance, left us with a bitter taste in our mouths, as you will discover by reading the following lines. To find out more about Dragon Quest XI, we refer you to our mammoth review of the Switch version that we have already published at the exit: it is, in fact, the exact same game ... in practically every aspect! History with a twist The Dragon Quest series has never been acclaimed for the stories it tells, but the producer Yuji Horii this time has decided to adapt to more modern standards without betraying his fairytale and parodic spirit. Thanks to more dynamic shots, an excellent adaptation of the dialogues in Italian, the dubbing in English and in Japanese, Dragon Quest XI returns a whole new rhythm. In the very first minutes of the game, a woman rescues her infant son by paying for her courage with her life. The infant grows up and becomes our protagonist who, having come of age, discovers that he is the reincarnation of the Lucente, a legendary hero who appears every time the Dark Lord threatens the world of Erdrea. During a long and full of surprises journey, many characters will join our hero or stand in his way: the Definitive Edition further puts the hand on a captivating and well-represented cast with new missions that delve into some pivotal moments of the story . Old school exploration and craftsmanship Dragon Quest is now a famous franchise in our country too, especially after the release of Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King, and everyone should know that it has always represented the traditional Japanese JRPG. Square Enix has once again beaten this safe path, without risking strange experiments: Dragon Quest XI is not an open world title, even if the vastness of the scenarios would suggest otherwise. Although it is possible to run at breakneck speed or ride the most bizarre creatures, the lack of more sophisticated exploration continues to be felt, but Dragon Quest XI is actually a fairly easy and intuitive title, at least until you come across some boss or certain challenging enemies. In those cases it is necessary to use the spells and techniques in the arsenal of the various characters intelligently, especially if you want to face the many secondary contents at the end of the adventure. The player has a certain amount of control over the growth of the characters: each of them corresponds to a sort of chessboard which allows you to spend the Skill Points earned to progress in the various skills: each square purchased unlocks the surrounding ones in a sort of chain which requires a minimum of planning, although it is possible to reset the spent points at any time by spending a few pennies. It is worth mentioning that it is also possible to check a series of items, at the start of a new game, with which you can customize the experience, for example by removing the possibility of escaping from battles or buying new items from merchants. In Dragon Quest XI, in fact, there is no real Game Over, given that the defeat of the party sends us directly back to the last save with the wallet halved. Despite this, Square Enix has implemented a novelty that significantly lightens the whole, namely the camp: it is a safe area where players can restore life points and magic points, mto also chat with the group and save the game. At the camp, you can also use the Celestial Forge, a fun crafting system. Once you have learned a new formula - often hidden in libraries around the world - it is possible to manufacture the corresponding object through a nice mini-game: by completing the process with a minimum of attention, you get your hands on the best weapons and protections. In the Definitive Edition, the celestial forge can also be accessed at any time by selecting it in the inventory, a solution that is not exactly elegant, but very practical since it allows us to manufacture new objects on the fly. Fights and extra content The combat system is particularly suitable for those who do not have a great experience in JRPG, but can also give a lot of satisfaction to strategy lovers. No great tactics are needed in the beginning, and the enemies are funny enough to make every battle delightful. Perky powers are probably the most ~complex~ dynamic of the fights: characters can temporarily become stronger, unlocking a series of cinematic special attacks that they can perform alone or together with their companions. This condition lasts for several turns and doesn't necessarily expire at the end of a fight, so players can manipulate the mechanism to tackle bosses and more challenging tasks. Some NPCs, in fact, will entrust us with small missions to complete in order to obtain objects, weapons or formulas in exchange. Dragon Quest XI is a rich and enduring title. The main story is completed in about fifty hours, to which we must add the abundant content after the end credits which, in reality, are not exactly optional, given that they constitute to all intents and purposes the second part of the adventure and lead to a large even more satisfying ending. It's a really interesting and different solution from the usual, which ingeniously exploits the narrative trick of time travel: if you love completing RPGs to 100%, Dragon Quest XI is a title that could capture your attention for over a hundred hours without ever getting bored. Playstation 4 trophies The Definitive Edition of Dragon Quest XII unlocks one platinum, one gold, seven silver and forty-eight bronze trophy. They are different trophies compared to those of the original version: Square Enix has in fact removed five and added three unpublished ones, relating to extra content. One of them, of course, is unlocked by completing 2D missions in the city of Acronia. The Definitive Edition on PlayStation 4? The Definitive Edition of Dragon Quest XI on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC is identical to the Switch in terms of content  and more. And perhaps this could represent a sensible reason for disappointment for all those who waited for it and perhaps even gave up hope. Let's start with the good news: the extras are all there, starting with the most important, namely the excellent dubbing in English and Japanese and the orchestral soundtrack. Unlike the original version for PlayStation 4 and PC, in which the music was simple midi, the Definitive Edition includes the soundtrack in a symphonic version and it is possible to switch from one to the other by selecting the appropriate option in the settings page. Anyone who has played the original version of the Square Enix title will immediately notice the leap in quality: although not all the music has been rearranged, most finally do justice to the compositions of the controversial musician Koichi Sugiyama. In the transition to Switch, Square Enix had to sacrifice something especially in terms of definition and lighting: some shadows disappeared, but also the grass in the wide prairies and the more sophisticated graphic effects, lightening the load of a title that still returned a fluid world and colorful thanks to the cartoon style of Akira Toriyama. For owners of the Nintendo console it was an almost miraculous conversion, and one of the reasons that prompted many players to wait and hope for the Definitive Edition for other platforms was the greater definition and cleanliness found in the versions previously released for PC and PlayStation 4. The problem is that the new Definitive Edition is nothing more than a conversion of the Switch version, with which it shares almost the same graphic shortcomings, in the face of a higher resolution and a slightly more incisive anti-aliasing filter on the code that we tested for PlayStation 4 Pro. Clearly it is a great pity, but our judgment is still very positive because the Square Enix title is phenomenal, even if the decision to convert the graphically me version is burning.not cured (to the delight of PC users who will probably resort to any mods to improve it). From a certain point of view, the Japanese developer's solution seems understandable: the extra contents were designed for the Nintendo console and integrated into the gameplay, so perhaps it would not have been so easy to simply add them to the old editions for PC and PlayStation 4, even by virtue of the first release on Xbox One. We are still talking about trifles, of course. The definition of the image is however more than good and our perspective is simply polluted by the knowledge of the original version: probably a player who tries Dragon Quest XI for the first time already in the Definitive Edition will not even realize these shortcomings, but others will remain bitter in the mouth for the opportunity that Square Enix has squandered.", "date": "2020-12-01", "grade": "9.0"}
