{"name": "Pandora  Bricks", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pandora-bricks_a.html", "text": "During the passing of the baton between the ancient and the new generation of divinities, the forces of Chaos, subjected to the control of Enki at the end of a battle that took place at the beginning of time, interfered, taking advantage of the momentary weakness of the righteous to cause havoc. Who but the demigod Gilgamesh assisted by the wisdom of Enki will be able to restore peace? Apart from the vicissitudes, it is a close relative of the ~racket-and-ball~ games (or ~bat'n'ball~ as they call them across the Channel) born from BreakOut and Arkanoid with the particularity of having four rackets distributed each on the four sides of the screen , of these two are controlled by you as Gilgamesh and two are under the benevolent supervision of Enki, however there is another possible scenario, if you have a friend equipped with another cell phone with Pandora Bricks a cooperative game is possible (two rackets each) by activating Bluetooth. Thirty paintings to cross, every ten of these there is an intermediate monster beaten which changes setting and backdrop, as in each descendant of the progeny of Arkanoid the breaking of the bricks could release bonuses or malus such as magnetism, enlargement or shrinkage of the racket , inverted controls, pinball-style multiball, (it must be said that here the magnetism, for example, is graphically spectacular as well as evolved from the point of view of physics), demolishing ball, etc. The bricks themselves can be crumbly, massive or indestructible, and rather annoying enemies continually spawn in the play area, deflecting the ball's trajectory on impact. What does not fall within the ordinary administration however is the effects of the Javart title, deformations of the screen with the action in progress or transition in the key passages worthy of the infamous Mode7 which gave so much prestige to the SuperNES, ripple effects in four directions, inverse zoom , hyper-animated backdrops, there's plenty to be taken by surprise. PRO exceptional effects thirty levels and three monsters AGAINST baroque and excessive at the expense of playability", "date": "2007-03-13", "grade": "S.V."}
