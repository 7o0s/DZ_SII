We are talking about the early days of videogames, and since then there have been ~reissues~ as technological progress allowed it: the classic created, among others, by Nolan Bushnell has changed clothes several times over the decades, as have numerous it was the clones, more or less shameless, who revived the gameplay. Block Breaker 3 Unlimited substantially falls into this category, given that the fundamental concepts of the Gameloft title are the same as Breakout (a bar that moves in the lower part of the screen and a ball that bounces against it...), but enriched by a series of elements that make the experience more dynamic and engaging, multiplying the playing area depending on the case and inserting bonuses and upgrades that can make the difference in certain situations. The experience of the French house is also felt in terms of numbers, given that we are given the opportunity to face about one hundred levels divided into seven thematic areas, each characterized by a different opponent to defeat, as well as accessing alternative modes to the main one, with obvious repercussions on the longevity of a product that is available on the App Store for only 79 cents. The ball bounces The immediacy of Block Breaker 3 Unlimited is indisputable, and a few moments are enough to ~take the measures~ of the Gameloft title, which already in the first levels tries to put us in difficulty with close blocks and rapid rebounds. As the bricks are destroyed by our metal sphere, bonuses and power-ups fall down that can earn us an extra life, equip us with cannons, activate a magnetic system for recalling the ball, a momentary barrier that prevents us from making mistakes and more. All extras that, if desired, can also be purchased through an in-game system, which however smacks a lot of ~paid cheats~ and that players with a minimum of skill and patience can easily ignore. As per tradition, the simple bricks are sometimes accompanied by more resistant versions, which must be hit several times to make them disappear, and to this situation are added variables such as the flying ~little monsters~, which we can damage with the ball but which in fact constitute a further obstacle and they can mislead us due to an unforeseen rebound. The connotation of the stages is never static, but expands into a feast of lights and colours: once all the bricks on a screen are destroyed, the metal sphere can end up in a duct which transports it rapidly to another ~room~, and then away until the conquest of the star that determines the completion of the level. In this sense, the boss fights constitute a further element of variety and challenge. From a graphic point of view, the developers have done a great job: the use of colors, the design of the levels and the style in general appear perfect for this type of operation. On the (very important) front of the controls, however, we cannot hide some perplexities: in fact, the touch system seemed too reactive to be able to support us in the most precise manoeuvres, while the one based on the accelerometer does not have a button for instant calibration and during our tests found the starting position ~off-center~ compared to the correct one. We expect an update that resolves these details, perhaps adding the ability to control the wand directly, by dragging a finger across the touch screen.
