In fact, the package includes software that is essential for the use of the game to which it is linked, but so complete and multifunctional that, really, one wonders how it is possible that no one else has ever thought of it before. PlayOnline (more commonly known as POL) is an interface through which it is possible to do practically everything. Conveniently enclosed in a small window, it allows you to access your account and modify it, send e-mails, read the news regarding Final Fantasy, download music, desktop wallpapers, electronic postcards and much more. Through POL, it is possible to contact who is playing by sending simple messages and receiving replies, add new contacts to your Friend List and open chat channels with whom, perhaps, between one editorial article and another (totally random example...) he has in-game friends tell him what they are doing or the gossip of the day. The CD also includes the Tetra Master mini-game, usable by paying a negligible monthly fee, inspired by the homonymous card game that characterized Final Fantasy IX (and Final Fantasy VIII, in the previous version called Triple Triad) and even more fun. A storyline for an MMORPG A complex and gripping story is the backdrop to FFXI, which begins when the Beastmen, evil intelligent creatures, gathered under the banner of the cruel Shadow Lord, starting the Crystal War. Thus the nations formed the Alliance of Altana, benevolent goddess and mother of all races, and with many sacrifices they defeated the demonic adversary, starting a period of peace. But now twenty years have passed and we find ourselves catapulted into a tumultuous era, where nations warily spy on each other and where darkness and light mingle. A shadow falls over Vana'diel, it is rumored that the return of the Shadow Lord is near, that Duke Kum'Launaut of the imposing Consulate of Jeuno is plotting something in the shadows, that the Zilart race is not as extinct as believed, that the chained god Promathia is breaking free from the prison that has kept the world from falling victim to his evil for centuries. And guess who will have to carry the weight of all these impending woes on their shoulders? You, of course... but you won't be alone. Genesis of a Hero The first choice that the player is called to make after having installed the excellent PlayOnline Viewer interface, six GB of game, mega upon mega of patches and even the expansions (Rise of the Zilart and Chains of Promathia), after having viewed the splendid introductory movie and then having drooled for about an hour and a half on the six discs of the most awaited game of the moment without being able to touch it, clearly concerns one's alter-ego. The world of Vana'diel is populated mainly by five races: Hume (human beings), Elvaan (the race that most resembles elves), Tarutaru (funny dwarfs with canine noses), Mithra (anthropomorphic cats) and Galka (a cross between a bear, a lion and a gorilla whose head is as big as a Tarutaru); note that only the first three races have a male and female version: the Mithras are only females, the Galkas only males. Each race has its peculiarities and the choice must also take into account the professions one intends to undertake: the Elvaan, for example, contrary to the commonplace which would see them as graceful and shy wizards, are the most powerful warriors; Tarutaru, on the other hand, have high magic-use bonuses but are poor fighters; the Mithras are discreet sorceresses and possess extraordinary agility and dexterity; the Galka are the worst mages in the game but the most formidable warriors; the Humes, on the other hand, are the most balanced, an excellent choice for those who want to try everything. Once you have selected the breed that best suits you, any sex, size and one of the available faces (ahinoi, only eight pairs), it is time to decree the nation of departure: although at the beginning it may seem a superficial and of little account, one's nationality will have important repercussions on the playful experience, influencing quests, missions, fame and much more. There are three nations in which it is possible to be born, and certain races will receive an object as a gift by being born in their county: the Kingdom of San d'Oria, the medieval homeland of the Elvaan, the Republic of Bastok, the industrial city of Hume and Galka, and the Federation of Windurst, a village surrounded by nature that is home to Mithra and Tarutaru. The Job System Let's take a step back. We have chosen the race, the stature, our face, we prepare to be ~born~ on Vana'diel... but one decision still remains to be made: the initial profession. In Final Fantasy XI, the Job System that characterized Final Fan returnstasy IV, which was reworked into Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, which changed the JRPG genre, greatly influencing the products that came after. We are initially presented with a forlorn list of just six jobs: Warrior, Monk, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage, Red Mage. The initial jobs are a good starting point if you already have an idea of what you want to become, but if the player is uncomfortable with the job chosen at the beginning, it will not be necessary to start over, since the ingenious element that most characterizes Final Fantasy XI is the possibility of changing one's profession at any time: just go to one's Moghouse (a sort of city shelter) and through a simple menu it is possible to leave the path to Kenshiro del Monk to become a White Mage expert in healing. Every time you change jobs, the one on the bench maintains the painstakingly accumulated levels by killing monsters, while we lose all the benefits. This mechanism undergoes major upheavals twice. The first time takes place once you reach the eighteenth level with any job: it will in fact be possible to complete a quest that will allow you to use another job at the same time as the main one, so that the player will find himself managing two jobs, a Main and a Support (or Sub-job). The combination must be contemplated strategically, as it has a not indifferent limit: the support job in this condition will, in fact, be reduced to half the level of the main job. In short, the player will find that he is influenced by the secondary job in a limited way, but will still receive the bonuses essential to continuing the game. The combination of Main plus Support job is very important: it not only affects the solitary play experience but also the community one. It goes without saying that an unlikely combination of Warrior and White Mage will never be welcomed by other players, resulting in a fighter who absolutely does not benefit from the statistical bonuses necessary for his trade: much better to bet on a Warrior / Monk, for example . cross and delight of the Eleventh Final Fantasy, therefore, cooperation is also a way to obtain greater satisfaction The Job System If the possible combinations already seem many and intriguing, this happens even more with the second jolt mentioned above, which at the same time has the obvious limitations of the Job System: at level 30 of any job, in fact, it is possible to bring at the end of the quests that will unlock another nine jobs, called Advanced Jobs, in short. Therefore the Paladin (Paladin), the Dark Knight (Dark Knight), the Ranger, the Dragoon, the Bard (the Bard), the Beast Master (the Lord of the Beasts), the Samurai, the Ninja and the inevitable Summoner ( the Summoner). Characterized by greater complexity in their management and in the range of specific skills, the Advanced jobs increase the variety of combinations and, at the same time, end up forcing the player to fixate on particular pairings to make the most of the skills of the main job. The Paladin, for example, is the ~tank~ par excellence, that is, he is the one who in group fights attracts all the hatred of the monster upon himself, taking the attacks in place of the other members thanks to the greater defense and the ability to heal himself through the white magic he can use: it is logical, therefore, that it depends more on the Warrior's skills, such as the Provoke, which allows you to draw the enemy's attention to himself, or the useful Defender, which increases even more plus defense; this then leads to a universal combination, that of the Paladin/Warrior, which in its obvious logic prevents any Paladin from experimenting with other Support Jobs. Such cases are often encountered: the Red Mage should be supported only by the Black or White Mage, the Monk only by the Warrior, the Summoner is a practically useless Support Job, and so on. In short, the Job System is probably the best and most salient feature of Final Fantasy XI, but it is not without flaws, first of all therefore the illusion of unlimited variety and combinations, fueled by the mechanics itself and destroyed by the needs of the community online, and also based on elements that are certainly not secondary in importance such as race (which can however be circumvented through equipment and its bonuses). Of course, it is possible to ignore it and create the combinations you like best, but you have to collide with the more closed mentalities, demonstrating only with facts that the most used combination is not always the best. To War! We are at the crucial moment, we were born in a city (San d'Oria? Windurst? Bastok?), we grabbed the timid Onion Sword (onion sword...) supplied, we went out into the open, welcomed after a short load by a rocky wasteland, a dense forest or a verdant clearing, and we prepare to face with trembling legs our first enemy, a deadly helpless bunny with sweet eyes and long ears. Fighting is the main activity of Final Fantasy XI and it is enormously simple: once you have engaged in battle with the appropriate commands, you position yourself close to the enemy (it is possible to move around him, but this does not affect the progress of the fight in any way) and wait for the automatic attacks to stop only when the enemy is defeated or our corpse lies on the ground. Initially, therefore, the fights are yawning: there's not much else to do but watch our alter-ego and his opponent fight each other. As you level up, however, you begin to learn two types of skills: Traits and Abilities. The first are the characteristics of the job, permanent and passive (ie automatic): the Monk, for example, learns HP Max Boost which increases his life points, while the Warrior learns Defensive Bonus which increases his defense; there are several Traits, from those that only increase statistics to more varied ones that, for example, decrease the loading time of spells or pseudo-immunize to certain ailments such as blindness, poison. The Abilities, on the other hand, are precisely the Abilities of the job, usable in combat and each characterized by various parameters (such as duration and reactivation time): these are the ones that enliven the fights and it is the player's duty to get to know them and use them in best of ways. Spells are also Abilities: they are learned by recovering the necessary parchments and ~using them~ to learn magic, which from that moment on can be cast by competent jobs using the necessary Magic Points (MP). It's just one example of the multitude of Skills that the game offers, sometimes bizarre and unusual like the Ninjutsu of the Ninjas (who waste particular objects called Shihei) or the songs of the Bard. So as you proceed in your ~growth~, the field of Abilities offered by Main and Support Job increases more and more and at advanced levels the fights become more and more fun and ~active~, thus involving a painstaking group work which implies the knowledge of the trades of the companions, especially on the occasion of the infamous Weapon Skills and Skillchains. Weapon Skills are special attacks depending on the weapon in use (each Job can use various types of weapons to which he is more or less similar) which can be launched when an indicator reaches at least 100% TP (Tactical Point); the TP are earned by hitting the enemy, being hit in turn, using particular Skills (such as the useful Meditate of the Samurai), and the greater the amount of TP discharged with a single Weapon Skill, the better the performance of the latter will be. With timing, it is then possible to combine two or more Weapon Skills, executing them in sequence according to a certain pattern, and producing the Skillchains, bonus damage that can be decisive. A particularly good Magician, however, can cast the right magic at the right moment and obtain a Magic Burst, ie a bonus to the damage inflicted by the spell in question. It is therefore clear that the fights in Final Fantasy XI imply a strong collaborative component, placing enormous emphasis on teamwork, which characterizes the game so much right from the start, making it impossible (and this is the major flaw of the Square Enix title) to solitary use if not at the highest levels, when in any case there will remain insurmountable obstacles for single-player play. Cross and delight of the Final Fantasy, therefore, cooperation is also a way to obtain greater satisfaction: defeating a terrible monster with seventeen other friends and sharing the loot earned with so much effort is the most satisfying and fun thing in the world of Vana'diel , not so much for the gain itself, but for the experience actually lived.

[/C] Life on Vana'diel So we created a character, we were born into a nation, we gave him a job, maybe we even changed it because we didn't like it... What else is there to do in Final Fantasy XI? Well, we won't deceive you: the game is particularly focused on level-up, on the experience gained by fighting dozens and dozens of monsters. It's not po", "date": "2004-10-01", "grade": null}
