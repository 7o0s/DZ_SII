The mechanics are similar to those seen in the aforementioned Ballistic SE, but with the big difference represented by the maze-style levels, whose corridors gradually become more complex and must be explored in search of bonuses or surviving opponents before reaching the exit . It's not a Cave-style bullet hell, that's for sure, also because the scrolling of the scenario is not fixed and depends on our movements, but in some circumstances there will really be hundreds of bullets that will rain down on us and that we will have to try to dodge to do not lose precious life energy, or to ~absorb~ without consequences by activating the shield. In this regard, we must immediately open a dutiful parenthesis: playing at the intermediate difficulty level, the stages run away without particular headaches and we practically ~forget~ about the possibility of activating the shield, also because we leave the right virtual stick to press the relative button on the touch screen is not the most immediate operation in the world. Beyond the convenience of the maneuver, however, the problem undoubtedly depends on the balancing of the difficulty, which in practice until the advent of the third boss never forces us to resort to energy shielding (whose functioning is determined by an indicator that empties over time and then resets automatically when it is not called into question). If you haven't ~trained~ with the Cave titles, perhaps it will be more difficult for you to complete the game, but for savvy users the situation is different and the duration of the experience could be affected. In this case, we suggest that you immediately jump on the higher difficulty level. Acid shooter The Inferno+ control system is based entirely on the touch screen, with two virtual analog sticks on the sides of the screen and two buttons in the central part to possibly activate the smart bomb and the energy shield. From the options screen it is possible to customize the controls in various ways, adjust the sensitivity and position of the sticks and even activate support for an external controller, so you will really have no problem finding the most comfortable solutions for you. Everything else is action: you enter each level from a gap and the goal is to look for its twin, or the exit, while eliminating any threat, static or mobile. The developers have done an excellent job in terms of the quantity and variety of enemies, ranging from turrets to ~bubbles~, from ships that open fire asymmetrically to ~black holes~ capable of attracting us, to finally arrive at bosses, particularly armored and overflowing with cannons from which they emit thousands of shots at our address. Each eliminated opponent releases points that we can collect and spend in the ~shops~ located within the scenarios to buy various types of upgrades: pods, bombs, improvements for the speed of the ship, for the cannons, for the shield and etc. In short, the structural framework appears complete, and is supported in a tremendously effective way by a mix of graphics and sound perfect for the genre, which contrast a sort of very fluid wireframe with acid colors with trance music just a bit repetitive.", "date": "2012-07-27", "grade": "8.3"}
