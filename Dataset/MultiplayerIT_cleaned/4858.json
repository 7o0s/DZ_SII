Just a few months ago we described to you Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms, an ambitious soulslike that boasts the collaboration of a monster sacred of the industry like Chris Avellone. If the aforementioned project represents the long-term future of Gamera, the present instead responds to the name of Unit 4, a nice old school platformer with pixel art graphics, usable both solo and in cooperative mode up to a maximum of four players. Despite the complexities of the independent market, especially in our country, the new Italian reality seems to already have very clear ideas on how to gradually expand its presence and make itself known to the public. Although at first glance Alaloth and Unit 4 appear to be two projects that are very distant from each other, both in size and in purpose, there is a minimum common denominator that is by no means negligible, represented both by the high level of challenge and by the idea of drawing from past titles. And if in the first case the reference point from which the developers started is a work dating back to Moonstone, with Unit 4 it was decided to pay homage more generally to the tradition of the classic 2D platformers of times gone by. Before continuing, we remind you that the game is available today on Xbox One and PC and is sold at a price of 14.99 euros. Odds Unit 4 is a 2D platformer from yesteryear: in single player you have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts! Guardians of the Galaxy Being a platform that draws heavily on tradition, Unit 4 is not afraid to show itself for what it is: a grim game, in which you wink at longtime fans and try to leverage the inevitable nostalgia factor . The peculiarity of the game system consists of the presence of four protagonists that can be selected without interruption during one's game, on the basis of the needs that arise from time to time from each puzzle, obstacle or enemy to be overcome. Each of these characters has specific qualities, such as the ability to double jump, to move rapidly forward for short distances, to attach to walls and platforms with the aid of a grappling hook or to become invisible to cross obstacles that otherwise they would be impassable. Considering the old school imprint, the story that forms the backdrop to the adventures of this assorted team is nothing more than a pretext to introduce the player to the fifteen stages along which the adventure develops. In the universe of Unit 4 an alien civilization has stolen a precious artifact from the population to which the intrepid protagonists belong, and so an arduous journey begins in an attempt to recover the lost resources before it's too late. Simple isn't it? Not much, since the journey will be fraught with obstacles of all kinds and will put your patience to the test even before your reflexes. The structure of the levels is very linear and involves moving from an entry point to an exit point without time limits, but there are also the classic moments of escaping from looming threats or crossings aboard some vehicles. For the entire duration of the game, trial & error mechanisms are mostly privileged, aimed at learning the most suitable strategy to continue towards the coveted next checkpoint. Xbox One goals The objectives of Unit 4 are 44 in total. The most difficult are to complete all the levels of each area at 100% or to defeat some bosses without ever dying. Password: perseverance As we have already mentioned, Unit 4 can be experienced alone or in cooperative mode alongside one or more friends. The first solution is obviously the one designed for the more hardcore players, since in these moments the game is extremely punishing, putting a strain on the player's reflexes and coordination. The greatest difficulties emerge as soon as it becomes necessary to switch from one character to another in rapid succession in order to successfully overcome a particularly difficult obstacle. The entry into the game of at least one other user therefore helps to reduce the general complexity of the stages, facilitating the advance towards the next boss. The idea of exploiting the collaboration between characters turned out to be pleasant and interesting to use, nevertheless we encountered some balancing problems in their use. Just to make it clear, the protagonist in the blue uniform is clearly the most exploited, closely followed by the one in the red uniform, while the one in yellowhe proves to be the least effective of the team. And although the guys from Gamera have remarked that this disparity derives from a specific design choice, this solution lends itself to some limitations when deciding to take part in a four-player cooperative session. Overall, the control system proved to be sufficiently responsive, however we would have liked to be able to re-enter the game with a little more immediacy during shared sessions. Being a 2D platformer with a classic setting, it is at least singular that it is not even possible to join a game that has already started at any time, but on the contrary you have to wait to return to the planet map. If necessary, it is possible to return to your spaceship and move within the solar system to reach the other planets which have been unlocked in the meantime. Precisely in these phases the only parts of text appear - strictly in English - which are activated when you try to contact the command or reach the secondary destinations in search of secrets to unlock. During the exploration, you also get access to two galactic shops where you can buy new skins for the characters and some materials useful for changing the look of your aircraft. But in Unit 4 there are even quotes, starting from the name of the spacecraft, which has been called The Garriott in honor of the famous game designer Richard Garriott (and who, not surprisingly, is also one of the undisputed idols of Alberto Belli, CEO and founder by Gamera Interactive, but don't tell him that otherwise he won't let you go!). Moreover, there are even more or less obvious references to films and video games from the past, which certainly will not escape the most attentive players. As for the graphics, we believe that an extra effort could have been made. The characters are a little too anonymous and also the originality of the backdrops and other parts that make up the scenario is rather fluctuating. The care for the level design is more convincing, since each sector offers unique and distinctive characteristics. The same goes for the bosses who, while not numerous, are well differentiated and effectively test the player's skills. We also encountered a few small technical flaws here and there during our tests, but the studio has assured us that all the problems have already been fixed in the day one build.", "date": "2017-05-24", "grade": "7.5"}
