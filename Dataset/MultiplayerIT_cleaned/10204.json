However, we have also witnessed real experiments that have seen this genre mix with others that are apparently not very connected, with surprising results to say the least. One of the most striking examples was certainly Puzzle Quest, which replaced the canonical part of the fights with battles based on Bewelejed, and depopulated first on DS and PSP, then everywhere thanks to the perfect mix of the two components and a balanced implementation in all its parts. We then come to Sword & Poker, which follows the above philosophy and replaces the puzzle part with the French card game which is currently experiencing a second youth in our beautiful country too, with several reported cases of people kicked out by their spouse after having squandered all the savings in a gambling den with friends or in one of the numerous online sites dedicated to poker. The fact that the Japanese developer Gaia has not deigned to translate into English even the title sheet on the App Store (language then present in the game) has pushed its existence into the background on the Apple digital platform, and it is a real shame given the quality obtained. Gotta Poker'em all! Sword & Poker presents the classic situation of the hero of the moment who finds himself facing a myriad of monsters until he reaches the Lord of Darkness, ready to send the world into total Chaos. No space for frills such as dialogues and more, from the initial menu it is possible to choose a few options concerning audio, multiplayer on the same iPhone and then the main story. The progression is quite simple, there are ~floors~ to be tackled in sequence (but it is also possible to continue them in subsequent games), each with a map with some boxes to reach and which represent monsters, treasures or both. At the beginning of each floor it is possible to access the shop to buy weapons or upgrade the maximum number of energy in your possession, but if you die between one opponent and another you have to face it all over again. Once the box has been selected and the fight has begun, a spartan and essential graphic is presented, with the two contenders, their deck of cards and some of the characteristics in their possession, on the vertical opposite sides of the screen; in the center instead there is a grid that can accommodate up to 25 French cards, and 9 face up are already available on the playing field. The aim, respecting one's turn, is to select two from one's deck and place them on the sides of the grid, even diagonally, to thus obtain five cards and form one of the combinations present in a classic game of Poker, a sort of variant therefore with the so-called ~games~, jargon often used by those who play poker. Each valid combination provokes an attack on the opponent, obviously commensurate with its importance: a flush will do more damage than a two pair, a straight than a set and so on. Things get complicated near the filling of the grid, where it is also possible to exploit the external cards for linked combinations, and therefore it is necessary to plan the positioning of the cards and perhaps pass the hand to avoid opening new ones on several sides. Do not miss the combo bar, which after being filled allows you to transform one of the cards in your deck into a joker, with all the advantages of the case. What are spells and weapons for instead? To increase the offensive power of course and to change the cards on the table, it is appropriate to say. By purchasing new weapons, the damage inflicted for each type of combination will increase, it will be possible to add side effects (subtracting the best card from your opponent, making him miss a turn, etc.) and perhaps with magic shuffling the cards on the grid or directly attacking the opponent , in such a way as to increase the unpredictability of the game in progress. Obviously the enemies will not stand by and each category has in its ranks characteristics related to pure physical, magical or a combination of the two, including the inevitable bosses of the moment. The end result is more than good, with fast game progression and no downtime, a good strategy base and the undoubted charm of combining French cards together and maybe even thinking about the next move, when to use the combo, the spells, any energy resets, and whether or not to pass your hand. The programmersi have also been good at balancing the level of difficulty and introducing various additional elements as new opponents are challenged, even if, going a long way, the repetitive factor could get the better of someone, given the few concessions to the rest and to any plot , narration or variation on a theme. We therefore do not arrive at the same depth and variety of a Puzzle Quest or its descendants therefore, but we are always talking about a title that costs much less ( 2.39) and can guarantee a longevity made up of several hours thanks to its interesting gameplay .
