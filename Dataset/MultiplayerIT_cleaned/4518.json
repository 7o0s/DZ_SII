Specifically, this translates into a selling price of 10.99 euros for the complete package, without freemium mechanisms, without in-app purchases and without any of those elements that have characterized the smartphone games market for years now. Tablet. In short, the developers have taken GRID Autosport in all its complexity and have made it available to all owners of iOS terminals, preferably the most recent since we are talking about a product characterized by rather rich and detailed graphics. Once the game has been launched and a profile has been created, exactly as in the original edition, we will be able to choose whether to try our hand at a quick race, with a large number of single tournaments (also customizable) or with a career mode which will see us run within five different categories: Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner and Street. Depending on our choice we will find ourselves behind the wheel of very different cars: touring cars well placed on the ground, nervous and snappy open wheels, accessible and fun standard vehicles, all very well rendered in their peculiarities. In order to progress and make a name for ourselves, we will have to choose a team, sign sponsorship agreements that require the achievement of specific objectives and, finally, get on the track and do our best to bring home the best possible result. The Real Driving Simulator GRID Autosport is a driving game born in a very different context from the mobile one, so we were curious to understand how the adaptation to the touch / tilt control system and the graphic optimization necessary to make everything run smoothly were managed. best on iOS devices. Naturally, you need to allow yourself a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the controls and perhaps make some advanced adjustments, but we can say with some confidence that the default setting, which uses the accelerometer to steer and the touch screen to operate the accelerator and brake, works in an almost perfect way and guarantees excellent control of the vehicle, with the possibility of literally brushing the curves, counter-steering in the oversteer phase and overtaking at the limit with great ease. What's more: haptic feedback transmits the vibration of the tires on the asphalt, telling us when we're drifting, when we're off the track, when the brakes come into play and so on. The option relating to touch controls seemed decidedly less brilliant to us, with a clear sensation of poor reactivity that we hope will be fixed with the next updates. In structural terms, however, the game literally has it all: GRID Autosport offers hours and hours of entertainment, five different visuals, a very solid progression and mind-boggling numbers, given that we're talking about one hundred cars and as many tracks. all very well implemented. Thanks naturally to the original work done by Codemasters, given that the assets are precisely those created for the PC and console versions, with excellent polygonal models for the cars and scenarios rich in detail, with a view to a transposition work which in fact has only online multiplayer left out. So we come to the age-old question: how does such a complex and detailed production behave on iOS terminals? Well, on the iPhone 7 the graphics flow in a fairly fluid way, but there is some uncertainty and, in general, one feels the absence of an option to lower the general quality in favor of the frame rate: the only adjustment in this sense it is based solely on the charge level of the battery. The sound sector is excellent, with convincing effects and the possibility of downloading the narrative voice in Italian for free.", "date": "2017-11-30", "grade": "9.0"}
