The charm of My Hero Academia and its characters flows powerfully in the game, which requires a substantial additional download after installation, but entertains us while waiting with an interesting summary of the events of the anime, which is presented in this way the young protagonist, the bizarre world in which he lives and his big dream: to become a hero. Contents My Hero Ultra Impact, the composition of the team Right from the start, My Hero Ultra Impact appears as a very traditional project, which incorporates the typical mechanics of the genre without attempting any variation on the theme. The main menu therefore immediately makes us feel at home, crowded as it is with options to experiment with: managing and upgrading characters, unlocking new fighters and missions, which form the core of the experience. Once the item is selected Quests we are faced with different possibilities, with the story mode dominating and a series of extra items that surround it but can only be activated after reaching a certain level. However, there are further digressions, see for example the possibility of modifying one's headquarters by changing its style and furnishings so as to make it more comfortable. Gameplay My Hero Ultra Impact, the fighting interface Regulated by an indicator of the energy of action that during the first hours always remains full, part of a welcome strategy that between unlocked achievements, rewards and trivial challenges aims to excite the player and give him the feeling of being able to get even at the end of the game without major problems, the missions of My Hero Ultra Impact certainly lack variety and depth. The formula, as mentioned, is that of strategic RPGs but the degree of interaction is reduced to the bone: what we can do is form the team, activate any special attacks and start the fight, but otherwise the action it takes place almost completely automatically, although it is possible to select a specific target in order to concentrate energies from time to time on a single enemy, perhaps the most dangerous. The possibility of speeding up the speed of the sequences and the inevitable ~auto~ button immediately give an idea of what Bandai Namco's approach has been, as mentioned, firmly anchored in the mechanics that these productions have shared for some time now, in an attempt to offer the largest number of contents possible and an accessibility that is too marked, suitable for casual gamers. The charm of the experience is therefore entrusted solely to the possible passion for My Hero Academia: if you know and love the series, certainly see in action its flagship characters and being able to unlock many more through the gacha mechanisms may excite you, otherwise you will get bored after a short time. From this point of view My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero (review) was undoubtedly a more ambitious project, albeit with its limitations. Graphics and sound My Hero Ultra Impact, Izuki prepares to unleash a special attack The cel shading graphics also in this case gives us an excellent representation of the protagonists of the anime, reproduced in a very faithful way and equipped with a decent set of animations. The game doesn't include exploratory sequences, only turn-based combat within scenarios that aren't particularly varied or interesting, so there's definitely an asset variety problem. The spectacularity of the special moves and the intensity of the Japanese dialogues succeed however to create a certain atmosphere, involving us in the clashes and increasing the degree of interest of the game at least in the first hours. Moreover, from the options it is possible to increase the level of detail and bring the frame rate to 60 fps, but we advise against it: it is a useless embellishment for gameplay purposes, but which will make your smartphone warm up more quickly.", "date": "2022-02-16", "grade": "6.0"}
