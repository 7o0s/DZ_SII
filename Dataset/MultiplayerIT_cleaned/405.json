{"name": "Pro Cycling Manager 06 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-cycling-manager-06-recensione.html", "text": "A continuous evolution As mentioned, what we want to do is privilege the innovative aspects, and therefore this is what we will do, starting with the managerial section. a number of improvements have been made, although they are still rather immature and all too often end up causing more problems than the benefits they offer A continuous evolution Profound changes have renewed this section. First of all the management of our digital alter ego, i.e. the card with our scores as sports directors. The skills are always the same, but finally they all have an effective utility, which we will however discuss in detail when we examine the game areas they affect. Furthermore, finally, experience points will be acquired based on the results obtained in the race and not on interviews with cyclists. The talks, in fact, have undergone radical changes, which have led to the complete elimination of the previous version, necessary in the last edition to get an idea of the form of the runners and to decide with them the program of races in which to participate . Now, however, we will only be called upon to speak in the event of a victory or honorable placement, and we will be asked if we wish to speak about it with the press, the team or the rider directly concerned. Depending, and according to the importance of the result obtained, we could improve or worsen the morale of the rider or the team (obviously to a lesser extent), or the opinion that the main sponsor of the team has of us. Too bad the options are always the same. Since we have named the sponsors, we might as well talk about them too. The revolution in this case too was radical: via the screen of objectives to choose from based on the difficulty, replaced by a predefined list of objectives and specific favorite races for each team. Unfortunately, however, this list is fixed, and does not depend on the team's real potential, so a team that was important at the beginning, but fell into disgrace, will be faced with objectives that have become impossible to meet, while the grown ones will still have negligible requests. In any case, not only are the main objectives important, but also the placings and victories in non-indicated races will help to increase the favor of the sponsor. A continuous evolution The news has also been updated, with the inclusion of the final results of the competitions, the advance indication of the most important cyclists present in the minor competitions, and the possibility for the organizers of a race to request the presence of one of our cyclists at their event , paying us for the inconvenience (obviously then we also need to convince the runner to like it...). The nerve center of a cycling team are the cyclists (and how else could it be, the bikes don't pedal by themselves...) so it is natural that there have been important variations in the management of human resources as well. First, now even runners can gain experience. This obviously takes place by participating in increasingly important competitions, obviously, however, a rider will not be able to improve if he is engaged in competitions below his level, nor if he is sent into disarray in those that are too much above his possibilities. In theory, once a cyclist passes a level he should receive a significant improvement, with the possibility that he will ~explode~ showing that he is a real talent, but honestly we really don't know what this consists of, given that the acquisition of points experience is quite slow, and we couldn't get any of them to fire. the most important champions will not accept to participate in all the races that we propose to them, but will only pretend to do the ones they want, and there is no way to make them change their mind A continuous evolution Completely unchanged however are the buying and selling of riders, the search for new talent, financial management and sponsors as well as training courses and staff, even if the coach has finally gained importance. We then come to the main innovation of the managerial section: training. It has been completely renewed, no longer a simple slider to set how much importance to give to the runner's improvement and how much to his physical form, but two completely separate systems. The fitness section has an intensity indicator that affects how quickly the athlete builds up their condition, but at the same time also tires them, limiting their performance. The really important thing is that all these values are visible, and therefore controllable in real time, thus allowing us to make the necessary changes. The result is really oexcellent, and easy to manage. Definitely the best innovation of the game. The improvement of the characteristics, on the other hand, raises considerable perplexities, as it always occurs regardless of the intensity of the training. The results obtained depend on many different aspects (unlike the old method in which only the intensity set by the slider counted), such as, the coach (whose experience can bring enormous benefits), morale (which greatly influences above all), the age and potential of the rider. We can therefore go from by now cooked cyclists who hardly improve anymore, to young promises who improve by looking at them. What causes much concern is the excess of these improvements, in fact, combining all the positive factors can lead to ridiculously high modifiers with the results you can see in the screenshots below. A continuous evolution So, if on the one hand training has improved in an excellent way, on the other it has turned into a semi-disaster... Yet another sign of the excessive haste with which Cyanide releases its games. In the saddle Earlier we talked about revolutions, but now I'm at a loss for terms, because the improvements applied to the 3D race are impressive. Graphic detail has grown enormously. A very high number of objects have been inserted on the side of the track, including the monuments of the cities crossed by the most prestigious races, furthermore the public finally moves and follows the cyclists with costumes and flags. Last but not least, it is possible to see the cyclists with different faces and body types, and no longer witness the Attack of the Clones (this however requires considerable graphic resources). Another purely aesthetic modification is the inclusion of a large number of additional views in addition to the free one, including that of the motorbikes filming for the television networks, the helicopter and the finish line. But what he really expected weren't small graphical frills, but a substantial step forward in gameplay. And that's what happened, or at least what Cyanide tried to do. now it is possible to experiment with different tactics depending on the situation, and one is no longer forced to rely on only a few profitable mechanisms: we can send our supporters to pull to break up the group, or leave them to protect the captain, leaving the others to do it, and the AI will react accordingly In the saddle The flaws however are found in the more difficult hill or mountain stages, where these tactics are applied too early. This is because runners expend energy too slowly, and so they can pull in the mountains for hundreds of kilometers (more than once I've let the same man pull for over a hundred kilometers, half of which is uphill, and he only broke away when they had started attacking the big names). This causes an excessive fragmentation of the group with accumulations of impressive delays (even over an hour), with the consequent withdrawal for having shoveled the maximum time of dozens of cyclists (the record for now is 101 in one fell swoop at the Tour de France, including all sprinters). In reality this does not happen, and the strongest teams only start shooting seriously in the last stages of the stage. In the saddle If before we complained about having too little information available during the race, now it will no longer be the case, because a very complete information panel has been implemented with everything that may be needed, from the classifications to the detailed plan, to the composition of the teams, to the detail the composition of the competing groups. A real convenience is that from any point of the panel and from the news it is possible to go directly to the selected runner with a simple click, completely eliminating the annoying searches that it was necessary to do in the past. once the race is over, we will be offered the opportunity to see the replay of the most important actions of the same In the saddle Nice to see the first few times, but nothing more, also because it only identifies certain actions as important, and often doesn't take into account the moments that really marked the stage. Numerous controversies arose instead from the decision to simplify the time trial stages, removing gear ratios, punches, and cadence of pedal strokes per minute in favor of a simpler, but certainly less technical slider similar to the one used in normal stages. Technical compartment And here, unfortunately, the donkey falls... you will certainly have already realized this by reading what has been written so far, but, unfortunately, PCM2 is full of problems of all kinds It starts from errors of assessment as for the new workouts, and choices applied in a superficial way, to get to real tacky mistakes. All seasoned with a number of crashes and bugs that in someIn unfortunate cases they completely prevent you from playing. Obviously the programmers were immediately snatched from holidays to remedy at least the most macroscopic cases. Two 25MB patches came out in a few days, but they were also immediately withdrawn when it was realized that instead of fixing the game's errors, they demolished it completely. Currently, even the first official version of the patch has been withdrawn as it is not stable at all. The real problem with the game, however, is that it is extremely demanding. It's not so much a question of graphics memory (with 128 MB you can run it almost at maximum detail, whatever the programmers say) or processor power. The trouble is that PCM2 claims to have 100% of the processor for its exclusive use and consumption, something that anyone who knows at least a minimum of Windows knows is completely impossible, given that it is constantly engaged in useless checks. In fact, despite having tested the game on an Athlon 3200+ with 1 GB of Ram (far too much compared to the Pentium 800 with 256 MB of Ram required), the game clicks in some moments, and this occurs precisely in those moments in which the operating system takes that 2-4% of the processor to run its tests. You get to levels where you can't afford to keep a simple e-mail program active in the background because, when checking messages, the antivirus intervention (30-50% of the processor for 3-4 seconds ) is at serious risk of crashing the game. This occurred in stages with only one mountain and few riders; if you engage in a demanding one with 3 or 4 mountains and many runners, therefore with a high fractionation into small groups, each of which must be controlled independently, then it is essential to turn everything off, because a sneeze is enough to return to the desktop, regardless from your PC. honestly you can't expect players to turn off everything they have in the background to play a game with such low minimum requirements Technical compartment Extremely annoying is the insertion through the first patch of the so-called ~massive adds~, i.e. real advertising panels that are automatically downloaded from the game and replaced with the normal ones or custom ones created by the players. There is currently an invasion by the Pirates of the Caribbean (two examples below). Technical compartment Apart from the unique ugliness due to the monotony, what is most disturbing is the fact that the programmers have tried to circumvent the firewalls, inserting backdoors to still allow the download of the banners. Furthermore, on the official forum, a request for explanations was answered (in a anything but polite way) that having accepted the EULA (End User License Agreement) it is legal and therefore if you don't want it, you can very well avoid installing the game . To avoid this, just play while staying disconnected from the network and immediately firewall every single program that has anything to do with Cyanide or PCM2, in order to prevent them from downloading unwanted junk. Unfortunately, however, this is not possible during online games, after which you have to manually clean up the Massive Adds folder and the game cache. Equally unwelcome is the decision to only provide French users with the database editor, and only in French. The others were not pleasantly told ~arrange yourselves to translate it~. A little more respect for the players would be welcome, if not due. PPDB Giant Database I want to tell you a story... That sort of tongue-twister that is the title of this paragraph is actually the name of a titanic work created by a large group of Cycling Manager enthusiasts. It is an immense database capable of increasing the amount of data present in PCM by approximately 15 (fifteen) times. For those who are not familiar with it, the database is the set of all the information concerning cyclists, teams, sponsors, races, and much more; pretty much everything except processing and graphics algorithms. Just to give you an idea of its size, it is an update of about 200Mb which triples the number of cyclists (from 360 to 1000) and quadruples the teams (from 40 to over 180), and impressively increases the number of races (see screenshot), as well as adding a disproportionate amount of landscape elements.
