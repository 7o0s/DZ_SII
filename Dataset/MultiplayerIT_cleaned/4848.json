To tell the truth, it is also the first in the series to have succeeded, given that the previous chapter, dating back to 2002, despite being released for PC, has never crossed the Japanese borders, except by indirect means. Mask of Deception is a story that can be appreciated even knowing absolutely nothing about its predecessor, but it is undoubtedly better to play it before moving on to Mask of Truth, which will come to us at a later time, and perhaps recovering the reference anime . However, since we are talking about a visual novel in which there is little fighting and a lot of reading, everything you need to know will be told during the long initial prologue, despite a classic incipit in which we find the protagonist in the midst of total amnesia which leaves us quite devoid of reference points. Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception, a fantasy story based on amnesia and girls with tails! But who are they? Being a visual novel, Mask of Deception is basically one long story that is told to us through dialogues, static screens and occasionally some cutscenes. Most of the time we will spend pressing a button to go to the next stage, listening to the recitation in Japanese which, as far as we can understand of the Japanese language, was performed with interpreters of the highest quality. If desired, there is also an Auto Mode that eliminates the need to press anything, but in doing so you will not be able to speed through all those dialogues that do not proceed the narration. Even if the plot is quite intricate, especially in the initial part, don't expect narrative crossroads or other refinements. In some cases we will be able to choose some dialogue to listen to first, but the final result has no influence on the continuation of the story or on its conclusion. A linearity confirmed by the lack of dialogue options or multiple endings. The story of Mask of Deception is a straight line, not a flowchart. Also, don't expect to get into the action very soon, because the first few hours will only be played and will serve to show us the traumatic awakening of Haku, our forgetful protagonist, who after finding himself in front of giant insects and homicidal slimes is saved by Kuon, a girl with a tail and ears (in perfect Japanese kawaii style) who will become the first member of her future group of adventurers. After the incipit the story quickly kicks off when the two begin their journey to figure out who the hell Haku is, meeting along the way particularly bizarre characters with lots of different personalities (let's say one for each narrative clich) who however tend to remain quite unspoken and rarely develop anything in the course of the adventure. There is no shortage of twists and, of course, moments ranging from the ironic to the embarrassing. Since in most cases our traveling companions will be girls, expect comments that vary from the truck driver to the stalker, especially in the face of the inevitable buxom heroines, even from our alter ego. Technically speaking, we are dealing with a game that is also present on PlayStation Vita, so don't expect much from its three-dimensional parts, linked to some cutscenes and fights, while the drawings are always well done and on PlayStation 4 they can obviously be enjoyed at 1080p. But when do you fight? If you are looking for a JRPG of the real ones, look elsewhere, because in Mask of Deception in moments of confrontation they will be decidedly scarce and in most cases concentrated in the final part of the game. The fights are so few that they can be counted with a good approximation: they are 16, with 12 further clashes that can be faced once the game is over. Fortunately, the higher difficulty level offers a decidedly adequate level of challenge, while the normal one is too simple and dedicated to those who simply want to enjoy the story. The fights of Mask of Deception do not go far from the tradition of a genre that travels from Final Fantasy Tactics to Fire Emblem. We have the usual attack and movement grid, characters that have to go into close combat, spells, ranged weapons, resistances and weaknesses. In most cases we are asked to eliminate all the opponents, avoiding the death of the protagonist, but in others we will have to fulfill other requirements, such as killing a boss or luring opponents into a trap.To overcome the clashes at the highest level it will be essential to know very well all the pros and cons of each character, so as to take advantage of the combo attacks and any elemental abilities, so as to increase the damage. What we will have to understand immediately is if what we are facing is a clash in which it is advisable to attack or adopt a softer approach and let our defenses highlight the enemy's weak points. Furthermore, to unleash the chain attacks we will have to press the right button at the right time, this will allow us to get critical hits and finishing moves, but if you prefer there is also an auto mode, provided you give up the criticals. If the situation gets too messy, the rewind function will allow you to go back to the point you prefer, so as to undertake a different strategy and correct the mistakes that are leading us to defeat. As for the development of the character, when you level up some skills are learned automatically, but we will be able to decide the equipment and allocate bonus points to raise the basic characteristics.", "date": "2017-05-26", "grade": "7.0"}
