A little over a year later, the game debuts on consoles with a new edition that adds further toughness to the gameplay, given that now we will also have to deal with children. This War of Mine: The Little Ones adds more complexity to the original survival experience Under siege The setting of This War of Mine: The Little Ones is inspired by facts that really happened, and it is precisely the crudeness of reality that hurts the most. Take refuge in a ruined house together with a few other people, our task in the game will be to try to survive as long as possible, hoping for a truce that we don't know when or if it will come. Fundamental needs such as eating, sleeping and distraction will weaken our characters, who will have to divide the tasks during the day and go out at night in search of supplies and raw materials with which to build rudimentary tools, weapons or those things we normally take for granted: a bed, a small radio, a stove for cooking, an improvised stove to warm up from the cold. The ~scavenger~ sections, to be carried out using a character with suitable characteristics (primarily the ability to carry a large number of objects), emphasize the platform component of the game but also the stealth element, as sometimes we will find armed and hostile men waiting for us: we will have to try to steal as much as possible without getting killed, ergo moving silently or, in extreme cases, reacting to the attacks. Don't expect complex mechanics though: the goal in the game is to survive, so clashes should be avoided whenever possible, also because any injuries sustained in combat could ruin the excellent work done up to that point. When you die in This War of Mine, after all, it's really over. The moral question In day-to-night situations, This War of Mine: The Little Ones poses troubling questions: Will we have the heart to steal food and medicine from other refugees? Will we close the door on those who ask us for hospitality or will we run the risk of having one more mouth to feed? Questions that we will have to answer, willy-nilly, during a campaign in which every choice will have consequences. As mentioned at the beginning, the console edition adds another element of complexity to the gameplay with the introduction of children. Absent in the original version, the little survivors appear in the group randomly, like everything in the game, which with each new game mixes characters, events, seasons and even the duration of the conflict to offer us a different experience. The presence of an alternative mode, ~Write your story~, also allows you to determine all these parameters, in order to obtain some initial advantage or even a pinch of extra challenge. Obviously, children are not a resource, but rather a concern: we will have to try to distract them during the day, keep them as close as possible to their parents, let them rest appropriately, feed them and treat them if they get sick. Should things go wrong, we will not see them die as adults do (it would have been frankly too much), but run away, an eventuality that will have serious repercussions on the morale of those who were taking care of them. The console debut Beyond the impact of children, whose presence further exacerbates the difficulty of a title that wasn't rosy from the start, we were curious to find out how the developers of 11 bit studios had adapted a experience originally designed to be enjoyed with the mouse. The new layout takes advantage of the controller's back buttons, which are used to switch between available characters, whereas the triggers only come into play when entering combat mode. The analog sticks allow you to move and manage the view, with zoom in and zoom out assigned to pressing the levers on their axis, in a not exactly intuitive way. The central buttons are for basic actions, such as interacting with the scenery and other characters, while the d-pad comes into play when the interface poses different contextual options, such as opening a door or looking through the peephole if beyond there are threats. The problem with ~direct~ commands is that you have to follow the survivor on dutyin his movements, even perhaps when he is tired and injured, and therefore drags himself along, until we give him something to do, whether it is to go to bed or eat; only then can he switch to another protagonist. On PC, however, it was possible to click on the objective of the turn and let the character do the rest, dedicating ourselves to something else and thus optimizing the times. Not a small difference, considering the management of the day in This War of Mine: The Little Ones. On the technical front, however, nothing to complain about: the ~dashed~ graphic style conveys the atmosphere very well, the animations are well-finished and fairly varied (even those of the children), while the sound appears deliberately essential. A small note of demerit to the uploads between one day and the next, which on consoles last a few seconds too long.", "date": "2016-01-20", "grade": "7.8"}
