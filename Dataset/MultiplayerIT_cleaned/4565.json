But when things go wrong, the first to lose is almost always the coach. For the world of football it is now a real dogma, within which is contained all the complexity of the coach's job, to carry out which it is not enough ~only~ to know properly how to play football. Especially in times like the ones we find ourselves living in, coaches must be ready to face pressures of all kinds, both from inside and outside the team, with the ultimate aim of keeping their players focused on their goals. An often difficult task, if not even impossible in some extreme cases, which Football Manager 2018 promises to translate into videogame language thanks to its experience on the virtual field, which has now lasted more than twenty years. In recent weeks, Sports Interactive has not failed to present us the novelties of this edition, which, as per tradition, touch on all aspects of football management par excellence. In fact, it starts from important elements such as the management of locker room dynamics and scouting, up to contour topics such as the possibility that gay players come out. After about ten days in Maurizio Sarri's place on the Napoli bench, we are ready to give you our opinion on Football Manager 2018. Captain, my captain! Among the innovations introduced this year by Miles Jacobson and his team, the one dedicated to the internal dynamics of the locker room stood out right from the start, always present in previous editions but shrouded in an aura of mystery that prevented those in front of the monitor from understanding as good as the air was blowing. The importance of Dynamics in the minds of developers is confirmed by the presence of the homonymous section in the game menu of Football Manager 2018, thanks to which you can access an immediate overview of the strengths of your dressing room management , or if not, immediately notice what makes the players unhappy. The relationship between the latter is another aspect that Dynamics takes into account, proposing a real pyramid hierarchy typically led by the captain and vice-captain, plus any team members with particular charisma or with a certain seniority in the club. Social groups are also formed within the team, within which displeasing an influential player can have devastating effects. If, on the other hand, the bad moods concern a person already on the edge of life in the locker room, the effects on the morale of the troop should be at least limited on paper. Beyond the obvious inaccuracy that saw Zuniga(!) at the top of the Napoli hierarchy in our game, the Dynamics are quite useful, but it must be said that in practice they collide with what are some problems historians of the game, still present in Football Manager 2018. Just to give a few examples, after a few weeks of the championship it happened that the reserve goalkeeper expressed his desire to play as a starter, threatening to leave if he was not granted the placed between the posts. Every attempt to calm him down was in vain, including the intervention of the captain on whom we counted the most due to the introduction of the dynamics. Everything even resulted in a locker room meeting, with which we managed with difficulty to bring the average morale of the team back to acceptable levels. Anyone familiar with the Football Manager series has by now learned to deal with problems of this type, from players eager to leave every three by two up to glaring cases such as that of the footballer who had obtained a contract renewal in August, to then return to the charge after a couple of months, threatening to walk away without a raise. It doesn't help that beyond the introduction of Dynamics, interactions in Football Manager 2018 have remained the same as we know it, both with your own players and with the press. Although a renewal of the conferences and discussions in general has been at the top of the players' requests for years now, we are once again forced to deal with ambiguous sentences and ways of pronouncing them (the famous ~cautious~, ~energetic~ and company) still more confusing, often leaving it to our deputy to speak to avoid making trouble. Where, on the other hand, the game has made great strides is in the contractual negotiations, now very detailed to offer the player various alternatives to the too high salary, offering bonuses or even simply making promises for the future. The market presented itself con likely figures on some occasions, less on others, but as the transfer windows of recent years have taught us, even in reality prices are now capable of becoming more than crazy. Tactics and Observers Another aspect particularly emphasized by Sports Interactive for Football Manager 2018 was the tactics management system, on which the developers intervene every year to give greater possibilities both to those who love to spend hours on the details, and to those who instead want to leave their mark to the game without wasting too much time. For the benefit of the former comes a larger section dedicated to set pieces, in which to define schemes and positions, while for the latter the tactic screen presents an analysis of the roles defined by the coach, thus highlighting any gaps in the module. To reflect a football in which roles seem to multiply, the typical positions have been enriched by other definitions such as that of the midfielder or the ~carrilero~ in midfield, within which some players can identify themselves, thus finding a better position than in the past. Among the innovations dedicated to the subject there is also the possibility of organizing a pre-match tactical meeting, from which however it seemed difficult to be able to obtain particular benefits. As in the case of team talks and press conferences, we imagine that here too most players will delegate the deputy or walk even skip the meeting. On the contrary, the possibility of contextualizing some tactical indications to certain moments of the match is particularly interesting, thus telling the team how to behave in certain contexts (for example wide or narrow advantage) without having to do it in real time during the match. Connected to the definition of training we find another novelty concerning the Medical Centre, which is also present with a section distinct from the rest. In this case, the main view offers us a list of players more prone to injuries, indicating the reasons such as too high a workload in training or fatigue caused by too many games played. This is undoubtedly useful information, above all because it concerns another area which is widely debated every year with the Football Manager on duty: the frequency of injuries. In this way the developers hope to provide clearer explanations on risks and remedies, even if in our game, while being careful not to squeeze anyone too much, the incidence of injuries seemed too high to us. Scrolling through the list of Football Manager 2018 innovations, we find the new scout management system, undoubtedly the most different from past editions: the old list reports have been replaced by a series of cards proposed for consultation by the coach, which for each of the players shown, he can request further analysis sessions or decide that he already has what is necessary to establish whether it is a possible goal or not. The initial impact will leave those who know the old chapters of the series displaced, above all due to some buttons with a somewhat ambiguous effect and the absence of the already mentioned list. After a few hours the tool begins to appear powerful and more realistic as stated by Sports Interactive, even if the fact that not all options are just a click away as in the past forces the player to a learning phase which could discourage him from doing so. leverage on scouting to find new talent. Roaring engines Even for Football Manager the times of dots and only 2D are long gone. The collaboration with Creative Assembly, already started for the creation of the game engine a year ago, naturally continued also for Football Manager 2018, which thus presents itself with some improvements that start from the heart of the 3D experience of the Sunday match. In purely aesthetic terms, the improvements are immediately appreciable, even if on some occasions the animations connecting the movements of the players are still not sufficient in number. However, the ambition has never been to compete with FIFA or PES, but to simulate football matches in a realistic way. From this point of view, the Football Manager 2018 engine does not allow us to witness particularly striking blunders, even if we point out some problems in this area too: on certain occasions, players end up losing the ball when they would have an easy pass to make, while it is undoubtedly excessive the frequency of lucky cross-shots that create danger by ending up in the mirror of the goal. Also be careful if until last year you were used to playing partite in ~comment only~ mode: we don't know if it's a bug or an inexplicable will of the developers, the fact is that in Football Manager 2018 the comment only is shown for every minute of play, thus multiplying the duration of a single match compared to the past. Most of the bugs reported by players of the beta will probably be fixed by Sports Interactive through the patches published after the release of the game, but at present we must take into account what are some problems affecting Football Manager 2018, among which we also point out some application crashes that make us strongly recommend that you save your game often, especially after obtaining an important achievement. Returning to the progress of the match, the developers have introduced some tricks that will surely please everyone, such as the possibility of changing the player in charge of taking a penalty on the fly or retracing his steps in the event that a tactical change is about to be applied after a particular event such as a goal.", "date": "2017-11-10", "grade": "8.4"}
