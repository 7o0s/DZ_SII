Moroes continues to update us with the arrival of guests from all over Azeroth but, in the third wing, the Menagerie, he really begins to get nervous as the Curator, the handyman robot who helps him in the castle of Karazhan, has literally gone into a short circuit, forcing some guests to stand still for ~safety~ reasons and at the same time freeing rather dangerous creatures. He is the first boss of this wing and his hero power gives him the Taunt ability, so it is only allowed to attack him and not his minions: the heroic version differs only in life points, which are 40 plus 15 armor instead of only 30 of the normal version. His deck consists of beasts and robots, which are able to give each other bonuses, Murlocs and Shaman and Mage spells, which do direct damage. It wasn't a problem to beat him on both difficulties using a warlock zoo deck that aims to do fast damage and allows you to beat the Curator to the punch, even though his is a fast deck too. The reward cards for the first boss are the Zoobot, which for 3 mana is a 3/3 neutral robot with Battlecry: +1+1 to a random friendly Beast, Dragon, and Murloc, Menagerie Keeper (one of the most strong of the set), a minion for the druid who for 6 mana is a 5/5 that summons a copy of a beast of your choice among those already on your playing field. After fixing and repairing it, the Curator will show you the second boss of the wing, the dragon Noctumor who, after being released by mistake, must be put back in the cage: his hero power starts both players with 10 mana, uses a deck mainly composed of dragons and hunter cards. In the normal version it has 30 points, in the heroic one it adds extra armor but the combat does not change much, in fact we have overcome both difficulties on the first try with a deck for the priest that uses the new cards of Karazhan, the Ebony Bishop and resurrection magic. From the victory against this dragon you receive the Templar of Noctumor, a minion of the paladin who for 3 mana is a 2/3 who summons two 1/1 Dragon Babies (if you already have a dragon in your hand), and the Runic Egg, 0/2 neutral minion who has Deathrattle for 1 mana:Draw a card. Same formula and new cards in the final wings of One Night in Karazhan, the new Hearthstone adventure Malazampa and class challenges The last boss of the wing is Terestian Malapaw, also a well-known boss of the Karazhan instance of World of Warcraft. He has 30 life points in the normal version and 40 in heroic mode and the peculiarity of this boss is his immunity to all damage that does not come from his Annoying Imps, which, like Deathrattle, inflict damage on Malapaw and immediately return to the field. In the normal version the imps are 1/1 and inflict 1 damage while in the heroic version they are 2/2 and inflict 2: the deck that the boss uses is practically a zoo of the Sorcerer with the difference that this tends to summon a large number of Imps. Here too, we can use a single deck to overcome the battle both in normal and heroic mode and and it is, in this case, of the warrior: inside it many area spells and 2 Brawls, however spells that aim to eliminate in one only once the Annoying Imps causing massive damage to the boss. Defeating Terestian rewards with Purification, a spell for the priest that silences one of your minions for 2 mana and makes you draw a card, and the neutral minion Raptor Guardian, a 3/6 with Battlecry: gets +1+1 and Taunt if you control a secret. Closing the second wing, on the other hand, adds the neutral Mage of the Menagerie minion to the collection which, for 5 mana, is 4/4 and randomly provides one of your Murlocs, Dragons or Beasts in play with a +2+2 bonus. The legendary of the Wing is the Curator, a 4/6 neutral minion with 7 mana taunt who, as a Battlecry, draws a Murloc, a beast and a dragon and adds them to your hand (we have already seen it used in a fortissimo beast druid deck). The class challenges are reserved for the hunter against the Curator and the wizard against Noctumor, remember that the challenges are at the normal level and therefore are very easy to overcome. You have access to the Cat Trick, a hunter's secret (which players have already shown they love by putting it in a new type of secret deck) that puts a 4/2 Cat with stealth into play in response to any opponent's spell, and to the servant for the wizard Chat Bookhierone who, for only one mana, is 1/1 with Battlecry: Puts a random wizard spell into your hand. Final chapter: the Spire By now practically everyone has arrived at the party: Reno Jackson, directly from the League of Explorers, is moving and touching all the objects sending Moroes into a rage who, therefore, pushes us forcefully towards the Spire. Unfortunately, just as we pass through the personal rooms of the landlord, we are stopped by the first boss of the wing, the Shade of Aran, who definitely wants to kick us out. His hero power in normal mode grants 3 points of ability power to both players and his deck is mainly composed of wizard spells although he also has his own ones, such as the secret Garland of Flames that Aranka always plays as the first card of the battle and dealing 5 damage (10 heroic) to all enemies except the one attacking it. To overcome the battle, on normal difficulty, any deck will suffice: we used a Reno mage with many spells. Heroic difficulty increases the magical power that Shadow of Aran provides to players to 5 and its life points are 30 plus 15 armor (instead of 30 at normal level); it's like having Malygos perpetually on the field and, since Aranka's deck is full of spells like Fireballs or Arcane Missiles, it will take him a while to take you out. To overcome the challenge at this level, we used a wizard deck very similar to Aran's, but using the Illuminator and the Ancient Curabot to regain victory points and be able to resist the ghost's powerful attacks. The reward cards for getting rid of Aranka are Medivh's Valet, a minion for the 2-mana 2/3 wizard who deals 3 damage of your choice if you control a secret, and Spirit Claws, a weapon for the 1/3 shaman to 1 mana that has +2 attack if we control a minion with ability power. The second boss of the wing, the dragon Scagliafatua, will be particularly useful because through its portals we will try to recall Medivh; the hero power of the dragon for 2 mana provides him with 3 in attack but the game arena has a peculiarity (just like it happened in the World of Warcraft raid): the presence of two portals, the red one which provides wind fury to the minion placed to his left by removing this ability from the boss and the blue one that prevents the minion placed to his right from suffering more than one damage at a time by making the boss take it instead. The clash is very fun and, at a normal level, does not present particular difficulties; the heroic version differs in hero power which, for just 1 mana, gives the dragon 8 attack and, as usual, its overall life and armor points increase. We used a very fast zoo for the warlock and the challenge was overcome after a couple of attempts: the defeat of Netherscale gives Netherscale's 1/3 neutral minion to 2 mana Historical, which as a Battlecry revives a dragon if we have one in hand, and Library Dragon, a 6-mana 3/6 neutral dragon that destroys a minion with 3 attack or less if you have a dragon in hand. The wizard is back After defeating Scaglianether, Medivh comes out of one of the portals and he doesn't even waste time thanking you, he's in a hurry to manage the mass of guests waiting at the castle and unfortunately it's up to Moroes to close everything: it's from his mistake that the first part of the final boss consisting of two different encounters. Nazra Swiftaxe is an orc who, in both normal and heroic versions, has 15 life points and who, as a hero power, brings into play a 3/2 or 3/3 orc warrior with charge, depending on the difficulty. Once defeated, a second mistake by Moroes will summon Prince Malchezaar to the castle and Medivh, busy, will ask you to take him out, leaving you with his Atiesh staff, a 3-cost 1/3 weapon that brings a minion into play with each of your spells random with the same cost for the price of one health point. The prince's ability is the same seen in the prologue, so with only two mana he will summon an abyssal 6/6 on normal and 2 abyssal on heroic; his hitpoints will also vary from 30 to 60 with armor on. We got through this fight on both difficulties (although normal doesn't require much effort with any decent deck) with a deck for the paladin in Murloc, with Dawn of the Living Murlocs: the strategy to follow for the first part of the fight is to use as many ~trades~ as possible with the opposing minions, possibly sacrificing the Murlocs, starting towards the mid-game to gain life points to recover the first slaps that you will inevitably take and then draw the spell with which you will bring all the Murlocs to life and that you will have to use only when the p comes into playprince. It takes some trying but you will be successful. Sending the prince home rewards you with two more cards: one useful for the sorcerer's ~discard card~ zoo, or Malchezaar's Imp which, for 1 mana, is 1/3 that makes us draw when we discard a card, the The other is the spell for the warrior Portal: Ironforge which, for 4 mana, adds 4 armor points and summons a random 4 mana minion. Completing the adventure, on the other hand, gives you the Violet Illusionist, a 3-mana 4/3 neutral minion that makes you invulnerable on your turn as long as it remains in play, and the two legendary neutrals Prince Malchezaar and Medivh. The first will certainly give life to a new type of deck since, for 5 mana, it is a 5/6 which at the beginning of the game adds 5 random legendary cards bringing the total to 35; the second is an 8-mana 7/7 who, as a battle cry, places his Atiesh staff already described above in your hand. The class challenges of the last wing are reserved for the druid against Scale Nether obtaining the Portal: Moongaller, a spell that summons a 6-cost minion and which heals 6 life points to a target, and for the thief against the Shadow of Aran who, instead , adds Ethereal Vendor, a 5-mana 5/6 minion that reduces the cost of cards of other classes in your hand by 2.
