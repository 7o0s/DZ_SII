{"name": "Nba Live 06", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-live-06.html", "text": "Muscles and sweat NBA live certainly cannot be said to have changed in these (many) years, improved without a doubt but the sport it represents has not undergone substantial changes. The basic rules of basketball are always the same: two teams on the field, a ball and two baskets, whoever scores the most points in four game times wins. No more, no less. And therefore the operation that EA proposes annually is to make the game more and more realistic, to improve the AI and the response of the commands, to make the animations of the players more plausible, to bring the player closer to the strategic plan of this splendid sport and last but not least, always look for new ways to widen the 'replayability' factor as much as possible. In this NBA Live 06, in addition to the usual championship modalities consisting of the canonical 82 days and final playoffs, the section relating to the three days linked to the all-star game is expanded: it will be possible to compete in the rookie competition, take part in the competition between stars of the western conference against those of the eastern, or simply try your hand at a quick session of three-point competition or dunking. The all-star weekend will be accessible both through the traditional way, i.e. by playing all the games from the beginning of the season up to the fateful week of February, or by selecting it directly from the main menu; whether you get there in one way rather than another, the result changes slightly: arriving from a championship in progress, the player will be able to have the satisfaction of having the statistics achieved up to that moment in the season on his side, it follows that the votes of the public for all-star call-ups will largely come from games played up to that point in the season. An interesting novelty of this 2006 is the inclusion of a mode called Superstar Challenge which will put the player in front of a real series of scenarios to be completed which will range from making a certain player score a certain number of points in the 3 minutes remain of the game, until you get to the tests that will put the defense to the test in a last aggressive attack by the opposing team. This mode, absent in the home counterparts, is by itself probably the best training ground of the whole game, forcing the player to exercise the fundamentals in attack and defense and to learn the use of game strategies in the most critical moments to bring victoriously the team at the end of the game. the superstar challenge mode alone is probably the best training ground of the whole game, forcing the player to practice the fundamentals of attack and defense Muscles and sweat Added to these modes is ad hoc multiplayer playable via wi-fi between two psp's in the same environment. As far as the adaptation of this PSP version is concerned, the effective lack of comfort of the control system should be noted: the layout of the keys is not very suitable for a type of game of this kind and it can often be annoying (or at least complex) to move with the stick while attempting to execute complex offensive plays or a simple run on defense to make up lost ground to the transitioning opponent. Due to the lack of the double stick to the square button, the trick function was assigned in the ball handling phase, bringing to perhaps too simplistic levels what in the previous versions had proved to be one of the most unpredictable moves and which discriminated in a short time a creative player from a cumbersome one. In the defensive phase, however, the usual problem that has afflicted Nba Live for some time should be pointed out: the management of the jump; even a novice player will find it incredibly simple to stop opposing players in any type of situation, and this, mixed with the carelessness of the trick button, will make life really difficult for those who would not want to rely on continuous three-point shots. The 'television' camera used takes full advantage of the panoramic format of the PSP screen, rendering the depth of field well and at the same time allowing the player a certain overview of the field and a good view to defend inside the area. Visually the final result has nothing to envy to its home counterparts, the PSP screen renders the game action well and the player animations recall their real counterparts down to the smallest details (faces, tattoos, size of the arms, posture of running, favorite actions, EA's precision as usual borders on mania), the game has been optimized to the fullest and runs smoothly and without any slowdowns, due to its structure and excellent conversionit is probably a candidate for one of the most important NBA versions due to the portable console habits that go well with what the game offers: in a long season of 82 games you can find the time to play one or two matches in break or just on public transport. The sound sector, like any other EA production, does not disappoint, a series of r'n'b and rap pieces accompany the moments of pause between one game and another and the pocket trax mode allows you to transform the psp into an mp3 player able to reproduce the pieces inserted in the game at will. The commentary of the game was put in the hands of two veterans of the field such as Steve Kerr (great three-point shooter for Michael Jordan's Chicago and Tim Duncan's San Antonio) and Marv Albert, historic NBC basketball commentator. The NBA Live series makes its debut on PSP in the best way, perfectly integrating the dynamics of a sport like basketball and the portable element of the Sony console. Animations, playability and fluidity have nothing to envy to their home counterparts and the challenge mode gives the game a further boost to playability. The real problem remains the control system that is badly suited to the PSP keys and limits the gaming experience at times. Pros: All rosters updated to the championship 05/06 Satisfying and fun Graphically well-made Cons: The control system is problematic on some occasions Defense management is too simple at times For anyone in the world, the passing of the years is marked by the inexorable recurrence of traditional festivities, for the people of gamers, the first sign of the passage of the year is now marked by the ritual release of the entire Electronic Arts sports line. We had just entered the nineties when a Canadian producer started what was to become the fixed appointment of the year, the true term of comparison for measuring the seniority of a player: those who already wore out their hands on titles sportsmen like Pga, Nfl and Fifa in 1993 he is now twelve years older and can easily begin to stretch his fingers, 2006 is just around the corner. Over time in EA the annual series have increased up to a number that is close to ten, the precursors and spearheads still remain the same and among these Nba Live, which updated the roster list is preparing for the year new debuting on PSP. All that remains is to see if EA has a winning shot on its side...", "date": "2005-11-30", "grade": null}
