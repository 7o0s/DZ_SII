In addition to the remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, of which you can find the review at this link (what a nice pun), the original version of one of the best JRPGs of the last generation will also land on the Nintendo hybrid: Ni No Kuni : The Threat of the Ash Witch. If PlayStation 4 and PC will see the advent of a remastered version capable of showing off a splendid 4K, the Nintendo console will be satisfied with a title with the same contents, but without a graphic modernization. In this short review we will try to unravel all the doubts regarding an important and awaited porting, which still expands an increasingly astonishing catalog. The Threat of the Ash Witch Without getting lost in too much talk about the plot, it is enough to say that Ni No Kuni masterfully combines the great ability of Level 5 to reinvent itself in the JRPG field and the artistic flair of a group of talented authors known worldwide: Studio Ghibli. The extraordinary style of the team founded by Hayao Miyazaki blends perfectly with a deeply Japanese RPG setting. The same amalgam is created that for about thirty years has united Square Enix and Akira Toriyama in the creation of Dragon Quest. Unlike that case, however, here the imprint of Studio Ghibli is also perceived in the fairy-tale notes of the narrative, which as always do not disdain to disguise a story that deals with important and extremely mature issues. The ineluctability of fate and the overcoming of mourning are what constantly accompanies the story of the protagonist Oliver, forced too soon to say goodbye to his beloved mother and to embark on a journey into a parallel world. Accompanied by the faithful Lucciconio, Oliver will be called to grow up quickly, fighting and getting excited, during a long and successful campaign, net of some central moments that are too drawn out for long. The lack of any new content is however mitigated by a truly remarkable amount of main and secondary missions, as well as a large extension of the map, divided between the iconic JRPG world map that alternates with cities and dungeons. Gameplay still functional From the point of view of the gameplay Ni No Kuni still proves to be a title capable of exciting and giving moments of fun party management. This is possible thanks to a turn-based combat system which, however, does not disdain the frenzy of fighting. Although the game never proves too challenging, the progression is balanced and able to encourage the player to deepen. Whenever you enter battle it will be possible to choose leaders and combat tactics for the supporting characters, with the opportunity to switch between party members at will. A series of classic actions such as attack and spells represent only the tip of an extremely more colorful iceberg, characterized by the so-called ~families~. Borrowed with great capacity from the concept introduced by Pokmon for almost a quarter of a century, it is the possibility of capturing and bringing to one's side a whole series of creatures that populate the world of Ni No Kuni. Equipping and deploying pets is a useful way to spice up the battle and add another layer of strategy. The enemies we will face will in fact be weak to specific elements or attacks and it will therefore be important to study your opponents to face them with the right attitude. As if that weren't enough, the myriad of pets available can also be looked after or fed, so as to increase their affinity, or even evolved by means of some specific stones when they have reached the right degree. A system that may not be original enough, given its derivative nature, but which we still assure you ten years after the original release on Nintendo DS, is able to give many joys. Porting to Switch Now we come to the heart of the debate: the quality of the port on Nintendo Switch. Ni No Kuni is still today, thanks to the superfine quality of the animated cutscenes and the care in the creation of the models, an extraordinarily evocative title. It is difficult to think of being able to find more artistically beautiful JRPGs and the possibility of seeing this splendid world run on the Switch screen is no small detail. Clearly a whole series of refinements present in the remastered available on PC and PlayStation 4 are missing. If the implementation of 4K is certainly a little useful detail on the Nintendo hybrid, however the improvements to the backdrops and textures in general are a fair loss, so as to the distant fluidity of 60 FPS. We are not saying that Ni No Kuni is bad to see on Nintendo Switch, which among other things can boast the great plus of portability, but it is clear that if you have the choice, it all depends on how much you are interested in bringing the console around, even just lying in bed. Net of this discriminating factor, the game is still fluid and enjoyable, certainly more in the portable version than in the docked version, where the 720p resolution tends to get noticed more. We have also glimpsed some slight decrease in slightly more agitated situations, but certainly nothing that affects the enjoyment of a game that is not as frenetic as the first Ni No Kuni. To understand each other, it would have been much worse if this had happened in its sequel, considering the type of combat system. The music is always extraordinary, as are the excellent dubbings in Japanese and English, both also present in this re-edition.", "date": "2019-09-20", "grade": "8.5"}
