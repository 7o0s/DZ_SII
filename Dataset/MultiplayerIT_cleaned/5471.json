With each restart she changes road in the hope of finding it less steep than the previous ones, and instead she is always forced to stop after a certain amount and start over. It's a fantasy that comes very close to the story of Hi-Rez Studios, a development team that has never had a shortage of talent, but has been suffering from a chronic lack of business acumen ever since it was born. Almost all of the software house's latest projects have failed in terms of sales, to the point of making staff cuts almost inevitable; however, the sudden current that was leading Hi-Rez to bankruptcy did an about-face after the release of Smite, a MOBA capable of growing at a great speed from month to month and injecting a lot of hard cash into the coffers of the house . Smite is a unique case, a free to play that has been able to carve out a niche in a market where many thought that League of Legends and DOTA 2 had already cannibalized everything, and whose position has not shaken after the arrival of Heroes of the Storm. The reason is to be found in some brilliant features that have distinguished Hi-Rez's work from direct competitors, and in a peculiar quality: this is one of the few Dota-Likes capable of functioning properly on consoles. After arriving on Xbox One, therefore, it was assumed that the game would also land on the shores of PlayStation 4. We have tested the version dedicated to the Sony platform, and today we are here to tell you if its divine value is equal to that of the others. Only the Sony console was missing from Smite: will it be an excellent MOBA also on PlayStation 4? There is more faith in this MOBA Anyone who has tried Hi-Rez's DotA-Like before knows that one of its strengths lies in the use of deities instead of completely invented characters. In fact, Smite draws from Nordic mythology, paganism, Shintoism and a whole series of other religions to give mass to his long list of selectable heroes. A very clever idea, since we are talking about immense sources from which to draw, where there is no shortage of warriors and entities unique enough to be able to offer interesting ideas. However, the gameplay of the game is the real basis that allowed it to withstand the brutal attacks of the competition, since while building on the well-established foundations of the genre it belongs to, it is one of the most accessible and easily enjoyable around. Let's recap once again, since there are certainly those who still don't know the title or didn't care about it until they arrived on their favorite platform: Smite, just like all MOBAs, is a team-based competitive game whose games take place on a three-way map divided into two structurally identical halves. On each ~lane~ (as streets are called) there is a constant flow of units on both sides, which automatically attack enemy heroes or turrets scattered around the map: the team's goal is to destroy enemy turrets, and then get to the opponent's headquarters to eliminate that too, all while managing the growth of your character during the match and using an item shop that allows you to further enhance yourself. All things seen and overseen, which however Smite immediately offers with a different perspective than usual, since it is a third-person MOBA. A very particular choice of camera, linked to the desire of the Hi-Rez to immerse the player more in the action and to make the clashes spectacular. However, the third person isn't the only feature that makes Smite a more action-oriented title than the rest of the gang. Godly punches In fact, Smite's heroes, although divided into types, are largely equipped with active skills in combat with a basically larger area than the skill shots (special moves that require great precision to be placed) seen in DOTA 2 or League of Legends . Not only that, the control system uses simplified aiming and enlarged hitboxes that closely resemble those seen in PvP MMOs such as World of Warcraft, but at the same time it is faster and built around the synergy of the various characters. Not that landing certain shots with ranged specialized deities is easy, but it's still pretty straightforward, and battles rarely end with a couple of well-placed big brutal moves. The game is clearly designed to enjoy fighting and give everyone a chance to land a few hits before a teamfight is over (or at least to do so before someone on one side or the other becomestoo powerful due to the kills made). Even the management of minions that constantly walk around the map reflects this desire: it is not possible to eliminate them to prevent enemies from earning gold from their death, and it is not necessary to deliver a precise final blow to obtain these coins. Even the jungle - the inevitable neutral area that contains enemies to kill to get various buffs - is more basic and easier to navigate than usual. Combine all this with a clear interface, simplifications set up immediately that automatically acquire items and skills for beginners (but they can be deactivated at will), and the possibility of trying out all the heroes in training even if you don't own them, and you will get a MOBA that is really suitable for everyone. And we repeat, it does not mean that it is a title completely devoid of tactics (although a little strategy is actually lost in the mix), it is just well designed to welcome even those who are not usually interested in the genre. But with the pad? On consoles this nature shines particularly, and the control system goes well with the PlayStation 4 pad. The precision will not be that of the mouse and keyboard, but given the width of the skill area, the simple aiming at ground level, and the focus on combat, the difference is far from abysmal. Real flaws could therefore only be had from a technical point of view, yet Hi-Rez (probably thanks to the work done on Xbox One) managed the situation well, fielding a port that presented very few problems during our test. For heaven's sake, Smite has a few years on his shoulders and is certainly not superlative graphically, but his very bright colors and the almost caricatured style of the heroes, endowed with that Madureira-like ~tamarraggine~ that many appreciate, counterbalance the limited detail of the 3D models . In short, apart from a few jolts during loading, we have not noticed any graphical problems whatsoever. Less well matchmaking and team management, very inflexible. In the first days there were problems, now fortunately resolved, but during the search for matches the rigidity of the system is noticeable as soon as someone leaves the match or disconnects for some reason: in the first case the queue has to be repeated all over again, while in the second it can happen to have a teammate absent for the entire game, without substitutions. After all this time, we expected at least one quick-swap system to work on console. On the other hand, it is impossible to evaluate the validity of the matchmaking if it concerns the skills of the players involved, since right now it is too early. Before the situation stabilizes and ranked matches are handled properly, he needs to spend some time on the new platform. Finally, no change for the progression system (completely untied from passive upgrades, and only ~for the glory~) and for the microtransactions, however more than honest.", "date": "2016-06-06", "grade": "8.0"}
