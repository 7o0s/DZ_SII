{"name": "I Simpson: Fusione Imminente", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/i-simpson-fusione-imminente.html", "text": "Although obviously connected to the forthcoming film, The Simpsons: The Imminent Fusion is not based on the same plot, indeed it definitely distances itself from it. In this mobile game, in fact, we find Homer engaged in a desperate attempt to save the city of Springfield from a nuclear disaster, for which the media blame him: it goes without saying that for this reason the fury of the citizens falls upon him, making his mission even more difficult. To give the title a vein of drama, the developers of EA Mobile have well thought of inserting a countdown (freely available at any time) of 30 minutes within which to complete the arduous undertaking: an aspect that -as is evident- immediately highlights the biggest flaw of Imminent Fusion, or rather an infinitesimal longevity, which unfortunately also accompanies a non-existent replay value. Anyone intending to approach the game, therefore, would do better to budget for an extremely short, and not too intense, experience together with the ~yellows~, to be honest. As mentioned, Homer, as the only playable character, must be led by the user towards the Springfield nuclear power plant, a process that winds through only three levels of pure deambulation. We start from the Simpson house, faithful in all respects to that of the animated series: from here Homer must solve the first of a series of problems (that is, find the car keys), which almost always result in interacting with a character , in finding a particular object or in combinations of the two. To make things more difficult there are the various inhabitants of the city, who continuously chase poor Homer to beat him or who throw various types of objects at him: for this purpose, there is an energy bar to testify the health level of our ~ hero~, which can be replenished on time by collecting donuts and cans of soda. In addition to running back and forth solving these little puzzles, Homer is also able to interact with some objects of the scenario, in order to reveal hidden bonuses, to obtain a temporary boost (for example using a skateboard to make short journeys) or to block the way to enemies. And if you were to get lost in the meanderings of Springfield, you can always count on the excellent sense of direction of the pig (?) Homer's friend, who will not fail to show the way to the most confused players. Described in these terms, Imminent Fusion would seem a fairly simplistic title, and so it is in fact: with a control system almost entirely limited to the movement of the protagonist in four directions, a very low level of difficulty and a really ridiculous longevity, as mentioned, the EA product is certainly not the most appetizing mobile gaming has to offer. Which is undoubtedly a pity, considering how Imminent Fusion presents a good quality technical realization, first of all thanks to an extremely clean and detailed isometric graphics, which perfectly represents the spirit of the cartoon even in the animations of the characters. Also noteworthy is the sound, which deserves applause if only for the reproductions of the various ~d'oh!~ typical of Homer...
