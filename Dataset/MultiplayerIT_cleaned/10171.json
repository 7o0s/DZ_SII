This desire found a realization a few years ago with the comics published by Dreamwave, which revived the Transformers of G1 and rode the wave of a revival that finally culminated with the filmic reductions that we all know. GLU also saw fit to take advantage of such a well-known brand and use its characters to create an RTS clearly inspired by the various Super Robot Wars and Advance Wars. Transformers G1: The Awakening, in its Java version, was released in October 2008 and astonished everyone for its quality and depth (find the review here), making two distinct campaigns available to the player (one in command of the Autobots , the other with the Decepticons) and an arena mode, with the action accompanied by music and sound effects taken verbatim from the cartoon (see the unmistakable noise of the transformations). The dynamics were the classic turn-based strategy ones: each robot could transform, move and attack during its turn, within scenarios that also contained stations to be conquered to collect the Transformers' favorite source of energy, Energon. The latter served as an ~activator~ for the huge Metroplex (or, on the other hand, for the terrible Trypticon), which with a certain amount of Energon could release other characters onto the map and therefore played the role of the classic ~ship mother~ in any episode of Super Robot Wars. Likewise, Ratchet performed the duties of the support unit, capable of repairing others or himself. The conversion Bearing in mind the limitations of the platform for which it was designed, Transformers G1: The Awakening presented itself as a complete and immediate product, technically very well done, of great interest not only for nostalgics. The conversion for iPhone and iPod Touch, the subject of this review, appears almost perfect in terms of structure and gameplay, but shows the side of a series of technical shortcomings that are quite evident on the screen of the Apple device. Firstly, the graphics of the game have gone from the simple 2D of the Java version to a three-quarter view, a solution which unfortunately makes it difficult to control the units without adding anything in purely aesthetic terms. To move a robot you have to touch it so that the area within which it can move is highlighted on the screen, then touch the ~box~ towards which we want to proceed. Carrying out this operation within the limits of a three-quarter view is awkward and imprecise, and the introduction of the zoom function (obtainable with the usual multi-touch gesture to which we are accustomed) is of little use, given that in this situation the visible area it narrows too much. When an Autobot and a Decepticon are in adjacent squares, it is possible to launch an attack. The view at this point changes, showing us the two robots engaged in combat who fire the weapon supplied and take the opponent's blow. In this new version, these sequences have been redesigned to introduce more spectacular camera movements, as well as to use polygonal models of the Transformers made with the technique of cel shading. The result is good, but it could certainly have been done better in terms of animations. Autobots, transform! The ~transforming~ abilities of our robots certainly add depth to the gameplay, given that generally in the form of a vehicle it is possible to cover greater distances but one is more vulnerable to enemy attacks, while the combat system confirms its limits and reduces strategy to a few simple numerical arguments. The units attack and cash in exactly in this order, if we are the ones who lead the attack, and these dynamics do not have any variant: the robots are not able to dodge a shot, nor to use weapons other than the service rifle. An Autobot with the energy bar reduced to a minimum will in no way be able to get the better of a healthy Decepticon, therefore one can never escape the obligation to always maintain a certain numerical superiority. The attack and ~morale~ bonuses, capable of increasing efficiency of our strokes, constitute the only concession to a minimum of thickness. From a numerical point of view, the two campaigns are quite full-bodied and fairly demanding, and it is a pity that even in this case GLU has limited itself to re-proposing what has already been seen on mobile phones without particular modifications.
