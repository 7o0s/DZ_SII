{"name": "F.E.A.R. Extraction Point - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fear-extraction-point-recensione.html", "text": "Alma strikes back! Extraction Point begins precisely where the first F.E.A.R. ended, that is on the helicopter that is taking the protagonist to safety and where the charming Alma in buff also makes an appearance. Obviously the helicopter ends up on the ground in the middle of the city and it will be up to us to try to reach the extraction point, located on top of an ultra-technological hospital as it is gloomy. All this will mean facing five other chapters in which we will have to cross areas and buildings of the city, which seems to be completely dead... At the same time we will also have to try to save two of our companions (the soldiers present inside the helicopter at the time of the accident) with which we will cross during some missions. after completing the five extra chapters offered by this package, a sense of incompleteness that is difficult to justify remains in the mouth Alma strikes back! That said, continuing to talk about the plot, but without revealing anything, it must be said that, compared to what we learned in the original, here we will learn of a few more details with respect to the overall picture already outlined some more information will emerge on the past of Alma, of course, the usual dream and horror sequences that had so impressed several gamers will return, of course, but if you expect some capital revelations you will not be satisfied. It's more about carrying out your mission to try to save yourself, going through dark corridors and buildings full of enemies. Extra But we had mentioned some additions to the original... well, make yourself comfortable as we begin the list: three more weapons and three more enemies. Finished? Yes, finished. Oh right, if you want they added a new type of wooden crates to break through. The extra weapons are: a machine gun (the TG-2A Minigun, Minnie for friends), capable of firing an incredible amount of shots per second which, although it is very spectacular when used in slow motion, is not a very original weapon; and a laser rifle (the Type-12 Laser Carbine), very effective and powerful and quite fun to use (but also already seen in other games). The third weapon is actually a new type of grenade, namely the AP-5 Deployable Turret, a real portable turret that can be thrown to annoy enemies. Extraction Point does not add anything relevant to what can be downloaded legally from the network Extra As for the new enemies, we have a kind of very dangerous evanescent ghost, capable of fast and elusive attacks, we have an ultra-armored soldier armed with the TG-2 Minigun, capable of taking massive damage without blinking and protecting himself behind his large metal shield, and we have some kind of mech capable of firing missiles in bursts. That's all. Those who expected some additions in multiplayer will be disappointed, given that, by virtue of Monolith's choice to release F.E.A.R. Combat for free, Extraction Point does not add anything relevant to what can be downloaded legally from the network. In short... never as in this case can we say that there is very little new. Game mechanics and environments The game mechanics have remained, of course, identical to the past. The highly refined artificial AI of the enemies, capable of surprising for the ability to perform real combat tactics, the slow motion that creates the usual show of particles, lights and explosions and an incredible atmosphere capable of terrorizing and keeping you glued to the screen until the end. End that, sadly, comes too quickly (after 4.5 hours of gameplay). Obviously what there is is excellent, but... we always return to the sense of incompleteness we were talking about at the beginning of the article, a sense expanded even more if we take into consideration the five levels of play. the subway and the hospital are pleasant locations to wander around Game mechanics and environments There is practically nothing new in terms of scenarios. The subway and the hospital are pleasant locations to shoot, but they are too reminiscent of scenarios already seen in the first chapter, further fueling the controversy of those who criticized F.E.A.R. due to the limited variety of settings. Even from this point of view, despite the excellent level of detail achieved, something more could have been done, in order to justify the expense. In terms of system requirements there is little to say. The recommended ones will allow you to play with the detail set to medium / high, also by virtue of the optimization that took place over the months since the release of the original version. Of course the graphics engine remains impressive and able to handle light and shadow better than youall other games on the market. Conclusions The problem with Extraction Point is that there isn't much to tell. It looks more like a big mod than a real expansion. Of course, the gameplay has always remained the same and, therefore, excellent and breathtaking. However, what an expansion should do (add game elements) is disregarded and we find ourselves in hand with something beautiful, short and inconclusive. In short, if you liked F.E.A.R. and you want to go back to the arena to experience the same thrills, buy this expansion without hesitation. Otherwise, think carefully and direct your attention elsewhere: it might not be worth it. Pros Always fun and spectacular Well-kept atmosphere Graphic engine optimized and very fluid Cons Short Few additions compared to the original It looks like a big mod Alma strikes back! This expansion was, on balance, quite disappointing. Such a sentence would look good in the comment at the end of the review, but after completing the five extra chapters offered by this package, a sense of incompleteness remains in the mouth that is difficult to justify. Given the usual premises (from an expansion one only expects the experience of the original game to be prolonged, with some additions here and there) there is no doubt that the extras are very few overall. But we don't run.", "date": "2006-11-09", "grade": null}
