{"name": "Calico", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/calico-recensione.html", "text": "Calico's review closely follows the brief presentation of the game for Nintendo Switch, which took place during the recent Indie World; among other things, it is a launch simultaneously with the PC version (via Steam), published last December 15, 2020. From a theoretical point of view, no problem, on the contrary: who doesn't like cats? Never trust a person who doesn't appreciate you. And therefore an extra cat-based video game on Nintendo Switch can only please, especially if the mechanics seem vaguely similar to those of the highly appreciated Animal Crossing. But there is one ~but~. From a qualitative point of view, Calico is very similar to a hallucinatory journey, which takes place within an already compromised nightmare. All in all, it's a mess. Let's try to understand why. Plot: cats The plot of Calico is so evanescent that it passes completely on the sly, a mere pretext to start one's life within the game world in question. Let's summarize it quickly, as there is no danger of incurring spoilers of any kind: there is a very special island within a colorful and improbable game world. This island is inhabited by cats and other furry and adorable creatures. On the island there is also a caf that is now abandoned, because the previous owner at one point decided to go around the world. And here comes the fun part because, surprise surprise, the player is the very lucky person who receives the structure for free. He will then be able to freely take possession of it, put it back on track, furnish it to his liking and restart the business. All of this is just an excuse to fill the building with your favorite creatures, namely cats. Cats present everywhere in the game world, which can be physically present and moved to the caf, to keep the player company. Without stress, without any particular aim or objective: for the sake of having cats. And then, if you want, to complete the secondary activities and accumulate some money with the activity. Other important purposes and purposes are either absent or merely filler. Gameplay: Again cats If the cats in the plot aren't enough for you, you'll be happy to know that the gameplay is also invaded by feline creatures. Now let's put linguistic jokes aside for a moment: Calico is really a title that wants to offer a mere relaxing pastime to the player. The latter will be able to explore the entire island, shaped like a star and divided into various ~biomes~, in search of their favorite animals - cats, of course, but also polar teddy bears, foxes and so on, as long as they have soft fur. The simulator itself aims to offer an experience devoid of any form of stress, a relaxing elsewhere where you can live in harmony with what is available and offered by the players. The gameplay reflects this basic choice: and so the protagonist hero (or heroine) will have one of those sticks with a small toy at the end, tied to an elastic band, with which cats are normally played. Or he can take the creatures in his arms, or on his back, even on his head, and carry them around; others, larger, will be ridable. All for the pure pleasure of doing it, or for purposes related to collecting: you will have a sort of album where you can collect information on all the species present. Spupazzare the animals of the game world of Calico is a possibility; the other is customizing alter egos and inherited coffee. The furniture is linked to some indicative categories (~cute~ is one of them, all strictly in English, since Italian is absent; not that it's needed that much), and it will be useful for you to furnish every corner of the house . Over the hours of the game (if you resist) you will unlock other objects and customization possibilities, and slowly you will also explore the other areas of the island. Since this is a very particular production, you should take a look at what it offers to understand whether or not it fits your strings: but don't expect great depth or care in any aspect in particular. The defects We have tried to make Calico's offer as clear as possible: cats, game world to explore in absolute tranquillity, few tasks to perform and all equally relaxing. But it is impossible to overlook the defects, which make it equally impossible to achieve full sufficiency. The main problem is that the title doesn't really seem complete: as if its development phase had ended at a certain point, but in any case the developers had decided to publish it as it was. This is evident at an immediate glance: Calico is ugly to look at, very ugly. Not for a choice of artistic direction, on the contrary: yessimply the conversion on Nintendo Switch is technically and graphically embarrassing, and it doesn't seem that things are better on PC. Almost all of the textures present are mediocre, poorly cared for; annoying pop up effects are present everywhere; entering the cafe it happened that the walls and the roof disappeared, but not in a harmonious way: it is not possible to know if it was a stylistic choice or a programming error. The most successful aspect of the production is the care for the polygonal models and the behavior of the cats. The main character fluctuates between the grotesque and the awkward, with physically impossible limps and leaps, especially when swimming in a stream; at times it seems that the force of gravity becomes optional in Calico. Let's leave out the choppy frame rate and the camera wobbling, or the whole thing would end in havoc. And yet you could ignore all this and just enjoy your island full of cats: good luck, in that case.", "date": "2020-12-21", "grade": "5.5"}
