{"name": "Ugly Birds", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/149719-cooped-up-ugly-birds.html", "text": "This is the strange story of a depressed little bird, continually threatened by other birds and therefore forced to jump from thread to thread and from branch to branch in a mad, endless race towards the coveted salvation, if this exists. There really isn't much more to say, the premise of Cooped Up is at least as crazy as its graphic characterization and represents a simple pretext to launch the protagonist bird without too much hesitation around the screen. Imagine a cross between Doodle Jump and Angry Birds you will have a rough but rather effective idea of what this title has to offer: the screen scrolls constantly vertically, seemingly without a conclusion, while the player is required to make the bird jump story from a taut thread to the upper one, or from one branch to another, always with vertical, straight or oblique movements. To launch the creature, which apparently hasn't learned to fly yet, you need to charge up the slingshot-style jump, hence the Angry Birds comparison. By pulling back on the rope or the branch from which the bird is hanging, it is possible to establish the force and direction of the throw, the purpose of which in any case is to reach the upper point of support in the endless race towards height, constantly tailed by a swarm of other birds mysteriously enraged against the protagonist, in a sort of continuous escape from this bizarre ornithological nightmare. The response to the commands is rather quick and precise, which allows you to control the protagonist with short and fast touches, an essential feature to keep the pace of the action so high and the correctness in interpreting the inputs is also adequate for complex manoeuvres, when the situation becomes particularly complicated. The game is free and has only one possible in-app purchase: paying 1.99 euros eliminates the advertising that appears every two or three attempts and in fact you get the complete game in ~premium~ form. Help a poor little bird get rid of his annoying cronies in the Cooped Up vertical escape Volatile nightmare Nitrome, the team responsible for Cooped Up, has made a considerable reputation in the mobile sector as a software house specializing in simple arcade games with a high rate of playability and addiction, as well as having an unmistakable demented humor as a common denominator, a characteristic not little account for distinguishing one's own products in the chaos of the mobile offer. A look at some images taken from this game is enough to understand that we are dealing with something rather peculiar from a stylistic point of view: the choice of pixels and 2D graphics is fine, which is now more canon than a courageous and particular choice, but there is something really twisted and absurd about the way birds are represented in Cooped Up, in a grotesque interpretation of the graphic style adopted by similar titles. The protagonist is hunted by various types of birds, one uglier than the other, with plucked, psychotic and disturbing specimens that populate the various levels characterized by different types of behavior that require different countermeasures to be avoided (there are huge birds that simply stand still to occupy a large area of the screen, those that move slowly in one direction, those that flutter and those that madly chase the protagonist, for example). All this also manages to increase the sense of threat that weighs on the bird, making the escape particularly desperate and pushing us to act as quickly as possible. The simple mechanics of jumping with a slingshot effect to avoid touching enemies is therefore enriched by the different behavior of the latter depending on the type and by the possibility of eating various worms and insects around the screen to load an energy bar capable of make it perform a powerful acceleration and jump several platforms in one fell swoop. Few variables that keep the structure light and enjoyable, but which could be enriched with some additional element such as differentiated power-ups or additional types of enemies.", "date": "2015-05-13", "grade": "7.0"}
