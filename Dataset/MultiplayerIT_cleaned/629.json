{"name": "Namco Museum: Battle Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/namco-museum-battle-collection.html", "text": "no matter how advanced the console may be, every moment will be good to look back to the past, to its origins Back to Eighties Pac-Man, Galaxian, King of Balloon, Galaga, Rally-X, New Rally-X, Bosconian, Dig Dug, Dig Dug 2, Xevious, Mappy, The Tower of Druaga, Dragon Buster, Grobda, Motos and Rolling Thunder. It is right to report the complete list of Namco's amarcord operation to partially understand the scope of this project, because we must speak of a real project at least as regards the options (and modalities) that accompany and unite all the games: at canonical selections regarding total lives and bonuses are added a whole series of settings aimed at significantly improving the gaming experience by adapting it completely to the features of the psp; each game - in addition to being presented again in the classic version - can be slightly improved in terms of graphic rendering, can undergo variations in the graphic layout thus presenting map scores and various information in real time in the game being played and above all can be adapted to the own needs in terms of size and shape of the playing area: you can play horizontally in original size, horizontally in full screen or simply by turning the psp vertically and adapting the game to the whole screen (certainly the best experience , although not the most comfortable). A curiosity related to this Namco Collection is the evolution of the actual games included in the lot in the transition between the Japanese, American and European versions: in the first version, the oriental one, there were only 7 games, in the American version they reached 17 and then closed in Europe at 16, with the sole exclusion of Ms. Pac-Man. Eighties Reloaded! For the more attentive at the beginning of the piece, reference was made to sixteen great namco classics and four new games, and although that 'four new games' was half a lie what the reloaded versions of Pac-man, Galaga, Dig actually offer -Dug and Rally X represents in all respects a re-adaptation in a modern version (with modern technologies) of what were four of the most famous Namco games. All four games have been made by combining a delightful use of 3D graphics on unashamedly 2D mechanics: pac-man offers probably one of the best reinterpretations of the yellow ball, keeping the gameplay practically intact, adding clever variations to the theme and making the graphics more palatable to those who are the times that run; for Galaga the speech is focused almost entirely on the adaptation of the basics of the modern shooter mixed on the peculiarities that made the cabinet the coin-eating nightmare of many kids of the time, the insertion of bosses at the end of the level and a side map are two examples that give a good idea of the transformation process applied to the shooter; Rally X evolves on the tracks of graphics and the increase in competitiveness of a game that already offered a lot of them twenty years ago; the lot of the fantastic four closes with the new Dig Dug, new in terms of graphics and the camera used to play (from the side, no longer the hybrid between isometric and bird's eye view of the second chapter), but still the same underneath the outline of the gameplay: you throw the harpoon, inflate enemies, collect bonuses, simplicity and old-fashioned fun. Eighties Reloaded! One of the most painful notes of the game (perhaps the only one) is that concerning multiplayer and game sharing: although it is possible to play all the classic games in doubles and up to four players in the reloaded versions, to get in return adequate entertainment is strictly necessary to have friends who each own a copy of the game. Although sharing is clearly visible and indicated among the games present, what can be downloaded is in fact a timed version of the selected game, a version that includes only one level of play and which will end at the classic game over. Unfortunately, decidedly not much for what such a collection could offer in terms of multiplayer fun. Although the operations of reproposing old classics now tend to saturate an increasingly demanding market, this Namco Museum: Battle Collection cannot be condemned. Sixteen old glories of the video game, four unpublished graphically appealing for our days, options to adapt to the psp format and the same tested mechanics for twenty years now. We find them unique in the inadequate implementation of multiplayer management and in the lack of a real ~museum~ as in previous versions. Pros: Classic games. Some games redone graphically. Imintelligent implementations with respect to PSP hardware. Cons: Looking closely, it's yet another collection. Poorly crafted multiplayer. One of the most followed leitmotifs in the gaming world could be ~no matter how advanced the console may be, every moment will be good to look back to the past, to one's origins~. One of the most active software houses from the point of view of the rediscovery of the games of the past is undoubtedly Namco, historic video game creator with almost fifty years of work behind it and an endless series of milestones which, with Swiss punctuality, peep out on the console in the form of collections, museums and so on. And for another fledgling console, the psp, here is another -even more updated- version of Namco's hits, and if the assumptions of the Sony laptop were to outperform the competition in terms of game graphics, in this case one can only bow to the evident quantity and quality fielded by Namco: sixteen old glories faithfully re-proposed in all their splendor and four of these updated, remixed and polished for the portable debut.", "date": "2006-02-08", "grade": null}
