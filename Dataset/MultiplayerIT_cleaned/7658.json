Raise your hand, come on. Uh, so few? It's a shame, because we're talking about a real masterpiece of the time, a title of seminal importance (this term is also old), among the first to introduce rotoscoping animations from twenty-four frames per second. You know Prince of Persia, the one from 1989? Well, it was the first example of rotoscoping applied to videogames, an animation technique which consisted in filming an actor with a movie camera (all in analog), then drawing the sprite of the character you wanted to animate on the various frames, so as to make it fluid and realistic movements. Jordan Mechner at the time did it for Prince of Persia using his brother as an actor, while for Flashback the guys from Delphine Software resorted to a more professional approach but literally played the view on the shaky freeze-frames, all to deliver us the adventure that it inspired a whole generation of old-school gamers; and which has sold, albeit slowly, several million copies, entering the Guinness Book of Records as the most successful French video game ever. Well, Ubisoft decided that such a jewel had waited too long for a modern reinterpretation, and so entrusted the VectorCell developers with the task of creating a remake that on the one hand was very faithful to the original, on the other introduced mechanical and a technical department adapted to today's standards. How did it go? Not well. Flashbugs Despite the release of a patch, the Flashback remake unfortunately still suffers from some powerful bugs. We met four, to be exact. In the first poor Conrad felt the need to punch opponents already on the ground, thus hitting the air. The second bug consisted of a perfect ~game over checkpoint~, i.e. a checkpoint that saved the game at the very moment of our death, forcing us to start the level over again. In the third bug the view went completely crazy, framing the lower part of the stage while our character was on a platform above. The fourth and last bug we encountered concerns the disappearance of the interface at game over and therefore the impossibility of continuing the game, which forced us to close the game, calm down and then launch it again. My name is Hart. Bret ~The Hitman~ Hart You'll never, ever forget the moment Flashback's intro cinematic (also from 1993) showed you new ways to introduce a video game's story. The protagonist of the game flees aboard a flying motorcycle, chased by mysterious guys who want him dead and who finally manage to hit him, making him fall into a forest. The character wakes up and discovers that he does not remember who he is and what he is doing there, but apparently his hands know how to use a gun and this comes in handy when small but insidious surveillance drones spot him as he wanders between trees and platforms. In the remake the animated intro is obviously different; it lacks that pioneering flavor and cannot in any way innovate compared to current videogame productions, which is basically the leitmotif of this new Flashback, that is: can a game from the early 90s, however beautiful and important at the time, work today ? And the answer is a dry n, in the sense of yes and no, that is, we must distinguish well between the welcome nostalgia operation and the reality of an action platform that has very little to say and that is outclassed at every juncture even by less prominent exponents of the category. Conrad B. Hart, the protagonist, is actually a special agent who operated undercover to thwart a sneaky alien invasion, and who recovers his memory one fragment at a time, following a path that he himself had planned, a (nice) bit as in Total Recall. The Flashback remake presents itself as an often anonymous action platformer, devoid of particular bite Xbox 360 goals Twelve objectives for a total of 400 Gamerpoints: this is the loot offered by Flashback, which can also be obtained in a fairly simple way. In fact, to unlock the achievements, it is enough to complete the game at various difficulty levels, complete the available VR missions and eliminate a certain number of enemies. Rogue nostalgia The Flashback plot has seen the addition of some facets compared to the original but appears mostly unchanged, exactly like the gameplay between jumps, hops, jumps, climbing and target shooting sessions. The latter have been made more interesting by the introduction of elementssuch as the charged shot, the various types of thrown objects (whether they are stones, explosive fruit, bombs or the teleportation device) and an energy shield that must be activated with the right timing to deflect enemy projectiles, if necessary. The types of enemies, however, are too few (flying drones, ~wild~ guards, robotic guards and aliens) and the character enhancement system (which improves their effectiveness, accuracy and resistance) has not been adequately exploited . In terms of level design and artistic direction in general, there is a clear decrease immediately after the Death Tower section, with approximate sequences (the jump on the cars) and quite useless variations on the theme (the race aboard the flying motorcycle). We recover in the finale, which mentions the 1993 classic even in the furious escape against time. To create a valuable remake of Delphine Software's masterpiece, however, an extra gear was needed, especially in terms of graphics, which here seem to be the fair of old-gen polygonal models. We didn't like the visual rendering of the flashbacks either (we could have resorted to a slap-up illustrator, instead of facing some black and white sketches) and the Italian dubbing often and willingly appears devoid of a guide, beyond the value of the individual performers.", "date": "2013-08-26", "grade": "5.5"}
