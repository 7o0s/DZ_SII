We shouldn't expect anything new in the formula: four maps and a multiplayer setting for the Zombie mode so dear to the Treyarch boys. The American developers are confirmed to have a lot of imagination in the design of the battlefields. Empire and Berserk take us to ancient Rome and a Viking village, while Cryogen and Rumble are perfectly in line with the game universe of the third installment of the Black Ops saga. And for Zombie mode there's Gorod Grovi, which takes us to a destroyed and razed to the ground Stalingrad, but perfectly recognizable by all those who have played World at War, where gigantic robots and dragons give each other a thrashing. We tell you right away: it's a sensational setting, the best published so far. Descent is the penultimate DLC for Call of Duty: Black Ops III and here's our review What a beautiful Stalingrad! Raid was a Black Ops II ~fan favorite~ map, set inside (and outside) a wealthy mansion in the Hollywood Hills. Empire is the exact remake, only that the map has taken on the appearance of an opulent villa of ancient Rome, which seems to have come out of one of the period films of the sixties, those of Hollywood on the Tiber. It was fun four years ago and undoubtedly still is today, thanks to its skilful mix of airy open spaces, equipped with generous shooting lines, and indoor parts, complete with real ~tuna traps~ and bottlenecks. A beautiful map, also from a purely aesthetic and artistic point of view: those who put it to the sword on Black Ops II will undoubtedly feel at home but perhaps this is its only limitation, not being in fact an unpublished content . With Berserk we remain in Europe in what is to all intents and purposes a Viking village: a medium-sized map, characterized by a design that is as functional as it is banal, we could say. A bottleneck bridge in the middle, extensions, side wall runs and some indoor and elevated areas from which to dominate entire portions of the map. Nothing shocking, fast and frenetic, also graced by a good artistic component, but you will hardly find yourself choosing it in the vote between one match and another. Not ugly, however; just unoriginal. Rumble takes us to an arena, where instead of beasts and gladiators there are giant fighting robots. Small map, equally divided between the long firing ranges of the open spaces (but in any case interrupted by shelters, structures and robots) and an indoor part, to be understood as an access area to the stands. Once ~indoor~ the map becomes decidedly banal, neither labyrinthine nor full of ideas for movement skills. A battlefield to forget, in short. Closes the fan of the four Cryogen DLC maps. We are inside a prison, obviously one of the futuristic ones, where everything revolves - literally - around very high cryogenic cylinders where they are enclosed in stasis in the bodies of convicts. Around them it is possible to run and then jump and reach the other parts of the battlefield. Without a doubt Cryogen is the most fascinating map of the package, the one that dares a little more in terms of impact, but once again it is not particularly ~strong~ to guarantee a continuous choice in the playlists. Fortunately, this DLC Descent is revived by the new Zombie chapter, and here, as per tradition, Treyarch manages to give its best. Gorod Grovi is not only a beautiful homage to what they did previously with World at War but it is also, if possible, their best setting so far. Huge, labyrinthine, complex, distinctly vertical, chock full of secrets and new weapons, and damn good to look at too. But above all it gives us the opportunity to ride dragons. Gorod Grovi dwarfs all the other DLCs, truly a small masterpiece by the American team. However, a bit little to revive the fate of a package that in its strictly multiplayer component shines only in the remake map.", "date": "2016-07-18", "grade": null}
