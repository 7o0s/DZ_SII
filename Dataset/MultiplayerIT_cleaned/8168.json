ARC Squadron tries to enter this context on tiptoe, using the powerful Unreal Engine as a launch pad to bring an engaging and spectacular action to IOS devices, made not only of twists but also and above all of solidity and substance. Developed by Psyonix, the game boasts a dense, demanding and full-bodied single player campaign, made up of no less than sixty-four missions in which, at the command of a powerful spaceship, we will have to thwart the threat of the terrible Guardians, an alien race determined to subdue the whole universe. The capabilities of the engine created by Epic Games are immediately on display, and so the twenty scenarios that form the backdrop to our battles are distinguished by their excellent design but above all by the wealth of objects and details, alternating apparently empty sidereal spaces with areas full of debris due to a collision that took place some time ago, space stations, meteor showers and so on. Hundreds of hostile vehicles move within these locations, increasingly more powerful and each equipped with a different attack pattern, to be memorized in order to be able to adopt the necessary countermeasures. The last star of the evening The view from behind the spacecraft does not leave much room for errors: enemy fire reaches us quickly and distinguishing it is not always easy, so it may be appropriate to perform some traditional ~barrel roll~ and avoid remaining in the same position for too long . In this sense, the ARC Squadron touch control system helps us, but up to a certain point. Even by setting the sensitivity of the controls to maximum, in fact, it is not possible to move the shuttle around the entire screen without having to lift your finger and ~drag~, which is not a small problem in terms of playability and enjoyment of the experience. A limit that we hope will be resolved as soon as possible through an update because, to date, it really represents one of the few weak points of this production. In fact, the Psyonix title lacks nothing: there are nine exciting boss fights, fifteen extra challenges and a perfectly balanced upgrade system, which at certain times asks us to replay already completed missions to obtain the credits necessary for the purchase of a particular upgrade or to change spaceships, drawing from the list of six available models. The combat system takes advantage of some automations but does it in an intelligent way, for example the automatic fire is activated only when we have an enemy in our sights, while the homing missiles (equipped with a cooldown to make things more difficult for us) work simply by touching the designated target. We have already talked about the graphics, but it is really interesting to see the Unreal Engine grappling with a hitherto unpublished context on the iOS platform, a test that we can say passed with flying colors, also considering the fluidity of the frame rate and the total lack of uncertainties. Perhaps more could have been dared on the front of the sound sector, given that the techno musical accompaniment appears a bit trivial and a production of this level would have deserved a more ~epic~ soundtrack, but we are nitpicking.", "date": "2012-11-22", "grade": "8.5"}
