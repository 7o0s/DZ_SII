{"name": "Crash Tag Team Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crash-tag-team-racing.html", "text": "Happily ever faster The story behind CTTR (Crash Tag Team Racing, for convenience. Editor's note) is very simple and without particular pretensions: Von Clutch's amusement park is in danger of closing due to lack of funds and the car races he organizes are likely to skip due to lack of participants. When everything seems over, Crash (with his cronies) and Cortex (with his companions) stand out on the horizon as they duel inch by inch with their cars. What better time to recruit a wacky company of runners? Thus the game begins, in a level called 'intermediate' which will act as an interconnection between all five worlds present in the game and from which it will be possible to set in motion a series of sub-quests to unlock cars, costumes and secret films. The world that forms the backdrop to the game should be understood as a sort of 3D environment where crash can fully interact with people and things, and to make it even simpler: the entire game is a racing game disguised as a platform. Every time you enter a new world, Crash will be forced to move between platforms, collect coins, fight fierce penguins dressed as a ningia and thus reach increasingly inaccessible areas that hide the entrances to the driving sections. The worlds are linked to common themes of large amusement parks such as dinosaurs, fairy tales, space, pirates and ancient Egypt; the concept of 'theme park' offers a more than excellent starting point for the characterization of the environments that present themselves in the best of forms with objects that move on the backdrop, parodies and interactive elements, all enriched by very saturated colors. Each area of the game is basically split into three classic race portals and one with a deathmatch arena. The classic races are further divided into race, time trial, challenge of the apocalypse, rolling thunder and finally run and gun; the apocalypse challenge is a competition where the player is alone on the track and with the only objective of crashing into a series of targets scattered along the track in order to get the best score possible, in rolling thunder instead you he will find himself competing against all 7 opponents and the aim will be to blow them up as many times in one round, finally run and shoot is similar to the apocalypse challenge with the variant of flying instead of static targets. Clash of the Machine Guns The real fulcrum (and strategic center) of CTTR car racing is the possibility of merging with any opposing car to create another one equipped with two competitors, one at the wheel and the other with firearms. During a race it will be possible to bind and unbind to opponents at will and depending on the strategy being used; during the merger, the player will be given the ability to sit in the driver's seat or to take up a firearm, only by pressing a button that will actually swap places in the game. The component of the fusion between means largely represents what is the approach to the game: if in the lower levels it will be enough to keep away from the enemies' weapons, in the more advanced ones it will be absolutely necessary a weighted choice of the moment and of the machine to which we will merge, the merger brings changes to the cars both in terms of the speed factor and for that of the weapons. Each character has a certain number of cars (which can vary between faster, more destructive and more manageable) and weapons that substantially change the approach to the race. Although with a series of interesting features, what makes this CTTR special is the same factor that debilitates it under different aspects: first of all, the impossibility of completing a solo race, the game structure forces the player to merge with the machine right if it wants to reach the top ranking; at the same time, while it is absolutely possible to 'unhook' at any time from your car partner, the CPU will very rarely disconnect, thus leading the player to victory without too many problems; the weapons for some competitors (Von Clutch for example) are absolutely unbalanced compared to the others and can open the gates of heaven without effort, thus making the game flat and without competition. Although the goodness of the racing section is evident, unfortunately the fact remains that while progressing in the game the player is not left with any challenge factor, most of the time leading him to boredom and the premature conclusion of the races. In multiplayer things do not change much, the game modes remain almost the same as the single player with just the addition of the lan mode with which you can have fun with altri 7 willing friends. The game certainly does not aim to amaze with amazing visual effects and an ultra pumped graphics engine, it is rather about creating a credible and fun, colorful and full of life setting to perfectly recreate that air that you can breathe walking inside of an amusement park; the graphics engine does not present major hitches also due to the actual lightness of the game situations (it will very rarely happen to find yourself in intricate situations and in the midst of furious shootings with different means, usually the races tend to create large gaps between opponents) . Also as regards the sound there is little to say: the voices of the characters - all dubbed in Italian - are part of that branch of Italian dubbing that deals almost exclusively with cartoons and it will be easy to recognize in the voice of Cortex or Pasadina one (or many) other characters from one's childhood. Still for the sound, the now growing habit of dispensing free burping and flatulence noises, simply in bad taste and which are very little funny now, should be noted. Cross-platform CTTR comes out simultaneously for Ps2, Xbox and Gamecube and we only feel like stating that there is no difference between the three versions, just play it and have fun whatever your ~belief~ in terms of consoles. From some points of view CTTR is a good game: fun, well made and with some interesting features that make it a different product from the mass of driving games. For the rest, however, it remains a bit weak and insipid, the low difficulty combined with the monotony of the driving situations is not very suitable for a game that had to be the flag of playability. The use of a similar-platform as an introduction to the stages and a large container of secrets to unlock and sub-quests is interesting, but there is still a lot of work to do. A praise to the characterization of the environments. Pros: Very accurate graphic design of the settings. Machine fusion is definitely fun. Cons: Gets monotonous pretty soon. Finding out how to win without problems is too easy. Inadequate sound effects. Since its inception on psx, the Crash Bandicoot saga has often detached itself from the main trend to indulge in largely automotive spin-offs. The most famous and only true mario kart 'competitor' in the last generation was Crash Team Racing, an intuitive and fun game that put the player driving a kart on improbable tracks in the world of bandicoots. After the understated motoring debut of Crash Nitro Racing, Radical Entertainment taking over for the first time the heavy burden passed from hand to hand between Naughty dog and Vicarious Vision, thus deciding to overturn the foundations of the series and dive body and soul in a world of ningia penguins, fire-breathing turrets and mating machines - that's Crash Tag Team Racing.", "date": "2006-01-18", "grade": null}
