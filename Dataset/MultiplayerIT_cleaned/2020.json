{"name": "Prisoner Of War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prisoner-of-war_b.html", "text": "Graphics Looking at the digital world of POW from a distance, everything looks very ~nice~, places, buildings, objects, characters and whatnot. However, as we get closer, we realize that, unfortunately, not everything is as ~defined~ as we would like. In general, therefore, the POW engine is well done, the landscape that surrounds us renders it very well, transmitting in our souls that sadness, that grayness characteristic of any prison camp of the time. The light effects (see the night photos for example), the shadows and the particle effects (rain in particular) are well rendered and also help to increase the sensation of being alone against the world, in a foreign land (urgh, not the best of life!). The real graphic problem lies above all when we approach three-dimensional models; a clear example are the faces of the characters, some of which seem to be made with few polygons and a couple of textures ~stuck~ on top. Ultimately, even if it won't make us cry out for a miracle, nor will it delight us with last-generation graphic virtuosity (nor will we use it to show our friends the graphic power of XBox!), POW's 3D engine does its job more than very well , without ever making us turn up our noses or divert our attention during an ~escape~ (and I assure you that during the game you will be busy looking at much more!!!) Note the great work done by the programmers, and the search for useful details to recreate realistic and faithful reproductions of those ~tormented~ prison camps; especially Colditz Castle, digitally reproduced, following the original building plans! From brrrrrivid! Audio In terms of sound, everything seems well ~packaged~: the audio pieces composed for the occasion are an excellent tool to emphasize your ~state~, which will not fail to underline the ~hottest~ and most dramatic moments that will happen during your ~outings~. A separate discussion for the sound effects, which we remember, are fundamental in games where stealth is your only lifeline! Of course, the ideal would be to have a system suitable for positional sound (from the 4.1 system upwards (ie 4 ~satellite~ speakers and a subwoofer)), which would help us a lot to understand where, how and who is around us. Last two words on the native speaker dubbing which, in my opinion, seems well characterized; not only in the choice of voices, but above all in the way of speaking the ~inklese~ of the Germans (a similar thing was done with Return to Castle Wolfenstein, but in Italian, to the great delight of the undersigned!!!). Playability This is one of those few titles in which the focus is on the gameplay rather than on the graphic impact, a game that's all fired up and not smoked! Surely this is a good thing: a fun game but with little ~competitive~ graphics is better than a kind of CG movie with limited interaction (and zero fun). Certainly in some cases the excellent gameplay is sufficient to decree a title ~worthy of the videogame Olympus~ (as Tetris did ~eons~ ago), but POW, unfortunately, is not free from limitations that do not allow it to reach such high peaks . While on the one hand we have the freedom to decide what to do, when and how to act, in reality this freedom is only apparent; the story follows a well ~tense~ and linear narrative thread, where it is not possible for us to find nodes from which to unravel. For example, already from the first ~days~ of stay, we will understand at our expense how it is not possible to follow alternative objectives, or choose which escape route to try, but this same narrative thread will indicate the objectives to complete. The freedom we have is that of action and ~planning~: once we know what we need and where it is, it's up to us to decide how to ~get there~, how to deal with the problems we will encounter along the way. It goes without saying that to achieve our goals, we will not be able to limit ourselves to watching how the next soldier moves, but we will have to plan most of our actions (if not all), we will have to know perfectly how all the guards move and find the way and the right time to get around them; surely you must have a lot of patience (a lot since if you get caught you will be forced to start over) and coordination. The control system (although not configurable) is designed ad hoc and seems to respond well to our commands. We will be able to crawl under the raised buildings, walk silently, flatten ourselves against a wall, peek from the corners, check the presence of soldiers in the rooms, looking through the keyholes (!), smear shoe polish on our faces to try to blend better into the night, climb over walls, climb fences and so onro still. Sometimes I feel like I'm McGiver (I hope that's how you spell it), never a weapon at your disposal, alone against enemies and maybe in a short time you'll even have to ~build~ an escape route... and I assure you it won't be easy !!! The A.I. of your ~guardians~ is very accurate, if they hear a suspicious noise they go there to check, ditto if they spot something or if they see you ~hanging around~ in the right places, but at the wrong times (such as the canteen whose access is forbidden at other than meals). The only note consists in the guard system, which does not ~evolve~ when our mistakes are repeated, i.e. it does not modify its defenses (increasing the number of guards or changing the patrol route, etc.), as would be logical to expect in a (at least) realistic situation. In our case, however, this is a good thing, given that we do not have the possibility to choose alternative paths, but we are forced to follow an already written plot. POW won't guarantee you adrenaline injections (you won't touch a weapon, nor will you have Buffy's amazing combos at your disposal), but I'm sure it will literally make you ~tremble~ from how much tension this adventure will be able to give you. Longevity Pow is a title that requires a lot of patience and time to plan your every move; if you know how to appreciate it, it will completely enrapture you and make you experience this adventure in one go. Too bad that once ~escaped~, I don't think you will be much stimulated to ~go back inside~. Perhaps a ~push to re-play~ could lie in wanting to repeat a certain chapter because you thought of an ~alternative~ passage or because you want to improve the final score obtained or maybe, just because you want to try playing with the ~secrets~ activated ( that is, once unlocked, you can change the visual level of the guards, their size and other features that you can see in one of the photos taken). Comments POW is a well-crafted game, which perfectly manages to put us in the shoes of an allied officer, who has fallen into ~disreputable~ hands, locked up in a prison camp, forced to follow rules that are too strict for his tastes. The whole graphics engine, although technically not at the level of the latest videogame productions, still manages to do its job well, supported by an appropriate and well-made sound sector. In my opinion, the only real flaws lie in the longevity, linked only to the length of the adventure (not that it's short, but we have no other incentives to replay the whole POW) and in the linearity of the story, where it is possible to follow only one track... the only one laid by programmers. Ultimately, the word that best helps you understand if the game is for you, I think is ~PLAN~. In Pow you will NEVER go around armed, ready to exterminate your enemy, but you will find yourself ~eluding~ him, using anything that can offer you shelter. If you don't like games where you can't fire ~one shot~, POW won't satisfy you in any way. To all others less ~high on adrenaline~, I advise you to give POW serious consideration. Pros: Overall good graphics, all structures have been faithfully reproduced; Original concept, but gameplay not suitable for everyone; Excellent quality music and sound effects; Great playability, supported by a good control system; Excellent feeling, you will always be immersed in a sea of ~tension~. Cons: Once finished, I doubt you'll play it more than once (at all); Linear story, without the possibility of detours; The graphics are technically inferior to the latest productions; In some situations the difficulty of the game reaches very high levels; You will need a lot of patience (in all senses and just in case!). Materials: Exclusive Screenshots Preview Image Gallery Trailers Tricks Let's discuss it in the Forum Packaging & Presentation Thankfully (but also Halifax), the game has been localized with subtitles and menu in Italian. In practice, the only part that has remained unchanged is the dubbing, however well characterized (a clear German accent is heard when the soldiers speak to us in English!). All the rest is history (in every sense!)... the copy that I received has the manual and cover in English, (but I think the version completely in Italian has also been released), well made. Speaking of history, what we are about to embark on is a long and perilous journey of officer Lewis Stone, captured by the Germans during an Allied spy mission. He will find himself reluctantly interned in a prison camp, with all the rules and ~forces~ of the case. You will therefore be called to respect precise times for meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner), groll calls (morning and evening) and ~free time~. It will be up to you to exploit the gathering places (and not only those) at the right time.
