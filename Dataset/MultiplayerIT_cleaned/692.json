{"name": "Imagine Earth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/imagine-earth-recensione.html", "text": "Today more than ever we know what effects pollution and abuse of resources can have on the Earth: from the melting of the polar ice caps to tropical storms, through floods and desertification. Don't worry, the Imagine Earth review isn't meant to be a lesson in ecology, but awareness of the subject is a fundamental element in the game of the German independent team Serious Bros. Imagine Earth is a title that is described by the developers themselves as a simulator of global civilization in real time, practically a video game in which you will have to try to colonize planets and entire galaxies, keeping in mind some strict rules. The noble intention is fully achieved, with the further stimulus given by having to fight the other companies that will make sure, not caring about global warming and in spite of emissions, to put a spanner in the works. In an attempt to strike the right balance between expansionist ambitions and environmentalist intentions, you will travel planet after planet your way towards the reclamation and colonization of the universe. The wheel of technology licenses to unlock as you progress through the campaign The game structure Unlike many real-time strategy games, in which structures can be placed on square or hexagonal spaces, here we are faced with a subdivision of the planets into triangular cells. This unusual mapping forces a particular strategy that has limitations as regards the borders, being able to collide only three buildings at a time, but also profound implications for what concerns the management of the available space. The planets are divided by size, and there are five different sizes. Each of them can then have a good number of different territories on its surface, from the sea to the mountains, from deserts to rainforests, as well as presenting eight distinct biomes. They range from icy planets to places more similar to Earth, from mainly volcanic worlds to others almost totally covered by forests. One of the volcanic planets However, if at first glance it seems like a strategic one very similar to many others, in Imagine Earth you will have to impersonate a manager of a space colonization company who has to deal with countless unexpected events related to the characteristics of the planets on which you will find yourself. All of this always accompanied by a veil of precarious balance divided between emissions, global warming, quality of life and the stark economy. The first thing you'll be asked to do is choose a landing spot for the first colony pod, the Age of Empires equivalent of 'Downtown'. Once landed you will have to try to increase the population by making their life as pleasant as possible on an alien planet, within a defined area in which to build. They will therefore need food, which you will have to give them by building farms, cultivation fields, boats for collecting shellfish, greenhouses and aqueducts to increase their productivity. But you don't live on food alone, and obviously you and the inhabitants of the colony will soon need the energy to run all the machinery and equipment. Thus we find ourselves building technological and urban structures, energy plants or plants aimed at the production of food, each with its own characteristics and enhancements to effectiveness, production costs or emissivity. At this point you will have already understood where the game is going: each building has, in addition to a cost in money, also a different environmental impact in terms of emissions, pollution and energy consumption. Since the pollution rate will have repercussions on the environment and on the malus received over time, it is clear that finding the balance between all these factors becomes crucial. Interesting is the mechanics of the World Congress, a sort of council that takes place every 20 minutes of the game, in which all the companies present on the planet meet and vote on the inclusion or not of some positive or negative modifiers, related to pollution or to the buildings. This means, for example, taxes on coal or heating production, as well as financial aid from the global bank for specific construction categories. Too bad the World Congress doesn't oblige companies to make the structures positioned on the planetary grid more recognizable. Sometimes we found ourselves having to orbit the celestial body several times to find a certain construction, having to pause time so as not to risk suffering negative consequences. At some point you will have an exorbitant amount of options that you can control Ecology edEconomy On each planet we will meet indigenous races, sometimes hostile and others not, with whom we can forge alliances and trade agreements. This market, combined with space trade through the spaceport and alliances with other colonization companies, make trade an indispensable mechanic for the advancement of our company. You will be able to buy any good or building if you manage to make alliances with the other characters and in addition you will have a stock market at your disposal: the more your colony, the standard of living and the general evaluation grow, the more your shares will rise in price, allowing you then to sell to make money. As of this writing, the interface is still plagued by missing translations and rather simplistically animated 2D characters. The stock market, your best friend While you try to expand your colony, you will find yourself facing natural disasters derived from global warming, such as tornadoes or tropical storms, while most of the planets have volcanoes on their surface ready to generate chaos. Then there is the melting of the polar caps when a certain global temperature increase is reached: the result is a rise in the oceans, with the destruction of some of the buildings built near the coasts, thus forcing them to be moved to safer places. However, Imagine Earth also takes some more imaginative liberties, with the player being able to command certain elements with the help of Gaia, mother earth. In fact, on all planets there are temples of past civilizations with which you can use the powers of nature. They range from volcanic eruptions to depressions in the land to make room for coasts and stretches of water; or you can set fire to alien settlements that want to try to destroy you, up to command a meteor shower. Game mode and technique In addition to the main campaign (lasting about fifteen hours) there is the Competition mode, in which you choose one of eight different companies to play with, including alien races. You can choose the type of planet, therefore size and biome, adjust the amount of natural events, set the rules of the game, the initial resources and the time limit. The aim is to beat the competitors by earning more victory points thanks to the achievement of particular objectives: these range from reaching a certain number of inhabitants to being the first to sell a certain amount of rare goods. The world congress can give you an edge over your opponents later in the game The other mode available is the infinite game, a sort of survival in which you won't have particular objectives and you can relax and enjoy all the game mechanics without any pressure whatsoever. There won't be any kind of circumstances to end the game prematurely and you can also experiment with some strategies to use in the campaign or in the competition. Icing on the cake is a planet editor where you can let your imagination run wild and create the world you want, so you can play it in competition mode, or upload it online to make it available to the community.", "date": "2021-05-30", "grade": "8.0"}
