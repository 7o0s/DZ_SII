{"name": "NHL 2K6", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-2k6.html", "text": "The endless race for the Stanley Cup For those who are not particularly accustomed to this sport, hockey is a sport that pits two teams made up of 5 players plus a goalkeeper each against each other, as for football there are different formations that adapt to each phase of the game, the purpose of all this it is pushing a black disc, the puck, into the net with special clubs. The classic modes that have always accompanied this type of sport are those directly linked to the reality of the facts, the friendly allows the player to play a single match and allows you to have control over a series of basic customizable options such as teams in play, stage, playing time, difficulty; the franchise and season modes allow you to compete in an entire championship by experiencing it from all possible points of view, choosing whether to play the matches yourself or limit yourself to team management, managing transfers, formations and market strategies; and finally the classic shootouts, hockey penalties, in which a player starting from midfield must go towards the opponent's goal and try to score. The strength and completeness of the 2K title lies precisely in the satellite modes, the extra-ordinary ones which substantially lengthen the 'exploitation' time of the game: the games called 'extra' allow the player to play games tainted by particular rules such as for example the hilarious 3Vs.3, a mode in which all strategic factors cancel out in favor of a shamelessly attacking component; another possibility is to play with the old hockey glories in a classic historical game. Parallel to these, the most important novelty (first experiment in this field) is linked to the introduction of 20 mini-games created exclusively for multiplayer play and which allow 4 players to challenge each other in a series of tests that they sometimes remember for a long time near the Mario Party-like party game structure, obviously adapted to a sport like hockey: in one game it will be necessary to score as many goals as possible in an all against all without rules, another will measure the harmony and timing pairs where points are scored thanks to a series of passes,... . The battle mode is tout-court fun and is loaded with that pick & play vein that sports games usually fail to obtain due to the excessive length of the matches. Goalkeepers, rebounds and hat tricks The thing that is probably most surprising simply by holding the package in your hand is the presence of the Dallas Stars goalkeeper, Marty Turco, on the cover, which is quite bizarre for sports games and even more strange for a hockey game. In fact, goalkeepers have always been the real weak point of games of this genre, often too badly calibrated and not always equipped with an AI up to the rest of the game. For this 2006 version, 2kSports has focused more on creating credible goalkeepers and above all with behaviors and reactions that correspond as much as possible to the truth. Linked to the increase in AI, the 'rebounds' factor was implemented which, although the great protagonist of real NHL games, had not yet been fully taken into consideration for a hockey game. The matches are thus filled with imperfect saves, rebounds between the posts and the goalkeeper, scrum goals: virtual hockey takes a further step forward on the road to realism. Two substantial innovations in terms of gameplay are represented by the icon passing system and by pro control: the first is nothing more than the display of a button above each player's head (viewable by pressing the right stick) in a from planning a series of passes in a total and controlled way, understanding this method of passing the puck inevitably leads the player to a more immersive gaming experience, making the actions more spectacular and, often, more conclusive; pro control is what allows the player complete on-the-fly (real-time) control of the strategies and his players on the pitch. 2K has focused more on creating credible goalkeepers and above all with behaviors and reactions that correspond as closely as possible to the truth. Goalkeepers, rebounds and hat tricks Also in terms of matches, the inclusion of the possibility of skating backwards should be noted: an essential movement to be able to create an impeccable defense. If everything concerning the match and its outline were not enough, 2K has decided to insert a mode called ~Skybox~, a private room inside the stadium in which the player has all the data relating to his profile at his complete disposal user, to the copand honors won and with the pleasant diversion of a personal games room, complete with darts, hockey trivia, a field for playing air-hockey and one for a quick game of curling. The 2k series, in comparison with the EA twin, has never shone with exceptional graphic results, placing - rightly - the emphasis on a whole series of in-game mechanics in order to make the correspondence between reality and virtual as faithful as possible. The sound sector sees in this year, the important entry of two of the most famous Canadian hockey commentators in the NHL, the commentary, although not complete, is never annoying or redundant; the mp3 album included with the game unfortunately does not have any high-sounding name but still remains a good group of punk / rock artists who are well associated with what hockey represents. Speaking to the heart of fans of this wonderful sport: do you like playing hockey on consoles too? Well, NHL 2k6 is for you. Infinitely longer lasting, infinitely more fun, infinitely more real. This would be enough to describe the 2ksport title that presents itself in the 2006 year in the best possible way, showing off what is probably the most realistic and immersive hockey ever created. The misfortune of these titles is that they are often tied to a small circle of fans, to others it can only seem like yet another game about a sport with polished ice and a very hard black puck. Pros: Multiplayer modes breathe new life into the genre. AI definitely improved especially in goalkeepers. Extra modes promise long hours of gameplay. Pros: Hockey, like football, is a complicated sport and therefore not appreciated by many. The graphics sector can (and must) improve. However, the loss of the ESPN license remains a bad blow. Xbox vs PS2 Nhl 2K6 is also available in the Xbox version and the differences with the PS2 counterpart are limited to a greater graphic cleaning by this version and to slightly different settings for the control system. The choice of one or the other version is therefore only in relation to the console in your possession. The 2004/2005 year was probably one of the most unsuccessful for the NHL league: the championship was canceled and postponed to a later date due to problems related to the introduction of the so-called 'salary cap', a salary ceiling controlled by the teams themselves, and which found all the players in the league against and ready to lay down their clubs in order to assert their rights. Contrary to what happened in reality, last year's virtual hockey experienced a significant turning point, 2ksport, coming out in stores with a budget-priced title, offered important innovations both in terms of gameplay and the methods offered to the players. 2006 has thus arrived, with it the return of the most beautiful hockey championship in the world, and the finally updated and fully operational version of the virtual counterpart. We just have to go, pad in hand, to find out what 2k has in store for us for this sporting year, in the eternal competition with the adversary Electronic Arts.", "date": "2006-04-27", "grade": null}
