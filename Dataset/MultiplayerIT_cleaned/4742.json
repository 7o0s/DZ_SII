However, they had abandoned the hopes of being able to experience the promised campaign, which finally arrived in this hot August (playing a title that talks about a world immersed in frost while in reality there are more than 40 in temperature creates a nice contrast). Let's try to understand what the first two episodes of Wintermute - that's the name of the campaign - have to offer and if it was worth the wait. Survival The start of Wintermute serves as a tutorial. The protagonist, recovering from a plane crash, wakes up in the snow and wreckage and has to go in search of his flight mate, who ended up who knows where. Before doing so, however, he must be able to pull himself together, because he is wounded and hungry and the journey ahead requires him to be at full strength. The first missions of the campaign are therefore all focused on its recovery and the simplest survival. Those who have played the sandbox mode of The Long Dark will have no problems, since it involves performing some of the most basic actions, such as lighting a fire to warm up, melting snow to get water, dressing a wound and so on. Minimalist, but not ugly for that Those who will approach the game for the first time, on the other hand, will find themselves lost, given that the tutorial, made up of disappearing text messages, does not explain the fundamental mechanics very well, which are not exactly very simple, also by virtue of the numerous menus in which the interface is formed. During the entire phase, which takes place on a narrow cliff, we also see the first filmed sequence: a flashback to events immediately preceding the plane crash, which introduces us to the story. Once the immediate problems have been resolved and understood that what is happening to the protagonist is the fault of a favor done to an important person from his past, we reach the wreckage of the plane and witness another filmed sequence that delves into the relationship between the two. From now on, our goal becomes clear: we must follow the trail of the woman to find out what happened to her. These first minutes of the game have taught us something about The Long Dark: it has particularly deep survival mechanics and, above all, it is almost ruthlessly difficult. Damn wolves As far as we can remember, we don't remember such a difficult tutorial. As already mentioned, we are given very few explanations on what we have to do, but on the other hand the resources that are around are few (more than in the sandbox mode, anyway) and, if they go to waste, all you can do is start over by reloading the last save. It almost seems that it is taken for granted that the player knows what to do. The impression is strengthened by the continuation of the adventure, in which we find ourselves grappling with other major difficulties, without any help being given to us. For example, meeting the first enemy, a wolf (more on that later), its behavior is explained to us, but we are not given any tools to deal with it. It takes us little to understand how to overcome it, but the underlying feeling remains that we lack the fundamental concepts to get by. An impression that turned into frustration when we ended up with an automatic save made in the middle of the night, in a place we didn't know, teeming with fearsome wolves, without the possibility of loading a previous position, which forced us to start the entire first episode. At the second attempt, however, we were able to truly appreciate the many nuances of the game system, which provides for a complete and accurate management of the character, threatened by hunger, thirst, disease and, above all, the cold. However, if you are interested in the survival part, it is better that you go directly to the sandbox mode, because the story mode unlocks the different mechanics gradually and is really limiting at the beginning. Before the plane crash Wolves deserve a few separate lines, because they are the biggest threat and the biggest nuisance encountered in The Long Dark. Hypothermia isn't that bad either. They are truly everywhere and are very ferocious. Why they went mad is told within the game, but that doesn't make them any less dangerous. Let's say that when you encounter one, the best choice is to try to avoid it, even if it is not always possible to do so. Fighting a wolf unarmed means certain death. In case you manage to get away with it, it's almost certain that you'll come out battered from the fight and be forced to bandage someone.he wound in order not to bleed to death. Facing two wolves in a row is suicide. Since wolves are practically everywhere, without logic, you will understand when The Long Dark can become punitive from the first hours of the game. What you say and what you do Reading this far, many will assume that we didn't really like the Wintermute experience. In reality it is not so, because the survival mechanics work well ... for a survival. The problem is when they are related to the narrative, with which they clash a lot. When, after much wandering, you arrive at the village and you begin to get more in touch with the story staged by the developers, the situation improves. Rebuilding the lives that are about to be buried in that place by solving small missions makes you forget for a few moments the difficult situation in which the protagonist finds himself and gives the entire campaign more breathing space. Wandering through the houses bitten by the frost that has hit the planet gives moments of great atmosphere and finally begins to make people understand the overall meaning of the whole story. Too bad for the presence of too many filler missions, that is, designed only to make us waste some time, which instead of enriching the experience, artificially lengthen it. The snow is covering everything It is also a pity that the narrative quality of some sub-stories is not exceptional. However, this is where the fusion of survival mechanics and storytelling works best, expressing its full potential. The village is the perfect setting to dramatize the protagonist's condition and his actions. In fact, it's when it doesn't directly tell something, leaving room for emergent narration, that The Long Dark offers some memorable moments. For example, it happened to us that, returning from a search, we were in bad shape due to a fall that had caused us to sprain. We couldn't run and by now it was getting dark. We had almost reached a shelter when we heard a howl behind us. We turned around and found ourselves with a wolf running towards us to tear us apart. We threw the torch we held at it to frighten it, then we continued our slow march almost completely in the dark and with increasingly heavy breathing, invaded by the fear that the wolf would return. The Italian will be there We have updated this box, which was dedicated to the lack of the promised Italian translation of the game, to notify you that we have received communication from the development team that the translation is actually in preparation and that, therefore, soon The Long Dark will also be playable in our tongue. Unfortunately, we have not been told when the dedicated update will be released. Meanwhile we are happy to be wrong and to be able to give you this news. Black is the night In its simplicity, The Long Dark proves to be stylistically well elaborated, even if technically not superlative. The visual minimalism renders the scenario well and, even if some models are not exceptional, the general atmosphere is not affected, above all by virtue of some extreme choices such as having made the passing of the hours, with relative changes in the lighting, and changes in weather conditions, active parts of the gameplay. In The Long Dark, dark is dark In short, a snowstorm is first of all dangerous, then it is also pleasant to observe, while the night is not used to produce visual virtuosity, but to throw the player into desperate darkness. Instead, the interface is much more elaborate, to the point of being cumbersome. Some menus could be merged in order to avoid redundancies and a certain dispersion of functions, while certain options could be highlighted more. It is also a pity that a tutorial is missing that really helps to get into the game by explaining the many screens (what is there, as already mentioned, is very bad). However with a little practice the situation improves and you can master everything; and basically survivals are titles that have very steep learning curves, so enthusiasts won't complain too much about them.", "date": "2017-08-04", "grade": "7.2"}
