Although it follows the stylistic features of all that genre known (often too negatively) as Walking Simulator, it actually represents a mixture of elements. All-Italian work and created by One-O-One Games - which in turn is the union of two different teams - certainly does not hide the strong inspiration to the Firewatch of Campo Santo, nor does it try to revolutionize a genre, as much as to be one of the best exponents. Let's find out if the mission was accomplished. The family drama The story told by The Suicide of Rachel Foster is one of those that try to touch the deepest strings of empathy. Nicole is a woman who for years has abandoned Montana and the Timberline Hotel, a mammoth mountain building managed by her family. About ten years earlier a tragedy struck his family and that of the local reverend. Her father Leonard, going against all moral and ethical logic, fell in love with the sixteen year old daughter of Reverend Foster and, after becoming pregnant, the young Rachel took her own life. From that moment on, for Nicole and her mother, existence has turned into an escape from those memories, away from her father and from Montana and in search of a new happiness. After the death of both parents, however, she is forced to return to that place, so as to close the paperwork for the sale of the building, give all the proceeds to the Foster family and try to really move forward. These are the premises of a narration that develops over the course of a handful of hours, without ever getting bored and eliminating dead times, although sometimes reducing the player to a mere spectator of Nicole's life and memories, helped by Irving's remote company : local inhabitant and acquaintance of the family who, through a transceiver, gets in touch with Nicole and gives her support. The visit, which was supposed to be quick and immediate, however, turns into a longer and more nerve-wracking stay due to the storm that rages on the state and Nicole can't help but delve into a past removed from her mind, which hides many more pitfalls than she doesn't want to admit. The journey to arrive at the final choice will be hard and demanding and it will find the maximum pathos in the conclusion. A sketchy gameplay As we anticipated above, The Suicide of Rachel Foster manages to hit the mark when it comes to telling. Anyone who is familiar with this genre or is in any case a good connoisseur of fiction will hardly find something extraordinarily original in the title. Despite this, it would be unfair not to recognize the ability to speak with feelings and to do so with great expository capacity. The dialogues between Nicole and Irving in this sense are pleasant, well dubbed in English and never verbose. On the basis of this sequence of events, a gameplay is then based which attempts to insert the interactive element on more than one occasion but which often boils down to the simple search for a key to press inside a hotel which, otherwise, would would be totally detached from interactions. This feeling is felt above all by thinking about those few tools that you have available and that in reality are exploited so little that you forget them for a moment after using them. In fact, as strange as it may seem, the sin of The Suicide of Rachel Foster is precisely that of not allowing the player to sufficiently delve into the background of the game world. However good and successful the narration is, we would not have minded being able to have more ancillary and optional conversations with Irving, as well as the ability to investigate more within the various hotel rooms or situations from Nicole's past life. No matter how hard you try, you can't identify yourself in the right way with the characters and, despite the writer being a great lover of the genre and of all storytelling, it is impossible not to perceive a certain sense of inadequacy from this point of view, especially in relationship with titles that in recent years have been able to raise the genre. Alongside this awareness, however, there is also that of dealing with a small team and with the desire to tell a deeply personal story, perhaps even with the will to never let the player derail from the dictated road and, if so, we could only consider the attempt more than successful. A detail that helps us understand how much The Suicide of Rachel Foster is and wants to be an intimate and small project, also demonstrated by the low price of the experience which, on closer inspection, is little more than a ticket in a a big city. Technically speaking On the technical aspect estylistic of The Suicide of Rachel Foster it is easy to write about it positively. On the other hand, the first person view, the single location made up of interiors and the work on the English dubbing represent three of the most successful elements and which, in some way, also facilitated the success of the project. Anyone with a pinch of cinematographic culture cannot fail to find in the Timberline a trend force at the Overlook Hotel of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. This aspect applies both as regards some chromatic choices and some environments (someone said carpets?), but also and above all for having transformed the location into a real character, albeit more ~silent~ than we would have hoped. Going around the hotel means studying it, getting to know it and recognizing it, thus also highlighting an excellent level design. What really surprised us, more than anything else, is the sound sector, made up of extraordinarily sampled effects and a work on the sound and on the sensations that it is able to transfer that has something masterful about it. The positional audio and some specific moments border on the quality of some triple A productions and this aspect really left us speechless. , granite and without any type of demerit note.", "date": "2020-02-18", "grade": "S.V."}
