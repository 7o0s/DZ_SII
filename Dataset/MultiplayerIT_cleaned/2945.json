Among unpublished titles, such as Horizon Call of the Mountain; excellent adaptations, such as Moss: Book II and Thumper; perfectly fitting updates to the virtual reality of productions that have already been on the market for some time, we are obviously talking about Gran Turismo 7 and Resident Evil Village, there really is something for all palates. Considering Altair Breaker, even those with a taste for the horrid will have bread for his teeth, since we are talking about a game literally without rhyme or reason, boring, characterized by a gameplay deficit from any point of view. The Thirdverse production, unfortunately, isn't even trash, that trash that more or less voluntarily makes the rounds, becoming a small cult for those with preferences that we could define as particular. No, Altair Breaker is simply bad, a bad game that has no legitimacy to exist, especially on brand new hardware like the one featuring PlayStation VR 2. Not that on Meta Quest and Steam VR, the other platforms on which is present, do better... Curious to find out what makes this game so disastrous? We explain everything to you in our Altair Breaker review. There are stories that don't exist There is a hint of Nier in Altair Breaker. But only for the type of fire that the robots use It often happens that what at first looks like a canvas with few shapes and colors actually hides an unexpected depth and that by digging, waiting for the right time, initially hidden wonders are revealed. With Altair Breaker it is exactly the opposite. There is a promising tutorial, a HUB apparently full of terminals to interact with, even the premises of a plot that is not particularly original, but in some ways suggestive. After all, the idea of taking up a sword and shield to fight hostile robots, around settings to be explored always on the hunt for loot, is not bad at all. The aforementioned tutorial, moreover, bodes well, since the Sense seem perfectly capable of carrying out the task entrusted to them. Sword on one side, shield on the other, you slash and take cover from enemy offensives in an extremely intuitive way. A narrative moment of Altair Breaker The inconsistent weight of the peripherals compared to the simulated counterparts, as well as the total lack of feedback when the weapon meets the opposing metal, allow you to perform in outbursts that are theoretically impossible in reality, but this is a congenital problem in similar productions, which affects in itself the quality of the experience conveyed. Between dodging, jumping from one platform to another and even some walls to climb, at first one gets the impression that Altair Breaker wants to focus strongly on the gamer's freedom of movement, as well as on a rather fast-paced combat system. Unfortunately, the intriguing premises are completely swept away, as soon as one realizes that almost nothing promised and imagined actually exists. The levels of Altair Breaker are all extremely similar to each other. Often it's only the time of day you find yourself fighting that changes To begin with, the plot consumes itself in its own premises. In the form of digital entities, within a refined simulation, you will have to fight an A.I. crazed and her evil army. No further details are provided, nor will you receive any further updates on this by completing levels. Everything vanishes the moment it is revealed, giving the impression that a piece is missing, that something is left behind, that a step has been involuntarily skipped. None of this, given that, with extreme simplicity and nonchalance, after the short incipit, Altair Breaker is ready to give all of himself without too many preambles, a choice that might not even pose any problem, if the rest were characterized by a certain quality basically. But that's not the case at all. Seen one level, seen them all Even the bosses in Altair Breaker tend to repeat themselves endlessly Altair Breaker offers an evanescent and also incomplete campaign. We are not exaggerating or approximating. After a handful of levels, everything will run out of the blue, without any conclusion, nor further line of dialogue from the few NPCs present in the HUB. You will obviously be able to complete the missions on repeat, if you really wish, but there will be no terminal, character, document found by chance to update you on the state of the war against the aforementioned AI. crazy. This factor alone is a good alarm bell about what the game has to offer, but we care about ovensrvi the complete picture. Once you have selected a level, you find yourself involved in a whirlwind of scenarios that alternate without too many reasons, most of which are very, extremely similar to each other, whose only objective you will have is to eliminate any hostile presence. Don't expect who knows what settings, since the one in the tutorial will be the largest you'll encounter in the whole adventure. Towers suspended in the void, large clearings with ravines between one portion and another, cross-sections of ruined castles. They seem like intriguing places, but in reality the level design is really basic and extremely linear, which goes hand in hand with a graphics sector that is anything but surprising. Are there any weapons that are more fun to use than others in Altair Breaker? Just a couple, but the fun lasts very little Suspended in thin air, the scenarios are nothing more than small and medium-sized arenas, places that you will have to beat far and wide several times, depending on where the umpteenth wave of robots to be defeated will materialize. There is some treasure to be found at the end of a path, there is also some wall to climb that hides a collectible at the top, but thanks to the slow moving speed of the avatar, you will get bored rather quickly walking back and forth through scenarios without of any detail. Even the battles really have nothing to offer in terms of thrills and adrenaline. If in the first fight you enjoy parrying enemy blows and responding to the offensive, between lunges and slashing, the interest does not take long to wane for various reasons. The types of enemies you will face, first of all, are only three. The patterns they use are damn predictable. Furthermore, it takes very little to realize that the best way to get the better of any altercation is to shake the Sense used to control the sword as much as possible, without leaving time and way for the opponent to respond. An Altair Breaker weapon The rewards in the form of new weapons and shields are useless. Altair Breaker will bore you already after the fifth level. Especially since, we remind you once again, there is not even a real adventure to complete. Even playing together with other users caught off the net, the situation does not change a millimeter and, indeed, becomes even more pathetic, given that the enemies will oppose an even more disorganized and ridiculous resistance to the attacks of the party. Even technically, as already suggested, the game is very little. The polygonal models of the robots don't make a miracle cry and each setting is built using the same texture to infinity. At least we haven't witnessed framerate drops, or any other issues.", "date": "2023-03-25", "grade": "4.0"}
