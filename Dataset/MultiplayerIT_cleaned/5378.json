Spending some time together, however, the perspective changes and if the similarities with the title set in the kitchen are evident, there is an audience of users who will find Fueled Up the perfect game for having fun with friends. happy the customers of a restaurant, in the game developed by Fireline Games you will take on the role of a space mechanic in charge of rescuing broken ships traveling across the universe. To do this you will have to refine petrol, replace batteries, fix the hull and many other small missions, each more frenetic than the other. The top-down perspective is a clear invitation to play in company even if the experience is just as fun alone. In this Fueled Up review, we'll tell you about the little things that make this local multiplayer title the perfect alternative for when you and your friends no longer feel like playing Among Us. Originality and similarities In Fueled Up you will encounter many pools of estimates where it would be better not to fall Like Overcooked, Fueled Up is also a race against time because your spaceship could explode at any moment. As a space mechanic, and as the title suggests, your primary objective is to keep a spaceship fueled with gas by fixing anything that might break in the process. Each task takes time (displayed on the screen via a progress bar) and to carry it out you will have to stay still in a certain point, so it is essential to learn how to put priorities in order. There will be pools of slime to fall into and die, portions of the floor that appear and disappear, fires to put out, and ~recipes~ for more complex fuels. References to Overcooked are not lacking. The agency that recruited you needs more and more recruits since evil cosmic octopuses have begun to attack spaceships traveling from one part of the galaxy to another. If one of your engines stalls and you fail to refuel it in time, you too will be attacked by the evil giant cephalopod. Each level of Fueled Up takes between 2 and 3 minutes to solve so even in the case of the arrival of the evil purple octopus, laughter almost always takes the place of frustration, especially if you play in company. An interesting level design The level design in Fueled Up is interesting and always varied Your opponents in each level of Fueled Up will be the weather and the conformation of the map. You will start with a variable percentage of petrol in your engines and to keep them going you will need to refine the fuel crystals to create actual petrol. The process is pretty simple: a character takes the crystal from one room, carries it to another, fiddles with a car for a dozen seconds, and the fuel is ready to throw into the engine. The spaceships that require your services, however, are particularly battered and each one hides defects and fragility that you will have to deal with to get to the workshop in one piece. Among the many obstacles you will encounter there are airlocks that need to change the batteries ( unless you want to be catapulted into space), asteroids that release a green slime that slows down movement, fires, faulty generators ready to explode and much more. The developers of Fire Line have committed themselves to the creation of each level because rarely, trying it, we have had sensations we have already seen. Some elements, such as a rotating bridge, are repeated but meeting them again never bothers, on the contrary it amazes how the experience manages to evolve even with a mechanic already encountered. One rock after another Not even the floor is a certainty in Fueled Up Fueled Up's progression system is cruelly linear: to access the next level, you must complete the previous one. Each spaceship repaired will assign you a numerical score and a rating from 1 to 3 stars but these values do not count for the purpose of unlocking the next stage as, for example, in Super Mario 64. This system generates a lot of frustration when a map just doesn't work and could drain the energy of a party when played by 4. Fortunately, within 6 or 7 attempts we always managed to pass a difficult level but this still required 25 minutes of explosions and fires on our spaceship.Fueled Up defines itself couch co-op play and spaceship repair together and in person is arguably the most rewarding experience. The cries for help, the fires and the asteroids hitting the ship have a whole other weight whenyour teammates are an elbow away. The experience is just as fun playing online but the absence of matchmaking requires organizing dedicated sessions, an always difficult task when dealing with other human beings. Fortunately, Fueled Up can also be played alone: you will have two characters available, which you can command one at a time, to complete your space rescues. Mechanic's Guide to the Galaxy Friendly squids will come and visit you while you play Fueled Up If its gameplay is capable of giving smiles, it is with its ridiculous and playful atmosphere that Fueled Up will conquer its fans. If you love the novel series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams (or the film of the same name) you will feel at home in the corridors of the spaceships of this game. For copyright reasons you will not find posters with the words ~Dont'Panic~ but the silly, clumsy and loud way in which the visual and sound effects are managed is a great reference to the unruly and meaningless space created by Adams. artistic direction is the music, far too repetitive and almost alienating. Especially when a level is particularly difficult, those looping synthesizers contribute greatly to the onset of frustration. The increase in difficulty, then, is not exactly linear and has peaks of complexity and valleys of simplicity that are disorienting, especially when playing solo. Where we found Fueled Up most lacking, though, are the tutorial screens preceding levels where a new obstacle is introduced. Often they lack instructions for solving a problem or do not explain the procedure for activating a system. It's always nice to discover how a game works by living it but failing a level 4 times because no one tells you how to put out a fire isn't exactly a pleasant experience. All these defects, or almost disappear by playing in company and in person, a pity given the potential of the solo mode.", "date": "2022-10-20", "grade": "6.5"}
