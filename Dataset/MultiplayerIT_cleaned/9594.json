{"name": "Tron: Evolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82819-tron-evolution-disco-inferno.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3Prequel for Tron: Legacy, to be released at the cinema on December 29th, Tron: Evolution is a perfect tie-in, with all the pros and cons of the case, with the cons which, unfortunately, take over. The plot sees a sort of civil war within the world that we saw for the first time in 1982, between the programs created by men, the so-called Basic and the self-created ones, called Iso. As if that weren't enough, a powerful virus, Abraxas, makes its appearance, and obviously it will be up to us, in the role of a silent Anon, to fight the infection and try to restore peace between Basic and Iso. The Propaganda Games product is to all intents and purposes a sort of Prince of Persia, the one in cel shading from a couple of years ago, set inside a computer. The game is equally divided into two parts, one platform and one action. The first sees us, just like Ubisoft's Prince, running up walls, climbing buildings and mountains, jumping from platform to platform, or trying to reach particular ~aerial~ holds to make huge leaps, all by holding down the R1 key, which in addition to making us run, it is the glue that allows us to make all the evolutions. Jump, jump and jump again The game therefore engages us in long and ~tiring~ platform sessions, which in the developer's spirit should be as fluid and fast as possible, given that the path, always single and which does not include detours, is always marked by particular marks on the walls or on the platforms, unfortunately, however, all of this is undermined by two problems. The first is related to the millimetric precision that is required to make jumps and, if these are linked together, bringing into play the entire repertoire that Tron offers, i.e. leaps and runs on walls, aerial holds and retractable platforms, the syndrome immediately appears by trial/error, then going to repeat dozens of times, going through the fast but tiring Game Over, the part you are trying to overcome. The same problem was also present in Prince of Persia, but the much-maligned impossibility of dying with Elika's flight rescue resolved this situation, eliminating downtime and checkpoints that were too distant. Furthermore, as if absolute precision were not enough, the camera also gets involved, and often and willingly it is not clear where to go once you have taken a leap, consequently you die over and over again, and try pushing the cross in another direction, until you hit the right one. It's a shame because some sections are really well thought out with even a couple of rather interesting environmental puzzles, unfortunately in the long run, these continuous stops in front of a simple jump, which doesn't want to enter, exacerbate a certain sense of repetitiveness , which makes the platform part cumbersome and monotonous in the long run. Between one platform section and another, the action part of the title comes into play in which we finally put our hand to our record. The control method is quite simple and immediate, basically we have a light throw, a heavy throw and a melee shot. With the progression, then, the game gives us the possibility to equip four different types of Frisbee, enhanced, explosive, ~slowing down~ and ~draining~; moreover, collecting energy, jumping over particular distributors and control panels, allows us to carry out special shots, which can make the difference during crowded fights. System upgrades The clashes follow the evolution of our protagonist hand in hand, and when a different type of enemy appears, a new disc will also appear, specially made to knock them out. Following the mechanisms of the Chinese morra, a certain type of opponent corresponds to a particular disc, and, since there are four discs, we only find four types of enemies. It is still possible to ~make a mistake~ and attack your opponents with the wrong weapon, but given the chaotic nature, frenzy and duration of the fights it is always better to try to do things right and follow the instructions given to us. This is certainly the best part of the game, given that the clashes are real dances, Anon is forced to run left and right, just to gather energy, just to restore his health by taking advantage of the ~medical~ strips, unfortunately though the repetitive structure of the fights penalizes the good that has been done for the combat system. As written above, Tron: Evolution is all played on the combination of platform phase - arena - platform phase, and this is repeated for about eight hours, with only the parts on board motorcycles and holocausts to vary the gameplay. Propaganda Games has introduced little diversification into combati, you go from short fights to long waves simply by multiplying the enemies, at most you must be able to push a couple of switches or nothing more. The only factor that differentiates them is the disc to use depending on the enemy we are facing. Here too, however, there is something wrong, since there is no dodging, but only a parry, it is not uncommon to be hit from behind without knowing who threw the disc, something to keep in mind when you are short of energy, especially in the last stages, when the enemies on the screen can be really many, and together with them there is also an end-of-level boss and some switches or energy junctions to be destroyed. To try to alleviate this feeling of repetitiveness, the developers have included a well-thought-out upgrade system for the protagonist, structured in the same way as that of Call of Duty, so much so that everything that is unlocked in the story can be found in multiplayer (and vice versa). Playstation 3 trophies Tron: Evolution rewards the player with 42, relating both to the progression in the game levels and to the advancement to the various ~versions~ of the protagonist. Trophies are also awarded in multiplayer and depending on the number and manner of enemies killed. To conquer the gold and silver trophies, how to reach the level cap, finish the title on the maximum difficulty level, or collect all Tron files requires a lot of effort and dedication, both in single and in multiplayer. Bits and Megas In practice Anon levels up, or rather version fighting, and compatibly with the growth will be able to spend the mega acquired in upgrades for the different types of disc, to have more health or energy or to speed up the acquisition process of both and much more . You have to be very careful about what you decide to buy, because the mega you get are few, the choice to make must also take into account the development of your alter ego from a multiplayer perspective. To close the range of alternative moments to the action/platform ones, the developers have created levels in which you are on board the iconic motorcycles seen in the classic film (which unfortunately, however, no longer curve in the manner of the Snake of mobile phones) and safe inside the shiny black cuirass of a holocaust. Here too there are some critical issues, the motorbikes are hypersensitive, a light touch on the stick is enough to swerve all too violently to the side, which is bad given the continuous ravine on the sides of the road and the buildings that collapse from enemy bombing, while the parts with wagons they work, but they certainly don't shine for particular flashes or emotions. From a technical point of view, the game's cosmetics certainly have a good impact, thanks to the use of the Unreal Engine, but it certainly doesn't make one cry for a miracle. The textures, favored by the staging of aseptic, almost monochromatic environments, are rather clean and defined, and the lighting generated by the circuits on the program suits is good, with a little aliasing that emerges here and there. The cutscenes are well done, with Olivia Wilde and Jeff Bridges in great shape and the dubbing excellent, the lip-syncing a little less so. Instead, where the Propaganda Games technique explodes is in the motion sections, especially in the final stages, where between special effects and a backdrop that transforms under the player's eyes, the sensation of speed and emotions reach the apex of whole experience. To mention then the music of Daft Punk, decidedly spot on and with a great rhythm.", "date": "2010-12-03", "grade": "5.8"}
