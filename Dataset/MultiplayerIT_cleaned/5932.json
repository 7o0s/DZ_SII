Think, for example, of The Lost Vikings by Silicon & Synapse, which later became Blizzard Entertainment, or the futuristic Project Eden by the late Core Design. Even in recent times there have been several examples, such as the very famous and minimal Thomas Was Alone, or this The Body Changer, developed by the Italians TheShortAndTheTall, of which we tried the Early Access version some time ago. The story behind the action is about a contaminated space base where you have to use robots, called SynBs, to find out what's going on. As you may have guessed, each robot has peculiarities that make it more or less useful depending on the situation. For example, some can cross the wastelands without taking damage, while others can wield weapons to face enemies in real third-person shooter sequences. The ultimate goal is to reactivate all purifiers in the ten areas that the game is divided into, meanwhile finding all the discs hidden for the sake of completeness (the latter are not mandatory). Although the concept of The Body Changer is not very original, it is used in a creative way thanks to the introduction of some fresh and interesting mechanics. Let's take for example the Activator, which is a wearable pointing system that emits a colored beam of light, used by robots to solve many puzzles. The typical scenario is that of a colored button panel placed above a door, or in some clearly visible point in an area, for which a certain key combination must be pressed by pointing the Activator at it. The combinations can be found by reading the computers that fill the levels, which are also useful for having information on the story behind the action, or by solving some puzzles. The problem is that the buttons all have a certain color and in order for them to be pressed, the color of the Activator's beam must match that of the buttons. Often you have the necessary color right away, but sometimes you have to look for energy cells to mutate it. We reviewed the Italian action puzzle game The Body Changer: find out what it's like I SynB In short, in The Body Changer there is no shortage of bizarre situations that really put the gray matter to the test. Already the first puzzles are not as simple as one might expect, but going forward the situation becomes more complicated, also because the developers have worked hard in trying to propose ever-changing situations, such as a mirrored room in which a SynB has to build bridges from the his side that are reflected in the next room, needed to pass his colleague. Don't misunderstand, because we are not talking about the difficulty as a defect. It is a precise choice. What interests us is that it works. Of course, it is not an approach that everyone will like, since it assumes a certain reflective capacity, but in general it is not bad, because from a similar title one really expects to spend a good amount of time examining the rooms to understand what to do to to move on. However, there are some situations that require a more direct approach. Let's say better: less reasoned, also because obvious solutions are never found. For example, having to carry two robots over a bridge full of zombie robots that are reborn in a continuous stream, you must first guide the fighting robot by making it reach the other side, then advance a second robot, returning from time to time to use the first one to clean its street. To say: there are also different weapons to use, despite the limited amount of ammunition which adds to the problems. Above all, by selecting the higher difficulty levels, the fights become more difficult, forcing you to save ammunition when possible. However do not expect a Gears of War. The action part of The Body Changer is meant to be just a complement to that puzzle and, although there are also bosses and the possibility of using melee attacks (when enemies are stunned), the cornerstone of the experience remains puzzle solving . Some problems Unfortunately The Body Changer has more than a few flaws. If some technical problems can be overlooked, given that it is an independent production, and the cel shading without infamy and without praise that characterizes it is tolerable, just as you can turn a blind eye to the slightly woody animations. Less acceptable are some issues related to game design. As we said, we are not against complicated puzzles, but ris should be avoided like the plagueI can sometimes force the player to retrace his steps to look for something he has forgotten, especially if the characters' movements are not too fast (even when they run). Here it happens already from the first level to risk getting stuck, until you remember that you have left something pending right at the beginning of the map. Going back takes a long time. Unfortunately, the fact that the puzzles can be distributed in several rooms makes the player wander frequently, and if he finds himself stuck, he will naturally be led to return to the areas he has already passed to check that he has not forgotten anything, even when the solution is below the his nose. Nothing crippling, but as the puzzles get harder this problem becomes quite annoying. Finally, it is fair to point out the paucity of the soundtrack, characterized by short and very forgettable songs. Even from this point of view, much more could have been done.", "date": "2015-10-29", "grade": "7.8"}
