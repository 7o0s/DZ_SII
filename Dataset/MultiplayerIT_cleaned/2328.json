{"name": "Splashdown", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/splashdown.html", "text": "Jet ski? Splashdown is the second PlayStation 2 title developed by Rainbow. Previously, the Phoenix team had ~delighted~ us with the nice ATV Offroad, an excellent debut for programmers who had immediately shown that they knew how to decipher the mysterious hardware of the Sony console. With the necessary distinctions, Splashdown can be considered the equivalent of ATV on the water. The protagonists of the game are not the usual Wave Race Jet-Skis, but the flaming SeaDoos that differ from jet skis for the non-secondary characteristic of being able to be driven while seated. After a spectacular introduction we find ourselves in the blue main menu of the game which offers links to all sections of the game. Career mode is the starting point and constitutes, as the name suggests, a long championship that can be tackled in 3 difficulty levels. Once each of the 20 competitions provided (12 at easy level) has been successfully completed, we will be able not only to access the next competition but also to unlock other characters. The conquered tracks will in turn be available for the Arcade mode which allows us to challenge a human opponent or a friend of ours in a single race, via the inevitable horizontal split-screen. Could Venice have been missing? Career is a major challenge. 4 skilled opponents stand between us and the final success that will be pursued through a long series of races set on more or less difficult tracks. The latter are characterized by a notable variety not only of the route but also of the landscape. So we will happen to tickle the gentle waves of the Australian coral reef, to whiz under the ancient bridges of Venice or close to the stands of a packed stadium in every order of seat. The choice of pilot/SeaDoo pairing proves to be very important for progressing in career mode. Each crew differs from the others in terms of skills or characteristics of the vessel which have a decisive influence on the behavior of the vessel in the water: acceleration, speed, manoeuvrability, stability. These values are very important for the execution of the tricks, on which Splashdown is also based as already happened in numerous other racing games released in the past on PlayStation 2. Taking advantage of the ramps located almost everywhere on the courses, it is possible to perform real tricks circus that will have the function of recharging a bar which, once filled, will provide us with an additional turbo. Where are the horses? The control of the vehicle is really excellent and allows us to dribble our opponents and avoid natural obstacles with great precision and effectiveness. By pressing the left analog stick forward we can move the pilot's weight in the same direction causing the SeaDoo to sink into the water, an action that is very useful if you want to pass under buoys or other floating objects. Pushing back on the analog stick instead shifts the pilot's weight rearward, which lifts the front of the SeaDoo. In this way the friction is decreased and we are able to glide on the water at a much higher speed. Through the L2, R1 and R2 keys the tricks are performed while with the right analog stick it is possible to rotate the game view to our liking. Splashdown proves to be very entertaining right from the first games thanks to the frenzy of the competitions but above all thanks to the spectacular courses and tricks. The interaction with the surface of the water is most of the time exhilarating and the feeling of really being in the saddle of the SeaDoo is very much alive especially near the bends when we are forced to veer. The only drawback that can be found, at least for those who have played Wave Race, is the fact that it is rather unlikely that the water conditions are always optimal. So don't expect the waves of Wave Race but only the ripples of the water that cannot be considered real waves. Blink 182, Smashmouth... You can't start talking about Splashdown's graphics without first giving credit to an incredible water creation. Compared to Wave Race, the surface of the aqueous medium is certainly less dynamic and this can certainly be considered a defect but fortunately it is the only one that can be found in water that has never been seen so real on PlayStation 2, and beyond. Stunning reflection effects and convincing transparency add to the sensationnor that the one on screen is actually water and not just an imitation. A step below we find the tracks, whose graphic quality is rather fluctuating. The level of detail of the settings is more than good despite the fact that a certain fog is always visible not too far in the distance which helps to make the image less clear. The graphics engine runs almost constantly at 30 fps which, although they are not the usual 60 by now, are certainly not to be despised in this case. The sound part does its job with dignity while not reaching the level of other productions. The game's soundtrack is noteworthy, which includes, among others, some songs by the well-known Blink 182 and Smashmouth. If you like the genre, you won't have to complain. Splashdown vs. Wave Race It is undeniable that we are dealing with an excellent game, worthy of consideration by racing enthusiasts but also by all PlayStation 2 owners. Splashdown has all the credentials to be considered the Wave Race of the Sony console and compared to the Nintendo title, nothing seems to be missing. The amazing realization of the water alone is worth the purchase price of a game that deserves to be part of your collection. However, I fear that in this period full of novelties for the PS2, Splashdown perhaps risks being snubbed in favor of other released titles, perhaps less beautiful but certainly better known. Pros: Fun and frantic Great control Blink 182, Smashmouth... Incredible water... Cons: ...but a bit static ~only~ 30 fps A dip in Splashdown water Video games dedicated to water sports, or in any case characterized by purely aquatic settings, have never collected much on consoles. The difficult creation of an aquatic element, credible not only visually, probably constituted a barrier that was difficult to overcome. So it was until the arrival of Wave Race on Nintendo 64, a game that not only revolutionized the genre but also became its symbol. The success achieved by Wave Race has prompted numerous other software houses to take up the challenge launched by the big N. Just in the last few days a new game has arrived on PlayStation 2 which presents itself not without a certain dose of ambition in the presence of Wave Race Blue Storm (transposition on WR's GameCube) and PlayStation 2 owners. Its name is Splashdown and it comes from the talented Rainbow Studios team which for the occasion benefited from the support of the prestigious Atari brand.", "date": "2001-12-07", "grade": null}
