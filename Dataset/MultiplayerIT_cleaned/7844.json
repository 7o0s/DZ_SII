The army of undead evoked by the revived Adolf Hitler in the first three episodes of the franchise has now conquered the whole of Europe and there are few territories that still hold on in this creepy, dark alternative take on WWII. Commanding an elite soldier, can we make a difference in the final showdown for the fate of the planet? We tell you about it in the review of Zombie Army 4: Dead War for Nintendo Switch. Gameplay Zombie Army 4: Dead War, one of the first scenarios of the campaign As we wrote in the review of Zombie Army 4: Dead War for PS4 Pro, on the gameplay side this last chapter introduces some interesting new features, in this case several playable characters with peculiar abilities instead of only Karl Fairburne, an upgrade system for the three weapons that are part of our equipment (sniper rifle, machine gun or shotgun and pistol) and finally the special attacks linked to the guns. The experience is once again focused on combat, with virtually infinite waves of zombie soldiers ready to bite each other and we who will have to eliminate them by making precision shots from a distance or by fighting in close quarters with shotgun and pistol, as well as mines and grenades. The abundant repertoire at our disposal, which also includes close-quarters maneuvers, maintains a certain degree of variety and somehow manages to smooth the rough edges of an inevitably repetitive action. Within the scenarios of a campaign that we will be able to face alone or in online cooperative, set almost entirely in Italy and characterized by a duration of about twelve hours proceeding with our heads down, we will be asked to switch from one battle to another, including some interesting boss fights, but also to locate objects and activate switches, which however will start yet another wave. We will also be able to try our hand at a nice Horde mode and with a selection of special events. The Nintendo Switch version adds to the original system the possibility of exploiting the gyroscope for motion detection controls, but not exclusively: the option is activated only while we are aiming, allowing us to adjust the shot with great precision. Accuracy, it must be said, that the analog sticks do not guarantee, thanks to some problems with the hitboxes and a frame rate that is anything but consistent. Graphics and sound Zombie Army 4: Dead War, Karl Fairburne shooting zombies With the advent of next-gen consoles and the consolidation of 60 fps it has become increasingly difficult to come to terms with games that not only aim for 30 frames, but do so without the necessary consistency and frame pacing unable to communicate real fluidity . This is precisely the case of Zombie Army 4: Dead War on Nintendo Switch, which opts for an unlocked frame rate rather than a well-managed lock, but clearly struggles to manage the graphics. Unfortunately, the numerous uncertainties are not mitigated by the waivers made on the front of the definition, which become evident in some situations, for example during the X-ray kill cams. After that there are also the limits of the original, which in terms of animations (see the run of the character, terrible) and the ability to enhance the scenarios leave something to be desired. Little to say instead about the sound, which even without a dubbing in Italian manages to create an always disturbing atmosphere.", "date": "2022-04-22", "grade": "7.4"}
