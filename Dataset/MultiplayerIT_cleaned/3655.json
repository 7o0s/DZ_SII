{"name": "Resident Evil Remaster Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-remaster-switch-recensione.html", "text": "The remasters of the first chapters of Resident Evil were practically only missing on Nintendo Switch. For those who have been playing for a while, the feeling is to come full circle, an era in which the remake of Resident Evil was released exclusively on the GameCube. It was probably the first case of total remake, with production values absolutely out of every parameter. It was no coincidence that two years after its release in 2002, Nintendo asked Silicon Knights and Konami for a remake of Metal Gear Solid, even if not even comparable to the commitment that Capcom instilled in the title which became, in terms of impact and production, a milestone in the video game. Today, in writing these few lines, we find ourselves playing that Resident Evil, in its Remaster version, an updated edition in controls, textures and capable of adapting without shyness to 16:9. Always old friends The ability that the first chapter of Resident Evil has to convey horror is the daughter of the genius of Shinji Mikami. Wandering around the mansion remains an incredible experience, constantly anchored to the bowels of survival psychology and capable of showing the teeth of a dated but proud play structure, strong in that vintage aftertaste that displaces and then conquers at first. Without dwelling on the features of the remaster, which you find already beautifully examined in the review already published, we can tell you that Resident Evil on Switch has practically nothing to envy to the other versions. Having said that Capcom has baptized a framerate of 30 frames per second on consoles, the rest is truly a game of differences and frankly we have not noticed any particular tricks in docked mode. The strength of this conversion is the portable element which here takes on a further weight considering the nature of the title; even in motion, the corridors and the dangers reflect all the class of design and re-interpretation of the setting that Capcom showcased at the time and today finally and successfully proposes again on the Nintendo hybrid. Zombies in the backpack The suggestion we give you is to play it in wide screen to enjoy even those otherwise invisible parts hidden by the 4:3, still current thanks to a clever use of the camera and 5.1 audio, the true supporting actor of a journey that makes sounds and details hearing aids its essential allies. The possibility remains to play with typical or adapted controls; here it lies with the individual's desire to feel that peculiar aftertaste again in digesting commands of a legendary woodiness, or simply to enjoy the new mapping and management of the analogs which certainly makes everything more fluid and playable. We were saying, management on the move: this time we are not facing a revolution, but a welcome addition that pays the only price for an extension of loading times when switching between rooms, especially when compared to the docked mode and what has been experienced on the others console. Nothing shocking: having a good pair of headphones, the Resident Evil Remaster experience is one of those emotions that we feel comfortable recommending to anyone, especially newcomers from the seventh chapter or the remake of the second.", "date": "2019-05-24", "grade": "7.8"}
