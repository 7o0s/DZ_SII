{"name": "Mirror's Edge - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mirrors-edge-recensione_a.html", "text": "Let's face it: the postponement of the PC version of Mirror's Edge which took place last November was yet another wound inflicted on the poor heart of those who still love this platform, increasingly mistreated in favor of the more prosperous (and certainly less pirated) console market. But not all evils have silver linings, given that in a period of the year like the one immediately after Christmas, a little more exhausted than the releases of the last months of 2008 and what will come next February, one of the top titles of the December buying rush, giving us PC enthusiasts more time to enjoy them by fully exploiting the control system of our platform, which despite everything remains the most loved by FPS enthusiasts. In reality, as we well know by now, the game in question is yes in first person, but with rather particular dynamics which in the end could also leave us preferring the console version: with this Hamletic doubt on our shoulders, we just have to go and see what the team of DICE has reserved us the version for personal computers. Waving above the roofs Mirror's Edge is set mainly on the buildings of a futuristic metropolis that closely resembles New York, with its tower blocks more than suitable for practicing the art of parkour in the possession of the Runners, a group of messengers whose job is to deliver hot stuff escaping the control of a regime with eyes and ears in virtually all types of conventional communication. The protagonist of the game, named Faith, finds herself in the middle of an intrigue in which her sister is at the expense, unjustly arrested by government forces and accused of murder: using her skills as a Runner, Faith will have to shed light on what happened thus trying to free her without obviously being intercepted by the enemies, very unwilling towards her as can be guessed from the first fractions of the game. Without revealing anything else about it, we can say that the plot of Mirror's Edge unfortunately turns out to be one of the worst aspects of the game, resulting quite obvious and linear to the point of letting the player focus only on the evolutions between the roofs rather than paying attention to the unfolding of events, which said as we will see could also be a good thing. Longevity is certainly not worthy of the Guinness Book of Records, on the contrary it is slightly below average with more or less 6-7 hours of play and a little more, depending on whether or not you want to go down the road of time with lots of online leaderboards. Parkour, this unknown Parkour is a metropolitan discipline born in France in the early 80s, which sees as its purpose moving as efficiently as possible, overcoming the boundaries imposed by the ~normal~ sense of movement, unlike free running which instead makes the various moves as choreographic and spectacular as possible. It is therefore a way to deal with any emergency situations by moving between city spaces in unconventional ways, rising from one wall to another and using any type of handhold to perform one's jumps: nothing more suitable therefore for our Runners , forced precisely to run from one building to another without being captured by the police. The PhysX du role Let's start talking about the game mechanics of the PC version of Mirror's Edge with precisely what makes it most different from the console ones: the control system. Given the nature of the game, the number of keys used is higher than the normal WASD and a little more, making it also essential to use, for example, the Q to perform particular movements or the CTRL to slide while running and crouching during a jump to overcome obstacles. All of this obviously requires an initial setting phase, very well covered by the game tutorial which shows us practically everything or almost everything there is to know about the controls, letting us even imagine how complicated it can be to manage everything with only the joypad: in case you want to try we are in any case free to connect the device to the PC. But obviously there is not only the keyboard, since the mouse also does its part more than well, this time not as a means of aiming to shoot (or at least not mainly) but as a real caliber for our evolutions among the roofs : on balance the console controller stick is practically incomparable, marking another point in favor of the PC version. Another addition that the late release of Mirror's Edge brings to personal computers is the support of the PhysX libraries, thanks to which the already good physics of the game seen on consoles has been improved, while a further improvement regardsto also the textures and the cleaning of the image in general, which can also count on some graphic effects not present on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. Furthermore, some small differences in attention to detail can be seen in the creation of the external and internal environments, with the former albeit slightly superior to the latter in terms of production quality thanks to the aforementioned effects, while the interlude scenes created in a kind of cel-shading can leave you turning up your nose. Wanting to be more detailed, it is precisely by activating the use of the PhysX libraries that we will have the possibility of seeing marquees, flags and plastic dividers move in a realistic way as we pass by and with the gusts of wind and above all we will be able to admire their deformations and their breakage based on the gunshots and our passage and the enemies. The sound of the game is quite average, even if the advertised collaboration of Asia Argento for the voice of Faith clashes a bit, as the actress seems a pinch out of the gaming part assigned to her. Comment The prolonged wait for the arrival of Mirror's Edge on their screens therefore rewards PC users who have resisted the desire to play it on consoles, offering a more enjoyable product both in terms of controls and as regards the technical sector. While awaiting the arrival of the big titles also expected on this platform for February, it therefore turns out to be an excellent way to while away the time, trying out a certainly original product that almost missed entering the Olympus of the video game due to some small defects that have undermined its appeal, making it still a title of excellent class.Pro Better controls than consoles Improved physics and graphics Original gameplay Against Silly texture Medium/low longevity Not very scalable graphics engine PC - System Requirements Although the test configuration is not exactly the latest trend, we were able to see the goodness of the game's graphics engine, obviously provided you make the right compromises.
