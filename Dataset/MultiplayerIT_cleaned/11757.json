{"name": "The Bigs - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-bigs-recensione.html", "text": "It is no secret that to sell its new console, Nintendo has repeatedly focused on how the revolutionary control system based on the Wii-mote and Nunchuck allows players to carry out the movements themselves which are then represented on the screen . A feature with enormous potential, especially in the field of sports games: it is no coincidence that Wii Sports was chosen to immediately show how the console works and what new features it brings to the way of interacting with video games. Almost a year after the launch of the Wii, however, very few sports titles have been seen and the discussion has been guiltily left in suspense. Only now do the developers seem to shake out of their torpor Baseball on Wii Made by the sports division of 2K Games, The Bigs is certainly a more ~adult~ product than Wii Sports and does not aim to simplify the rules of baseball in favor of immediacy, but at the same time winks at an arcade setting that guarantees episodes highly spectacular. The game modes available represent a hybrid solution in this sense: it is possible to play a quick game or an exhibition with the official teams of the Major League, try your hand at a challenge to the last homerun or play an entire championship. Except that, in this case, we won't have to worry about a team in general, but we will embark on a real career with a player created from scratch, placing him in a pre-existing team and taking care of his development through a calendar of events that doesn't just count the games but also a whole series of skill tests. Overcoming each obstacle will allow you to earn a certain number of points, to be spent on improving the various characteristics of the player: power and precision of the serve and throw, speed, resistance and so on. Live action? Returning to the opening speech, it is clear that anyone who has tried his hand at Wii Sports baseball, and appreciates this particular sporting discipline, is looking for a title that incorporates the philosophy of the control system that ~reads~ the movements of the Wii- mote for executing swings and throws, adding a (nice) bit of depth to the experience. So we need to clarify this point right away: as far as depth and fun are concerned, The Bigs is really excellent and manages to involve even those who don't know baseball, which is no small virtue. But it doesn't have a control system like the one seen in Wii Sports, in this case we won't actually be able to bat or throw with the Wii-mote. Probably dictated by the multiplatform nature of the product, the solutions that 2K Sports has adopted for The Bigs refer to what has already been seen in many titles that have lost something in the Wii version instead of gaining it in terms of playability. First of all, it is necessary to connect the Nunchuck to be able to control the players with the analog stick: during the batting phase, moving the lever allows us to set the direction in which we would like the ball to go, while a vertical movement of the Wii-mote determines the speed and timing of the beat. The swing can be powerful or ~damped~ depending on whether you press the A or B button, while you can give three different effects to the hit depending on how you move the controller: you can go straight or rotate the Wii-mote to the right or to the left. During the launch phase, the analog stick can vary the landing point of the ball, while pressing the A and B buttons results in a hard or slow shot, respectively. Again, how we 'drop' the Wii-mote determines the nature of the action: going straight down results in a straight throw, while twisting the controller left or right gives a 'curve' effect in the desired direction. Okay, and the rest? As anticipated, The Bigs does not simplify the rules of baseball but rather makes us participate in all phases of the games. This means that once a hit has been made we have to make the player run towards the bases to occupy them: on the screen we see the outcome of the action and the ball being picked up more or less quickly by our opponents, therefore we have to keep an eye on the radar present on the right side of the screen to get a sense of the position of our player as he runs towards the first available base. We have to direct the race using the Nunchuck's analog stick and shake the Wii-mote like madmen for the character to gain speed. Consequently, in the throwing phase we will have to intercept the ball in case it is hit again, and we will have to succeed quickly in the enterprise so that the opponents do not make a complete turn of the field (which translates into a point for each player who return to home base). Unlike serving, throwing is performed with the presence of a bar which is filled by pressing the A or B button, and which contains a thin white area: making the indicator stop inside produces a literally ~fiery~ shot, very difficult to intercept. Each successful action earns us points, which fill up a bar and give us the possibility, at a certain point, to make a super hit: if we hit the ball, the swing will automatically produce a powerful homerun. Technical realization On a technical level, 2K Sports has done a really good job, in particular it has finally given dignity to the Nintendo console. Too often the Wii version of cross-platform titles didn't go beyond what was seen on PlayStation 2, while in this case we certainly have something more: beyond support for widescreen and 480p video mode, The Bigs boasts some really well-crafted players and very detailed, with varied and convincing animations, as well as an interesting reflection effect on the batting helmets. The public is entirely polygonal and the stadiums are very beautiful to look at, with the only problem of having rather simple surrounding elements (buildings and so on). The management of the polygons is sometimes uncertain, in the sense that there is even a minimal clipping effect, but in general the engine performs well and does not suffer from slowdowns, constantly keeping the action fluid. The sound sector is much more than functional but does not have who knows what numbers, in the sense that the signed soundtrack is made up of fourteen excellent rock songs, not one more. The effects do their job decently. The Bigs has a multiplayer mode that allows us to play in four at the same time, but lacks online. Comment The Bigs is an excellent baseball game. Equipped with a high-level technical realization, it allows us to control every aspect of the games while boasting important arcade elements, such as to make the experience more fun and engaging. Even for those unfamiliar with this sport, which is saying something. Unfortunately, however, it is not the title that Wii owners have been waiting for, which is a sort of ~adult~ version of baseball present in Wii Sports. The Bigs does not make us swing or throw in first person, but only introduces Wii-mote movements in a similar way to what we have seen in other multiplatform products, therefore on the Nintendo console it is probably less playable and precise than on Xbox 360 rather than on PlayStation 2. Nonetheless, if you like baseball it is still an essential purchase for its overall quality, a purchase you will hardly regret. Pros: Technically excellent Very playable and fun At times spectacular Cons: The control system disappoints Quite difficult Baseball is certainly not the national sport", "date": "2007-12-07", "grade": null}
