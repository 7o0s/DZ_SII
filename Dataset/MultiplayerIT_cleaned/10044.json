{"name": "Just Dance 2022", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/just-dance-2022-recensione.html", "text": "You understand that another year has now passed when on store shelves (or in times of pandemic on digital ones) you find the new chapter of Ubisoft's rhythm game designed for those who want to dance in company. Since this is the review of Just Dance 2022 you will obviously have guessed the reference: how long until Christmas? Less than two months, right? And Christmas brings with it New Year's Eve, the Epiphany, lots of celebrations and occasions to get together (here's the rhyme too). For the writer and presumably not only for him, Just Dance is a constant presence during the holidays, useful for warming up before the most frenetic celebrations and at the same time for digesting and working off the lavish lunches. Moving on to the new appointment specifically, it is legitimate to ask what has changed with Just Dance 2022 compared to Just Dance 2021, 2020, 2019... in short, for ten years now. Little or nothing, but you already imagined it and we bet that - rightly - you don't even care that much. The contents (and the subscription) This year Just Dance 2022 is very choreographed It's true that every year we keep asking ourselves: why doesn't Ubisoft renew the game formula? And punctually every 365 days the answer that everyone gives is always the same: why should it, given that all in all it works very well and sells many copies every year? Here then is that the contents of Just Dance 2022 are perfectly in line with those of past editions. If anything, anything regarding accessibility has been revised or changed. For example, startup is more intuitive than ever: a nice central option with the words ~Just Dance. Dance to the songs you love with friends and family!~. Clearer than that; then immediately on the left there is the Kids mode for the little ones, with songs carefully prepared for them, but also suitable for less squeamish adults, and then again on the right the Quick Play, with which you can immediately start dancing without even touching the main menus. This year Just Dance 2022 offers, basically, 40 unreleased songs, with the necessary variations related to the difficulty levels that will be unlocked later (dancing and re-dancing the songs present). These titles are obviously only a small part of the enormous potential of the brand, the problem is that - as always - all the other songs (hundreds and hundreds) are linked to the Just Dance Unlimited subscription (one month's subscription costs 3.99 euros , three months 9.99 euros, finally the entire year is offered at 24.99 euros). Not even so much, but it is the mechanics that are annoying, especially when the game in question reminds you, almost at the end of each ballet, that you can unlock all this goodness by paying separately. Not even ~free~ smartphone applications are so invasive. All the songs In Just Dance 2022 there is a special guest... If last year the songs chosen by Ubisoft only partially convinced, this year the selection has gone much better. Obviously it is a question of personal taste, but all the songs are more or less recent and inviting. We report them below because it is often this offer that convinces the buyer, or makes him give up. In Just Dance 2022 you will therefore find the following:  la Folie (Julien Granel & Lena Situations) Baian (Bakermat)Believer (Imagine Dragons)Black Mamba (Aespa)Boombayah (Blackpink)Boss Witch (Skarlett Klaw, Doja Cat)Break My Heart (Dua Lipa)Build a B**** (Bella Poarch)Buttons (The Pussycat Dolls )Chacarron (El Chombo)Chandelier (Sia)China (Anuel AA, Daddy Yankee, Karol G ft.

Gameplay and a welcome novelty Playing together on Just Dance 2022 isfunnier than ever Nintendo Switch is usually the best platform to enjoy Just Dance 2022, by virtue of the controllers present: the gameplay requires you to hold a single Joy-Con and to imitate, as is known, all the movements performed on the screen in the various choreographies. On other consoles (but also on Nintendo Switch if desired) it is then possible to connect your smartphone equipped with the Just Dance App, but with the Joy Con everything is much more intuitive, immediate and natural. Nothing has been changed regarding the game modes: the more the player is able to imitate the dancers, the higher the score will be at the end of the song (and therefore also the credits obtained, which are used to unlock skins, themes and even new variants for the tracks). A welcome novelty that came completely unexpected deserves mention: that is, the greater care for video on the screen. Apart from the fact that even the simple choreography with the ~silhouettes~ of the dancers to imitate now show more detail in the background and an overall better quality, Ubisoft has introduced real 3D music videos to accompany certain songs (not all) The quality of these videos, which closely resemble those in computer graphics that accompany the release of new hits in the musical world, is significant; just as that touch halfway between the dreamlike and the surreal that accompanies its settings and protagonists is appreciable. On the other hand, it is true that imitating the movements of the character who moves on the screen is a little more complex than the usual two-dimensional men. But for once in so many years that something new is proposed, everything is really accepted.", "date": "2021-11-07", "grade": "7.5"}
