{"name": "Giovanna D'Arco", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/giovanna-darco.html", "text": "Run Joanna! The video below requires Windows Media Player 9. Bring on your hands The potential of action arcades is essentially based on immediacy, playability and some RPG elements such as the presence of power-ups, the management of some scores (generally the experience collected in combat) and a certain number of usable weapons. Giovanna D'Arco complies perfectly with the characteristics listed above, starting immediately with her foot on the accelerator. It is immediately clear that the game prefers action to reflection. The world around us is a vast map, which includes fortifications, castles, checkpoints and areas dominated by wilderness. Extricating ourselves between gorges, ravines and the treacherous bush we will soon find ourselves face to face with the English militias intent on suppressing any hint of rebellion. Taking advantage of the third-person shot that has made Lara Croft's lower back legendary, the player is called upon to control the movements of an attractive Joan of Arc in heavy armor, ready to bring her hands in the direction of the enemy. The levels, eight in all, almost always have the same structure: free a camp from the British, eliminate every enemy and protect the lives of some key characters. The historical background, reconstructed for the occasion, by a large team of historians and illustrators, re-proposes the best-known figures in Joan's history, such as the Bastard of Orleans, King Charles VII, William De La Pole, or La Hire the powerful allied warrior of the french maiden. RPG tracks Once the objectives of the mission are known, it is soon time to dive into the action. Having met the first enemies, it will soon be possible to become familiar with the controls of the game, quite immediate and easy to use. The mouse controls the direction of the shot, while the directional keys move Giovanna on the ground while always maintaining the ~back~ view. The mouse keys allow you to perform sabers and lunges; their combination, combined with jumps and movements depending on the case, will give the possibility of exploiting lethal combos that are very useful in case of numerical inferiority. To activate the most deadly combos, it will not be enough to execute the sequence of commands perfectly, but you must have a sufficient amount of energy in the bar corresponding to the special shots. This type of energy, separate from the vital one, can be recovered by killing enemies. The numerous power ups left on the ground will be useful for recovering the energy lost in combat. A green bar, placed under the two bars of vital energy and attack power will indicate the experience score. Once the bar is filled you will move on to the next level. This step allows you to spend some points made available to enhance the most efficient combos. This slight RPG trait gives the game a decidedly pleasant and fun tone; in this way, in fact, each player will be able to customize his own character. During the story, other characters with personalized characteristics and their own weapons will line up alongside Giovanna. For example, the mighty La Hire will have an imposing spiked mace with which he can overwhelm his enemies, while the Duke of Alencon will be able to count on the agility of the long halberd with which he will deliver deadly blows and combos that are difficult to avoid. Not just Joanna Although this genre of games usually focuses attention only on the protagonist in Joan of Arc, the player will find himself having to face battles in the open field, with hundreds of units facing each other. Furthermore, it is not an RTS, but the commanders will still have their own personal guard available to follow him everywhere. During sieges at the fortifications it will be possible to use cannons and bombards (which were used for the first time during the Hundred Years War). Giovanna and her team, as well as the enemies, will be able to count on both close combat weapons such as swords and spears, and throwing weapons such as bows and crossbows. To add a further purely arcade element are certainly the end-of-level bosses, different in all respects from the common enemies, which in principle are distinguished by a couple of types of armor and by the rank that goes from simple soldier to that of elite. On the test bench Turning to the technical side, this game, while relying on rather accurate graphics, must deal withsome imperfections that affect a more general judgment. The first thing that catches the eye is certainly the way in which the characters, seen in the third person, rotate on themselves. The feet, very still, seem to slip like on ice on the ground that rotates under their feet, a really unpleasant effect that is very reminiscent of one of the most evident defects of the dated Rune. Another really unpleasant flaw is the solution with which the programmers have solved the problem of the map limits. Usually, in order not to have the players collide with the sad reality that sees them move within a map limited by well-defined borders, various stratagems are used, such as placing an impassable forest along the perimeter, or high walls, or an expanse of impassable water. In Giovanna D'arco, on the other hand, sometimes you will suddenly collide with an invisible monochromatic wall with a far from realistic effect. Another limit imposed on realism is that of not being able to travel the map with full freedom. Approaching a cliff, for example, it will not be possible to jump, nor will it be possible to jump a running fence. In both cases the character will be pushed back by an invisible wall which will prevent his movements. Too bad, because it would not have been bad to be faced with the need to pay attention to slopes that are too steep or eliminate enemies by pushing them into dangerous ravines. In conclusion In conclusion, we can certainly say that Giovanna D'Arco is positioned in the range of games that are worth playing at least once, especially if you are a fan of this genre that is not too demanding, but pleasant and quick to learn. Although some reservations are in order regarding longevity (eight levels, despite the vastness of maps and the number of objectives, still seem few), and for those smudges in the graphic apparatus the game saves face not so much for the originality as for the immediacy and fun that can arise from it, not to mention the value for money (really advantageous) that will not fail to make your wallet breathe a sigh of relief. Pros: Well-crafted characters The light effects generated by the combos are beautiful Immediate and fun Cons: Maybe not very long-lived, the levels are only eight Some smudges in the graphic apparatus Sometimes a bit too chaotic The action arcade genre is reliving a golden age. The limits imposed by the old technologies that wanted this genre of games too tied to horizontal scrolling action have long since been abandoned, thanks to the innovations in the field of graphics that have made the 3D transposition of scenarios and settings more accessible. This genre lends itself well to film adaptations and tie-ins of various kinds. Only in the last few months have we seen the release of games inspired by recent big screen hits such as the Hulk or Lord of the Rings. Films based on epic battles or more generally action films such as those produced by Marvel in recent years, lend themselves well to the action-arcade genre. Riding the wave Microids offers the latest creation of Enlight Studios, Joan D'Arc - War & Warriors, a game linked not to a film but to the story of Joan of Arc and the exploits that led her to free Orleans from English rule .", "date": "2004-06-11", "grade": null}
