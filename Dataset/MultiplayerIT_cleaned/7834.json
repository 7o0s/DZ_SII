Yet in the middle between these two moments, at the end of 2010, the Texan studio also had the time and desire to recover the Donkey Kong Country saga - whose first three chapters on Super Nintendo were made by Rare - giving life to an extraordinary platform for Wii, capable of garnering an excellent and well-deserved success with critics and the public (almost 6 million copies sold). Suspecting that the Wii and 3DS user base is not exactly the same, the Kyoto house has well thought of recovering the game in question, giving it a slight refresh, adding a couple of things and then republishing it on its laptop, renaming it for the occasion, with a considerable effort of creativity, Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D. We are descended from the monkey Obviously since those of Retro Studios currently have much else to think about, for the conversion work Nintendo has put Monster Games back on track, a team based in Minnesota that is not particularly famous but has been active since 1996, and with Excite Truck and Excitebots for Wii and most recently Pilotwings Resort for 3DS. The result is, first of all, very faithful to the original; on the other hand a game with 2 and a half years on its shoulders can still be said to be substantially ~modern~, even more so if the basic mechanics are the more classic and genuine ones of the pure two-dimensional platform. Yes, because Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, for those who have not had the opportunity to play it on the Wii, is practically a blast from the past in a genre that has been the basis and vehicle for the dissemination of video games at a mainstream level; today the most popular products are different, and it is no coincidence that (almost) only on Nintendo consoles can you appreciate a type of quality entertainment of this form. Closing the parenthesis, here we will focus above all on analyzing what has been lost and what has instead been gained in the transition from the home console to the portable, thus referring readers to our review of the Wii version for the description of the game itself. Starting from the purely technical discourse, you can actually compare the graphic results obtained on two rather different hardware such as those of Wii and 3DS; although this latest edition can be defined as absolutely appreciable and extremely pleasing to the eye, there is however no doubt that a downsizing in various elements was necessary. The first and fundamental difference is linked to the frame rate, which has dropped from 60 per second on the original to 30 on the laptop; a halving which, although evident to a careful and trained eye, does not affect the playful element and the precision of the gameplay. Then, together with the inevitable lower clarity of the image due to the lower resolution of the 3DS and the crowding of elements on the small screen of the handheld, in the ~side by side~ comparison some compromises can be identified as regards the quality of the textures, the detail , the lighting and the polygonal complexity of some objects. However, these are truly identifiable differences only by directly comparing the two editions, and in reality it is nothing that can actually affect the goodness of the final overall yield. On the contrary, considering the technical effort necessary to produce the three-dimensional effect of which the Nintendo portable boasts, the conversion work of Monster Games can be promoted without reservations. And precisely with regard to the stereoscopy just mentioned, the final result is actually excellent, among the best observed in recent times; if the original product already lent itself to this enhancement, with the depth changes in the game plan made through the barrels and taking advantage of an intelligent use of the camera, the programmers were good at grasping the nuances without excesses, effectively guaranteeing a result that appears functional to gameplay. The 3D effect Although it was not born with the 3D effect in mind, Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D has adapted perfectly to its use: the plane changes and camera games go well with the stereoscopy, which therefore appears in all its superfluous splendor. However, it is advisable to set the selector to minimum, because otherwise the result becomes, in our opinion, excessively marked. Easier? In short... Passing instead to the contenutistic, in this case in a sort of compensation the differences all benefit the 3DS; firstly thanks to the ~new mode~, which joins the original one - and does not replace it - guaranteeing an extra heart of energy (two with Diddy on the shoulders) and consequently reducing the overall difficulty. In reality Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D remains a challenging game even in this variant because, more than the difficulty in the fights, it is the platform passages that require timing and reactivity to test the reflexes with the risk of instant death; then the rare checkpoints certainly do not help in this sense, thus confirming the adventure of the ape a good level challenge even in this guise. Rather more incisive with a view to lowering the challenge rate appear the new objects that can be purchased in the Cranky Kong shop, which allow you to save yourself from falls, to suffer a second blow to the mine cart and the barrel-rocket, and finally to use one DK barrel at any one time. However, the real feat of collecting all the pieces of the puzzle and the letters K-O-N-G remains unchanged, a task intended to further extend the already substantial overall longevity. Then there is the local multiplayer mode which however requires two consoles and two game cartridges; a probably excessive effort to make to exploit a variant that we continue to find uninteresting. On the other hand, the presence of an entire ninth new world is totally positive, which can be translated into 8 unpublished levels (which however recover the settings of the previous ones) created exclusively for this edition. And the control system also deserves to be listed among the advantages of this version, which obviously rests on a more classic and precise use of the keys rather than on the questionable shaking of the Wiimote in the original. An excellent way to recover one of the best titles to appear on the Wii", "date": "2013-05-17", "grade": "8.8"}
