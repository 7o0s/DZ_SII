{"name": "Death Jr", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/death-jr.html", "text": "Morty the apprentice The story of Death Jr. develops in a world parallel to ours, populated by monsters who live peaceful lives where the typical day is characterized by school, work and friends. It is on a morning like any other, but the fate of the son of Death changes radically, on a school trip to the museum, little Death Jr. and his pestiferous friends fall behind the master and touch an artifact that shouldn't even be approached . This object releases an evil entity that chases and captures all of DJ's friends, trapping them inside strange containers, it will be DJ's job (the only one who escaped from danger) to recover the souls of his schoolmates and foil the looming threat on the otherworldly world. The aesthetic impact perfectly reflects the dichotomy between the different tones given to the story, presenting levels with absolutely dark elements inserted within worlds of saturated colors. Morty the apprentice The game begins from the crime scene: a large circular room from which you have access to all the worlds in the game; a particular friend of DJ is linked to each setting, whose task will be to explore the level and recover a kind of object similar to a puzzle piece capable of partially restoring life to his friend. In order to completely free each character it will be necessary to collect three puzzle pieces, all within the 18 levels useful to finish the game. The story is permeated with horror movie elements to which comedic moments and out of the ordinary dialogues are added. The aesthetic impact perfectly reflects the dichotomy between the different tones given to the story, presenting levels with absolutely dark elements inserted within worlds of saturated colors. To be or not to be (dead) The game structure, rather than being attributable to the classic action/platform, offers a solution already used for Ratchet & Clank, with the use of the character's weapons in FPS style. DJ, depending on the situation, will be able to use both the typical scythe of Death and a pair of pistols with infinite ammunition; in addition to the fixed weapons, it will be possible to find different consumable items in the game that will transform the pair of pistols into a more powerful version of them equipped with particular special powers such as freezing enemies or making them travel by a deadly shock. Depending on the enemies you will find yourself facing, it will be absolutely necessary to weigh your choice well in terms of weapon: some monsters will move very quickly, using physical attacks, which will make the use of guns almost useless; vice versa others will prefer to take up positions on buildings and high ground to be able to shoot from afar. The combat phase occupies a good 75% of the time played within the level, leaving very little time to jump between platforms and evolutions thanks to the use of the scythe (with which it is possible to use a kind of double jump); unfortunately this system is found to be the cross and delight of the game structure: although the game action is frenetic and fun, the serious lack of a good camera management system completely nullifies the result achieved, making both the battle phase than decidedly difficult and at times unnerving exploration. To be or not to be (dead) In addition to the problems of the camera, there are also a whole series of problems deriving from the graphic sector of the game which, while achieving a more than decent result in terms of fluidity and animations, finds itself creating too much confusion in an attempt to insert as many details as possible in the inside of a screen that, however big, doesn't keep up with the game. The desire to make the world of Death Jr. detailed also has a direct consequence on the quality of the textures and polygonal models, decidedly below the current production for PSP (and without even bothering the best game in this category, Daxter). The gaming experience that results from this set of problems is undoubtedly -unfortunately- limited, also affecting those aspects that made Death Jr. a good game. The sound sector remains anonymous enough, without infamy and without praise, almost as if it did not want to fit into the gaming experience. Although the desire to make a fun and well-crafted game is evident, the developers have unfortunately missed the mark. Death Jr. is a decent action/platform game that brings nothing new to the genre and falls into programming errors that worsen the gaming experience. It can be an interesting game for those who are particularly fanatic of the genre, but difficultmind will be remembered as a milestone for the PSP. Now hopes fall on the second chapter coming soon... Pros: Charismatic characters and convincing dialogue Fun to play Cons: At times frustrating As inspired as the settings are, the execution is bad Probably a bit too easy One of the most successful genres on Sony consoles has always been undoubtedly that of action/platformers which, while failing to give Playstation a real mascot, have alternately made the fortunes of psx and ps2. Contrary to the common trend of bringing back the old glories even in a portable version, the PSP (medievil and Daxter aside) in the middle of its already important playground does not include platformers of real caliber. It is in this particular scenario that Deatrh Jr., developed by the Backbones and produced by Konami, which is proposed as a reference action/platform on the PSP, comes out on the market. Will the ambition of the little son of Death succeed in achieving its goal? Keep reading is the only way to find out.", "date": "2006-08-21", "grade": null}
