This third episode is also developed in Canada by Capcom Vancouver and, although absolutely enjoyable as a stand alone, takes up the plot and setting of the previous episodes. Not an easy task for Dead Rising 3, given that, together with Forza Motorsport 5 and Ryse: Son of Rome, he has the burden of giving consistency to the launch of the new Microsoft console and making it clear immediately what the possibilities are offered by a system that sees Kinect integrated among all the possible game options. Dead Rising 3 for Xbox One is full of content and fun, maybe not quite graphically exuberant What are we doing? Calm down, there's time! Nick Ramos is a mechanic who lives in the city of Los Perdidos, completely isolated from the rest of the world since the virus has spread among the population that is rapidly turning into a shapeless mass of the undead. The problem is that the army gives the town seven days to complete the evacuations before razing it to the ground with a deadly bomb, while our hero teams up with a handful of eccentric characters in an attempt to find a way to run away. . Over the course of the story, new and old encounters are made and the group grows larger, while the situations become more and more grotesque and crazy. One of the main characteristics of the saga has always been the need to complete the missions with strict time limits, which has been greatly mitigated in the basic mode of this episode which is divided into eight chapters, which must be completed before the time expires. last day (there is a real day-night cycle which marks the passing of the days). The game proceeds along two tracks, that of the missions related to the main plot, which have no time limit except for the general week, and those, however, optional which have a clearly visible timer, but which is much less suffocating than in the past. These features make Dead Rising 3 much more like Grand Theft Auto, that is, an unhealthy free roam full of combat. However, Capcom has not forgotten the fans of the first hour, foreseeing from the beginning the ~Nightmare~ mode which brings the canons back to those typical of the series and which forces the player to save only in the pre-established points and not where he sees fit. That of the lesser gravity of the passage of time is not the only change brought to the structure, which has always been focused on the possibility of combining objects collected from the seabed to create some of the most absurd and lethal weapons in the history of video games, given that Nick as a good mechanic has no no longer need to go looking for worktables to assemble them, but he can do it anywhere, having found the relative assembly diagram (there are more than 100 of them to combine more than 370 weapons). The same goes for the vehicles which, parked side by side, can also be combined with pyrotechnic results in the truest sense of the word. By killing zombies, rescuing random survivors and completing sub-missions, Nick accumulates experience points and levels up, unlocking new combos and skill points to see his physical characteristics increase and to be able to more easily combine objects with each other. Found a scheme that, for example, asks you to combine a pair of scissors and a revolver to obtain a bayonet rifle, if you unlock the skills related to edged and firearms, just any blade and any gun to get the same result without having to search for the precise models. The same goes for vehicles. This means that Dead Rising 3 becomes a real orgy of absurd weapons, to be assembled continuously and used as you see fit, given that you no longer have to crash looking for workbenches and weapons scattered who knows where, thus giving the player a real and satisfying reason to go looking for as many weapon blueprints as possible. Mad as hell The optional missions are entrusted to Nick thanks to the phone calls he receives via cell phone from one of the first characters they meet. The most important are those connected to the Psychopaths, or those humans who survived the epidemic but have completely gone mad, and this time Capcom has really gone beyond any logic by presenting at least a couple of characters that defmemorable endings is an understatement, if not disturbing. Defeating them allows you to acquire particular weapons (some blatantly risqu) and crazy clothes, as well as increasing the longevity of the campaign up to about seventeen hours. The other optional missions are all related to survivors who join Nick's party accompanying him (up to five at a time) until they die due to lack of food or weapons to defend themselves. The downside is that the tasks they ask you to perform for them are almost always related to finding and bringing back a number of objects or destroying a number of targets and, were it not for the carnival of slaughter all around and the many secrets hidden everywhere, it would be difficult to continue to deal with it in the long run; also because Nick, once upgraded properly and with the right arsenal, gets along very well on his own. In addition to these activities, there are secret figurines to find, books that increase the player's stats, shelters to clear to save the game in Nightmare mode and to be able to manage your team, arsenal and wardrobe. There are also specific missions which award thousands of experience points which concern the completion of activities related to the various weapons and vehicles (such as ~kill a thousand enemies with a lightsaber~) and what are called trainers, timed challenges which call slaughter hundreds of zombies in certain limit with three levels to complete. It is not difficult to imagine that by completing all the side missions and finding all the secrets you can spend up to over thirty hours of gameplay, which is far from trivial for a launch title for a new console, without forgetting that for the toughest c There is also the Nightmare mode. You can also play with a friend, since at any time another player can join our game and roam freely around the map by continuing the story or completing quests and objectives. We played for an hour together with a journalist without encountering any connection or lag problems. Xbox One goals More than half of Dead Rising 3's 1000 points are obtained by completing the campaign on a normal level and defeating at least all the Psychopaths, the rest is done by the normal use of weapons and the combinations of these and means. Getting to full loot takes even more time, if only for the campaign in Nightmare mode and for finding the many collectibles. It will take a little patience, but whoever gets to finish the game is likely to want to go through it all the way through The next gen between kinect and frame rate The new Kinect is integrated in Dead Rising 3, above all for the very precise voice commands in Italian, which are used to navigate through all the menus and to save, but also to play. The Xbox One eye is used to call the zombies' attention if a dying party member needs to be rescued, or to lure them to a well-placed bomb or trap. Or again, to provoke Psychopaths making them more vulnerable by pronouncing pre-established phrases, but it also serves to manage the party by suggesting whether to attack, follow Nick or rummage in the seabed to find food to eat or drinks to drink. This part is very useful because it can be combined with the possibility of pointing an arm and indicating a point on the screen where you want a character to go in search of food, for example, and once it has been found it will proceed by itself to pick it up and eat it, without the need that it's Nick who has to pass it to him by approaching. We then discovered a feature of the pad that we didn't know, given that it is equipped with an infrared transmitter, detected by Kinect, which allows it to read its movements, so that Capcom was able to insert a series of ~gestures~ along the lines of those of the Wiimote to shrug off enemies or to make them fall from cars when they try to slip through the windows (only time will tell if they can be as complex as those detectable by the gyroscope of the Nintendo console or not). The Dead Rising 3 map pales in comparison to that of GTA V in terms of size, also due to the nature of the game which, if played in Nightmare mode, asks you to go from one part of it to another in a very short amount of time. On his side, however, he has the possibility of making a myriad of interiors explorable, all decorated and furnished in a different way, and the fact that it also develops vertically with Nick who climbs almost everywhere to look for quests and objects. Xbox One, in addition to this, also helps for the great physicality of the zombies and the interactivity of the backdrops (whole elements can fall apart) and the thousands of objects scattered everywhere.ue that you can have fun with. The real protagonists remain the undead, truly as far as the eye can see, who become even more numerous at night (imagine streets where there is not even a single pixel free to view) and aggressive, giving a real sense of anguish to the player, especially if he is in the dark of a sewer and armed only with a flashlight. The structures of the buildings and some sub-top textures suggest a code born halfway between the old and new generation, as well as the fact that it runs at native 720p and that 30 frames per second are more often than 20 when on screen there is hell, but that's certainly not something to stop you from fully enjoying what is surely the most content-rich title of the Xbox One launch, especially when Smart Glass is released for the console, making available a new series of quests that but we could not try.", "date": "2013-11-18", "grade": "8.3"}
