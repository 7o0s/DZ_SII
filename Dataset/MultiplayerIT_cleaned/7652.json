{"name": "Gone Home", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/122583-gone-home-la-casa-e-dove-si-trova-il-cuore.html", "text": "It's 1995. Kurt Cobain has committed suicide, in Italy there is still the lira, and Kaitlin, a young American, returns home after a long stay in Europe. It is her voice that we hear at the beginning of the game, a few words entrusted to the answering machine and addressed to her mother. The tone is light, confident, and suggests that there are no conflicts between her and her family. Soon after we find ourselves on the veranda of the house, late at night. The rain relentlessly hammers the world beyond the closed windows. Our luggage is on the ground, with the travel tag clearly visible. The commands are now in our hands, so let's wait a few moments to make up my mind. We look around and find the house key, hidden from view as prudence dictates. Then the eyes rest on a sheet of paper attached to the door. It is handwritten and signed by our sister Samantha, or Sam, and is addressed to us, Kaitlin. She says she's gone and doesn't want anyone to find her. ~Nobody~ is written above the preceding words, which only included our parents and which have since been crossed out. She apologizes, and begs us not to look for her; maybe one day she will visit us. Restless and a little frightened, we open the front door in search of explanations, but there is no one inside. There are only objects left to tell the story of our family, which we thought we knew and about which instead we discover we know very little. The objects and a diary, to which Sam confided his thoughts, not being able to talk to us anymore, his older sister far from home and unreachable. His voice will guide us in the memories of a special year, in which everything has changed. Our family has left a story behind. Our task is to reveal it. Gone Home is the story of an intense and clear love, born before adulthood and its disillusionments So close, so far Gone Home is an excellent example, perhaps the first, of environmental fiction. In the game world, objects tell what happened. We can pick up almost all of them, examine them, look for clues, and then put them back where we found them, or leave them on the ground, a sign of our passage. There is also a traditional narrative voice, which belongs to Sam, who reads Kaitlin's mind pages from her diary when she finds an object that was significant to her younger sister. A lot has happened since Kaitlin left. Her family moved into a mansion inherited from the girls' great-uncle; Sam has started attending high school in the new city and there must also be something unfinished between the parents of the sisters, if when Kaitlin returns they are not at home either. The remarkable aspect of the narrative construction is that the story of Sam and Kaitlin's father, mother and great-uncle become secondary plots that intertwine and support Sam's main one. We soon discover that the father, Terry, is a critically respected but unlucky novelist in sales. His debut came with a story about a secret agent who travels into the past to stop the assassination of President Kennedy and since then inaugurated a series with the same protagonist, ending up with an unsold novel and a new one in the works. The beauty is that Gone Home doesn't just give us a picture of Terry's life; thanks to the objects he left behind, he tells us how his career has evolved over the last year, following a real mini-plot. The same goes for his wife and great-uncle, characters who live against the backdrop of an unexpected and overwhelming teenage love, one that begins with feelings and changes lives, lived by Sam with sweetness and fear. Kaitlin rarely comments on her discoveries, perhaps to leave room for the emotional reactions of the player who plays her role, but emerges in contrast to her sister thanks to small details. One above all: the way the two girls performed the same task at school. Kaitlin, a future scientist, rearranged the sentences on the woman's ovular cycle according to the logical order, while Sam, who inherited his father's vocation for writing, makes a story out of it. These fragments of life are reproduced, like all the others, with incredible verisimilitude. The house is filled with handwritten notes and letters in different handwritings, drawings Sam and Kaitlin made as children, comic books, payment receipts, annotated envelopes, a will, and so much more. There are even cartridges of the old Super Nintendo with which Sam loved to challenge his neighbor in Street Fighter. The player is free to start exploring the house from any point they like, and many details become clearonly proceeding in the analysis of the notes and traces of life scattered throughout the rooms. Only towards the end of the game will we find out, for example, where the decorated skull in the hall comes from. However, there are some areas that are inaccessible at the beginning and that can only be unlocked by finding the right key at a certain point in the game, but apart from the order given to the macro areas of the house, everyone is free to follow their own personal hunt to treasure. A touching and engaging research, indispensable once started. And punctuated by the numerous songs present in the game and recorded on cassettes that we find almost everywhere. It is the music that Sam listened to while attending his high school friend that changed her life, and that we can listen to thanks to the many cassette players scattered around the house, while we investigate the memories of our loved ones. In writing these lines, an infinite number of details come to mind that we would like to discuss with you, but we don't want to spoil the surprise for you. We limit ourselves to mentioning just another narrative touch, cheap and powerful, designed to give us an idea of what Kaitlin's surprise is in front of the discoveries she is making about her family. His postcards from Europe are scattered here and there. Let's read the greetings of a girl like many others, carefree, resolute, who speaks to a perfect family and recounts her spontaneous and somewhat banal travel exploits. A world many miles away from the reality that awaited her at home. The house of mysteries If you thought Gone Home was a horror game looking at the photos of the game or the cover image on Steam, you're in good company; we probably all thought so. And since the developers are not naive and know that the game is the typical American house of horrors, theirs could not be a superficial choice. Wandering through the deserted rooms without knowing what happened to everyone makes you uneasy and it is almost inevitable that you look over your shoulder. This effect is desired and supported by an esoteric subplot, which fortunately turns out to be immediately functional to the story that binds Sam to that girl who is so special to her. His assumptions about the presence of ghosts in the house also act as a bridge between the present and the past, in which we find that great-uncle pharmacist, who lived isolated in the mansion and whom everyone thought was crazy. Only a detail hidden in a safe reveals his soul tormented by an unexplained guilt that alienated his family's affection forever. If you play Gone Home to the end, you will discover that the girls' attempts to summon him are a tribute and an absolution for the man who feared he was guilty, when in fact he wasn't. Provided our assumptions about his transgression are correct. We can't tell you more here, but we invite you to exchange your views on the forum. And then there's the house, which hides its mysteries behind secret passageways. Imaginary ghosts are therefore a symbol of the fears and anxieties hidden by family members and it is no coincidence that Sam's most hidden emotions are hidden right in the basement and inside the attic, places that in horror films contain the most painful and unsolved events. Another example of the heavy preliminary work done by the developers, who left nothing to chance, linking every detail to the story they wanted to tell. Free to be At this point you will have understood that in the game we can only explore the house and examine the objects. However, there are three small obstacles, three secret codes to find. One of the three is automatically composed when we find the three corresponding fragments of paper, because it is essential to continue, while the other two require a minimum of effort (but very minimal) and connect to the subplot of Sam and Kaitlin's great-uncle. On the other hand, it would have been a shame to get in the way of the pleasure of exploration. Each room has its secrets and there is something everywhere. Even the handwritten titles on the labels of the many VHS tapes stored in the cabinets have been carefully reproduced, and there is so much writing to read and detail to peruse that it will keep the most meticulous player busy for a good three or four hours. A defect that Gone Home has in common with all games with interiors full of objects is the infinite reproduction of secondary accessories. The dozens of details related to the story are meticulously cared for, but otherwise you will find erasers in the most unexpected places, just for decorating. And the same goes for glasses, cleaning products and many other objects to be picked up once and then ignored every time they come back. This flaw is fortunately negligible in the main rooms,like Sam's bedroom, reproduced with many unique and personal items. For the rest, we have few criticisms to make about the game, except that the potential of modern PCs could be exploited more, but this doesn't change the value of the experience, so don't give us too much weight. However, consider dropping everything, at least for now, if you feel uncomfortable with the English language. However, let's leave the technical disquisitions behind us and come to what we think is the point of the game. Gone Home tells a story and every self-respecting story, with its choices and motivations, also speaks of a theme. With Sam's story, the developers argue that vocations, sexual preferences and character traits are born with us. Rather, it is the others, sometimes the family themselves, who feel uncomfortable with what we are. And this is very painful. So, in order not to be the ones who in the end have to feel uncomfortable with themselves, it is sometimes necessary to pack up and leave for one's life. Just like Sam did.", "date": "2013-08-28", "grade": "9.0"}
