{"name": "Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battlefleet-gothic-armada-2-recensione.html", "text": "Battlefleet Gothic was designed by Games Workshop as a spin-off of the popular Warhammer 40,000 series, in the same way as Blood Bowl and Space Hulk. In this case the board game, developed by Forge World at the dawn of the new millennium, focuses on space battles. In 2016 Focus Interactive commissioned the Parisian developer Tindalos for the PC version which in Italy went a bit under the radar unlike what happened across the Alps, where sales were satisfactory to the point of leading to the creation of the sequel, Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2 precisely , which we will analyze on this page. We had loved each other so much In the previous episode we wore the stripes of Admiral Spire who had to face the Warlord Abaddon of the Forces of Chaos; the whole thing was set during the Twelfth Black Crusade. This sequel takes hold about 700 years later, to be exact in the final stages of the Thirteenth Black Crusade, when the Blackstone Fortress, the last bastion in defense of the Empire, is crashed on the surface of planet Cadia: scenes portrayed during the training prologue which, once completed, will unlock the three single player campaigns with which Battlefleet is equipped, namely the imperial one, where we will find Methuselah-Spire in splendid form, that of the Necrons and that of Tyranids. A big step forward compared to the original title, which had a single story-mode. But that's not all: while in the first there were four, here, in skirmish mode, there are all twelve factions also available in the board game, each of which has its own ramifications. Thus we will find, for example, the Biel-Tan of the Asuryani, the Death Skullz of the Orks and the Dark Angels of the Space Marines, for a truly impressive variety. It goes without saying that each one has specific abilities, although in many cases they tend to resemble each other. Unfortunately, the single battles are not very varied: you can have 1 vs 1 or 2 vs 2 duels, both against the AI and facing human opponents. There are two ways: the domain provides for the capture and maintenance of strategic areas until the collection of a certain number of points; in addition there is the classic conquest in which victory is achieved by eliminating all opposing units. As can be understood, therefore, most of the work was directed towards the countryside. Annoying tutorial The prologue cannot be skipped and has some aspects that we didn't like at all: the invasiveness of the aids in the first bars is truly unnerving. Not only does the game pause itself, prompting the user for mundane actions like moving a ship from one point to another, in an attempt to explain the basic mechanics (something it only succeeds so far); while the thumbnails of the characters appear at the top of the screen exchanging jokes on the progress of the battle and on the right semi-permanent pop-ups remind you of some of the key commands. The result is that on the one hand you can't follow the plot well and on the other you end up skipping all the tips, which could prove useful, to practice on your own. Once the forced tutorial has been completed, you can select one of the three campaigns we wrote about just above. They are independent of each other, even if they share some key moments experienced from different points of view. The single player of Battlefleet Gothic can be summarized in two pillars: the main one, in real time, sees us at the helm of a fleet of spaceships; the ~secondary~ (but not too much) one is characterized by a star map where artificial intelligence and the player take turns moving their troops to conquer the solar systems. The management is conceptually similar to that of Civilization, albeit very simplified: for example, any form of diplomacy or cultural domination is missing, so that to take possession of a sector it is sufficient to face the stationed troops in a duel. The task can be delegated to the CPU which will return a result based on the values in the field, but the main battles, in which the plot progresses, must be faced by the player in first person. Each planet provides one of four main resources; it can also be improved to become more efficient and reinforced with guard systems to keep enemy counteroffensives at bay. The experience gained on the battlefield translates into skills to unlock (more powerful shields, reduction of the recharge time of special skills) and in a greater capacity of the fleet, which can be enriched by the most impressive frigates as you reach the last level. During the course dn the campaign it may happen that you make choices that condition its progress: for example in the imperial one, at a certain point, you can decide whether to ally with the Eldar or fight them. In the same way, too many shifts cannot be lost in the nerve-wracking wait to accumulate resources because the more one remains idle, the more the level of emergency increases and, beyond a certain point, One of the most important merits that must be recognized to the French developers is that they have faithfully respected the Warhammer universe. It was difficult to condense the infinite facets that have stratified over the years into a strategic one, but Tindalos managed to present some of the most iconic characters without watering down the levels of anticipation of the fans. We will therefore find ~mythical~ figures such as Trazyn the Infinite or Belisarius Cawl, and other faces more than known to those who frequent the Games Workshop universe. The other side of the coin is that the slightly more general public may find it difficult to get involved in the course of events. The dubbing, only in English, is really well done as are the cut-scenes which are a cross between drawing and computer graphics animation. Strategy in power The strategic part is much more similar to that of a Total War than a StarCraft, so to speak. First of all, the number of vessels is on average low, especially in campaign missions where seven units are rarely exceeded. Also, however fast you can speed up the tempo, the rhythms are extremely slow. The risk of getting bored is averted by a truly noteworthy tactical depth. We will learn immediately that it is necessary to meticulously govern the movements of the spaceships: the tonnage must be taken into account, which will make the change of direction all the more difficult the more the dimensions are imposing; of the position towards the opponents, since some weapons, positioned on the sides, can only be used when an enemy is parallel; even speed, because shields and weapon power could be sacrificed to gain an advantage in a short time. In addition to this, each spaceship has specific abilities, and it is useless to remember how the prudent use of each of these can cause disruptive effects in the dynamics of a battle. There are three values to monitor: shield level, hull health, and crew morale. It could happen that a series of close shots causes the troops to mutiny and prevent control of the ship; when this situation occurs, one can try to regain control by suppressing the revolt on board, or to self-destruct it with serious consequences for all those around it. Each vessel also has critical points, so by concentrating the attacks on the engine it is possible to reduce the mobility or by shooting at the bridge it is possible to try to kill the admiral (with the above consequences). The most challenging undertaking is to control all units of the fleet simultaneously: even some veterans could find bread for their teeth in front of Battlefield Gothic: Armada II, especially in online arenas. Technical Problems The gaming experience is unfortunately marred by very annoying technical problems. The first, paradoxically, concerns pathfinding: it is truly absurd that in open space spaceships do not reach their designated destination just because the line that connects them intersects some asteroids (which, moreover, are one of the few elements with which it is possible to interact on the map). It is equally irritating that sometimes they do not stop at the point indicated or that they do not turn in the desired direction; even more unnerving that double-clicking on the ship icon doesn't always reposition the camera, so you have to go looking around the screen for it. The very large strategic map cannot be explored by moving the cursor to the edges of the screen, but it is necessary to move with the arrow keys. Furthermore, still speaking of the single player campaign, several users have complained of crashes in the imperial one and the tyranids, while with the Necros there seem to be no problems. To tell the story, at least from this point of view, we have nothing to report. An in-depth analysis remains to be done regarding the balancing of the units: with all the irons in the fire it was inevitable that some balance problems would arise, but what happens in the conquest missions borders on the ridiculous. In fact, the CPU manages to reach the first strategic point in a few seconds (this is even more evident during the campaign), when the player's troops, even launched at maximum speed, are still halfway to reachthe closest one. From then on it is a succession of movements from one area of the map to another without there being the slightest chance of reversing the tide of battle because the points accumulate in a very short time. We also see critical issues in the skirmishes with even more paradoxical results: at a very easy level (the lowest of the five) the entire fleet of our Ultramarines was literally wiped out by a single Ork Deadnot. Joy for the eyes and ears The versatile Unreal Engine 4 is in better shape than ever under the artistic direction of Tindalos. A praise goes to the designers who have been able to meticulously recreate all the details of the miniatures of the Warhammer universe, in particular of the larger vessels, which can be admired thanks to the remarkable zoom level. There is to be enchanted in observing the gothic architecture of the imperial ships, and the slow rhythms allow you to spend a few seconds more than usual to feast your eyes (especially if you use 4K monitors). The explosions are very spectacular and also the effects of the missiles do a good job of keeping the player glued to the screen. Thumbs down for the user interface which is confusing: the menus surround three of the four sides of the screen, they are invasive and not very immediate and you need a lot of familiarity to quickly reach the information you need. We would also have something to say about the zoom level, which doesn't allow you to keep an adequate portion of the map under control, forcing constant movement and making it almost impossible to open two war fronts at the same time. However, there are some improvements that deserve to be reported: one above all the possibility of using the specific ability of a spaceship that is part of a selected group, without necessarily having to open the menu dedicated to it. The possibility of coloring the ships at will has disappeared, but it is not a lack that we feel like reproaching given the variety of troops available. The soundtrack is excellent.", "date": "2019-02-05", "grade": "7.0"}
