The quality of these operations is always rather variable, but it is not uncommon to find games which, while venturing well beyond the paths traced by the original titles to which they are linked, manage to obtain good success and even maintain a concrete connection with the source material. So let's see if this is the case with Heroes of Dragon Age, which maintains the setting and characters of the first two chapters of BioWare's RPG saga but inserting everything in the context of a turn-based strategy game. Morrigan, I choose you! Although the tutorial phase of the game does everything to appear unnecessarily redundant and verbose, it doesn't take long to understand that Heroes of Dragon Age looks more like a collectible card game rather than a strategic one in the strict sense. The main difference is that here the object of desire is represented by the statuettes that reflect the features of the main and secondary characters who populate the universe in which the series is set. This is the focal point of a gameplay that sees the user engaged in setting up the best possible team to face a whole series of battles against opposing factions. Heroes of Dragon Age, however, does not bother to provide a real narrative basis to justify all this, reducing itself to composing a path dotted with clashes that vaguely refer to situations already seen in the two chapters of the BioWare saga. Such a lack of interest in the form could suggest a totally substance-oriented developer's work, but unfortunately this is not the case with the EA product, which ends up being cannibalized by its free to play use model. There are two main sources of income for the application that in the long run contribute to the decline of an already uninspiring title. The first is represented by the inevitable resistance indicator, which is reduced by one unit with each battle and which, once exhausted, requires money or a certain waiting time to be filled; the second comes from the same protagonist statuettes, which must be purchased through packages with mysterious content whose cost is proportional to the probability of finding rare heroes inside and therefore endowed with greater abilities in battle. Heroes of Dragon Age is a strategy game with little bite and a lot of emphasis on in-app purchases It is also possible to buy these elements using the virtual currency accumulated with the victories in the various clashes, but in this case the grinding enters straight leg as in most free to play games. However, all this would be a minor problem if Heroes of Dragon Age offered a truly satisfying play structure, which it fails to guarantee. A pity also considering the good work done by the developers as regards the outlines of the actual gameplay: the section dedicated to the management of your handful of heroes is undoubtedly complete, the rules that decree the progress of the battles are quite deep for the media of the genre and there is also an asynchronous multiplayer mode that is at least apt. The fights - which should constitute the fulcrum of the entire game process - however lack the attraction and interactivity necessary to keep interest alive: having chosen the arrangement of the warriors on the grid, the user has no control over the progress of the battle, reducing himself to a mere observer of a show not too convincing from a graphic point of view. In short, there is so much to buy and too little to do in Heroes of Dragon Age, an aspect capable of discouraging even those who (rightly) could be fascinated by the complexity of the strategic dynamics devised by EA.", "date": "2013-12-13", "grade": "5.5"}
