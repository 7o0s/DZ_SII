{"name": "The King of Fighters 2003 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-king-of-fighters-2003-recensione.html", "text": "Something new This King of Fighters marks the return of Japanese developers to work on the saga, after some chapters entrusted completely to the Koreans of Playmore. It is therefore a fully SNK product, and this is demonstrated by the fact that the producer of the game is none other than Eikichi Kawasaki, the backbone of the Japanese publisher who has always been linked to the Neo Geo brand. Some new characters make their appearance in this 2003 edition, such as Ash, Malin, Adel, Shenwoo and Duolon, while the other, numerous competitors are traditionally mediated by the previous chapters and other SNK fighting games such as Fatal Fury and Mark of the Wolves. The team fight structure is slightly modified by the ~tag team~ setting, with which the player can change the character in the ring at any time by pressing the R key. When the team is chosen, one of the three wrestlers must be assigned the role of leader, thanks to which he will be allowed to perform a particularly powerful special move that the other two will not be able to perform. Be the King The King of Fighters 2003 follows the same structure that has characterized the series since the 1990s, that is a classic one-on-one fighting game with the particularity of a team battle. At the beginning of the game, you will in fact be asked to choose not just one character, but three, who will make up your team. The three characters, in the standard game mode (Arcade), will fight one after the other until each respective energy bar is exhausted, with the possibility of changing the fighter in the middle of the fight by pressing the R key, and this is one of the major innovations introduced in this chapter. Therefore, there will not be a clear division of the match into different rounds, but the fight will be continuous, like a single battle that ends when one of the two teams completely runs out of energy from all three characters. This, perhaps to the detriment of a more reasoned choice in the succession in which to bring the 3 fighters into the ring, gives greater dynamism and speed to the action, which now does not allow even a second of respite from the beginning to the end of the match . Be the King The modes present are numerous, as are the possibilities for customizing the game settings. From the options screen it is possible to change the level of difficulty (from 1 to 8), the level of power and defense, the setting of the keys, and also change some settings of the graphics such as filters, zoom and even the colors of the characters. Returning to the game modes, we have Arcade, Competitive Arcade, Cooperative, Single and Survival in teams or singles. The fact of being able to compete in a ring with thousands of participants from all over the world is certainly an incentive that always keeps alive the desire to return to the game Be the King Variations on the main theme that allow you to divide the match into rounds for each fighter on the team (Cooperative), try to face all opponents with a single character (Survival) or play with a classic one-on-one setting, without teams. Multiplayer, a substantial element in a game like this, is ensured on Xbox by a large support of the Live service which allows you to easily find an opponent (or many more) to clash against. The fact of being able to compete in a ring with thousands of participants from all over the world is certainly an incentive that always keeps alive the desire to return to the game, because the air of challenge that one breathes in a fighting game is something truly unique and the presence of statistics drawn up on weekly, monthly and global results are a nice incentive for the gamer's pride. 100 mega shocks? SNK fighting games have a very special charm, which still continues to gain acclaim among fans, but how much is such a title actually worth in 2006? In the year of transition to the next generation, inserting a disc into the console and seeing a very short and meager introduction start with the wording ~press start~ flashing perpetually in the middle of the screen and finally arriving at a practically monochromatic initial screen may seem anachronistic. In fact, that's right: this SNK/Playmore title has no qualms about shooting pixelated 16-bit style graphics in the face of the player and, apart from a few concessions made to polygons in the scenarios, it holds the 2D flag high in an era where the ~magnificent and progressive fortunes~ of the gaming market would like the imposition of massive three-dimensional graphics strictly in high definition. On the other hand there is not only re-enactment nostalegic from the good old days: the 2D fighting game is based on a structure that has little to do with that of the 3D counterparts, which has reigned since the 32-bit times. The transition to three-dimensional graphics did not represent an evolution in the dynamics of the 2D fighting game, it was rather a distortion and a trend towards a new type of gameplay. there is not only a nostalgic recollection of the good old days: the 2D fighting game is based on a structure that has little to do with that of its 3D counterparts 100 mega shocks? Free from the precise calculation of the spatial and volumetric ratios of the polygonal system, the bitmap graphics allow you to concentrate all your attention on a single action plan, increasing the spectacularity of the encounters and inserting large quantities of special moves for each character. Of course, the pixelated graphics don't really make a good impression nowadays, but everything should also be seen by appreciating it as a rare example of the craftsmanship of the graphics which in some cases reaches absolutely remarkable levels: there are some sprites and some impressive animations for the their qualities, while other characters appear evidently more rough and neglected. The scenarios, in general, despite the 3D contributions that blend quite well with the bitmap graphics, do not reach particularly pleasant quality levels, always remaining rather flat and anonymous. From an audio point of view, the game has very little to offer: the usual sampled screams and 80's synthesizer music make up a repertoire of songs and effects that will certainly not enter the history of video games and which at most can increase the impression of being in front of a dated title, even more than it actually is. The King of PlayStation 2 The King of Fighters 2003 is also available for PlayStation 2. The differences with the Xbox version are practically non-existent from a technical-content point of view, except obviously for the different types of joypads, but these are matters of taste. The extra gear of the Xbox version consists in the presence of online support via Live, which is instead a big lack of the PlayStation 2 version. Comment The King of Fighters 2003 is a game that lends itself to different readings, and its value is particularly difficult to establish in an absolute way. It is clear that this is not a game suitable for a mass audience, but it can be extremely appreciated by fans of the genre, for whom it could be a real boon. Compared to the recent SNK Vs Capcom Chaos it is a much more pleasant and well-finished title, both from a purely technical point of view and in terms of playability and the current scarcity of such games on the market plays in its favor. Technically the graphics do their duty well with some truly remarkable animations and certain sprites, pleasing to the eye even beyond the simple retro taste of the 16-bit style graphics. Finally, a decisive element of the game is the presence of the online service, given that multiplayer is the soul of the fighting game: a good use of Live, like the one we can find in this KoF (Xbox version) is an extremely important added value for its success. Ultimately, The King of Fighters 2003 is a must buy for all fans of 2D fighting games particularly inclined to the SNK style and a great buy for fans of the arcade beat'em up genre in general. For all the others it could represent little more than a curiosity, a sort of relic from the past that would hardly lead to a purchase, even at the reduced price with which it is presented on the market. Pros: Solid and well-tested gameplay Large amount of characters Excellent online multiplayer service Cons: Suitable almost exclusively for fans of the genre Rather dated technical realization Anonymous sound A welcome return Some time ago SNK and Capcom competed for the large audience of fighting game enthusiasts, especially in the era in which these arcades were still depopulated and represented extremely refined products. In particular, the SNK games belonged to an even more elite circle, since in order to be able to use them at home it was necessary to spend figures that a mere mortal could hardly put aside with weekly pocket money. Today, the heirs of these exclusive games are sold at a reduced price, and despite this they still seem to be products clearly behind from a technical point of view, in a market dominated by much more refined productions. But there is no sloppiness in the making of these games: SNK/Playmore products, as they come from Neo Geo to Xbox, are the last bastion of 2D graphics that video game makers have unfairlycompletely neglected in recent years, flattened on a production line that cuts the legs off any project that does not include an expensive use of polygons.", "date": "2006-02-20", "grade": null}
