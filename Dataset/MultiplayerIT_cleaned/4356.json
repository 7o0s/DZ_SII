In short, this is a sort of disclaimer: we are not clairvoyant and we cannot know what will happen in the next two years, but in this review of World of Warcraft: Dragonflight we will tell you how we spent these first few weeks on the Isle of Dragons and What impressions did the ninth expansion of the most famous MMORPG in the world make on us? Discover the Isle of Dragons World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, completing the initial campaign will unlock several extras We write these lines after completing the first Mythic+ that Blizzard has unlocked with the new weekly reset, following the popular model of the last season of Shadowlands: eight timed expeditions, but if four came out with Dragonflight, the other four belong to past expansions . We're not sure if it was the best choice for the first season of the new expansion, and this should serve to make you understand that no, it's not that Blizzard has it all right this round, but in Irvine they have been designing exceptional shipments for years, only to then abandon them at the release of each new expansion, and this new solution saves many memorable assets from oblivion. The new Dragonflight expeditions are almost all splendid, apart from Conca dei Felcepelle which is really gloomy and ugly: they are generally shorter than in the past, and the less linear ones, such as Offensiva dei Nokhud, are never dispersive, even if they allow a fair amount of freedom exploratory. Knowing full well that the bulk of players would spend a lot of time in the new shipments, Blizzard has taken care of this aspect even more than before, but precisely nothing has changed in the vertical progression endgame, all focused on equipment and item level. It's a proven formula that is now the DNA of World of Warcraft, and here one could make a thousand thousand speeches about the toxicity that fuels a certain type of competition, but the point is that the endgame must be reached, and this time the journey seemed count much more than the meta also, and above all, by Blizzard standards. Dragonflight is a more intimate and heartfelt expansion, which refers to a part of Warcraft mythology, that of dragons, which may appear trivial, but no less fascinating. Alexstrasza, Kalecgos, Nozdormu and company are characters that Warcraft fans have come to love over the years, and who felt torn away when Blizzard shelved them at the end of the Cataclysm expansion. Now that the Isle of Dragons has awakened, our task will be to help the former Aspects restore their respective Flocks to defend their thousand-year-old home from the threat of the primordial Dragons. World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, these two Orcs star in one of the coolest missions of all time The main story has only just begun, of course, but it's clear that Blizzard has scaled back their ambitions: after trying to tell the final showdown between the Horde and the Alliance with little success - so much so that we ended up playing together! - and having wasted the cosmic potential of the Shadowlands with a clumsily written story of redemption, screenwriter Steve Danuser has focused the initial campaign of the ninth expansion on a temporary antagonist, the very stereotypical Raszageth, who is a real MacGuffin, that is, a gimmick almost completely irrelevant narrative that only serves to move the story. This would suggest that Danuser and his have made a hole in the water with the narrative, but the reality is that in these ten levels of Dragonflight we have completed some of the most beautiful missions in the long history of WoW, which in the meantime has turned eighteen. They are more personal and contained stories, to compose a mosaic respectful of the imaginary that Blizzard has established in all this time and which take up ideas and subplots left pending. Thus it may happen to come across an old Orc devoured by guilt, a Dwarf who is actually a dragon lost in one's memories or an ancient tome that drives anyone who reads it to madness. World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, Veritastrasz has a lot of stories to tell to those who have the time and desire to listen to it The missions are distributed practically everywhere on the map: only the campaign can be followedna, and reach the maximum level more or less organically, or get lost among the myriads of yellow exclamation points that Blizzard would seem to have scattered in every corner of the island, and for a mission that is completed usually two or three others appear that lead to new areas and as many assignments. It's an absurdly complex plot that works beautifully, but that unbalances the progression a bit: completing every possible mission, and without taking on any expeditions, we reached level 70 about halfway through the third zone, although it is a completely rough estimate that it can vary based on a plethora of factors like rest bonus, experience points gained from gathering materials, extra achievements, and so on. The fact is that we had a lot of fun: the best missions are really well written, often moving or sobering, and in some cases they are resolved in a more original way than usual. This does not mean that Blizzard has revolutionized the structure of the game, which ultimately remains the one devoted to action that we know well. In short, those looking for an epic in the style of Final Fantasy XIV might be disappointed, but the micro-campaigns are diversified and interesting: we appreciated, in particular, the rivalry between Wrathion and his brother Sabellian, which promises very interesting developments, and the characterization work that definitely served Kalecgos. World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, our job will be to help the Dragonflights The four regions of Dragonflight are splendid and the campaign crosses them cleverly, basting a narrative in each that converges in the main storyline. Not all of them succeeded to the same degree, unfortunately: the Centauri subplot in the Plains of Ohn'ahra left us rather indifferent, with a resolution related to the green dragonflight a bit forced, while we absolutely adored the return of an old acquaintance in the Vastit Azzurra and the space-time odyssey of Chromie and Murozond which makes fun of the now overused dynamics of the multiverse. The division into micro-campaigns also makes sense from a gameplay perspective, as each unlocks a new faction that functions at levels of Fame similar to the Covens of Shadowlands. In this case, however, the player does not have to choose, and each new level of Fame unlocks extra content that can be cosmetic items or pets, but also bonuses that apply to all characters on the account, mini-games, additional missions, even extra features . Each level of Fame represents a goal to be achieved: a comfortable interface anticipates each of them, then it's up to the player to choose whether to focus on one, the other or all together according to his preferences. The beauty of dragon flight World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, Valdrakken is the dragon capital in the Thaldraszus region Dragonflight is a set that works in the sum of its parts because each of them has been clearly reasoned in concert with the others, and one of them is undoubtedly the so-called dragonflight. Perhaps the trick lies right there: by stripping the new expansion of any overly articulated frills such as the Soul Binds or other amenities such as Azerite or the Garrison, Blizzard has returned to focus on pure gameplay, and draconic flight, while not affecting on the actual character, it's a feature that changes the experience in an incisive way. If in the old expansions you have to wait months before being able to fly to the new zones - usually by completing some Enterprise - this time the skies are crossed almost immediately: one of the very first missions in the Shores of Awakening, the first zone, unlocks the first of the four usable dragons only in the Isle of Dragons. They are special mounts, and cosmetically customizable through a series of scrolls to be collected, which can fly following the laws of physics. Double-jumping takes off into flight, which consumes a special Vigor gauge that recharges over time or by maintaining a certain speed. World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, dragon flight is a fantastic novelty Drakes fly much faster than traditional flying mounts, and the player must actively control them, using elevation, physics, and acceleration as the circumstances dictate. There is no risk of falling and dying, but only of finding yourself waiting for the Force to recharge. Fortunately, the campaign rewards the player with new flying stunts, while the Dragon Glyphs scattered throughout each map serve to upgrade the mount to fly longer and faster. Once you max out your drake, there's no turning back. The traditional mountstions seem slow and boring in comparison, because flying in the Dragon Isles is exciting: with a little skill you can get from one end to the other in a matter of minutes, and Blizzard has filled the Isle with timed races to be completed complete with records and medals. Of course the lazy ones can always use the traditional Flight Masters to get from one point to another while having a coffee or surfing the Internet, but you have to give credit to Blizzard for having invented a dynamic of gameplay that we really hope will also be implemented in the rest of the game. The point, however, is that the Isle of Dragons was also geographically built around dragon flight, and we are not joking when we say that it is without a doubt the most complex region that they have invented in Irvine. World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, the ninth expansion is one of the most inclusive ever Blizzard's artists have also developed each region in height, modeling 3D scenarios that encourage the reasoned - and sometimes strategic - use of draconic flight. It's not just the secrets and collectibles in industrial quantities that are placed in the most pleasant places, but there are areas and missions that cannot be reached on foot. Overall, the Isle of Dragons is one of the most diverse regions in World of Warcraft, and each zone includes multiple biomes or visual themes that are reflected in a simply manic complexity of modeling and detail. And despite this, World of Warcraft remains the same enormously scalable game as ever, although the technical requirements bar has been raised significantly compared to some time ago. The scenarios that we have explored in these ten levels are incredibly spacious and detailed, as are the creatures we have faced: many of them respect old archetypes or re-propose already known skeletal structures, but the Californian company has enriched each new one with high definition details 3D model that in some cases looks like another game. World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, fishing in the Azure Vast with the Tuskarr In this sense, however, WoW continues to feel ~old~ in other respects, and the real-time cinematics lend themselves to a clumsy and plastered direction. It goes so much better with the major cutscenes, so much so that one wonders why the same device hasn't been used for every other climax of the narrative. Honestly, they are speeches that leave the time they find: no one really plays World of Warcraft for the graphics - although the cartoon style must necessarily like it, of course - but when you get to Valdrakken, the capital of the Isle of Dragons in the Thaldraszus area, and swooping down among the flocks of dragons that circle and fly over Aspect Keep, perched on a mountaintop from which every single surrounding region can be seen in the distance, while solemn music fills the space, well, let's just say that the historic World of Warcraft player cannot remain impassive in front of this show. New but old World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, we will visit a hilarious alternate dimension where the Murlocs have conquered Azeroth Reached level 70 and completed the first part of the Valdrakken campaign, we unlocked the usual world quests, new high-level activities and a series of incentives for the growth of secondary characters. World Quests are definitely the content that will split the gaming community in two for some time, as they no longer reset every certain number of hours, but every certain number of days. Blizzard explained this decision with a somewhat hypocritical excuse, because we all know that Irvine is interested in extending and maximizing subscriptions, and we too initially looked at this choice sideways, but at a certain point we noticed its aspects positive. Yes, it's true, the new system artificially limits the content available to the player, and slows down the growth of reputations, but if on the one hand it prevents players from consuming this content in a few days and then complaining on the official forums, on the other hand another does just what Blizzard claims it does, that is, it doesn't induce compulsive hooking. Not to mention that the levels of Renown do not unlock improvements in terms of item level, but only additional content. World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, better watch PvP from afar and from above In a perfect world, these tricks would have been more than enough to maintain a certain balance, but Blizzard has implemented a series of missions that resolve themselves in an excessive and completely optional grind which, however, has already", "date": "2022-12-16", "grade": "9.0"}
