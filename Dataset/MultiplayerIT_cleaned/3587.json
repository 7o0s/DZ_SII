{"name": "Blazing Chrome", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blazing-chrome-recensione.html", "text": "Just as Konami celebrates its fiftieth anniversary, JoyMasher and The Arcade Crew pack a tribute with Blazing Chrome that seems explicitly aimed at Contra, as we see in this review. Curiously, Konami has chosen to recover the brand by proposing a new 3D interpretation with Contra: Rogue Corps, in addition to the Contra Anniversary Collection, while the indie team has decided to bring back to current screens a real new 2D shooter that seems to come directly between the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s and, at least as a first impact, it seems a decidedly apt choice. Because in fact there aren't many other ways to reproduce the sensations, rhythm and gameplay of the 2D run and gun shooter if not by precisely reproducing those stylistic features of the era in which the genre had reached its maximum expression, which at the same time represents the recognition of the qualitative level achieved by titles of this type in that period and the condemnation of the impossibility of replicating the experience with modern means. You can breathe classicism right from the first semi-static screens that tell the story of Blazing Chrome, this too coming directly from a period in which games definitely didn't ~shoot~ with flesh-and-blood actors and without the use of screenwriters: in In the year 21XX, the war between robots and humans has almost ended with the total defeat of the latter, but a faint hope has remained alive. Warrior Mavra and reprogrammed android Doyle are the last two combatants standing on a madcap mission behind enemy lines and find themselves humanity's last chance before complete destruction. Obviously, the player is left with the choice of whether to play one or the other, or both if the game is played in cooperative multiplayer, which is certainly the maximum expression of Blazing Chrome. Pure action In short, we are not exactly faced with an action-driven story, let's say. The game allows us to select the level to face within an initial choice among four, each characterized by its own setting, situations, enemies and bosses, a bit in the style of the old Mega Man, to stay on the subject of classic suggestions . The gameplay is derived directly from the Contra tradition but with some digressions reminiscent of Metal Slug and a particular power-up system that is quite original. The two characters can walk, jump, grab ropes and protrusions or bend down and roll to carry out evasive manoeuvres, with the possibility of using special vehicles in certain cases that introduce more peculiar situations in the game, capable of approaching some situations typical of the famous SNK shooter. Both fighters are equipped with a base weapon with standard firepower, with power-ups that allow you to obtain four other interchangeable weapons, each with particular characteristics in terms of power, range and fire trajectory. The ammunition is infinite but with each loss of life the additional weapons are also reset and we return to the basic situation: considering that there is no energy system (beyond momentary shields and extra defenses provided by the armor), every single shot immediately you pay very dearly, losing one of the few lives available and all the progress made with regard to the arsenal available. This determines a challenge rate and a decidedly high level of difficulty, combined with the amount of threats that bombard the on-screen protagonists and the frequency of challenging fights against bosses and mini-bosses, all characteristics that fit perfectly into the classic run and shooter style. traditional arcade gun. As befits a perfect Contra emulator, Blazing Chrome can be played in cooperative offline multiplayer with one player and it is probably in this configuration that the game expresses its best: beyond the additional enthusiasm that face-to-face multiplayer is always in able to give, according to a rule valid from the origin of video games to today, the levels and bosses seem in some cases designed to be faced in a better way in two than the single player, although even the single player is perfectly enjoyable. Unfortunately, it does not seem possible to bring the second user into the game with a drop-in / drop-out system, thus forcing to set up the game for two participants directly when starting the Arcade mode. Classic aesthetics The rediscovery of the pixel has gone through various phases and it is interesting to note that one of the most recent trends is the most faithful recovery possible of the style ofn the 80s and 90s, as Blazing Chrome also demonstrates. More than a use of 2D bitmaps and classic iconography to find a new symbolism, a sort of post-modern aesthetic, this game tries to reconstruct without any filter the graphics that were the most popular in 2D scrolling shooters at the time of 16-bit. It is obviously always an artificial operation deriving from a ~cultural~ reinterpretation process, so to speak, but the effect that emerges is not that of particularly artistic pixel-art, but rather a sort of genuine attempt to recreate, out of time, a type of game now almost completely extinct by representing it with the typical look it had when it was at its peak. In short, the ~time machine~ effect is particularly effective and by launching Blazing Chrome you really have the feeling of being in front of a shooter from 25 years ago. The quality of the sprites and scenarios is remarkable, also thinking of the craftsmanship behind it, with some particularly spectacular moments especially during the boss fights, in which animations and effects also partially betray the obviously different potential of current consoles compared to those that hosted the games to which this title refers. Sometimes the wealth of moving elements on the screen, explosions and effects also leads to a certain confusion that makes it difficult to read the action precisely, which can have serious implications in a title with such a high challenge rate, but it is an inconvenience that also falls within in the characteristics of the genus. If anything, the problem is a certain lack of identity that characterizes Blazing Chrome, deriving precisely from its paying homage to titles such as Contra and the typical imagery of 80s and 90s science fiction so well that it brings practically nothing new and thus proving to be a particularly mannerist product. However, such a flaw is inherent in the very essence of a project of this kind.", "date": "2019-07-18", "grade": "8.0"}
