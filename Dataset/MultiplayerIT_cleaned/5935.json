After a long hiatus, the famous witch has decided to get back into action and do it in style. For the conquest of the city of Donald and his family, he decided to unleash a powerful magical army composed of numerous creatures, mechanical and otherwise, capable of fighting and subjugating the once peaceful town. This time it doesn't seem to be a simple narrative device to then bring everyone back on the right path and conclude the matter in the name of good feelings: there is a need to act and fight back Amelia's followers before it's too late, because they don't really seem willing to reason in any peaceful way. Donald and Scrooge, in spite of themselves, are the first to come to terms with the minions of the evil Vesuvius witch and immediately become involved in the front line battles with ... playing cards. Yes, because The Duckforce Rises is a collectible card game with RPG elements, in which we find ourselves facing enemies in a strategic battle with cards capable of triggering attacks, defense maneuvers, special abilities and more, all to be dosed and calculate with the right timing and parsimony to try to knock down the enemies that stand in front of us. The concept does not represent anything extremely innovative, but associated with the Disney universe (to be precise with the world of Donald Duck) it could represent something very interesting, considering the vast choice of characters and situations from which it is possible to draw and the planetary popularity of the elements in question. To tell the truth, this Sonoma production limits itself more than anything else to carrying out its task without exploiting such a potential too much, which is undoubtedly a pity, despite the basic mechanics of the clashes and the management of the characters are all in all well structured. The game can be downloaded for free and contains microtransactions applied in the now most widespread way, with two different currency systems that allow the purchase of various in-game items, both linked to the possible disbursement of money to speed up spending possibilities. The most invasive element is given by the energy that is spent for each single fight and which, once exhausted, forces you to wait several minutes to get the recharge or speed up the process by buying new energy cells with gold, but in any case this is not a particularly perverse system. Donald and Scrooge challenge Amelia and her army to the sound of cards Paper Donald Duck The game limits itself to proposing a series of clashes in succession (about 80 to start with, barring further additions that are almost certain) interspersed with the possibility of managing one's characters and applying any upgrades, but most of the time we spend on the battlefield, with a narrative progression equal to practically zero. The clash takes place in turns between the party in our control and the enemies and is based on the choice of cards to use taken from one's deck, with three possible extractions for each turn before passing the hand to the opponents. The cards are generally divided into physical attacks, special abilities and modifiers, the latter capable of generating momentary defenses or increases in attack power, or of canceling the opponent's bonuses, the aim is to deplete the hit points of the opponents and thus clear the battlefield. The mechanism is basic but well thought out, with a good amount of cards to unlock which, although they are not reflected in many different game situations, offer at least assorted animations and a certain strategic depth especially in the reasoned use of modifiers, which often represent the cardinal elements for victory. There are dozens and dozens of battles placed one after the other and separated by rare dialogues with Archimedes and a few other characters, in a frankly rather incomplete narrative substratum, which relies above all on some beautiful intermission screens and short and banal exchanges of jokes at the start of the fights. Even the playable characters that can be unlocked (Paperinik, Paperinika and the like) do not expand the controllable party that much, except of course for any and probable additions applied later by Disney. A good idea, on the other hand, is the introduction of role-playing elements that allow you to increase the protagonists' statistics by investing the diamonds collected in fights in the transition to successive experience levels, which unlock new cards for the deck and improve the attack and defense characteristics of the player. character. It is a basic management of the characters, which however withit helps to create a sense of progression that would otherwise be almost totally missing, and expands the game solutions with the new cards, the lifeblood of such a game. It goes without saying that a large part of The Duckforce Rises' charm and identity obviously derives from the Disney characterization, with well-modeled and animated 3D characters and excellent 2D illustrations placed between the clashes. Precisely from this point of view, however, more could certainly have been done, building a slightly more structured story and with a minimum of dialogue and perhaps some cutscenes.", "date": "2015-10-28", "grade": "6.5"}
