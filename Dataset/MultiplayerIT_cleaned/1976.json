{"name": "This is Football 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/this-is-football-2004.html", "text": "The game modes After starting our PlayStation 2, accompanied by the song ~In my shoes?~ (Kirsty MacColl/Pete Glenister) we will be able to enjoy the presentation in which a series of game actions are shown: from overhead kicks to headers to get to spectacular saves. Unfortunately the computer graphics do not make the beauty of the presentation as PES and Fifa manage to get thanks to the really wonderful and well-maintained introductory films. Once the loading is finished we will find ourselves in the main menu where we will be able to choose between various options. The game possibilities are really very varied, we will be able to choose to undertake a Friendly, a Season (choosing from one of the 15 national leagues present in the game), a Competition (World Cup, European Cup, America's Cup...) or choose Career mode (you will start by taking a young school team and participating in the championship for schools, if you arrive first you will be able to access the semi-professional league and subsequently the minor leagues of the national leagues). Thanks to the Timewarp mode we will be able to play competitions against the biggest names in football history and also if we want to compare ourselves with other TIF 2003 fans, we will be able to choose the Challenge mode in which each game we play will be judged with a score that will vary according to the goals , of the technical gestures, of the fouls and of the mistakes we make; subsequently we will be given a code which must be entered on the official site (https://www.tif2003.com) where a scoreboard with the world records of all TIF2003 enthusiasts will be viewable. Still in the main menu, it will be possible to view a fifteen-minute interview with Fabio Cannavaro by Bruno Longhi, commentator on TIF 2003, in which the Inter star will answer various questions about football and videogames. Kick off... Once we have made our choices, it will be time to take the field. At first glance, we will realize the immediacy of the management of the commands: the shot, the slide, the tackle, etc. they are supported by some combinations and classy strokes such as the double step, the quickturn and the triangulation. When we run, the first major graphic flaw of TIF 2003 will immediately catch the eye: the small size of the field. The playing surface is not proportional to the size of the players and their speed, and the actions will be proposed frantically from one side of the screen to the other, leaving little room for the geometry of the schemes. The passing system is very intuitive but too perfect, through convenient arrows that will appear on the screen we will know the position of our teammates on the field and we will hardly miss the pass. Another negative side of playability is the total homogeneity of the players in knowing how to play the ball. It is difficult for the ball to come off the ball carrier's foot, and it is possible through two passes to get directly to the goal and shoot. Unlike the various Fifa and PES, there is no loading bar for power, but depending on how long we press the button, a more or less powerful shot will be made. Except for the goalkeepers who too often perform Superman-like flights saving the impossible, the player animations are very realistic, highlighting the developers' effort to improve the game's realism. Furthermore, scoring from a bicycle kick or header will be all too simple, thanks to the perfect crosses that any player will be able to make. Free kicks and corner kicks are managed in the Fifa way, via a directional arrow that we can load with the shot button and that at least the undersigned has not yet learned to use after playing Fifa for years. At the end of each match we will also have a complete picture of all the transfer market buy/sell requests. In this way we will be able to buy any player and add him to our squad of champions, or sell a valuable price of our team to lighten the company's debts. TIF 2003 comes with a transfer mode that is better than the various PES or FIFA and ~close~ (metaphorically speaking...) to the various PC Calcio and Scudetto. Sound and graphics Despite having licensed thousands upon thousands of footballer and team names, the Sony team developers were unable to implement the original team shirts featured in TIF 2003. Only the most famous players will feature real facial features, and most of them will have faces that are completely different from reality (an example is Totti...). As gAs previously mentioned, the animations in the game have been well cared for, the players move fluidly, the movements are well coordinated and the replays are very nice to watch. Unfortunately, however, there will be only two cameras available (one lateral and one central) with close, medium and far shots. There are about ten stadiums in the game, all with great attention to detail, such as the smoke bombs coming from the stands or the flags waved by the fans. Leaving aside the graphic aspect, let's go to judge the sound. The sound effects on the pitch are very realistic, we will hear players celebrating for a goal or despair when they miss a shot. Bruno Longhi's commentary is very professional, sharp and realistic; if in PES the commentator's voice got really annoying after a while, in TIF 2003 you won't run that risk. Conclusions Sony has once again managed to vastly improve its football simulation. Although with some shortcomings in playability and graphics, TIF 2003 presents itself as a good title dedicated to the world of football, proposing itself at Fifa levels, but still remaining far from the realism of Pro Evolution Soccer. The game is totally localized in Italian, with lots of interesting options and a huge database of players and teams. Bruno Longhi's comments and the soundtrack provide a happy background to a discreet football simulation. If you want to try a cross between the monotonous Fifa and the superlative PES, This is Football 2003 could be for you, managing to surprise even the veterans of football simulations. Pros: Lots of game options to choose from Sound effects and commentary by Bruno Longhi Transfer management Cons: Playability still to be improved Field too small compared to the proportions of the players Graphics and animations to be improved A bit of history... A few days after the release of the long-awaited Pro Evolution Soccer 2, Sony re-proposes its football simulation in the 2003 version; we are talking about This is Football 2003. This is Football was published for the first time in 1999 by Team Soho, whose ambition was to create a football game capable of effectively simulating the technical aspects of this sport, rather than creating yet another arcade title. Made for PlayStation, TIF (we'll call it that from now on) could boast over 230 teams present and 20 real competitions included. The teams and leagues could be customized to your liking by inserting and editing the names of the teams and players present. Only the following year, with the publication of This is Football 2, Team Soho managed to create a title with appreciable playability for a veteran of football simulations. TIF 2 offered a faster and more challenging game, with even more teams and a Season mode. In 2002 TIF 2002 was released for PlayStation 2 and marked the definitive consecration of the game as the third pole in football simulations (after PES and Fifa). The development team this time had focused on realism in the expressions of the players, stadiums and atmospheric effects and had once again improved the gameplay by making the passing system more intuitive and with more animations. In the following lines, we will discover together what the brand new This is Football 2003 looks like...", "date": "2002-10-17", "grade": null}
