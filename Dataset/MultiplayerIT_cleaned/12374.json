{"name": "Undercity", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/undercity.html", "text": "Breakpoint Games tries to make up for this lack with Undercity, through a simple and immediate mechanic that allows us to immediately board our subway and transport passengers from one stop to another within six major cities of the world. The game control system is based on the pressure of only three buttons: 2 (or the UP arrow of the joystick) to accelerate, 8 (or the DOWN arrow of the joystick) to brake and 5 (or the FIRE button of the joystick) to open and close the doors. The progress of the matches is rather linear: you have to follow a predefined route in a straight line, with a variable number of stations. It is necessary to respect each stop precisely and in a timely manner, keeping an eye on the clock on the display: delays cost money, but so do early arrivals. Numerous passengers enter and exit at each stop, bringing into our coffers the money needed to try their hand at upgrading the vehicle (improving speed, brakes, efficiency of the doors) or to buy a plane ticket that will take us to the next city. Once you become familiar with the response to the commands, you manage to reach a good level of precision and earn good money, and it is precisely when everything seems under control that something unexpected happens: you end up involved in a shooting or the victims of a terrorist attack... in this sense, Undercity reserves a certain number of surprises that can easily shatter our dreams of glory and result in a game over. On a technical level, Undercity doesn't work miracles but it offers nice and functional graphics and sound. The music (which can be activated or not at startup) shows off catchy and well-paced melodies, which manage to entertain and cheer the atmosphere as happened in the era of 80s computer games. As far as the graphics are concerned, each city is characterized by different fantasies as regards the construction of the stations, where the passengers do not change in appearance (although boasting a certain variety in the typologies) and the movement of the metro is almost devoid of dynamism due to the of slow and artistically uninspired vertical scrolling.
