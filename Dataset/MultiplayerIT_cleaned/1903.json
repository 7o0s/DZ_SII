{"name": "Paradise Lost", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/paradise-lost-recensione.html", "text": "Just a few days ago we told you about Projekt Riese, a historical fact that actually happened during the Second World War and how it was the basis of inspiration for the PolyAmorous guys in the development of Paradise Lost. Today we are here instead to tell you about our experience after embarking on a mysterious journey inside the dystopian bunkers located under Lower Silesia. Yes, because Projekt Riese was never completed by the Nazis, while Paradise Lost proposes a future in which everything we know no longer exists and the war did not end as we remember. We're ready to give you our final judgment then, in our Paradise Lost PC review. Tunnel of emotions Paradise Lost: the bunker rooms This review, for the writer, is truly one of the most complex that he has had to work on in recent years. You will therefore excuse us if we take a few lines to give you a premise which, however, we consider necessary. Looking at a title from a mere technical point of view is wrong, there are many aspects that distinguish a work and relying solely on one of them to complete a judgment is clearly wrong and we won't do it today. Yet, as a provocation, we throw this stone into the pond waiting for the reverberation of the waves. Can a video game be judged as such if it does not include a playful component? And in the same way, can pressing a lever about ten times in about five hours of adventure be considered a playful component? Finally, can a title that is openly inspired by a certain genre of video games be considered part of that genre if it does not embrace any of its fundamental pillars? Paradise Lost: A Broken World Szymon is a child who has lost everything. The fault lies with the adults, as always. Adults attracted by power, by money, blinded by hatred towards what we don't know, towards those we don't know. The game of power is a sneaky game, which often envelops even those who would not have wanted to enter that game or should not have. Szymon is a child who has lost everything, even his mother and he can't rest for this. Szymon is the child you will take on the role of and with whom you will try to accept the loss of the only person who in that world of big and mean, tried to keep him safe. The journey will take you through the ruins of a dystopian world, a world which does not exist, but which could have been. America did not intervene in the Second World War immediately, Hitler completed the Giant Project, moved the population there and launched an atomic attack that brought almost the entire planet to its knees. Inside and outside the bunkers, desolation spread and chaos began to reign. However, ruining your trip is not our intention and therefore we leave the rest of the plot to your discovery. And this is precisely the strongest point of Paradise Lost: the ideas, the narrative. PolyAmorous has chosen a complex theme, a difficult topic and has transposed it with love, an aspect that often exudes in the various moments in which you will delve into the story. Szymon's journey in accepting his mourning is intertwined with the story of what happened inside those tunnels and those walls. This will be what will keep you going and in some cases turning a blind eye to what Paradise Lost is not. The technical and playful question Paradise Lost: one of the rooms The initial provocation obviously hides concrete references to what we found ourselves playing. Paradise Lost is a beautiful and evocative (as well as touching) narrative journey. But here the description ends. Paradise Lost could be defined as a walking simulator that reduces player interaction to historic lows, relegating it to buttons, levers and small interactions with machinery and nothing more. The inspiration revealed, also glimpsed in the trailers, to works such as Firewatch, What Remains of Edith Finch, but also to the more recent Call of the Sea is not to be taken into consideration in the slightest. For example, the depth of the Firewatch connection or the structure of the Call of the Sea puzzles are missing. A real playful component is missing, understood as player interactivity. Paradise Lost looks like a great museum visit, a warning not to forget what can happen when man tries to replace something or someone greater than him, but nothing more. Paradise Lost is therefore a different work, difficult to place within a genre (the walking simulator itself is a title that does not quite fit) which aims to awaken sensations, emotions within the players, but which in many cases it could even be boring. Paradise Lost: lots of exploration The technical question is then one of the most thorny. From one paIn fact, we have the artistic side of the game: inspired, scenically well thought out and full of interesting ideas, consistent with what the Giant Project was. On the other hand, however, we find a deeply imperfect title, poorly optimized and full of problems. We knew that the budget wasn't huge, yet the trailers and what had been shown hadn't struck us in a negative sense at first glance. During our test we tested the title with the frame rate locked at 60fps (it is also possible to leave the title without the lock but this often resulted in very heavy drops and problems) and Ultra quality in all aspects. Despite this, the title in certain phases (often in correspondence with the background loading of the new areas) suffered drastic drops in frames up to freezing for a few seconds and ferocious jerks when collecting objects or opening doors and suitcases. Also problematic is the management of numerous textures and some reflections in the glass. Nothing that maybe can't be fixed in the future, but in the current state, even if we remind ourselves of the independent production of the title, aspects remain too impeding in the fruition of the work. Paradise Lost: The Outside World Before concluding our review, it is therefore right to give you our response to the initial provocation. Paradise Lost is a work worthy of respect, a story that must exist, for the simple fact that if the videogame medium wants to evolve, it is right that it tries to experiment with new paths, that it embraces new ideas and pushes its limits ever higher . In a period in which the crisis of creative ideas has been amplified by the global pandemic, it is right that works of this kind try to move the small pebbles that could cause a landslide (creative of course). Starting from historical events, trying to innovate through metaphors closed inside and outside (also through surrounding elements such as comics, documents, etc.) of the video game, telling a story in a personal way, must be the norm. Those who however, in our opinion, two fundamental pillars must be respected: first of all, the lucidity of not taking the longest step and secondly, respect for the playful component. If from the first point of view the problem is that of not succeeding in one's creative and innovative intent, due to the poor technical level which impairs its use. On the other hand, the player must necessarily be guaranteed a minimum of playful and interactivity aspects that cannot be questioned, since the work in question is a video game regardless of the drift chosen in terms of genre and ideas.", "date": "2021-03-27", "grade": "6.0"}
