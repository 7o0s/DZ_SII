{"name": "For Honor: Marching Fire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/for-honor-marching-fire-recensione-dlc.html", "text": "For Honor hasn't had it easy. Since the day of the launch, some development-related choices have led the community to fall apart and abandon the servers rather quickly, only to then occasionally return to check the situation with the various updates. Unfortunately, unlike the powerful Rainbow Six: Siege, the recovery work by Ubisoft did not have the desired effect and not even the arrival of the new fighters or the long-awaited dedicated servers managed to restore a particularly complex situation. For our part, however, we have never stopped keeping the title under our arms, partly because the combat system has always been lively and exciting and partly because, let's face it, it would be crazy not to love a production where knights, Vikings and samurai they sound right on them. In a market therefore used to having everything immediately, being able to keep the reins of such a courageous project is not for everyone and Ubisoft is really trying in every way by spending resources and energy where others would have already raised the white flag. The results are there for all to see and today, with the arrival of the new Marching Fire expansion, players have an excellent, new reason to give the title a second chance. Here come the Chinese! In case you haven't had enough of ninjas, knights with flails or huge bare-chested men wielding two-handed swords, Chinese Wu Lin troops join the For Honor brawl. A move that is not easy to digest for the Western public - also because even more charismatic fighting breeds could have been drawn from the basket - but perhaps, with a view to relaunching the project, also relying on the Eastern market could be the move to save goat and cabbage. Here then it is not surprising to see four new fighters for this faction on the servers, sold in a single package or purchasable, as always, with the classic steel currency. What struck us most could only be the Shaolin monk, armed with a stick and equipped with equipment that makes him look impressively like the legend of Son Goku, the king of the monkeys. With the ability to teleport while jumping and suddenly interrupting his combos he is one of the most fascinating and unpredictable new warriors and in the right hands we can assure you that he is a terrible killing machine. Nuxia, on the other hand, is the group's killer: fast and ruthless, she vaguely recalls the peacemaker in her movements but, no small thing, Ubisoft has been decidedly skilled in always knowing how to give a style and a soul of its own to all twenty-two warriors present in the roster, and this time too things went no differently. Tiandi and Jiang Jun, on the other hand, seem to have come straight out of any Dynasty Warriors, catapulted by the tales of the Three Kingdoms and now embroiled in an ageless and endless battle. Obviously, it is useless to go into detail on the moves, styles and new special skills of these four warriors, so it is enough for you to know that their purchase, for those who love the oriental tradition, is obviously recommended. Obviously the differentiation from other armies is not bad, with the Chinese warriors basing their styles on mobility and dodging, also capable of great damage in counterattack and very particular energy management. In short, excellent introductions that make it clear how much space there is still for experimentation on For Honor and how much, if desired, the game can be further expanded in the coming years. Complete changes to all equipment The thing that surprised us the most about this update, however, was the complete redesign of the loadouts. Features have been eliminated altogether, replaced in a similar way by Privileges: instead of increasing attack, damage or penetration each piece of equipment will now grant a specific amount of score for the individual Privileges and leave the player complete freedom to what concerns the customization of the builds of the various heroes. Privileges basically work like Call of Duty perks, by grafting passive abilities onto characters. Some will receive a speed bonus, others will allow you to absorb an additional amount of damage if you are close to death, revive teammates faster, or still receive health shields after exiting Revenge mode. It will be interesting to see over the coming months how these combinations affect balance, especially with the addition of new pieces or even new Privileges, which could revolutionize builds from time to time. Obviously, with Marching Fire there are dozens of new equips, also for theold characters, as well as for the Chinese faction, as well as aesthetic customization with objects to be obtained also through the completion of the new training sessions now completely revised and much, much more in-depth. In short, an excellent work in many respects, including the war between factions with a clearer and more readable interface for sending troops and reinforcements. A huge amount of content The arrival of Marching Fire also marks the appearance of two new game modes, very interesting and particularly successful. So let's start with the PvP that represents the quintessence of For Honor. Two teams of four players will have to fight each other on a fairly large map and complete a siege. One team will be on the defense while one will attack, having to escort a ram through several checkpoints by breaking through defensive gates. It works much like Overwatch's Payload mode with a dash of strategy stolen from the MOBA genre. Waves of minions from both sides will attempt to damage or protect the ram, and players will need to thin out the AI-controlled warriors to allow their side to gain an advantage. There are also bosses to defeat to obtain temporary bonuses and a final fight against the commander of the fortress which essentially represents the Core of the opposing base. Crossbows and archers are also placed on the course so as not to transform the games into a mere confusing battle, a choice that we appreciate as it adds that extra bit of strategy that never hurts. The attackers will then have a series of return tickets to protect, so as to avoid ignorant head-down charges until the objective is reached. The only drawback of this mode is probably the duration, with the most balanced games that can last even for half an hour of play. Applause goes to the new matchmaking system which now not only matches players before the match but also automatically mixes teams during the various rounds, so as to find a perfect balance between the teams and offer matches that are the most exciting possible. The second mode, on the other hand, is trivially called Arcade and is an interesting content but with particular accessibility. Let's start by saying that this specific option is only available to those who have purchased the entire expansion and for now there are no plans to separate it from the package. This is a pity because Arcade is simple but interesting and, in its own way, virtually infinite: in this mode you can choose your favorite fighter and throw yourself into a series of five randomly generated fights of increasing difficulty with different buffs and debuffs to spice up the matches. Fun and above all useful since the progress and experience accumulated will be shared with the PvP profile allowing you to experiment with tactics and strategies in peace and then throw yourself online with the already higher level character. Finally, there are improvements to the graphics engine, which now features improved lighting effects and even more defined textures.", "date": "2018-10-24", "grade": "8.0"}
