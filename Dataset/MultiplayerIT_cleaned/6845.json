In this period of time we have also got used to Bayonetta's new haircut, to the point of appreciating it more than the original: the protagonist has not lost an iota of her sensuality, her sarcasm and her wickedness in the service of good, with the latex suit capable of transforming and summoning demons, dizzying heels and blows of all kinds to accompany the most spectacular combos. But beyond all this, it is the gameplay and the contents that take the lion's share in this spectacular action. Nintendo saw us right by supporting Platinum Games and leaving a handful of crumbs to other producers who will never see Bayonetta 2 on different platforms. Its protagonist can be considered as the female counterpart of Dante from Devil May Cry: she is physically and athletically exaggerated, she always has a ready joke, she performs in fights and in situations bordering on the surreal. And in fact, as soon as the story begins, the game throws an exaggerated chaos in the face: a battle in the sky against angels full of explosions that is repeatedly interrupted by larger opponents who literally shatter the scenario and in which it is possible to familiarize yourself with the system of control, without worrying about life energy. After this riot of colors, Bayonetta finds herself in the prologue while shopping in New York with the known (by those who played the first chapter) Enzo, Jeanne and Rodin: at a certain point some Jets that should have been there for a parade create the chaos and attack the population. After seeing Bayonetta literally kicking a plane to keep it from crashing into a building, an interlude sequence starts during which everything happens, and which has also dispelled any of our doubts in terms of adaptation and censorship: the bad words abound and the protagonist winks continuously, a peculiar feature since the first chapter. Bayonetta returns to Wii U with a spectacular exclusive destined to be the envy of many Bayonetta dance The essence of the predecessor has remained intact, including the long surreal interlude sequences already mentioned, which have been lightened by the frankly accessory Quick Time component: Bayonetta 2 also speaks of angels and demons, light and darkness, while humans represent chaos. The free will of the latter has always been a double-edged sword, but also an advocate of the possibility of creating one's own destiny without submitting to rules written by others, often in blood. To fight the enemies, the protagonist performs a sensual kiss that opens the portal to purgatory, within which the opponents are visible and humans can only see the effects of the destruction resulting from the clashes. The combat system does not differ from the previous chapter, but we refresh it for the new followers of the Platinum Games action title. Bayonetta has two pistols planted in her heels that can be used with the Y key of the GamePad and at the end of other combos; with X it is possible to deliver the punches (or use the main weapon), with A the kicks and with the B key perform the single and double jump.  Combos feature several keystrokes as you would expect from the genre, including those with the lower left backbone ZL, while pirouettes can be performed with the left analog. The most spectacular combinations always end with a punch or a heel strike generated by the suit of the protagonist (who in the meantime remains half-naked), and for this reason they are the most lethal. By delivering the collected gold LPs to Rodin at the gates of Hell, it is possible to obtain new weapons such as, for example, Rakshasa swords, much more effective than the butt of the pistol with fists and capable of releasing devastating combos, or whips, bows and others that we will not reveal to you to leave the pure taste of discovery. However, the protagonist of the combat system is represented by ZR, the lower right back, which activates the dodge: if performed at the precise moment in which the enemy launches the attack, it allows activating the so-called temporal Sabbath, which slows down the action for a few moments, with all the benefits of the case. Its use is not trivial and it is also what made the first chapter exceptional: once you have acquired a certain familiarity it is possible to literally dance the main protagonist from one enemy to anothertro, in an endless sequence of spectacular and destructive combos. After a certain number of successful hits, a special bar fills up (Apotheosis of Umbra) which activates the inner strength of the protagonist and here too all hell happens on the screen between the shots of the heroine and those of her opponents. Another key element of Bayonetta is the extreme spectacularity and the succession of events on the screen: in the prologue alone we had to fight a running enemy while it was destroying the Brooklyn bridge, then we danced in flight between jets and rubble, to finally get to fight another boss together with Jeanne and tear it apart with the demonic inner strength released by the main protagonist. Which then turned against her! A sort of dragon with a tail that enveloped a skyscraper and that we fought in flight thanks to Bayonetta's wings, while between counterattacks and special moves, the scenario fell apart. Each chapter of the game is divided into verses, each of which gives a rating and a certain number of Halos based on its performance - just like in the prequel - which can be spent in the Gates of Hell on skills, weapons, items and treasures. The game can be played alternatively with touch controls for a more casual experience; the difficulty levels are called apotheosis and are three, with the fourth, called infinite apotheosis, which does not allow activating the Temporal Sabbat and is unlocked once you have completed the game at the highest level. Even if, as mentioned, the combat system is practically identical to its predecessor, there are some innovations both in terms of events and setting. The events around Bayonetta also lead the protagonist to Hell to save Jeanne, and therefore during the sixteen chapters of the adventure it will be possible to face real demons, who release dark crystals which in any case have the same function of increasing the number of collected Halos. In different sections of the game Bayonetta will not be alone during the fight, a configuration that increases the spectacularity and the possibility of accessing even more devastating combos (sublimated by the Double Apotheosis mode, on which we will return later), as well as justifying the narrative moments i which are slimmer than the original chapter but equally explanatory and spectacular. Some chapters are dedicated entirely to boss fights, and to call them crazy is an understatement: only God of War 3 has reached such levels of spectacularity, with a graphic style perhaps even more epic, and in Bayonetta 2, fighting an enemy means facing him in multiple configurations, in the air or on the ground, while the scenario is devastated and the enemy throws everything at the protagonist. Other chapters offer pleasant variations on the theme and are also homage to SEGA and Nintendo classics such as Space Harrier and Starfox, such as when the protagonist is on a Jet, complete with a scope to kill enemies from a distance. The same thing applies to the costumes: for the cost of an important number of halos it is possible to dress the main protagonist, and some of her supporting actors, in the most disparate ways, including the Starfox suit complete with tail. At this juncture, the lock sight of the enemies also changes, which from the typical kiss switches to a green square, and the color of the shots, truly representing an aesthetic incentive to change when facing sections of higher difficulty again or to improve the score. There is no shortage of references to the original title and various directly connected events: the same transformation into a panther of the protagonist and more pronounced exploration sections, including those underwater, arrive almost immediately, and there is no shortage of chapters where there are various secrets and exploration to collect items such as the famous lollipops that restore energy and increase attack and defense, or chests that can give away items to increase energy and vitality. To play and replay From a technical point of view, Bayonetta 2 is certainly equipped with a better graphics sector than its predecessor, especially in terms of management of light sources, variety of some scenarios and particle effects. You love or hate the artistic system, but it is undoubtedly of fine workmanship with the Angels and Demons who have a baroque style between the disturbed and the surreal that we like so much. The title developed by Platinum Games is even more alive, and although we are in the middle of a new generation of pumped consoles and PCs, we have been delighted on more than one occasion by the combination of graphics plus fine work that distinguishes the glimpses within the chapters, with a visual distance perfect, ever-moving scenery, for example clouds full of rain in the distance and in general a very inspired representation of hell, heaven and the real world and always full of detail. Among the many moments to remember there is the one with a sort of royal palace surrounded by a water garden and an imposing mountain in the background, or the enormous series of tunnels that lead up to the mouth of fire where the queen of hell resides . The response to the commands is perfect and the title runs for good stretches at sixty frames per second; the biggest drops are curiously in the interlude sequences, but this is also because they are often out of whack both in terms of directing and happenings. The image remains a bit dirty especially in some situations where it is more contrasted, but we are undoubtedly faced with one of the most beautiful titles to see on Wii U, and promoted with full marks from this point of view. The sound system follows the lines of the graphic one, the music is inspired and rousing based on the action that is proposed, there are some famous songs licensed and it is possible to select between English and Japanese dubbing - excellent for genre purists - with the choice of subtitles in Italian. We completed Bayonetta 2 in about twelve hours, but like the first chapter, stopping here means not exploiting the full potential of this action: the strength of the Platinum Games title is that of having a system that leads to improve and replay the levels in order to obtain a higher grade and more Halos to unlock all the extras present, which is impossible after a single game. There are accessories to buy, which allow you to perfect your technique and perhaps obtain Pure Platinum without being touched, there are techniques that allow you to ring in even more devastating combos, there is halos to accumulate for all costumes, there it's the sheer pleasure of revisiting the story at a higher difficulty level, such is the beauty of the combat system. Crows to collect and spells to unlock, or an in-game achievement system, are other small incentives; once the title is finished, you enter the Gallery, which offers a huge series of extras including the jukebox of all the music, backgrounds, characters, 3D models of all the bosses, vehicles, angel demons and main characters ... we can already imagine close-ups on Bayonetta and Jeanne, we did it too. To seal replayability and longevity there is the Double Apotheosis mode, which can be accessed from the main menu: on the initial screen it is possible to search for another player online, invite a friend or play offline with the help of the CPU. At this point you select the character to control (initially there are Bayonetta and Jeanne, but not only) and the equipment in terms of costume, weapons and accessories from those available. In the menu there are all the cards that have been unlocked and those not yet obtained: you have to choose six in succession and successfully complete them to obtain rewards such as costumes and halos to spend on further upgrades. There is also a rank associated with your performance: every six verses you get points that serve to increase in level, from D up to S+. We played both online with some other journalists and with the computer: in the challenges played there were bosses, enemies and glimpses of the setting from the single player, the energy was also kept between one card and another until the completion of the sixth. These challenges require a lot of skill and mastery of the combat system but they are interesting and the fact of being able to play them in two increases the fun and the need for coordination, therefore they represent the sublimation of the combat system and a further incentive to return to the game.", "date": "2014-10-13", "grade": "S.V."}
