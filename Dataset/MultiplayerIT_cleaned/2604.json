{"name": "Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/desperados-wanted-dead-or-alive.html", "text": "Long live 2D, down with GeForce3 Let's start by describing the skeleton of the game and then the graphics engine. Lovers of 3D and super-accelerated graphics cards don't puff, but Desperados uses a 2D engine. Logical choice and with which I fully agree, also because, as you can see from the screens present, the settings and the characters are really visually beautiful. The scenarios are many and all very different: we go from the cotton fields of the first mission, to large cities, fortresses, gold mines, streams, prisons, caves... The game takes place both during the day and at night (even with rain), and the different light conditions greatly influence the development of the action. Although the graphics are 2d, you don't have to fear little interaction with the setting. Thanks to complex mappings, 2D is made three-dimensional: you can hide by crouching behind a fence, avoid being seen by an enemy on a balcony by passing close to the wall below, shoot through cracks in the walls. When you throw dynamite or other objects, the preview trajectory will appear and it's amazing how realistic the rebound calculation is. So yes 2d graphics, but mediated by a substantially 3d game structure. The interaction with the environment doesn't stop there: you can enter buildings and exit other doors, saddle horses and mount them (even hook up another one to carry two at the same time), take found equipment, climb, spy inside doors, unlock the locked doors, hide in the shadows and destroy obstacles (these are only a small part of the possibilities). Of course you won't be able to rotate the map, but on the other hand even owners of ~old~ computers will be able to play this masterpiece (declared minimum system: P233 megahertz, 64 mb RAM, no 3D accelerator graphics card necessary... HURRY!)(however in the maps full of enemies at the maximum resolution 1024 you could see some small slowdowns, nothing to worry about since the optimal resolution is, in my opinion, 800*600). The only flaw found is the impossibility of seeing enemies and our characters when they are ~behind~ a structure (a pity that the ~transparency~ option has been implemented for these cases). Definition of intelligence The other point, as important as it is thorny, is the interaction with the other CHARACTERS present in the game. It is interesting to note that in this category there are not only the usual enemies of all types (Mexicans, US ARMY soldiers, outlaws and cowboys), but also unsuspecting passers-by of all races and genders (who will not hesitate to throw a spanner in your : the women will scream when they see lifeless bodies, others as soon as they see you will indicate your position to the guards, while others will stay calm and peaceful). Fundamental rule present in all missions is the need not to kill civilians, this does not mean that you can stun them, tie them up and hide them in some dark cavern of the map.. UAZ UAZ... so you learn to be spies!). Another series of characters are the animals, which we will have to take into account in the maximum degree (as already written in the preview, a group of crows that take off could ruin your ~stealth~ tactic. In addition to crows, there are dogs , alligators, pigs and chickens. However, maximum attention to the military: let's see what they are capable of. Each enemy has a dozen parameters (hidden from the user) such as intelligence, courage, sense of duty, shooting accuracy, resistance, reflexes and resistance to alcohol (as you meet them you will learn which enemies to fear the most and their weaknesses). fixed, others still stay inside the houses ready to intervene in case of need. One of the most important tools of the game is the telescope that will allow you to study the visual cone of the enemies. As in Commandos, if a soldier should see you or discover a corpse of a partner, the visual cone would go from yellow to orange, his attention would increase and his movements would become much faster. An effective tactic is to make yourself seen and followed, while your other companions are hidden ready to ambush you. Your opponents do their duty, even if their greatest strength is the number and in advanced levels the speed of reflexes and shooting accuracy (in fact, in the first levels you may not be perfect in your military actions, but in the following ones a misstep will mean certain death). Perhapsa flaw of the game is this: in the final levels the enemies are excessively strong and with a single shot they will kill you, without giving your team the opportunity to return fire. I'm starting to say it already from here; the game is extremely difficult, maybe not on Commandos levels, but don't expect a family game. Sometimes you will have to repeat an action many times before you achieve the desired effect. This difficulty could frustrate players who lack patience, while teasing the most aggressive (at the end of each level the satisfaction is really a lot!). The sound Other positive notes! Typical music from the world of the west, ~high noon~ sonorities will immerse you in the climate in a very convincing way. Some musical themes are really beautiful and will remain in your mind a bit like the tunes of Monkey Island (the music occupies a good part of the CD: 42 minutes of soundtrack in wav). Realistic sound effects and excellent voice dubbing (in English in my version) of the characters, as well as excellent is the vocal characterization of each member of your team (the characters are stereotyped at the right point, their phrases and dialogues will make you smile every time) . The care put into the creation of the game (born from the work of the German Spellbound Software) is maniacal and the result is visible from the first minutes of the game (the introductory movie, very long, is a show of 3D graphics and skilful direction). How I screw enemies Six are the characters that you will control during the game, even if as mentioned, they will be encountered progressively. Each character, in addition to having certain characteristics of speed, resistance, aim (etc etc) can perform 5 customized actions. Let's see what it is. The first custom action of each element is the ability to use a pistol or shotgun (or poison arrows for the little Chinese girl). Everyone has their own different weapon. Often it will be necessary to resort to other techniques to defeat the enemy: John Cooper, the leading character, will be able to punch, use the knife to throw or stab him and finally use a small timed music box that will distract the enemies. Samuel Williams, the little negro (my favorite), in addition to using a very useful rifle, will be able to throw sticks of dynamite (they are not always available, however), tie up stunned enemies, use a snake (I won't tell you what it is for) and use barrels of dynamite to blow up (usually to remove large obstacles). Doc McCoy, the doctor, will be able to use a sniper rifle, launch vials that stun enemies, heal himself and others and double himself (through a trick that I won't reveal). Kate O'Hara on her side can throw cards on the ground to distract and attract enemies, use a mirror to blind, use her charm to distract guards and kick (I don't want to know where she kicks, but I assure you they do very bad). Saanchez, the Mexican, is the biggest and in addition to being able to carry 2 bodies at a time, he can get enemies drunk, hide under his siesta hat, use a bat (not baseball, but almost) and throw stones. The last character is Mia Yung, a little Chinese accompanied by her monkey, who will be able to distract enemies, throw flash bombs, use a flute to attract the attention of soldiers and shoot needles with a blowgun that drive enemies crazy. Each action can be programmed, so that it is performed at the simple push of a button. This feature, combined with the fact that each character will be able to set his ~fast~ action, will allow you to synchronize and succeed in the most complex strategies. However, the game is very ~action~ and it will often be essential to be quick to shoot or hide by clicking in the right place at the right time. Let's draw conclusions As already mentioned, the game is extremely difficult and you will have to use savegames often (after each action, that's my advice). The missions are really many and all differentiated in a surprising and exciting way. The net time to finish a mission of the first levels is about an hour, but counting the saves, tests and re-tries, in an evening of play you will be able to pass a mission at most (if not less). The storyline is captivating and the cutscenes are really well done. Taking into account the differentiation of the characters and missions, the fun and longevity of the game is guaranteed to fans of the genre (waiting for Commandos2 to come out). For all the others, I repeat that the game is decidedly difficult, perhaps less frustrating than Commandos (the difficulty grows during the game, don't expect impossible things right away). Some flaws can be noted (the lack of different levels of difficulty for example, to say the last), but overall this title deserves special attention. If you are still undecided, download the demo and try your hand at a mission (note well: the demo mission is not included in the 25 of the game). For a bunch of dollars 25 levels full of enemies will lead you to a unique duel. You will face nothing but... Calm calm, let's start at the beginning. ~Desperados - Wanted Dead or Alive~ is a real-time strategy game, set in the Far West, which puts you at the helm of 6 characters (the increase in the number of companions will be gradual: in the first missions you will guide only one, and then join to the very nice Samuel Williams and the others as the story goes on). The style of play is very similar to that already seen in Commandos (for those who don't know what we're talking about, I will briefly say that it is about moving and giving orders to a character or a group to carry out a series of missions). We have just encountered the first apparent flaw: the decided and for some shameless resemblance to Commandos. I just say two words on the subject: wasn't Half-Life perhaps a half copy of other 3d action? Sure, but that doesn't mean that HL was a great masterpiece. Go on.", "date": "2001-04-23", "grade": null}
