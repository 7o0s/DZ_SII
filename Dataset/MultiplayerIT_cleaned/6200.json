The protagonist of the game is the ninja Kurt the Righteous, and his story literally begins from the end credits: after defeating the final boss and his apprentice, in fact, the bizarre hero in the purple tunic finds himself without memory, and his aim is to retrace backwards his own adventure to understand who he is and why he had to carry out this mission. So a rather interesting start, but which unfortunately loses its charm and charisma over the course of the 42 levels that make up the work, which recently landed on the Nintendo eShop as an exclusive Wii U. Roving Rogue's bizarre backward journey is not fully convincing Rows too short Son of the so-called ~garage game~ trend, Roving Rogue is extremely simplistic right from the options. In the main menu, in fact, the only selectable items are the Story Mode, the local Multiplayer up to four players and the credits; you can't adjust the difficulty level or audio volume either. As specified in the introduction, the game consists of 42 levels, set in six chapters where each of them represents a specific area of the huge castle of the bad guy on duty. Starting from the sixth chapter, we must therefore reach the first, assisted by a map that recalls that of historical Nintendo productions like Super Mario World and Donkey Kong. Naturally, once you have passed a stage, you can replay it whenever you wish to collect the collectibles present, or the so-called ~Amnestatuettes~ - three per level - which will help Kurt completely recover his memory. Each statuette unlocks a portion of the ledger accessible by pressing the + key on the map, which at the beginning of the adventure is full of indecipherable characters. But how exactly does Roving Rogue work? As mentioned, it is a simple two-dimensional platformer, and the player must reach the end of each level (indicated by a red door) by jumping between the various platforms, killing enemies and above all escaping the collapse of the structure. The castle, in fact, was supported by the magical powers of the final boss, and upon his departure, at the beginning of the game, after a couple of levels of acclimatization it literally begins to collapse and to be enveloped by lava. Stages are basically of two genres: vertical scrolling and horizontal scrolling. In the first case we will have to deal with the problem of the lava that chases us undaunted from below, while in the second Kurt has to deal with the walls collapsing from left to right. Speed, ingenuity and sometimes a good dose of patience are the weapons necessary to get the better of each stage, but the protagonist to achieve his goal is also supported by a couple of important skills, namely a short distance teleportation, which represents the real fulcrum of the playful experience, and a move to kill enemies with his wakizashi. Activated with the X and Y keys, the teleportation allows the protagonist to disappear in a cloud of purple smoke and cross the yellow colored walls. The level design is completely built around this skill, and as you progress it will be necessary to study the passable passages more and more carefully and quickly, also complicated by trampolines and portals. As mentioned, it is possible to eliminate the various enemies present, ranging from the goblin armed with a bow and arrow to various types of wizards, such as those who throw balls of fire or ice, passing through knights in red armor who do everything to throw you down from the platforms. To kill enemies, simply touch them from behind or jump over them, however it is precisely in the control system that Roving Rogue shows its side to some critical issues. Sometimes, in fact, even by correctly performing the assault action, the enemies are not eliminated, moreover the precision of the jumps is not millimeter like that of the highly refined Nintendo works, and sometimes it can happen to get literally stuck at the pixels of the edges of the platforms. Not to mention the imprecision in selecting the double distance for teleportation, although fortunately in 99% of cases it is sufficient to use the maximum one. The basic dynamics drag throughout the adventure, and beyond the more advanced levels, sometimes so chaotic that it becomesre frustrating, despite the defects in the control system it is possible to continue expeditiously until the conclusion of the game, facilitated by the absence of game over (there are no lives) and by the presence of numerous checkpoints. It should be emphasized that the ~paddone~, mandatory when playing alone, is not used in any way in its characteristics, outside of being able to play on its small screen. Comb knots Even from a technical point of view, the Padoane Games work does not particularly shine, presenting pixel art graphics that pay homage to the 16-bit era without original artistic flashes. The levels are all a bit similar, and with the exception of the ~final~ ones of the first five worlds, which add a little spice to the basic recipe thanks to the darkness and the immortal ghosts, it seems that the developers have exhausted their own rather quickly inventiveness. The enemies have quite crude animations, and we must also point out that the game even manages to snap in the most chaotic sections, when for example the screen is invaded by sprites. Longevity is between three and four hours, with a couple more to add if you decide to take all the statuettes, while the multiplayer rather than fueling the fun is a catalyst for chaos; the characters, in fact, not overlapping continue to hinder each other, and this translates into continuous departures especially in the stages where the speed of execution is essential. In two, however, the action is still enjoyable and the collection of collectibles is greatly facilitated, given that some make the proverbial seven shirts sweat. We close the technical discussion with a mention of the audio sector: some tunes are nice, while others are damned repetitive and annoying. The sound effects do their job with dignity but without particular merits.", "date": "2015-07-14", "grade": "6.0"}
