Usually when a game passes from a living room console to a portable one, these are heavily retouched or even completely revised versions of the original, due to the need to compromise with often enormously different computing powers. Psp was the first handheld to reverse this trend: strong in hardware with capabilities not far removed from those of the Ps2, the latest addition to Sony has allowed very, very faithful adaptations. But in the vast majority of cases, it didn't add up. Perhaps due to exhausting loading, or simply because the mechanics were expressly designed for use on a home console, resulting forced from a portable point of view. The games on Psp, in this first phase of its life, have largely failed to create an identity of the platform in question, which is a fundamental aspect to decree its success and longevity. Thankfully, today we're talking about something different, namely GTA: Liberty City Stories. It is, as easily understood, the debut of the series on the latest Sony console; a debut actually not entirely new, but not uninteresting for this. Rockstar programmers, with foresight and intelligence, have in fact considered it impossible to create an episode of Grand Theft Auto from scratch in a short time. The idea therefore fell back on using an already existing city and setting, precisely that of the previously mentioned GTA 3, however the scene of a completely new story. As the title suggests, this chapter for PSP takes place in Liberty City, the same that accompanied the success of the debut on Ps2. And when we say the same, we mean exactly identical: same extension, with the 3 communicating islands, same buildings, alleys, roads and available vehicles. This is a truly impressive technical achievement, which once again highlights the skills of the programmers of the Rockstar team. Seeing such a complex and detailed polygonal world run at 30 fps on a laptop is something we frankly never expected just a handful of months ago. Of course, on some occasions there is a bit of pop-up, the frame rate has some drops and maybe some textures appear less detailed, but it is a matter of nitpicking; Liberty City, on PSP, is exactly what we left on Ps2. Incredible. Toni Cipriani i love you As mentioned above, the setting is nothing new. Completely fresh - even if not particularly intriguing - is instead the story, which features a certain Toni Cipriani, a member of the Leone family, as the protagonist. Toni is a boy with rough and direct manners, certainly not very intelligent, forced to do the ~dirty work~ to bring an end to the war between the Leone family, the Sindaccos and the Forellis. Obviously, not a peaceful end... The game structure is exactly the one appreciated on living room consoles; basically, it's about reaching areas marked on the map where, through interaction with a character, you get the assignment for a mission to complete in the best possible way. Don Salvatore, the leader of the Leone family, is also the most important figure among Toni's ~friends~, but certainly not the only one. Faithful to the irreverent style that has always distinguished the series, there is no shortage of characters such as JD O'Toole, a perverted inhabitant of the red light district who will entrust Toni with some very unedifying tasks... and this is just one example. As announced, the mechanics have not undergone any changes, relying mainly on missions to be completed one after the other in order to advance the development of the plot. Aware of the different philosophy of using a portable console compared to a home console, the programmers have well thought of putting a brake and a limit on the complexity and duration of the individual objectives, which in most cases do not require more than a handful of minutes to complete. This relative simplification is by no means a defect, but can even be seen as an advantage since it gives greater balance to the gameplay and makes repeating missions less boring in case of an error. On the contrary, the defects are to be found in the difficulty levels of the missions themselves, at times inconstant with unjustified peaks capable of creating frustration in the player. Fortunately these are rather isolated cases, and in any case it is easy to turn a blind eye thanks to the variety that Rockstar's creatives have been able to guarantee throughout practically the entire adventure. A good offender The control system, much feared egr the absence of two back buttons and an analog stick, has actually been transported to PSP with more than appreciable results. Especially the driving phases, whether it's two or four-wheeled vehicles, allow you to appreciate the great differences in behavior between each individual vehicle, and at the same time to always have full control in every situation. If mistakes are made, it is the player's fault alone. Where, on the other hand, a few more maneuvers are required lies in the adjustment of the camera which, since it can no longer be delegated to the second analog stick, has been entrusted to the single lever in conjunction with the pressure of the L key. As you can easily guess, this compromise imposes not being able to change the camera and control the character at the same time, thus requiring some time to get a good familiarity. Still far from perfect is the pointing system, which often hooks poor and defenseless passers-by, leaving the player at the mercy of real and dangerous enemies. All in all though, there is very little to complain about this GTA: Liberty City Stories. The defects that the Rockstar production denounces are in fact simply those that have accompanied the series from the beginning; this means that those who have never loved Grand Theft Auto will certainly not change their mind thanks to this episode, which on the contrary will delight all fans of the most politically incorrect game of recent years. However, it must be said at the same time that although the events narrated are completely new, and although the variety of missions guarantees a good freshness to the product, it is undeniable on some occasions to feel a more or less marked sense of deja-vu. On the other hand, the mechanism is the same as the one proposed at the end of 2001 which, although it has aged quite well, after 4 years it begins to show some signs of weakness. Where nothing can be disputed is on the purely technical aspect, to the point that Liberty City Stories should be taken as an example of how to program on the PSP. We are not referring only to the goodness of the polygonal world, very close to what was seen on Ps2 so as to leave you speechless. Equally astonishing is in fact the management of uploads, the true cross of most productions on the Sony laptop; in fact, the Rockstar title takes about a minute for the initial loading, and then interrupts for a few seconds only during the interlude sequences or during the transition from one of the 3 islands to another. A result that to define bearable is at least simplistic, and which confirms that the PSP uploads are actually a false problem: the real problem lies in listless and approximate conversion processes, and in programmers unable to exploit the console's features in the best possible way . Obviously, radio stations have not been excluded from this new chapter of GTA, freely interchangeable by pressing the digital pad and which also in Libery City Stories offer an incredible variety of musical genres, accompanied by the comments of the speakers who often and willingly deal with the criminal actions of the player. Furthermore, through a special PC program, it is possible to bring your own music CDs onto a memory stick and then make them become the soundtrack of the game. Longevity is very good; the main adventure can be completed in about 15 hours, but that doesn't mean reaching 100% percentage. In fact, there are a whole series of secondary missions, such as those of a policeman, fireman, taxi driver or bellboy, which, as per the tradition of the series, increase the overall duration well beyond 25 hours. Furthermore, this chapter on PSP is the first to offer a true multiplayer mode via an ad-hoc wireless link, allowing up to 6 players to compete in capture the flag, deathmatch and king of the hill competitions. Comment GTA: Liberty City Stories, in addition to the merits of the game itself, represents first of all a manifesto of the real potential of the PSP, as well as a fundamental programming lesson to be imparted to several lazy development teams. Seeing Liberty City on the Sony laptop in all its polygonal complexity, with its alleyways, buildings, cars and motorbikes in a version that is almost indistinguishable from how we remembered it on Ps2 is truly incredible. The game remains faithful to the series in the same way, proposing the gameplay that has made it successful in all its aspects; this can actually be seen, however, also as a not entirely positive element, since 4 years after GTA3 some limitations and defects are manifested in a more marked way. And for this very reason, despite the plot and the forsongs are entirely new, it's impossible not to feel a strong sense of deja-vu. But Liberty City Stories remains an extremely entertaining product, of great depth from every point of view, and undoubtedly represents one of the best titles currently available on PSP. Pros Technically impressive A real GTA in all respects Good control system Cons Game mechanics a bit aged Unforgettable plot Some drops in frame rate Do you remember the devastating effect that the market debut of Grand Theft Auto 3 had? After the first two episodes, entertaining but far from unforgettable 2D experiments that appeared on PC and PSone at the end of the 90s, no one would have bet on an exploit capable, it must be said, of revolutionizing the videogame market. Yet this is what happened in late October 2001, when GTA 3 saw the light for the first time on PS2. A rich, detailed 3D world capable of offering a freedom of action never achieved before combined with an out of the ordinary dose of violence. The Rockstar title was, with all due respect to its detractors, one of those titles capable of shifting the balance, selling consoles and giving life to a new genre. Now, all of this is available on Psp.", "date": "2005-12-01", "grade": null}
