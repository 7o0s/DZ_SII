{"name": "Samurai Shodown per PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/samurai-shodown-pc-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Samurai Shodown for PC comes exactly one year after the game's debut on consoles, with an exclusive release on the Epic Games Store which, however, does not give up the charm of downloadable content in favor of a complete edition.Available at the standard price of 49.99 euros, the SNK-branded fighting game with white weapons in fact includes a roster made up of sixteen characters that can be enriched precisely through the purchase of two Season Passes or individual fighters. However, this implies a considerable extra expense, despite the current discounts on DLCs. Gameplay Beyond the opportunity or not to land on PC without the additional costs of a complete package, which in any case was made available to us for the article, Samurai Shodown also confirms in the Windows environment all the advantages relating to the gameplay that we had underlined in the review of the console version. Putting aside the narrative aspects of what practically stands as a prequel to the famous SNK franchise, it must in fact be said that the current panorama of match-based fighting games lacked an experience of this type, so strongly focused on strategy and the calculation of distances, with maneuvers that allow you to empty your opponent's health bar in just three moves and an atmosphere that is consequently full of tension because matches can take any turn and be revolutionized within a few moments. From this point of view, the title marks a clear and evident return to the origins, and in its mechanics it immediately appears very clear and compact. The controls include three types of slash (weak, medium and strong) and a kick, a grip designed solely to open the enemy's defense and a dodge on the spot, but also a set of devastating and variable specials based on the buttons used. which are accompanied by super as spectacular as they are effective: performing them with the right timing can really turn the tide of the clash. Even in practice there is little to complain about: we proceed with the traditional crescents, it is possible to activate a fury mode when the relative indicator is full and in this state attempt the super which disarms the opponent, putting him in a net position disadvantage (unless he can find an opening to retrieve the weapon), but there are two other maneuvers that are equally important in the dueling economy and that can only be ~expended~ once per match. Personages The Samurai Shodown system, so solid and interesting, finds its outlet through the use of characters who are divided between old acquaintances and new entries, three in all as regards the basic roster: Yashamaru Kurama, the new protagonist, who fights using powers from Tengu that make him similar to a crow; Wu-Ruixiang, a Chinese warrior who wields a shield; and Darli Dagger, a sort of pirate of African origin, equipped with a huge serrated cleaver. After which there are obviously the classics Haohmaru, Nakoruru, Hanzo Hattori, the lightning-fast Galford, the ineffable Genjuro Kibagami with his cards, and so on : a group of variegated and still very fascinating figures, reinterpreted in a very faithful way to the history of the series. The final boss, the fearsome Shizuka, unfortunately cannot be unlocked, but as mentioned it is possible to purchase two different Season Passes for a total of eight extra fighters who certainly add something to the experience. We have, for example, the imposing monk Wan- It was with its stone pillar, a classic for Samurai Shodown fans; or the young Rimururu, who has always been one of the most popular figures in the franchise. Furthermore, a bit of fanservice could not be missing, represented in this case by the busty Iroha: a very buxom and scantily dressed warrior, who fights using two large scythe blades. Mode The lack of content remains Samurai Shodown's weak point on PC as well. The fulcrum of the single player experience is in fact represented by a classic-style story mode, with a sequence of encounters that ends with the final boss and a disappointing static final cutscene. There were undoubtedly many ways to strengthen the offer without having to make who knows what productive effort, as done for example with the now well-known Mortal Kombat Towers. Completed the game with all the characters, there is not much else to to do: the usual survival games, a Dojo in which to challenge the ghosts of other users (which, however, mysteriously, don't constitute who knows what test of skill), the inevitable options for practicing, local Versus and a competitive online multiplayer that unfortunately pays dues due to a netcode not up to expectations and currently sparsely populated servers. The verPC sion From an artistic point of view, Samurai Shodown is confirmed as very pleasant to see: the style adopted for the costumes and above all for the scenarios gives life to sequences of great impact, full of splendid colors, with some truly evocative landscapes. The characters boast a quite similar to that of the last two Street Fighter chapters, although without ever giving up on the proportions front (no gigantic feet, in short), and their moves give a show thanks also to a good set of animations. Too bad that some polygonal models highlight somewhat approximate and angular solutions, see for example the new entry Darli. The PC version suffers from some annoying youthful problems: we weren't able to set a resolution higher than 1080p except by manually acting on the configuration files, while the visual adjustments seemed frankly few to us, limited to the activation of antialiasing, shadows and the bloom effect. The lack of v-sync also results in unpleasant tearing during certain moments and must also be resolved by using external settings.", "date": "2020-06-15", "grade": "7.5"}
