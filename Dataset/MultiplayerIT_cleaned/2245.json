{"name": "MotoGP 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/motogp-2.html", "text": "Something is changed? The answer can only be yes. One of the most recurring criticisms of Moto GP was due to its limited longevity. All in all, just five runs proved insufficient to make a promising game a must-have title. Fortunately, things seem to be going differently in MotoGP 2 and the pre-existing tracks of Suzuka, Paul Ricard, Jerez, Donington and Motegi have been joined by the new Catalunya, Assen, Le Mans, Mugello, Sachsenring. The news certainly didn't end there. The ~challenge~ mode, particularly appreciated last year, has assumed even greater importance thanks to a number of competitions that far exceeds 70 units. By completing some particular challenges it is also possible to unlock a brand new mode that will allow you to face some of the biggest names in motorcycling of the recent past on the track. Champions of the caliber of Michael Doohan, riding his '99 Honda, Kenny Roberts Senior (Yamaha '81), Kevin Schwantz (Suzuki '94), Freddy Spencer (Yamaha '89) and Wayne Rainey (Yamaha 93') have not certainly need no introduction... Added to these two-wheeled legends are the riders who put on a show last season on all the tracks of the planet, and their respective bikes, identical in all respects to their real counterparts. The rain falls... Additional tracks aside, the biggest innovation presented by this MotoGP 2 consists of the rain, which sometimes wets the asphalt of the tracks abundantly. To tell the truth, the first time I ran a race in the wet, I couldn't help but turn up my nose as in reality a race in such conditions is difficult. Despite this, the wet effect and in particular the feeling of poor grip are well recreated and, having said that, the new weather condition available can only give more variety to the game. From the point of view of playability, however, not much has changed. Vehicle control and response to our commands have remained the same. However, this pleases those who, like me, considered playability to be the strong point of the old title as well. The decision to slightly raise the level of difficulty, now finally worthy of its name, also fits perfectly. I don't know if anyone agrees with me, but I found it quite frustrating to win all the races, even on the highest difficulty level, without meeting any opposition from the opponents. Music to your ears? As could easily be guessed, the look of MotoGP 2 has also undergone a certain restyling. To tell the truth I would have expected a more drastic transformation but, beyond the use of some better textures, MotoGP 2 would seem identical to the original. However, a parallel comparison between the two games makes visible some differences that seemed almost imperceptible. The implementation of anti-aliasing has in fact given the game a decidedly greater image cleanliness and the same can be said of the now habitual flickering, in this case much less visible. Unfortunately, nothing has changed for the sound. In fact, the excellent sound effects were accompanied by the usual horrible music which, even on the occasion of the first Moto GP, had forced us to deactivate them completely. This makes me think that Namco are not really connoisseurs in the choice of music... Last lap, last MotoGP? After testing Moto GP 2 on the road for many hours, I think I've got a pretty clear idea about the game in question. The innovations introduced are undoubtedly a pleasant surprise which, however, will not be able to satisfy everyone in the same way. The resemblance to the predecessor is in fact very marked and the addition of a few tracks and some rain may not be enough to convince those who already own MotoGP to buy the sequel as well. For motorcycling enthusiasts and those approaching MotoGP for the first time, Namco's new effort will certainly be worth all the money it costs. The simultaneous presence of Vale Rossi, Biaggi and Capirossi is also an extra incentive to buy. While waiting for MotoGP 3, announced in recent days, I just have to renew the appointment with the world of two wheels. We'll hear from you in a year... Pros: Immediate Funny Good graphics Valentino Rossi is there too! Cons: Little news Horrible music Again Rossi Vs. Biaggi The year that has been archived for a few weeks now was probably one of the most exciting that the history of engines can remember. The mind immediately goes to the amazing season enjoyed by Schumacher's Ferrari,crowned by the conquest of the riders and constructors world championships, and the fantastic hat-trick of Italian riders in the 500 class of the motorcycling championship. Loris Capirossi, Max Biaggi and above all Valentino Rossi painted the Italian flag on almost all the podiums of the world championship, giving the fans emotions perhaps never experienced after the Agostini era. Next April 7th, the 2002 edition of the motorcycling championship will open with the Japanese grand prix, which will once again see our local centaurs as favourites. But while for the most important teams in the 500 class it is a period of tests and trials of the new chassis, on PlayStation 2 the season has already begun with MotoGP 2, the sequel to the two-wheeled driving game released exactly one year ago on the black monolith. I remember looking forward to the first MotoGP, devouring every screenshot and footage released by Namco in the months leading up to the game's release. The wait was largely repaid thanks to a very fun game even if not able to satisfy the simulation purists. One year after the first game, the legendary Namco tries again with a game that promises to eliminate the defects of its predecessor. Will it actually be like this?", "date": "2002-02-16", "grade": null}
