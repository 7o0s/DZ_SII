{"name": "Paper Beast", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/paper-beast-recensione.html", "text": "Writing the review of Paper Beast without saying a few words about its author, Eric Chahi, would not make much sense. In fact, we are talking about a legendary game designer, to whom we owe classics such as Another World and Heart of Darkness: a person able to perceive the boundaries of the medium and cross them thanks to a series of innovative ideas that have undoubtedly contributed to raising the quality standards of the entire industry, especially as regards visual storytelling. Paper Beast is his latest creature, literally: a game for PlayStation VR in which we certainly find Chahi's desire to experiment, who tells us a story that is at times very exciting using new tools. There is practically no interface, the controls via DualShock or Move are essential and the subdivision between the stages takes place in the simple passage from one area to another of the peculiar world in which we are projected, after an original musical interlude signed by the Japanese band TsuShiMaMiRe. Gameplay, between puzzles and controls From the Paper Beast start screen it is possible to access two different modes: a campaign consisting of seven chapters, for a total duration of about six hours, and a sandbox in which it is possible to create a real ecosystem by placing in a small map all the objects and creatures that we have unlocked up to that moment. From the very first bars of the story we find ourselves lost, with no particular references beyond those that can be understood at the moment. Nothing can hurt us in the game, so we are talking about a relaxing experience in many ways, but we often notice how some of the paper animals that populate the scenario can end up victims of predators, and perhaps our task in this specific situation will be to help them. The interaction with the scenario follows simple and precise rules: the movement of our character takes place exclusively via teleportation (unfortunately there is no alternative option) acting on the left back button to identify the point in which to project oneself, while with the right trigger it is It is possible to grab objects or creatures on the basis of a light beam which then ends up flexing as we move any load. In short, it seems to fish, with the up and down keys of the d-pad to determine the lengthening or shortening of the ~line~: a system that is certainly original and ingenious, but which also turns out to be very cumbersome and imprecise, having dealing with increasingly broader and more multifaceted three-dimensional contexts. In each stage we are asked to solve an environmental puzzle, but above all to understand how to do it: in the absence of any help or suggestion, we will just have to experiment with the various interactions, identify the problem and figure out how to solve it. Sometimes these are very trivial, in which it is enough to grab some creatures and throw them over an obstacle to make them move away from any pitfalls. Proceeding in the adventure, however, real terraforming mechanisms are introduced that make use of special objects: crystals capable of freezing water, ~worms~ that swallow earth on one side and spit it out on the other so as to create , animals that carry dirt and that we will have to lure to certain points on the map, fiery rocks that can melt icy walls and so on. Playstation 4 trophies Paper Beast's twenty-two Trophies are mostly obtained by performing specific actions for the first time, thus ushering in new ways of interacting with the scenario. There is obviously no shortage of achievements related to collectibles and particular situations, such as being able to see the sun or attaching one object to another. Technical realization and limits of experience The world of Paper Beast is undoubtedly suggestive and fascinating, despite the extreme simplicity of its polygonal models. It is a sort of desert dominated by a clear sky in which strange pink clouds float, with some rock formations to delimit the different areas that we will be able to explore, moving on foot or by climbing on a sort of hot air balloon.The flight phases , also rendered in a very spontaneous way, probably represent the most interesting and evocative part of the experience, but also the one that makes one wonder why a traditional movement option has not been provided in addition to teleportation, which adds further cumbersomeness to a context already in itself very woody and at times frustrating. To say: if you suffer from motion sickness and instantaneous movements have saved you from stomach aches, traveling aboard a hot air balloon will make you recover from the lost nausea. In any good visual narration, the audio sector plays a roleor of extreme importance, and this obviously also happens in Paper Beast. While moving with a deliberately essential approach, in order to emphasize certain moments, the audio helps to create a great atmosphere and underlines the most important moments of the adventure with beautiful music, while the effects appear quite convincing in their characterization of actions and verses .", "date": "2020-04-05", "grade": "7.2"}
