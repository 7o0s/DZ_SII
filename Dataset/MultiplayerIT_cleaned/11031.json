{"name": "Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shaun-white-snowboarding-road-trip-recensione.html", "text": "One of the few titles presented at the E3 Nintendo conference to have survived the harsh criticism of the specialized press, Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip seemed to promise great things mainly thanks to what appeared to be an intelligent exploitation of the Balance Board. Now let's see if it's finally time to dust off the picturesque Nintendo peripheral to use it as a snowboard... Not just Balance Boards Wii owners who haven't had the audacity to buy Wii Fit and the related Balance Board needn't despair, as Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip offers an objectively less exciting remote control system even if more precise and reliable: it is in fact, it is sufficient to rotate the controller to move your alter-ego on the track or rotate it in mid-air, while a quick upward whip to make the character jump on the screen. The exploitation of the A and B keys completes the picture in terms of increasing speed and executing tricks. We go blank As - fortunately - often happens for cross-platform productions of a certain level, the Wii version of Shaun White Snowboarding differs considerably from its PS3 and Xbox 360 counterparts, and not only for the presence of the Road Trip subtitle. If in fact the other two incarnations offer a more conventional play experience, oriented towards a certain degree of realism, Ubisoft's production on Wii follows a path closer to casual gamers, both in terms of the play structure and in terms of technical implementation . A choice that has often led to splitting the public in two, exalting non-gamers and making hardcore people turn up their noses, but which in this case worked perfectly, leading to the creation of a game that is immediate but at the same time endowed with a depth enough to keep you interested for more than a few games. The lion's share is obviously played by the control system via Balance Board, which objectively allows Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip to engage that extra gear useful for overcoming similar products such as SSX Blur. The comparison with the EA product is not accidental, given that here too we are faced with a snowboarding game with an arcade setting, with slightly cartoonish characters, situations light years away from reality and unlockable power-ups and extras they waste. However, let's go back to the Balance Board, a peripheral on which Ubisoft has obviously focused a lot: first of all, the game offers an adequate system for detecting the user's weight, as well as an option that allows you to select three different degrees of sensitivity in relation to your needs . the control system clearly demonstrates its extreme affinity with the genre We go blank On the track, the system clearly demonstrates its extreme affinity with the videogame genre in question: just lean on the ~scale~ to move left and right, duck down to gain speed and do a quick knee bend to jump. In flight, shifting your weight in one of eight directions causes a corresponding rotation of the boarder, while using the Remote's A and B buttons allows you to execute and chain the various tricks. Everything is really very simple to assimilate, and at the same time extremely fun and rewarding: of course, some lack in terms of precision occasionally makes itself felt (to the point that to get to the bottom of the more advanced challenges it may be advisable to rely on the control via Remote , described in the box), but in principle the support of the Balance Board exponentially increases the feeling of involvement with the Ubisoft product. To each his own As mentioned at the beginning, Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip is still a title that winks at casual users, as can also be seen from the setting of the play structure. The main menu allows you to launch into the various competitions by simply clicking on the icons that appear on the screen, all dividing yourself between a handful of slopes (strictly invented from scratch) scattered around the world. You start with only two selectable characters, a number that increases as you complete the races: each boarder has different values that determine his skills both as an athlete and as a cameraman. A peculiarity of Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip lies in the need to express one's preference also in this aspect, a choice that alters the power-ups made available to the downhill skier when certain scores are reached. However, Ubisoft has not totally forgotten the more savvy public, given that each event offers two distinct obieffective: the first, the main one, is usually quite simple to achieve, while the second often requires repetition of the stage in order to collect all the bonuses, beat the hi-score, perform a certain number of tricks and so on. Ubisoft has not forgotten the most savvy audience To each his own Certainly this is not enough to make Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip a properly challenging game, but at least an attempt by the developers to increase its longevity is visible. Something to which the multiplayer component also contributes, divided between a co-operative mode (unfortunately without a drop-in option), a split-screen section and another dedicated to hotseat-style turn-based play. Complete in terms of the playful offer, the Ubisoft product fully convinces also as regards the technical realization, without a shadow of a doubt among the best seen recently on the Wii. The developers have rightly opted for an approach away from the pursuit of realism, without however depriving the game of truly pleasant elements: for example, the suggestive glimpses of some mountains, as well as the graphic effects that highlight speed increases and various power-ups or still the snow that accumulates on the camera lens following a fall. In general, Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip boasts good fluidity, a respectable visual horizon and well-animated polygonal models, making you wrinkle your nose only for some barely sketched contour elements. An apt soundtrack completes the picture of a really well packaged product from every point of view. Comment The main risk with Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip was a classic of many Wii titles: ending up with a casual, fun product for a couple of days or so. Fortunately, the Ubisoft developers were good enough to give their creation a good balance between immediacy - strengthened by the excellent support of the Balance Board - and the ability to entertain even in the long run, thanks to single and multiplayer modes that are up to the task . If you also put a respectable technical achievement on the plate, it is easy to crown the present title as the best snowboarding game available for the Wii, and more generally one of the best products of this winter season for the Nintendo console. Pros Excellent support from the Balance Board Immediate and fun Fairly deep and long-lived Cons Fairly low level of difficulty Some careless side elements", "date": "2008-11-21", "grade": null}
