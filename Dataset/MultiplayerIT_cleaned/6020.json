From this point of view, at least in Europe, since the days of the old 16-bit consoles, the flagship of the Canadian company's production is certainly the FIFA series. The popular football franchise returns to the public again this year on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with an edition that tries to offer some new content in terms of game options and a handful of refinements to the already solid gameplay on which it has been on for years lays its foundations. As we will see, in fact, while not revolutionizing anything (after all, what could a football game revolutionize every year? at most it can try to get as close as possible to a certain realism) FIFA 16 improves the good things we have seen from various points of view in the past season, and not only in that one. In short, it is clear that Electronic Arts is focused on the new generation consoles but does not forget the previous ones and its users. Having made this premise, let's go into our analysis of the new chapter of what many consider the King of football simulations. FIFA 16 continues its quest for realism even on past generation consoles Curiosity Thirteen athletes, including Kadeisha Buchanan, Ashley Lawrence, Celia Jimnez and Amanda Perez, have been removed from the game by EA due to a complaint by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. According to the latter, their presence in the game would violate some rules on amateur sports in the United States, and could compromise the eligibility of girls in their respective college teams. Ready for a new season? The usual Messi welcomes the player to the main screen, where the various game modes are available in the now classic window menus. In this sense there are no sensational news and all the choices of last year are present, from quick friendlies to various tournaments, real or invented, each of which features different options for all tastes and needs. There are the Season, EA Sports Football Club, which once again represents the pinnacle of statistical production and data collection across all game modes, and the Virtual Footballer, with challenges to increase the characteristics of one's alter ego. There is also an area reserved for training complete with prize trials, Support your Club and Xbox Live, available with the usual friendlies, customizable challenges and the possibility of being able to play an entire season. About the online game: we had the opportunity to do a few races on the Net and everything went smoothly, without lag and with a rather fast matchmaking. Returning to the offline and single player modes, obviously the presence of the Career is inevitable, for years the beating heart of the production, enriched on this occasion by some new functions. In addition to the possibility of earning money useful for the budget by participating in tournaments around the world during the pre-season, the mode has been further refined in the options and embellished in what is a sort of narrative structure, useful for giving some prominence to everything that happens in the changing rooms and outside. In this way, by further enhancing those surrounding elements in the career of an athlete, the user is placed more in the role of a football player or a coach. For the rest, by impersonating a coach-manager, the gamer is called as always to manage the finances of the club, the contracts with the sponsors, the training sessions, the transfer market and so on, including the nursery. In this sense, it should be noted that in this edition more emphasis has been placed on the growth and evolution of young talents discovered and hired by the club, to be improved in their basic skills through targeted training and some mini games. In our analysis we obviously haven't forgotten about Ultimate Team, the ~game within a game~ that allows users to create their own ideal team by basing purchases and exchanges on a complex ebay-style system. For those who are new to the mode and would like to test it, or for those who still want to play it quickly, a new quick access feature called Draft has been implemented. Through the latter, you can basically get a ~taste~ of FUT by playing four straight games, without having to worry too much about player packs and schemes. But the real novelty of FIFA 16 is certainly the introduction of twelve women's football teams into the roster. Women and balls The introduction of female athletes has not only a mere faesthetic anointing, but it also has an impact on the dynamics of the gameplay. This is because EA Sports has rewritten portions of the code and adapted the physics engine to make the matches played by the women's national teams credible. As in reality, the differences between the two sexes in terms of physical and technical characteristics lead to a generally slower and more thought-out pace of play. Nonetheless, in terms of commitment, grit and tactical skills, the female players have nothing to envy to their male colleagues and the matches with them as protagonists, even in FIFA 16, constitute a good challenge and good fun for fans. It's just a pity that these teams can only be used in an ad hoc tournament and in friendlies. Moving on to something else and talking in particular about teams made up of men, we instead have a well-balanced playability, where teamwork and reasoned action are enhanced. In general and in extreme synthesis, the rearguards appear more attentive in marking, in anticipation and in reading the offensive action rationally. In midfield, depending on the schemes, the strategies adopted and the quality of the elements in the squad, there is a tendency to build the game (or break it up with reasoned pressing), to get the ball moving or to verticalize where possible. Attacks, on the other hand, are more inclined to look for overlaps on the flanks, shots on the edge of offside or quick one-two punches to climb over the opponents' back pack. Furthermore, when possible they do not disdain the conclusion from outside or the play of the single champion. The physics of the ball, like that of the tackles and the athletes, are believable, and the ball feels ~heavy~ and consistent in reactions to shots and passes. This is especially noticeable in crosses, which have a greater variety, in rebounds or in certain conclusions on goal. This element adds that element of randomness that exists in real football, which ensures that if certain parameters are not met, the ball can literally leap into the air or end up bouncing between the feet of an opponent. In this sense, the trajectory is influenced by various factors (the way in which an athlete hits the ball, the foot, the coordination, the technical parameters, the tackles), and the precision therefore becomes a decisive element in trying to insert the ball into the net and overcoming the surly goalkeepers who, apart from some occasional sleep at the near post, generally appear to be attentive. The complete impact on shots and passes, 360-degree movements, freedom and speed of control (obviously we are talking about manual settings), all important concepts as we have written over the years, have been improved and perfected over time and with FIFA 16 have probably reached their peak, at least for the older generation of consoles. In short, with due proportions, playing one has the sensation of being able to relive on the virtual field situations similar to those that one could experience in the real one. Too bad for the age-old momentum problem, which as in FIFA 15 is less annoying than usual, but still remains ~present~ in certain decisive moments of some matches or of the season at advanced difficulty levels. Xbox 360 goals FIFA 16 gives gamers no less than forty-eight achievements to unlock. To do this it is necessary to satisfy the most diverse requests of the game such as for example removing the ball in a sliding match in a women's soccer match, playing the first game with your Virtual Player, winning a division in FUT or during an online Head-to-Head season. The art of retouching To close, let's take a look at the technical part. As well as for gameplay, even from this point of view FIFA 16 does not differ much from its predecessor. But on the other hand it was something widely budgeted, given that the limit has now been reached on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 as regards the exploitation of the hardware, at least for this type of game. In any case, as happened in the 2015 edition, as you play the more attentive eye cannot fail to notice a whole series of tweaks made here and there by the graphics to improve the aesthetics of the product, starting with the various elements outline that make up the match event. Pre-match and entry into the field of the two formations, up to the actual match, enriched by the presence of a good number of skits before and after the kick-off. In particular, some of the new celebrations after a goal are very engaging, which can be performed in a personalized way as always with the help of the pad keys (otherwise they take place automatically depending on the scorer). Sometimes it can also happen to see the author of a marking go to grab a camera and, after a change of perspective, see him shownin the foreground while exultantly kissing the lens. Among other things, these situations help the gamer to better identify with the context and to enhance the faces of the most famous players, really well done, including those of the female soccer players, for whom the same technology as their male colleagues has been used to faithfully reproduce their faces, beyond the outfits of the various teams, especially those covered by official licenses. In this sense, the game boasts many teams and tournaments that benefit from logos, names and various references to the real counterparts. To make everything more credible then there are the animations, once again numerous and well blended with each other, capable of showing the movements of the players during the various phases of the game, which seem to be made by real people controlled via pad. Also in this case the developers have created a set of animations specifically for women, then adapted to their anatomical model. Still on the subject of graphics, the stadiums are good, with some made in a more refined and detailed way than others. On the other hand, the choirs sung inside by the supporters of the teams are decidedly spectacular. In FIFA 16 the chants almost represent the state of the art for a football simulation, not only because there are many and they are all sampled in the stadiums, but because they are full, they don't jump out at random and create, especially in the key stages of a match, a really amazing atmosphere. Try playing a match using a good sound system and adjusting the volume upwards: the sensation of being inside a real stadium will be total. In any case, remaining on the audio theme, the soundtrack is beautiful, which boasts among other songs by Icona Pop, Durante and The Royal Concept, and the Italian commentary. The duo Pierluigi Pardo and Stefano Nava proves to be successful again this year, with a dynamic and quite varied commentary for the main matches, but there are still some repetitions on certain plays and certain actions.", "date": "2015-09-24", "grade": "8.8"}
