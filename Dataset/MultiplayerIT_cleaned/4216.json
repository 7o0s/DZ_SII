The Italian team has racing in its blood, that's for sure, and right from the start, when the company was still called Graffiti, it has shown that it knows how to get the most out of any hardware. However, the situation of the various gaming platforms has changed profoundly over time, and so certain technical solutions have begun to feel the excessive weight of increasingly strong, increasingly organized competition, capable of counting on powerful unified tools. It is therefore no coincidence that 2018 for Milestone was inaugurated by their first racer powered by Unreal Engine 4, Gravel, and that all the franchises of the Milanese studio have adopted the same technology in order to aspire to an unprecedented degree of competitiveness on the scene international. The question is naturally obvious: considering the characteristics of the graphics engine developed by Epic Games, was it the best choice? It certainly wasn't a small change: as we already pointed out in the test, the adoption of the new engine brought with it big steps backwards on the structural front, probably due to the fact that many assets had to be reworked. MotoGP 18 therefore starts anew in terms of content, cutting the significant novelty of the managerial career in favor of a range of traditional options, which include the standard career, the championship, fast races, time attacks and the competitive online sector, which in future will open up to a number of interesting eSports facets. You are like my bike If it is true that Milestone has chosen to switch to the Unreal Engine with a little delay, after having endured the criticisms due to the use of a proprietary engine that has never really been able to compete with the most famous productions in the context of the racing genre, at the same time no one can say that the Italian team has ever skimped on the depth of its titles. In this case we are not talking about the structure, which as mentioned in MotoGP 18 does not go beyond the more traditional and overused methods, but rather about the gameplay and its ramifications, about a riding model that once again can teach everyone how to make a truly progressive system, and which in its many adjustments includes the possibility of adapting the experience to the most varied tastes, allowing us to ~grow~ from race to race, increasing if we want the degree of difficulty or the realism of the physics, activating or not the realistic damage and tire wear, limiting ourselves to a few laps of the track and just the race session or tackling the weekends in their entirety, counting in the end on directly proportional awards in terms of points. The situation changes substantially according to our choices, and in this sense there must also be an increase in the general difficulty, a greater incidence of falls (deadly for the purposes of the ranking, but made less bitter by the presence of the now inevitable ~rewind ~) and a more realistic behavior of the bike and the rider, supported by animations that we have never seen before in the series, as well as more convincing physics when an impact occurs. In short, the key concept is that with MotoGP 18 you enjoy riding, you enjoy every overtaking (even more so when you have to sweat it out) and you never get tired of racking up laps, which ultimately makes the difference between a race and a patchwork experience. Having said this, however, on the opponents' artificial intelligence front, things have not actually improved much, with the tendency to represent two situations that are quite polar opposites: the lack of setting errors by the other pilots but at the same time the practically constant to film them at the cut, during which it often happens that someone runs into us without therefore perceiving our presence. A career man Precisely at the service of this gameplay-centric vision we find the many facets of the MotoGP 18 career, which will see us attempt the climb starting from a minor championship, in a team of little importance, and try to get the best placements to sign with more stable teams. emblazoned, thus using the points earned on the track (the result of a very detailed analysis of our style) to improve the bike in terms of engine, brakes, suspension, chassis and aerodynamics. Similarly, before racing we will be able to modify the setup by changing the tire compound, adjusting the suspension and steering, varying the gear ratios, the electronics and the braking system, with the possibility ofi save the setup in order to be able to recall it quickly. Or put us in the hands of the track engineer for an automatic review focused on our needs. In short, on the structural front there are no real novelties, but the contents have been implemented with a certain care and the interface is particularly well finished, stylish and balanced, with an excellent arrangement of the commands and multimedia contents that introduce us to each new location. The tracks of the official season are all present, as well as real drivers (not all faithfully made, in truth), selectable to face fast races or an entire championship. Online multiplayer allows you to join sessions that are already open or to create private matches for up to twelve participants, and during our test we found that matchmaking worked well, which however will need to be verified with the game in stores. Playstation 4 trophies The fifty-one MotoGP 18 Trophies are mainly linked to victories, on certain circuits and in certain conditions, but there is also a whole series of achievements to be unlocked by playing a certain number of online games or by taking the fundamental steps in terms of career. Cross and delight So let's come to the technical realization, as mentioned at the beginning, one of the key points of MotoGP 18. Has the transition to Unreal Engine 4 really solved the problems of the series on the graphic front? Yes and no. On the one hand, there is no doubt that the new engine guarantees a better rendering of polygonal models, which are detailed and realistic, as well as moved by more convincing physics; and in the same way we appreciated the representation of the various weather conditions, unfortunately static and not dynamic as by now it would be reasonable to expect from the latest generation driving games. What certainly makes one turn up one's nose is the passage from the sixty frames per second of Milestone's proprietary engine to the thirty frames per second of the UE4 which, however stable (on PlayStation 4 Pro there are very few uncertainties), are far from the target optimal for this type of experience. The point is that the overview of the tracks does not justify such a drastic and defeatist choice, perhaps the result of inexperience with the new engine or (but we hope not) of the well-known difficulties that the Epic Games engine encounters with streaming fast content, also highlighted in the case of MotoGP 18 by textures that are slow to appear during the first shots of each scenario. The creation of the pilots, the staff members, the ~umbrella girls~ and some dated effects (see the champagne) still require a lot of attention, while as regards the audio sector we have an excellent performance of the engines and the engaging commentary by Guido Meda , unfortunately limited to the introductory stages of each grand prix.", "date": "2018-06-07", "grade": "7.2"}
