Among these, for example, we have seen relatively recently Resogun, chosen by Sony to accompany the release of PlayStation 4 as a downloadable title, in the light of a collaboration that has brought and will bring other games to the platform ecosystem of the Japanese company. However, the Helsinki-based studio can boast in its curriculum a story that began in 1996, within which the publication of Outland also took place in 2011, an interesting platformer that landed on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 under the banner of Ubisoft : fifteen years after the last title developed for PC (Supreme Snowboarding), Housemarque has decided together with the same French-Canadian publisher to surprisingly bring the same title to this platform too, where it was made available a few days ago through the usual Steam. Taking advantage of this new youth of the game, we gladly returned to the Outland universe, to understand if there are any differences with the versions already on the market, but above all to give way to those who weren't in possession of one of the two consoles three years ago mentioned above, to evaluate the purchase. Housemarque returns to PC with the conversion of Outland, released on consoles in 2011: let's hope it stays there! A two-color hero For the benefit of all PC users who have not followed the first Outland release at the time, we remind you that the title developed by the Finnish team puts us in the shoes of a character initially unaware of what awaits him. Troubled by some dreams, our hero first turns to medicine, to try in vain to stop them, then moving on to the care of a shaman, who tells him of a series of events dating back thousands of years earlier, in which one of his ancestor managed to get the better of the Sisters of Chaos, bent on destroying the world. Gradually, our virtual alter ego will realize that he has deep ties with the legendary hero, discovering that he can also acquire extraordinary powers thanks to them: he will naturally have to use them to face the two Sisters again, who escaped from the long captivity that had rendered them harmless all this time. The growth structure of our character is quite simple, also because it is now quite classic for video games dedicated to the figures of ~fallen heroes~: going forward in the adventure, we will be able to unlock new skills, to be used both in combat and in purely platformer of the game, thus obtaining the possibility of reaching places that were previously closed to us. To the main single mode, able to occupy the player for a time equal to about seven hours, another challenge mode is added, in which to complete the levels unlocked in a given time interval, but above all the online cooperative one, thanks to the which to add further fun to a title which, as we are about to see, guarantees it at will. Chameleonic platformer As you progress in Outland, you end up appreciating the elements that Housemarque's work draws from different titles of the genre to which it belongs, to make them your own and skillfully put them together. Platform sections and fights are reminiscent in some ways of the various Prince of Persia, Metroid and Castlevania (the fusion of which gave rise to a very specific genre, the ~metroidvania~) while the strongest call is certainly that of Ikaruga, mentioned practically everywhere you talk about Outland, with good reason. In fact, among our hero's skills, we find the use of magical powers inherited from the old fight against the two Sisters: one of them in fact controls the energy linked to sunlight, while the other one linked to the moon and darkness . The ability to change ~color~ between red and blue must be used on several occasions: to fight enemies of the opposite color, since they can only be defeated using the energy opposite to that possessed, but also to jump on some platforms, which can be activated using a certain color, and finally as a shield for energy beams that are fired by some opponents and other elements on the screen. By activating the same color as the beam, you become invulnerable to it. All this gives life to very interesting and often challenging game phases, in which it is necessary to repeatedly switch between one type of energy and another to advance: imagine, for example, a scene in which you find an enemy of a certain color chasing you, while you have to jump on a platform activated by the opposite color passing through a radius of oneof the two colors, and you will understand how Outland is often challenging in its dynamics. To lower the difficulty a bit, the developers have however introduced some life points to count on, rather than giving the player a single chance of success before returning to the checkpoint: the downside is that often in the most agitated situations you can decide to simply throw yourself into the middle of the fray, sacrificing one of your hearts to move forward without too much reasoning. Size matters The graphic aspect of Outland is completely based on a two-dimensional view, making use of parallax backgrounds that change to the point of view obtained by moving the character. The general technical aspect is pleasant and inspired, putting the player in the middle of a tribal setting also favored by excellent quality music, chosen to accompany the adventure together with the only narrative voice. In terms of design, the variety of levels could probably have been a little more marked, as are the excellent boss fights at the end of the level: they will become increasingly stronger, to be beaten by making use of the skills acquired in the game. course of history, through dynamics that can engage in the clash even for several minutes. The single-player experience of Outland is enriched, as mentioned, by the cooperative mode, capable of transforming the experience quite radically: each of the two players can go through the level at will, without being present on the same screen, but their bond causes the game to stop in case one of the two dies. There are also some portals in the various schemes that give access to co-op challenges, which can only be activated if you are playing Outland together with another human being. As for the conversion from console to PC, there are no particular changes: the use of a joypad is highly recommended, given that the ~keybinding~ for keyboard control is a real delirium and unfortunately cannot be redefined.", "date": "2014-10-03", "grade": "8.2"}
