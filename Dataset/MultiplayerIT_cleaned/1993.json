{"name": "Commandos 2: Men of Courage", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/commandos-2-men-of-courage.html", "text": "Prepare the chamomile and free yourself from improper weapons The game, after the intro with period footage on the war front situation, comes with a total of 12 missions and three difficulty levels, as well as a long series of tutorials. If this seems little to you, just think that there are several dozen tutorials alone and they are so necessary for the game that you would not be able, without first having studied them properly, not even to start a mission; that the missions are of an unheard-of vastness and complexity; and that already the second level of difficulty is more challenging than 80% of the games you have had the opportunity to try in your life. The presence of such a large number of tutorials is necessary to be introduced to every aspect of the game, which does not simply include the possible actions or the characteristics of the objects encountered but also the control system itself, which to define as ~complicated would be an understatement. Trying to have an approach to the game without first going through the hard learning curve constituted by the tutorials would be a real waste of time, but also an unjustified skipping of the crucial factor of the game, that is to adapt to its cumbersomeness. The game takes place with an overhead view on the rich photorealistic maps of the game, a view that can be varied by moving along the map, zooming or rotating the perspective; basically, the left and right analog controllers are used to control the characters and the camera; the latter also engages the R1 and R2 keys, while the former is quite distinct from the directional pad, which is used to control the menus but not the characters; using the other buttons it is possible to confirm, disconfirm, select and activate a disproportionate number of actions, options and commands which, for the most part, are discriminated by the use of L1, which allows the passage from ~offensive mode~ to ~interactive mode~ ; other functions are controlled via select, or via special combinations. As can be seen, it is an extremely difficult control system, which manages to account for the very large number of actions that the game presents, but not at the cost of a considerable expenditure of time, commitment and dedication required, equal to those which it would take to learn how to control a clutch-problematic WW1 tank. Prepare the chamomile and free yourself from improper weapons The tutorials cover actions such as using the camera, crouching, studying the enemy's field of vision, swapping, collecting and combining objects, using weapons, ammunition and tools, climbing heights, swimming, strategizing (such as distraction strategies), preparing traps, control multiple characters at the same time, and so on. Once you take the time to perfect your control through hours and hours of tutorials, not without a lot of load times and an interesting but decidedly repetitive voiced instructor, and dive right into the action, Commandos 2 will reveals itself as a deep title, which requires hours and hours of time to be mastered: to be able to complete a mission it will be necessary to restart it dozens and dozens of times, correcting control and strategy errors each time and thus perfecting a process of actions capable of making us triumph over the sadistic CPU that controls the opposing men, very ready to give the alarm, shoot us or derail an infiltration strategy in a few seconds that had cost us five or six gags of enemies, two or three sneaks and the use of three men with four tools! In Commandos 2, in short, the extreme difficulty and complexity of the actions to be performed, aggravated by a cumbersome control system and the real-time component that makes everything more pressing, are the other side of the coin of a deep, rich game of intelligence and inventions and which will give enormous satisfaction to those who will be able to give him large doses of patience. An above average period characterization One of the strengths of Commandos 2 is certainly the aesthetic characterization: even if slightly inferior to the original for PC, in fact, the graphic representation of the game environment is very suggestive, with the rich environments seen from above that abound in details and are presented in an almost documentary period style, while the presentation of the soldiers and characters adds a Hollywood and slightly cartoonish touch. Maps can be zoomed in, revealing fine detail at the cost of minimal graininess. The characters, though minute, are well animated andcharacterised, presenting particular and distinct ways of moving and acting. A negative note is constituted by the way in which it is possible to move the view in the environments since, these being two-dimensional versions obtained from rendered models, it is possible to zoom them at the cost of graining them a bit or rotate them: the rotation, however, does not occur freely, but in 90 steps, which on the one hand can be disorienting and on the other constitutes an ineffective way of resolving risky situations in which millimeter choices make the difference. As far as the audio is concerned, compliments must be paid to the composer of the background music, extremely well done and capable of capturing the feeling of tension and solemnity of the time and of the military atmosphere with a pinch of Hollywood mood, above all managing to be less repetitive and to benefit the tense atmosphere of the game. The sound effects are all well done, and even the speech of the soldiers is characterized according to their nationality, so that you will easily recognize the French soldiers of the alliance regardless of whether they speak in English, or you can identify yourself more in the action by hearing the speech of the Germans while you hide waiting for the next move. Undoubtedly, the representation of icons and war manuals also contributes to the aesthetic characterization, faithfully reproducing an entire historical era, returning it to strategic enthusiasts in all its charm. To conclude... ...Commandos 2 is an extremely well made and excellently featured game, but plagued by too much difficulty for anyone who is not a strategic fanatic. If the game is difficult and complex, the control system appears too cumbersome to be able to make it attractive to anyone who is not accustomed or passionate about this type of game. For this reason, the control is the only fairly serious defect of this PC conversion which, already in the original version compatible with keyboard and mouse, was above average difficult, and which, in the transition to the console, should have presented a simplified control and not made worse by the pad, for example eliminating certain rather gratuitous cumbersomeness such as the distinction between directional cross and analog for selections. Bearing in mind the load of time, patience and learning that this game requires, we can only strongly advise against it to anyone who does not particularly like the genre. All strategic fans, on the contrary, would find an excellent title in their hands. Pros: A boon for strategy lovers 12 Huge and very complex missions Packed with action and interaction Accurate tutorials Very classy period characterization Cons: Totally unsuitable for the average player Extremely high difficulty Cumbersome control system Learning curve too long Slow loading between the tutorials Commandos 2 is a particular game for the console market and which, while falling within the strategy genre, deserves a separate discussion. In the first place it is a conversion of a PC game specifically oriented towards lovers of strategic games and developed by a software house that has always produced strategic games; secondly, the game system, although heavily strategic, is in real time, with a view from above that mixes the importance of reasoning and the order of actions with a component of manual speed and reflexes that makes playability even harder; finally, it is a game as well made and complex as it is arduous, demanding and nerve-wracking for a wider audience than that of strategy fanatics. Consequently, do not expect to be able to load the game and go for a quick carnage or easily complete a mission: what you will find is something that requires large doses of patience and time and that could put your nerves to the test but, also, give you great satisfaction as a reward for an out of the ordinary commitment.", "date": "2002-10-04", "grade": null}
