{"name": "Airline Commander", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/airline-commander-recensione.html", "text": "Airline Commander is certainly a niche sector, but which boasts a following of great enthusiasts. In fact, we are talking about a real flight simulator, characterized by a system of licenses, exams and fleets designed to offer rather long-lasting entertainment with a progressively higher degree of difficulty. After a short tutorial, we will be guided through obtaining the licenses through field tests in which we will be asked to perform a perfect take-off, a landing or, as we progress through the campaign, manage the rolling phases or deal with a difficult situation, for example the failure of one of the engines. The experience provides a more immediate approach, with visual indicators and assistance that make it relatively simple to understand what to do, and a more realistic one, which eliminates interface parts to confront us with situations that sometimes become very complex. There is also a progression in access to increasingly prestigious aircraft, which have additional controls for starting and managing the engines or perhaps for a sudden decrease in speed which could allow for rapid return within the range foreseen for a landing. Different views are available, even if the third person view remains the most immediate, in support of a control system that intelligently mixes the accelerometer and touch controls. The first, in particular, is automatically recalibrated with each mission and proves to be particularly reactive and precise: no small quality, given that each maneuver must be carried out with extreme gentleness to obtain the best possible score. Structure and mechanics Airline Commander is available on the App Store and Google Play in the traditional freemium format, so you can download it for free and play without particular limitations. At some point you come across the waiting times for the release of licenses, but it is possible to reset them by watching a simple advertising trailer or by spending a few virtual dollars. However, the purchase of money packages remains optional and in the early hours you never feel the need to reach for your wallet. On the other hand, the structure offered by the developers appears very rich: the aircraft available are numerous and well differentiated, from propeller to jet models, more or less large, and the same can be said of runways and airports, reproduced with a fair fidelity thanks to the use of satellite images. The missions tend to repeat themselves a bit, but as you progress through the campaign, you access new and complex situations, which for example bring together different procedures in a single session. The interface sometimes shows the side to solutions that are not very beautiful to look at, but the system remains functional to the action and it is difficult to lose sight of the most important things, thanks to a system of suggestions which will initially indicate the procedures necessary to move forward in our career, gaining experience and funds with which to buy new patents. As mentioned, the control system guarantees the necessary precision to deal with every maneuver with great sweetness, but in terms of technical realization Airline Commander moves between ups and downs, resulting fascinating where you opt for the ~cinematic~ view, but in general modest as regards polygonal models, effects and scenarios, the latter composed in the landscapes by simple textures glued to the ground. The sound, for its part, reproduces in a rather faithful way the sounds that characterize the take-off and landing phases of the planes.", "date": "2018-08-11", "grade": "7.5"}
