{"name": "World's End Club", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/worlds-end-club-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Unfortunately, the World's End Club review cannot fail to contain some minimal spoilers, if only for the fact that the names involved in the development of the game can already easily give rise to expectations, however upset by the revealed identity of this particular title, now in complete form on Nintendo Switch. This is the new adventure created by Kotaro Uchikoshi, creator of the Zero Escape series, and Kazutaka Kodaka, author of Danganronpa: from this formation we can easily expect a disturbing psychological thriller seasoned with anime characterization and a pinch of Japanese irony, but the game in question goes beyond these premises and proposes something decidedly different, albeit linked in some way to the legacy of both authors. The restlessness and constant danger also shines through in such an apparently childish and cheerful characterization, remaining in the background and then bursting with twists and dark and unexpected situations at any moment. It is clear how the developers themselves have played on the public's expectations in this sense, which is fully revealed already in the very first hours of the story. World's End Club begins with a quiet school trip... The stated intent of the two authors was to create a sort of ~road movie~ inspired by children's adventure films, as they reported during a Reddit AMA session before the release. The result is indeed something similar to the Goonies seen from the slightly distorted perspective of Zero Escape and Danganronpa, a strange mix on paper and also to play, but which somehow works very well on the narrative front. It's all a kind of theater of deception, which acts on different levels: the Game of Destiny to which the protagonists are subjected at the beginning of the story immediately launches us into what seems to be a classic ~killing game~ dynamic typical of Uchikoshi and Kodaka , but it turns out to be something else when the game suddenly opens up and seems to become something else altogether. However, it is only the beginning of another series of twists in which it is above all the player who falls into deception: every time you think you have figured out what to expect, World's End Club upsets the prospects and puts everything back in doubt, starting from the very essence of the protagonist and from the same logical sequence of events we witness. In this great work of construction and disassembly of the narrative line, the weak point remains above all the actual gameplay, unfortunately, as we see below. A strange story In an elementary school in Tokyo there is a strange class made up of somewhat maladjusted boys, or at least so considered by teachers and other pupils for their inability to adapt to the strict rules of behavior imposed by society, but who have developed a solid friendship and they proudly defend their diversity by calling themselves the ~Club of the Daredevils~. After witnessing a catastrophic asteroid crash during a school trip, the boys awaken in a strange underwater playground, forced to play a sadistic game and eliminate each other to secure their way out of prison. But are things really like this? It is very difficult to talk about the story of World's End Club without spoiling it, because the whole narrative construct is based on the discovery of surprising elements and twists that distort the player's perspective. Suffice it to say that, after the first phase, the game turns into a long march of 1200 km to reach Tokyo, in a post-apocalyptic Japan dominated by a new dystopian reality imposed by a mysterious omniscient entity and its emissaries. It is precisely against this sort of deity that the boys will have to contend, covering numerous stages between various Japanese cities. Pielope is a strange character who closely resembles the authors' previous productions Everything turns into a training journey focused on the maturation of the boys, forced to face enormous challenges that awaken special powers in them but also confront them with dramatic events. The contrast between the cheerful tones of children's anime, the young age of the protagonists and the brutality of some situations and scenes is impressive, but it falls within the main theme on which World's End Club returns on several occasions, namely the stark contrast between opposite emotions , the ups and downs of sensations which ultimately highlight the great humanity of the boys, their sense of justice and the friendship that binds them. However, some discordant elements constantly emerge even in their compactness, with clues and suspicions that emerge about someone's identity or someone else's actual loyalty.it has original characteristics but does not stage unpublished elements, however it is the way in which it is built and told that is most striking. Continuing the narration, it is easy to see elements that do not seem to add up, inconsistencies or shortcomings, but these tend to be resolved by going forward (or backward) between the various acts, reassembling all the pieces of the strange puzzle not necessarily following a precise chronological line. Gameplay: platform, action, adventure and ~montage~ World's End Club is a sort of youthful road movie but with metaphysical elements The long journey of the boys takes place through numerous stages that cross a large part of Japan, also giving the opportunity to see various panoramas of the country and also receiving interesting explanations on the various places visited, in the interludes between the members of the club. Each stage is a game sequence that can take on various connotations: in some cases they focus exclusively on the narration, as in the case of the camps at the end of the day, in the dialogue phases or in the interlude scenes, while in others they are configured as real own levels with gameplay elements. It should be noted that in some of these stages we will be forced to make a choice between two different possibilities of story progression, which determines a branching in the sequence of episodes, staging different situations and alternative paths but with the possibility of going back and trying different paths, characteristics that will be fundamental to succeed and compose all the events. In World's End Club there are often moments of discussion and dialogue at the end of the day The game phases, unfortunately, are probably the weakest elements of this strange composite creature of Izanagi Games, Grounding and Tookyo, perhaps revealing a certain inexperience of the directors and designers in the field of action adventures with a platform structure. The choice of staging the action in a 2D context with platform features is interesting, but partly due to the woodiness of the controls and above all due to a rather lackluster level design, in terms of puzzles and challenges, the action is weak and not very engaging. In general, each level stages the awakening of the specific power dormant in each of the characters and presents obstacles and enemies to face using this special ability, but everything is too linear and guided. Some ideas are interesting, but being able to count on 9 different powers, something more could really be done as gameplay solutions, perhaps presenting greater possibilities for the combined use of skills or even simply allowing you to change character at any time and inserting so many additional variables to the puzzle design. In this way, although some levels are pleasant and interesting, in general the gameplay seems poorly reasoned and it is a great pity if we consider that the starting ideas, such as 2D action adventures based on special powers and a large cast of different characters, are very good and interesting and some puzzles are also quite challenging and non-trivial. Similarly, boss fights also have exciting moments, but are resolved in most cases with the reckless use of the special ability of the character in question. An interactive cartoon In World's End Club we witness the awakening of the powers of each character from time to time The character design of the Japanese illustrator Take is certainly the element that stands out most in the aesthetics of World's End Club, which is very accurate from the point of view of style even if rather simple in terms of technical realization. The characters, outlined with a somewhat childish anime style, are all very well characterized and, overall, remain impressed, making it easy to identify with the story of this shabby group of misfits. Obviously there is no shortage of stereotypes and the re-proposition of classic Japanese cartoon tropes such as the nerd, the athlete, the gamer, the dark handsome man, the petulant girl and so on, in the assorted group of 12 boys protagonists of the story, but often under each mask there is a deeper reality and a substratum of more or less traumatic experiences which confirm how in World's End Club we must always go beyond the surface to understand what we are dealing with. The 3D scenarios are decidedly less impactful, even if the variety of settings and the journey through various Japanese locations still helps to give a considerable touch of charm even in a not exactly brilliant level design. The special greeting between members of the Daredevils Club occurs often in the World's End Club World's End Club had already been reviewed on these pages in the Apple Arcade version, but the Nintendo Switch edition has some differences that make it the definitive version to all intents and purposes. The main innovations concern the contents: the initial version was incomplete, not allowing the achievement of the most advanced ending which is made possible only by closing all the sequences, present on the Nintendo console. This translates into several additional hours that make the story effectively homogeneous, thus solving the cliffhanger effect with which the iOS version ended. English speech has also been added, although purists may still prefer the original Japanese one, but the dubbing is well made in any case. It should be noted, however, that the game is entirely translated into Italian (as regards the written texts), even if the results are a bit fluctuating, going from good adaptations even of some puns to rather brandish errors that perhaps demonstrate one poor review process. Finally, it must be said that the use of the physical controls of the Nintendo Switch enormously improves the gaming experience compared to the touch screen, which still forced the use of an external controller.", "date": "2021-05-27", "grade": "7.5"}
