The young Spanish software house Deconstructeam has continued the development of the idea and has added five more levels to the original episode, giving life to a complete product that has carved its own niche in the overabundant archives of digital stores. Gods Will Be Watching is sold on Steam (also available for Mac and Linux systems) as an adventure, but the points of contact with the point and click games of the early nineties are limited to the graphic style so much so that, under the highly inflated pixelated guise in very popular among independent developers (the list is endless, we limit ourselves to mentioning the acclaimed Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery EP), there is a puzzle game with very strict rules that will put the patience of most (programmers) to the whip users. The gods will make fun of us In the first level, set in a server room, the group of terrorists to which the player belongs is made up of four elements: a leader in charge of hacking the system, an operator in the engine room and a soldier at the entrance in charge of keeping watch out for a rushing security unit. Also inside the room are four scientists being held hostage, including the professor responsible for the virus we're trying to steal. The first and frustrating level: all the action takes place within this screen The goal is to recover the data before the police raid and at the same time keep at least one prisoner alive, the only reason that prevents the ~good guys~ from using strong methods. For every action of Sergeant Burden (the controversial protagonist of the story) corresponds the filling of the download bar and a series of consequences that are difficult to predict. For example, we could order Jack (the rifleman) to open fire on the guards to make them retreat, but this would increase the tension between the researchers. Of course, it is possible to try to reassure them, but it is not always a winning tactic: a too relaxed hostage, like one who is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, will still try to escape from the room and at that point it will be up to the player the evaluation of whether to keep the fugitive alive or execute him in front of his companions. The moral choices proposed in Gods Will Be Watching are probably the most fascinating point of the work, the one that has allowed him to obtain the favors of critics from overseas. In the chapter set in the underground laboratory (the third) it will be possible to decide whether to inject an almost certainly lethal antidote to one of the trapped to verify its effectiveness, as well as in that of the camp (the fourth, a reinterpretation of the original episode) by eliminating mouths to feed, food supplies will be rationed for longer. The classic example of how you can't always make a good game out of a good idea The gods will raise the level of challenge At the end of each stage, a screen will compare the player's work with that of the other users, but, unfortunately, being magnanimous rather than ruthless will not lead to any practical consequences. In the second of the six missions, for example, the protagonist is, for a sort of law of retaliation, taken hostage right together with Jack. The terrible interrogation The task is to face lengthy interrogations during which the tormentors will not fail to torture the unfortunates. Burden could try to extend his life by sacrificing his partner who, however, as if by magic, would return to better shape than ever in the next scenario. Such lightness, if on the one hand it kept production costs at bay (it would have been much more laborious to create a sort of tree of choices) on the other it proves to be a double-edged sword, not only because it does not push the player to obtain the best judgement, but above all because it clashes with what are the claims of the title, which as written tends to emphasize the situations in which the most subtle reasoning can predict the upper hand. The level of challenge, especially high if you select the original mode conceived by the developers for the Ludum Dare, is mainly due to the impossibility of understanding the mechanisms underlying the game. Only in a couple of chapters, among which the one who had deserved the silver medal shines not at all, is it possible to give weight to the consequences of one's decisions, while in the rest the feeling of looking at random for the right sequence of actions in an attempt to take the right path is nothing short of irritating, also because, in case of failure, you have to start the whole level all over again. The gods will not approve Going back to the frustrating first scenario (the bad choice to propose it right at the beginning) too often it happens that we lose control over the hostages we thought were held in check. Certainly in this sense the graphic style does not help much, another widely celebrated aspect, the evaluation of which is however subjective. The gods judge at the end of each level The writer has never been particularly enthusiastic about the ~old school~ technique in modern video games (apart from a few rare exceptions), but Gods Will Be Watching must be given the merit of being able to convey, albeit with a few colored squares, the tension and violence that occur in certain situations. From this point of view, the interrogation scenario is probably the most successful, above all when one of the torturers aims the pistol at Burden's forehead in a Russian roulette reminiscent of Cimini. The soundtrack is very good, supporting a ~thriller-noir~ screenplay not free from mistakes (including grammatical ones) and clichs; it is a pity, however, that the missions adapt a bit by force to the narrative plot, making them almost more convincing if taken individually. The replay value, which as we wrote relies on the stat tree and the ever-challenging Steam achievements, isn't overly brilliant as the story continues unchanged regardless of how the (not numerous) missions are completed.", "date": "2014-08-01", "grade": "5.1"}
