Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent. Dota 2 has recently cleared one of the most popular videogame genres in recent years among ~hardcore~ RTS enthusiasts, precisely that of MOBAs, multiplayer online battle arena. These are titles designed for use exclusively in multiplayer, in which two teams (sometimes three) face each other within a map with the aim of eliminating their respective starting positions. Achieving this goal is far from easy, however: you must first sustain a certain number of clashes, leveling up your warriors and at the same time purchasing objects capable of improving their abilities. The gameplay is therefore divided into two phases: the first in which the ~grinding~ is carried out, perhaps trying not to be killed; the second in which the actual lunge is carried out, with the troops now ready to sustain more than one fight to achieve final victory. Although the touch control system of smartphones and tablets adapts very well to the dynamics of RTS, until now no one had thought of creating a MOBA for iOS or Android devices, probably because this genre of games requires a time commitment that goes far beyond the classic ~quick game~, with challenges that can last from a minimum of half an hour to a maximum of a couple of hours, depending on the skill of the participants. In the end it seems entirely coherent that it was Gameloft, one of the most committed companies on the mobile gaming front, who took the first step in this direction, creating a title based on the universe of the famous MMORPG Order & Chaos Online but whose gameplay and whose structure precisely obey the rules of multiplayer online battle arena. Pay to win? Fortunately no Let's start immediately by clarifying two aspects of Heroes of Order & Chaos. Firstly, the game can be downloaded for free from the App Store and Google Play, and the freemium dynamics are far from stringent. In fact, it is possible to play for free forever, without ever feeling the real need to put a hand in your wallet, if you are satisfied with using the ~characters of the week~ rather than choosing our champion freely from the squad. Secondly, the ~pay to win~ factor is very limited: those who use real money have more customization, can use any character and significantly reduce the time for respawn, but cannot buy upgrades other than simple recovery potions of health and mystical energy. The current offer includes only two maps, a total of thirty champions and two modes: three against three and five against five, which can also be played in single player with the use of bots. Apart from some inconvenience during the first few days, the matchmaking turns out to be quite fast and functional, leaving some aftermath in terms of lag as soon as the match starts, but solving the problem quite quickly (and we hope that the situation will improve further in the future). The control system allows you to choose between an RTS style, with the screen that must be touched to tell our character where to move, and an action type, with a virtual analog stick. It goes without saying that the experience is best enjoyed on terminals equipped with a large screen, in our case a third generation iPad, because the buttons to press on the touch screen are actually numerous and it is easy to confuse them. In fact, on the right side of the display there are four icons relating to as many ~special shots~, of an active or passive nature, which can be accessed from a certain level onwards, also choosing which ones to enhance. These skills complete each champion's move set in a way that is consistent with his nature: if we have a tank (big, slow and strong characters) we will therefore be able to make the earth tremble, perform a disruptive blow or activate a barrier that damages enemies; if instead we control a long range (capable of striking from a distance but poor in defense), our arrows or our spells will enjoy greater effectiveness, or we will be able to cover our retreat with poison, and so on. Gameloft has done an extraordinary job in the characterization of each hero, and also on the technical front Heroes of Order & Chaos proves to be excellent, thanks to the excellent design, a clever use of colors, the great detail of the scenarios and a full-bodied and enveloping sound .", "date": "2012-12-15", "grade": "8.2"}
