{"name": "StarDrive", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/118475-stardrive-la-nuova-frontiera.html", "text": "StarDrive is a mix of space RTS and 4X management created by a small team whose founder is a former divorce attorney from the state of Oregon. The launch of the title took place two years after Dan ~Zero~ DiCicco founded Zero Sum Games to embark on a Kickstarter campaign through which he obtained the funds with which to hire a graphic designer, a musician and some programmer part -time to help him. In short, we are talking about a title that arose exclusively from an idea and developed with decidedly modest means, but the genre to which it belongs almost automatically makes it an ambitious title with non-trivial mechanics. In these cases it is difficult to evaluate the work of others given that the production value is inevitably low and, at least initially, bugs and imbalances are almost inevitable, especially if the project concerns a strategic 4X space complex. In any case, despite the modest origins, it is immediately clear that the aesthetic sector of StarDrive defends itself adequately and there is no shortage of intriguing mechanics to support the gameplay. The starry background is suggestive, the soundtrack is enveloping and the title makes use of excellent quality drawings that outline rather original and appreciable vessels and races. One captain, there is only one captain! The first step, once the game has been launched, consists in calibrating the FTL speed and in activating, or not, the gravitational well of the planets. The ability to change these two parameters is very welcome since it can radically alter the experience. In fact, gravitational wells prevent you from making hyperspatial jumps and therefore hinder escape, while hyper-speed regulates the duration of the movements by altering the timing of the game. Once the basic parameters have been set, one then moves on to choosing the race, each of which is combined with a set of talents. These racial perks can be modified, increasing the personalization of the experience, and offer substantial bonuses that also alter the behavior of the artificial intelligence managed factions. As in any 4X, the center of the experience is space, an infinite ocean of possibilities, populated by bloodthirsty enemies, adrift ships and planets to conquer. And the StarDrive space allows the player to take direct control of his flagship by shooting opponents with the mouse. This formula, loudly advertised by the developers, enhances the action by allowing us to fight in first person between spaceships that follow credible trajectories, looking for the right line of fire and avoiding enemy shots. All this in battles that can get quite animated since the title allows us, with just a few clicks, to manage various fleets and also provides the possibility of setting up mass maneuvers before the start of the battle. In short, a sort of Men of War in a spatial key, combined with a 4X structure. Unfortunately, the first defect emerges from the RTS component which concerns that sore point in the videogame world called Artificial Intelligence. And this, in StarDrive, does not seem to be able to follow the aforementioned orders in a dignified way. Indeed, often our spaceships are not even able to proceed in formation making the role of admiral nothing short of thankless. Fortunately, the universe is large and it is not always necessary to postpone directly the scandalous shortcomings of our men. A space empire is inevitably huge and implies the possibility of delegating various tasks to artificial intelligence. This mechanic, in StarDriv, is facilitated by a simple, intuitive interface accompanied by useful preset shortcuts. To access the contextual options of planets, stations and space ships, for example, just select the object of interest and press the Q key. Diplomacy and espionage are included in a single convenient screen and with a click it is possible to view the balance global which represents the most important element when managing a galactic empire. This, in StarDrive also predicts details such as the resource storage capacity of a given planet. Once the stocks are filled, it is necessary to export the excess goods in order not to waste productivity and to supply any missing resources to another planet. On the other hand, population growth reduces food production and this factor can cause major sustainability problems. For this it is necessary to produce cargoes and assign them to transport so that they automatically redistribute resources. Adrift in space Technological advancement, another fundamental component of any self-respecting 4X title, is regulated through a coda of priority and consumes the research resource. The evolutionary trees are six and range from colonization, with techniques for exploiting resources and planetary defenses, up to socio-logistics that allows you to advance in the management model of the empire and even to carry out alien studies to obtain strategic advantages. The technologies, of course, include planetary management, also making it possible to improve the sustainability of a given ecosystem. The management of planetary structures takes place through a simple grid that becomes a strategic battlefield in the event of terrestrial conflicts. These don't add much to the gameplay and are completely unrelated to the space mechanics, but it is still a welcome addition that gives depth to the game universe. Of course, when a planet isn't occupied by another faction there's no need to bring out the artillery. The use of the Colonize command places the planet under our influence and thanks to the space highways it is possible to include it in a sort of protected sphere within which our spaceships enjoy various types of bonuses. Although the aesthetic sector is inevitably modest, StarDrive can count on a fair variety in the design of the vessels, on inspired alien races, on pleasant graphic details such as the hyperspace jump, on the implementation of gravitational wells, on the credible behavior of the spaceships and on a soundtrack simple but addictive. Furthermore, the customization of spaceships, focused on components rather than on aesthetics, is quite complex and allows us to create increasingly efficient transports and military ships. However, this is not an easy task and Zero Sum Games has well thought of not including detailed tooltips, making the first moments really hard and the first tests of the ships almost dramatic. A ship without shields but with a reactor in plain sight is a bomb ready to explode, while a freighter without thick bulkheads and with few reactors is all too easy prey. And this is the most successful feature of the title which, excluding customization and the possibility of piloting the flagship, is a not evil but at the same time not exciting 4X. Only three resources limit the management complexity already crippled by the low complexity of espionage and diplomacy. The interactions with the opposing factions are in fact limited and intergalactic trade provides for generic agreements without an economic macrosystem to make everything more interesting. In essence, too many elements are sacrificed, too many bugs and few side elements. In fact, there is no plot, there is no narrative thread that would certainly have enhanced the atypical elements of the game, and there is not even a multiplayer compartment (removed before launch and presumably postponed to a future update). In essence, the only way out of an endless skirmish is modding, a decidedly welcome element even if certainly not sufficient to raise the title above a meager sufficiency. The hope, therefore, lies in the updates, now an integral part of this type of publications that could lead StarDrive towards a desirable maturation.", "date": "2013-05-13", "grade": "6.2"}
