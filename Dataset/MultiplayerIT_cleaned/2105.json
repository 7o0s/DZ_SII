{"name": "Grand Theft Auto 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grand-theft-auto-3_a.html", "text": "The principle of everything Once you have opened the package (DVD style), browsed through the instruction manual (not exhaustive as it should, but that's it, also because it's practically identical to that of the 128-bit Sony version), pleased by the poster/map of the city where the game is set, installed Gta3 (less than half a gig, fortunately), inserted the second cd rom and made the appropriate settings (actually to a lesser extent than the usual average, between the settings for graphics, sound and assignment controls), we immerse ourselves in the criminal, cold and merciless world of Grand Theft Auto 3. The introduction, created with the game's graphics engine (made with Renderware middleware, owned by Criterion Software, also used by Konami for its football games Pro Evolution Soccer and International Superstar Soccer), with the addition of a pinch of motion blur (very fashionable since the release of Virtua Tennis in arcades), tells of a robbery, of those millionaires, of those that would have allowed to John, our alter ego and Maria, his fiance, to leave that corrupt city called Liberty City, leading a life of true billionaires. Fate, however, would have it that Maria wanted to keep the loot all to herself (or so it seems), betraying her hunk who was shot in the head and fell to the ground amidst the gushing blood, ready for a pleasant stay in a beautiful prison. Years later, John is uploaded to a cell phone to be transferred from prison, with other inmates as ~8 ball~, who manage to gain freedom during the night. ~8 Ball~ invites you to get in touch with an Italian/American boss, Luigi, who de facto controls the ~prostitute district~ of Liberty City. From here begins your rise to power, as well as the foundation for one of the most incredible video games ever created. Liberty City That DNA Design and Rockstar Games have given the name of Liberty City to the city where the game is entirely set, can be understood after the first half hour of the game. A small digression, however, allow it to the writer: one of the greatest merits of a videogame masterpiece par excellence, such Super Mario 64 (the platform that in fact gave birth to three-dimensional platform games), was the one that allowed itself to be played divinely despite the non-completion of the missions that the game required: between one star and another to recover, the gamer wandered through the levels, hopping merrily from one side to the other, went for a swim to look at submerged vessels, did some snowboarding in the snowy levels, ending with some flying, free in the sky; all these characters have served (or so we hope) to explain one of the greatest strengths of Grand Theft Auto 3, or the enormous sense of freedom left to the player, whether he is involved in a mission or not. Just before writing these lines, we had just returned from a game session lasting about fifteen minutes in which, without fulfilling any mission of those bosses or bigwigs of the various criminal families (Italian, Chinese, American ) they will persistently feed us. The question you might ask is, of course, the following: what the hell did you do then? Well, simply, we took a walk around the city, improving our alter ego's resistance to running, we beat up a guy who we decidedly didn't like (thankfully without any desire to react) sending him to the other world (among other things by lightening his pocket of his possessions), we then positioned ourselves near a traffic light, we ~kindly asked~ the owner of a rover to get out of his (former) four-wheeler (taking advantage of the fact that the traffic light was , obviously, red) and to donate it to us, so we took a tour around the city, we invested a few too many big fat ones (also taking their hard-earned savings) and we had the car repainted so as not to arouse the suspicions of the chaff. Dulcis in fundo, we loaded a prostitute into the car, we went out of town tomake a nice double (err) and, let's give Caesar what belongs to Caesar, she was so good that we let her go with his fee, since it would have been a shame to invest it and get the nest egg back, right? Since we are famous for our fussiness, we specify that during everything that happened to us, there was a downpour which fortunately lasted just a couple of hours (obviously simulated), followed by a truly evocative sunset which he could see from the place where we scrapped the car and then, late at night we went to rest.Liberty City The next morning (that is when we have finished writing this review), we will have to go to work otherwise the dindi are never enough. Indeed, now that it comes to mind, we will go out at night leaving some fool lying on the ground and we will further fill up our finances, there is a beautiful machine gun that attracts us from the windows of the gun shop which is a love; at worst, we take a ride in the car (or taxi, so we put even more dough aside, emulating Sega's famous Craxy Taxi) and, volume blast, we switch between one radio and another, each with its own particular style musical: dance music, Rock, revival, even opera music, as well as stations entirely dedicated to very interesting talk shows with the various Costanzos of Liberty City. We sincerely hope that the very long preamble has served to give you a very precise idea of the micro-universe created by American coders, among the most realistic environments that have ever graced our monitors (and TVs). The first hour of the game is almost always resolved in the total amazement of the gamer: cars that respect the signs (stop at red, start at green, let pedestrians pass quietly on the crossing, etc.), variable weather conditions (rain, fog , sun, night, etc) and resulting number of NPCs around: if the traffic is consistent during the day and there are lots of people wandering around, on the contrary, at night, you can go around the city with your car at unheard-of speeds, while the people you will meet at night will mainly be prostitutes (complete with their own sector of the city), bums and ugly thugs who more than once will perform robberies and muggings (which still happen, albeit to a lesser extent, even in the morning and afternoon). In case someone is injured (you hit him, there was a fight, etc.), you will see the ambulance rush to the place of the tragic event with sirens blaring as quickly as possible, to then see the poor fellow loaded with it ( or taking care of him directly on the spot) and/or police patrols who want to ascertain what happened; obviously nothing prevents you from stealing the ambulance or the cops' car, perhaps after having extracted the shotgun and having carried out a massacre. Trust me, what you have read so far is, yes and no, 30% of what you can do, depending on your morals and your tastes, we will not ~spoil~ further, certain that this taste has tickled your imagination. The possibilities are really many (there are also some decidedly inviting subgames) so much so that. we have so far only talked about everything that is a mere accessory of the game, since what matters in Gta3 are the.. Assignments ~Without work, you can't make love~, they say, so John's main prerogative is to amass as many dindi as possible, an aim that can be achieved mainly through the chores that will be entrusted to you. It starts with recent assignments, such as taking the prostitute Misty to take her to her boyfriend, who is also no good, we continue with murders, thefts, life lessons (stealing a car, making us put a bomb on it, returning it to where you have it borrowed with the following..BOOM!!), occasionally improvising us as taxi drivers (for example, in a mission you have to bring as many prostitutes as possible to the police station for a party) or robbers of those who mobilize 40 cars from the police with attached helicopters (attack on a security van, for example). Obviously, with your deeds becoming increasingly difficult and, therefore, famous, the leaders of the underworld will increasingly want to have a man of your talent, now serving Luigi Leone, later helping the Diablos, up to making agreements with the Yakuza. However, committing infractions, murders or muggings, near police cars or, even worse, near the plant, will not fail to attract the attention of the cops to you (this can be seen from the number of stars you will have at the top right of the screen), crushing all your ambitions, despite the first few times (or if you will be caught in the act during criminal acts of little importance) you can get away with a fine or a few days in jail. Miiii how nice The minimum requirements to play Gta3 settle on a P3 / Athlon 450, 96 mb of ram and video card with 16 megabytes of memory. The recommended requirements, to more than worthily enjoy the Dma Design and Rockstar Games game, are higher, settling on a processor of the aforementioned class, but with a speed of 700 mhz, over 128 mb of ram (now recommendedstandard 256 mb) and an accelerated video card with at least 32 mb of ram. In any case, Direct X 8.1 is indispensable. The (very funny) test on Gta3 was conducted on a P3 933, 256 mb of ram at 133 mhz and GeForce 3 Titanium 200, with all the details at maximum. As has already happened for other portings from Playstation 2, Grand Theft Auto 3 has also been slavishly converted, with the (at least obvious) addition of being able to choose the resolution that best suits us, the level of distance of the landscape, the sound more suitable for our sound card and the choice of keyboard or joypad inputs (both excellent, with a slight preference for the gamepad, given the ~comfortable~ origin of the product in question). Let's get our hands on, the only technical defects, for once slightly negligible, concern the uncertain fluidity and some polygonal constructions, of decidedly low quality. The graphics engine of the game, as mentioned in the initial paragraph, was created with Renderware, a middleware created by Criterion Software that allows you to obtain good visual results with almost minimal work. Unfortunately, with this system, it is impossible to program superfluid graphic marvels or with special effects worthy of the hardware on which it is programmed and Playstation 2 users are well aware of this by now, given that Konami's best-selling Pro Evolution Soccer, also made with Renderware, presents an excellent fluidity, partially sacrificing the cosmetics, or rather the absence of referee and linesman, a very badly made crowd and textures with far from irresistible detail, more or less the same fate that the sequel will suffer in October (Konami will use Renderware for other 3 years). Miiii how nice Gta3 is certainly a much more complex game than any football simulator, but luckily the final result is more than good: the characters are made fairly well (even if the diversity between the sprites is not as high as the case would require) and although the number of polygons are not the highest, facial animations are reduced almost to the bone; fortunately, however, there are many different animations (and some quite hilarious cases) that do not regret this lack. The textures are really beautiful, also because unlike the equally identical version for the Sony black monolith, on PC it is possible to use higher resolutions than the classic 640x480. The buildings, or rather, the majority of them, are quite bland to look at, apart from those important for the economy of the game, more than sufficient; the eighty plus different vehicles (whose drivability can vary considerably from one model to another) enjoy a realization without infamy and without praise, however necessary in order not to put the hardware in use on the ropes, so it is a welcome limitation , especially when you notice reflections (unfortunately not in real time) well implemented on the sheet metal or when, after numerous collisions, your vehicle starts to lose doors, windscreens along the way, gradually igniting until the final bang (and, we hope for you, quick escape). The special effects such as rain, fog and sunset are very beautiful and will certainly make you smile with satisfaction. The other painful graphic side is, as anticipated a few lines further up, the fluidity: as in the Playstation 2 version, the fluidity varies from fifteen frames per second to a scant thirty, same performances recorded on the computer used for the review. However, as happens in most PC games, some snaps never seen on consoles, unfortunately, peep out there. Taking into account the enormous amount of graphics managed and the complex artificial intelligence routines that manage pedestrians and motorists, as well as the different climatic conditions, the result obtained is truly remarkable and leaves room for few regrets, let's only hope that the already announced sequel uses a brand new graphics engine that can fully squeeze the video chipset of Playstation 2 and modern PC graphics cards. Check this out man If there's one thing no gamer can argue about, well, that's the sound side of Gta3. When in the third paragraph we talked about going around in the car, going from one radio to another, each with its own sound and its own djs, we weren't saying nonsense; turn on Head Radio to be carried away by the beautiful ~Change~ by Conor & Jay or ~Fade Away~ by Craig Gray, while the deejay Micheal Hunt changes track; do you love opera?
