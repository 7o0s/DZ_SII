{"name": "Crazy Frog Racer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crazy-frog-racer.html", "text": "Putting together a nice character and catchy music, with the glue of a computer graphic video, has literally transformed Crazy Frog into a global success: everyone knew it, everyone had the clip on their mobile phone and the creators of the ~crazy frog~ rightly decided to take advantage of it. In addition to the distribution of ringtones, logos and so on, the franchise has peeped into the world of video games with a series of titles of which Crazy Frog Racer represents just a taste. It is a racing game that takes up what was seen in the video clip with the musical theme of ~Beverly Hills Cop~, leaning on a structure very similar to that used for the various wipEouts: you choose a character from the eight available and launch inside futuristic circuits, on the surface of which there are all kinds of objects. The start screen allows us to choose whether to try our hand at a single race or tackle the ~Via della Rana~, or a sort of ~story mode~ built on several circuits in sequence. Once on the track, Crazy Frog Racer proves to be quite classic in its setting, if we exclude the possibility of making jumps (both to overtake opponents and to collect objects positioned high up). The characters on paper boast different characteristics, which however do not weigh that much in the race. The presence of the objects adds a strategic element to the game, but their ~random~ determination disappoints: you collect a power-up and in the upper part of the screen the various possibilities scroll rapidly, until you stop on the one which you can then activate by pressing the joystick in on or with the 2 key of the numeric pad. The three difficulty levels present allow us to approach the races in the way we prefer, but generally it is enough to have a ~clean~ race and be careful of collisions with opponents to reach the finish line first, without any problems. Collisions are unfortunately one of Crazy Frog Racer's weak points, not so much because each impact results in a sudden slowdown and a consequent loss of energy, but because the sprites are not ~scaled~ as necessary to be able to make corrections to the trajectory you need to avoid them: they appear suddenly and it's hard not to hit them. Each race takes place over several laps, giving us the opportunity to recover from unfavorable positions, but we will have to be careful to conserve the character's energy or possibly collect refueling kits in order not to risk early withdrawal... Crazy Frog Racer is available in two versions: a ~classic~ one, therefore with sprites on a polygonal track, and a completely 3D one. Both boast a good technical realization, both as regards the design of the characters and, in particular, the quality and variety of the scenarios where the races take place. The 3D version is slower, though, and suffers from major background-related pop-up issues; flaws that can't be wiped out by the bonus of the first person view alone. As for the sound, we have some well-made and rather catchy music to underline the various phases of the action. The control system is quite simple: acceleration is automatic and you simply need to press the joystick left and right to change direction, the 0 key of the numeric pad to jump and the 2 key (up the joystick) to activate the newly collected item. PRO Nice graphics Proven play structure Good number of different circuits AGAINST Collisions sometimes unavoidable The 3D version is slow and suffers from pop-ups Questionable object handling", "date": "2007-12-06", "grade": "S.V."}
