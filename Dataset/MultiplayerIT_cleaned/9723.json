His colleagues can't get him out, so he decides to explore the surroundings to see if there is a way out. On his way he finds a mysterious device that seems to be built with human bones, but he doesn't understand how to use it until a huge metal sphere appears in front of him: the tool has magnetic properties that allow him to control it, attract it to himself even if is at a great distance or throw it violently away. The sphere will become his only hope of survival in a world that only appears to be uninhabited: soon ferocious and gruesome creatures will smell its scent and attack. This is the plot of The Ball, a title that ranked second in the 2010 edition of the ~Make Something Unreal~ competition organized by Epic to discover new talent. We are dealing with a truly original application of Unreal Engine 3, which in this case is used not for the creation of a classic first person shooter, but rather a first person adventure in which puzzles play a role foreground. In fact, the protagonist must drag the huge sphere we have talked about within eight scenarios and use its mass and peculiarities to open doors, activate switches and eliminate threats. The fights are also based on the management of this kind of metallic boulder, which can be shot away with force to break through walls and crush mummies, as well as manage to shatter anything it encounters on its way back. A game ball? The Ball clearly distances itself from any FPS, as mentioned above, and this becomes clear as soon as we realize that the ball will be the only weapon available to us during the game. A difficult thing to digest, especially considering the fact that our character remains completely helpless without it: when he controls its movement and keeps it close, he can use its mass and resistance to take shelter from bullets, exploit its height to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, break through walls or use his special ability to ~bind~ to certain blocks of stone; on the contrary, without it our dear archaeologist cannot defend himself in any way, not even by shaking the device made of human bones, and must necessarily regain control of it in order to survive. As original as a solution of this type may be, it has to deal with scenario exploration dynamics that are inevitably weighed down by the task of having to carry around a large metal boulder. For example, if we find ourselves passing over a very narrow bridge and we inadvertently drop the sphere to the lower level, we will have to go back, retrieve it and redo the route. There is little space for ~solo~ actions, i.e. without the sphere, precisely due to the lack of alternative solutions in the event of an enemy attack. The same puzzles, basically based on pressing two different buttons (one that can be activated by the character, the other by the sphere) or on inserting blocks inside slits (using our bone tool to ~push~ them) do not contribute to create a picture made of extraordinary thickness, but rather they are sometimes too simplistic or in any case already seen. The charm of the underground city, endowed with its own red ~sky~, with now abandoned houses and above all with dungeons that are too similar to each other, unfortunately, tends to diminish rapidly when one realizes that the level of interactivity with the environment it is almost nil (the sphere smashes the crates and vases placed on the edge of the path, but what's the point?) and exploration, as already mentioned, appears superfluous as well as uncomfortable to put into practice. Fortunately, this does not mean that the experience, in its entirety, is not enjoyable: bearing in mind the budget nature of the product, completing the scenarios and finding a solution to each puzzle proves to be pleasant all in all. We are not dealing with a new Portal, this is clear, but The Ball certainly has its own reason in the current range of titles on Steam. The presence of the ~survival~ mode also guarantees a few extra hours of fun with a distinctly action character, given that it is a question of surviving a certain number of waves of enemies, using in this case not only the sphere but also a whole series of traps that can be activated via the usual switches. Technical realization From puFrom a graphic point of view, the game alternates convincing solutions with less brilliant ones. Our ~weapon~ is fascinating, with its luminous skull, even if the system that allows it to ~push~ the sphere appears frankly mysterious. Similarly, the ~open~ scenarios are evocative, with good use of colors and light sources, characterized by a natural predominance of red tones. The creatures we face appear to be fairly made and boast good artificial intelligence, in fact they do not wait passively to be invested by our metal boulder and often we have to insist a little on crushing them, but precisely their dismemberment is a bit dated. And ~dated~ is the right attribute to describe a large part of the visual sector of The Ball, which takes advantage of the Unreal Engine 3 but obviously does so without the resources and attention to detail typical of the large software houses, those to be clear with a flood of divisions and employees. The graphics engine itself proves to be far too heavy for what it shows, holding the sixty frames per second only in relatively calm situations and dropping to thirty-five to forty when things get busier. The audio is essential, but unfortunately the poor quality of the localization in Italian is striking, especially as regards the dubbing (guys, we don't expect experienced actors but a diction course is the bare minimum).", "date": "2010-10-19", "grade": "7.2"}
