The basic idea is to combine Elite-style space simulation with resource and crew management somewhat similar to The Sims, and it's a really interesting concept, it just doesn't really quite work out to be a convincing amalgamation, leaving the task incomplete in both directions. It is a question of commanding a spaceship in various missions, mainly concerning the trade and transport of people and objects, around various planets and systems, essentially managing the vessel and the crew through a complex control interface, navigating between options and menus. The challenge arises from the need to keep an eye on a large number of parameters in order to be able to carry on the business, such as the money needed to pay for ship upgrades, repairs and obviously crew salaries, travel times that they must respect the limits imposed by the various clients of the voyages and many other stratified elements in the management structure, from the organization of the spaces on the ship to the state of health and serenity of the employees, up to the battles against the warlike space travelers who populate the interplanetary routes . Contrary to what we are used to seeing in the mobile sector, Cosmonautica does not have an easy and intuitive approach, on the contrary it is particularly difficult from the start given the need to carefully calculate the moves to be made in the first few minutes, in order not to risk getting stuck in a negative spiral of economic and personnel losses that are difficult to resolve. From this point of view, the presence of a somewhat incomplete and vague tutorial and a very steep difficulty curve does not help, which makes it difficult to enter the game mechanisms gradually, given the possibility of slipping into dead ends already taking the first steps in space trading . Not that the high level of challenge is an a priori negative element, far from it, just that there are inconsistencies in the organization of the missions, such as the possible impossibility of selling certain quantities of materials in the foreseen ports due to lack of space to part of the traders, the mismatch between the times necessary to complete a mission with the limits imposed by the latter or other intricate situations that demonstrate how the general design has been properly studied to offer a certainly challenging gaming experience, but even unpleasant. How hard is the space trader's life? Find out with Cosmonautics Space merchant It is clear that Cosmonautica is a title designed primarily to be played on PC, with a rather basic mobile adaptation of the interface that is not particularly enjoyable on touch screens. The icons are often very small and the enormous amount of text to read in the windows makes it practically prohibitive to use on smartphones, finding the right size only on tablets. The whole game is based on navigation within various menus, with brief digressions represented by battles and interplanetary travel. The first take place by pressing keys to set different predetermined maneuvers and approaches, in a sort of strategic chess game. The travel management is also particularly far from the normal mobile style, which even by speeding up time essentially force us to wait a few minutes, perhaps taking a close look (but without the possibility of interaction) at the crew's activities. The structure of Cosmonautics is extremely multifaceted and stratified and it is difficult to explain in short: essentially it is a question of visiting planets and space stations accepting various job offers, hiring and managing the crew in order to make it as efficient as possible according to the different specializations and personal tendencies, trading with shopkeepers, fighting and transporting materials and people, sometimes illegally, between the various planets and organizing the spaces inside the ship by installing instruments and rooms of various types in order to expand and modify the vehicle characteristics. Everything is complicated by a large number of variables and factors to keep under control, such as the constraints imposed by time and finances, any health or behavioral problems of the crew and the constant need to devote time to research scientists of board on new areas of space to explore or on ulterthe most technological elements to be applied to the ship. We therefore find ourselves mediating between various problems, making sure we respect the parameters and following alarm signals or status bars at every moment of the game with the impression of never being able to precisely dominate the events and only interacting in a very indirect way with the elements at stake. Conversely, in the midst of such a chaos of problems to manage, if you manage to get into the mechanism well and assisted by a little luck, the fact of being able to progress in the game gives a certain satisfaction, especially when you manage to pass all purchase of larger ships and advanced internal equipment, but both in the Campaign mode and in the sandbox there are no particular objectives to be achieved to give a real sense of progression beyond the iron will to keep all the indicators positive. In all this gray accounting, what considerably raises Cosmonautics is the cartoonish and humorous characterization chosen by the developers Chasing Carrots, which creates a particular contrast with the structural seriousness and manages to make the game's spatial world intriguing despite the difficult impact with the first steps inside. Good technical implementation considering the genre, even if the not exactly advanced graphics hardly justify the exorbitant minimum request for an iPhone 6 or an iPad 3 to be able to play.", "date": "2015-09-22", "grade": "6.0"}
