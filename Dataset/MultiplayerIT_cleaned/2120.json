The first impression I got trying KK2002 is that the game has been made less simulative than the previous version. The result is immediately visible due to the increased speed and frenzy of ~melee~ fights. Fortunately, all this translates into a more engaging and spectacular gaming experience, capable of exalting not only boxing enthusiasts but also the occasional geek. However, the most substantial innovation is made up of the renewed control system, now more immediate and precise, although it still needs a study phase in order to be able to learn it in its entirety. With the left analog stick you control the movement of the boxer to the right and left, towards the opponent or backwards, when you want to get away from unpleasant situations. In proximity of the opponent, the same analog stick assumes a dual function that will allow us to dodge blows and make feints simply by pressing the stick halfway. With the remaining keys it will instead be possible to score all the classic blows reported by the boxing manuals such as hooks, uppercuts, jabs and even illegal blows, which will however cost us a warning from the referee (after 3 warnings we will be disqualified) . Also inevitable is the key through which to taunt our opponent, a more fun than useful feature. The R2 key is instead entrusted with the important task of recalling the special blow, specific to each boxer and able to give us a good advantage if used at the right time. Muhammad Ali is back! Testimonial and superstar of Knockout Kings 2002 is once again Muhammad Ali, rejuvenated for the occasion and present in the game together with forty-four other myths of the past and champions of the present belonging to the three main categories: heavyweight, middleweight and lightweight. Among the old glories, in addition to Al, we find Joe Frazier, Sugar Ray Leonard and ~our~ Roberto Duran. Among the boxers currently active, there are Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield (will his ear grow back? :) ) and Oscar De La Hoya. The selection of arenas available is also very vast, among which the legendary Caesars Palace in Las Vegas stands out, the scene of numerous challenges in recent years. Through the exhibition, tournament and career modes, we will have the possibility to enter the ring in a ~friendly~ match or to participate in a prestigious competition that will see us engaged in a series of matches with opponents controlled by the CPU or our friends. The career mode is certainly the most interesting section and will allow us to create our own boxer, customize his appearance and technical skills and start a climb which, if completed, will lead us straight to a dream match with the king of boxing gloves, Muhammad Ali. More arcade, more realistic Moving on to the actual game, it must be said that KK2002, although it proves to be simpler and more immediate than in the past, certainly does not lose ground in terms of realism and depth. The variety of shots that can be performed is truly remarkable, just as the effects produced by each hit are notably different. The tactical management of the match is of a certain importance and, depending on the strength of the opponent or the situation, we can decide to launch ourselves into suicidal attacks, to distance ourselves waiting for the right moment, or to remain on the defensive and then come out with vehement attacks by surprise. All this contributes to making the game very enjoyable and fun, perhaps a little arcadey but no less satisfying. To be picky, a couple of flaws can still be found. First of all, the lack of support for the analog functionality of the PS2 pad keys. From this it follows that it is not possible to adjust the power of the blows based on the pressure of the buttons, in this way each punch will always have the same effect. Another small flaw is the difficulty of executing low blows (to the body) and the equally difficult defense against low blows. But they are alive! It is certainly not a novelty that Electronic Arts pays great attention to the technical realization and in fact Knockout Kings 2002 also defends itself quite well also on the audio-visual side. Compared to last year, there seems to have been a significant leap forward especially as regards the polygonal models of the boxers (splendid), the textures that cover them and above all the animations, now more fluid and realistic. A note of merit also goes to the facial expressions that give life to godssonaggi that never as in this case seem little virtual and very real. The same visual magnificence is not found in the construction of the arenas (however good) and above all in the public. It would also be time for our 128-bit super consoles to give us a three-dimensional audience and not stickers moved by 2 frames of animation. On the other hand, only good things can be said about the sound. The excellent sound effects are accompanied by a commentary (English) worthy of the name and a sufficiently catchy hip-hop soundtrack. Can't really complain... ..8...9...10! You are out! Knockout Kings 2002 easily conquers the scepter of best boxing simulation on the market, managing to offer us a significantly improved game compared to its predecessor. There is certainly no shortage of defects, after all perfection does not exist in the videogame field, but I am convinced that the game will be able to give emotions at will to all PS2 (and XBox) owners, boxing enthusiasts and more. KK2002 is in fact simple and immediate enough to be attractive to anyone, even novice gamers. If, on the other hand, you don't like boxing, you will hardly dwell on a title which, however valid, does not offer the same level of depth as fighting games of the caliber of Virtua Fighter 4 and Tekken 4, already admired on PS2 Jap. I advise everyone else to think about it, but be careful! Knockout Kings 2002 could knock you out if you fall short of Mohammad Ali. :) Pros: Fast, frantic, spectacular, fun.. Lots of punches available Impactful graphics Improved control system 45 boxers! Cons: Does not use analog keys Some graphical defects Missing Mike Tyson Lewis vs. Tyson While the boxing world wonders about the lack of public interest in it in recent years, preparations are underway for the match on June 8th that will see Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis cross gloves in the ring in Memphis, Elvis Presley's city. This could be yet another attempt to restore credibility to a sport that for too long has lived on false stars and farce matches. Will Iron Mike be able to regain the reunified heavyweight crown after a few years of chasing? We will have the answer in just over three weeks, so we just have to prepare for the event with a healthy dose of virtual boxing, perhaps less exciting than the real one, but fortunately also less painful. When it comes to boxing on consoles, it is inevitable that you immediately think of Knockout Kings, a boxing simulation by Electronic Arts which this year has reached the fourth edition of a series that gains greater acclaim every year. Are you eager to know what new Knockout Kings 2002 has to offer? don't be impatient and take your seats... The match is about to begin!", "date": "2002-05-16", "grade": null}
