Sylvester Stallone has entered the collective imagination by right by playing this character as muscular as he is tormented, a veteran from Vietnam who finds himself back in war. First in an American town, following the arrogance of a sheriff who doesn't want trouble with the veterans but ends up creating quite a few; then again in Vietnam and Russia, to fight battles that seemed to be over but instead left a long aftermath of violence and tensions. It is not the first time that Rambo becomes the protagonist of a video game, but things from this point of view have never gone the right way and probably the best transposition remains the arcade shooter Rambo III, which circulated in the arcade in the early 90s and that you may remember for the cabin with attached Uzi machine gun. The new multiplatform production created by Teyon unfortunately does not improve the average and indeed ends up burying it, giving us a mediocre mix of railgun shooter and first-person quick time events whose levels are based on the situations seen in the three films, naturally enriched with unpublished events for be able to reach about four hours of duration. Rambo: The Video Game may be the worst video game of the year... and it's still February I'm starting a war you don't even dream of The first stages of Rambo: The Video Game represent a synthesis of what we must also expect in the rest of the campaign. We begin with John Rambo's funeral ceremony (a very good omen, no doubt about it), in which an anonymous officer says that it was a good thing that he died (as well!) because during his ~career~ he killed quite a few few people. So the first ~flashback~ starts, i.e. the mission in which Rambo is still in Vietnam, a prisoner together with his companions, and manages with a flash to free himself just before being killed, obtaining a rifle and making his way through the enemy ranks in waiting for reinforcements. This section, which represents the bulk of the gameplay, works exactly like a gun shooter, with the only problem that we don't actually have a gun. We will therefore have to control the aiming reticle by acting on the analog sticks, a real nightmare due to the semi-automatic coupling system, which only makes everything even more imprecise, and excessive sensitivity of the commands. Fortunately, it is possible to modify both parameters and obtain at least a decent response to inputs, advancing from one position to another and trying to expose yourself to enemy fire as little as possible. It is not always possible, in the sense that the possibility of crouching or hiding behind cover is not taken for granted (nor does it guarantee immunity to all enemies' blows) and in some moments we will necessarily have to eliminate everything that moves on the screen to avoid to take too much damage. Finally, once the ~fury~ bar is loaded, we will be able to activate a special mode by pressing the A button and hit the Viet Cong to recover vital energy. This is the only way to avoid game over, given that the difficulty is fairly high but above all the hitboxes leave a lot to be desired. In case of death, we will have five ~lives~ available to start over from the last checkpoint, otherwise we will have to start over. Xbox 360 goals The twenty-seven objectives of Rambo: The Video Game are achieved by looking for the best possible performance in the levels, therefore carefully avoiding enemy fire and placing a good amount of headshots. Getting two stars in the various stages translates into the unlocking of as many achievements, while for the others we move on to numerical issues: killing a certain number of enemies, reaching certain score multipliers and so on. Day to day If the rail sections make up the bulk of the gameplay, there are clearly parts of the film trilogy that did not lend themselves to firefights (not even those added for the occasion) and that the developers have seen fit to represent through sequences filled with quick time event. The result, if possible, is worse than the parts where you shoot: the interactive component is reduced to a minimum, the challenge is practically nil and the visual spectacle offered by the game is terrible, even comical at times. Just think of when our character escapes from the police station in the first film, always facing the same policemen in the rooms of the building! One, in particular, the guy who is thrown into a glass window, at one point made us an incredible pain, since he was the one who took more blows than tall, in the sense that his polygonal model was re-proposed in the most painful situations. Even on the technical front, beyond a dignified realization of the forest, always that of the first film, Rambo: The Video Game is a bitter disappointment. The protagonist has a head so big that it seems they wanted to make a parody of it, the polygonal construction is poor and everything smells terribly of ~old gen~. The question of enemies all the same is however the most serious thing, and if in the case of the Viet Cong perhaps little attention is paid to it, when the policemen or the military are fought this defect appears in all its evidence. Not even the sound is saved: the music is that of the trilogy and therefore well known to the fans, but it was decided to re-propose the same dialogues between the characters, evidently capturing them with a cassette recorder from an old VHS and without operating any equalization, so that in some cases the echo effect of the speakers is even heard.", "date": "2014-02-28", "grade": "3.0"}
