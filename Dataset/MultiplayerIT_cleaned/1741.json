{"name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-splinter-cell_a.html", "text": "Freedom to amaze. In Splinter Cell, under the command of Sam Fisher, we are called to assume the main role of an interactive novel of political fiction, which is not so much fiction. The president of Georgia, Nikoladze, plans to make the United States pay for its hegemonic role with a series of terrorist attacks on a global scale. The crux of the matter unravels from the disappearance of two agents infiltrated into enemy ranks, Sam is sent to find out what happened to them and then find themselves in the midst of an international crisis involving remnants of the former Soviet Union and China. Plot aside, which is decidedly inspired by recent, sad news events, what is striking is the way in which this is told. There are no monologues on the future of the world or lessons to impart, there is a story to be played with the greatest possible identification. The player, after a short tutorial that teaches the basics of the gameplay and the skills (many) Sam has, is launched in apnea on an exciting mission, where small brushstrokes gradually reveal the general picture of a colossal story. The missions are interspersed with news reporting our deeds in the third person, the details and events are perceived through notes left on computers and sheets of paper, through conversations stolen from guards and soldiers, hiding in the shadows or using futuristic directional microphones . These, together with any other device you can imagine, are made available to us to face and overcome the different game situations. The charm of Splinter Cell lies precisely in this freedom that is granted. There is no single way to solve a problem, there are always at least a couple. At the beginning of the stage we are given weapons and gadgets, but many times we find ourselves coming out alive (with difficulty, it must be said) without having used them, without knowing why they were given to us as a gift. The beauty will be to find out for yourself, try to figure out how else you can overcome groups of vigilant and ready to shoot guards, to be ready when it will be necessary to empty our inventory. The guards then wander around the different locations following precise patterns, but only until we attract their attention, throwing an object, making noise, making us glimpse. From that moment on, anything can happen and, by doing the same pattern twice, you will rarely find yourself in the exact same conditions as the previous time. Obviously, there is also a downside and when, towards the final stages, the development team decided to restrict this freedom to make it more difficult to complete the game, we find ourselves caught off guard in front of some sequences that require a precise execution to be faced and which, since there will be no one to help us, can only be overcome thanks to us and our inventiveness. It may also happen that you are no longer able to turn off the lights in a room, shooting, to hide, for no other reason than that of a choice to make the game more challenging. This does nothing but remind us that we are playing and makes us understand how skilled the Ubi Soft guys have been in recreating an absolutely realistic setting. When this veil of solidity is broken, one is struck, but then one returns to playing more decisively than before. These observations make the idea of a fascinating game, but not for all palates. Splinter Cell's accelerator is decisively pressed in the direction of a reflexive game, where acting in the shadows is almost always the preferable way to a bombastic shootout in the midst of ruthless opponents. It takes patience and brains. Without forgetting that Fisher is still a soldier and that, another advantage of this title, is lowered into a game with a modular level design. Our hero knows how to shoot, as well as hide in the shadows, and he will happen to find himself in some schemes, in which the game will make us understand that it is time to let go, come out and fire without fear, for some exciting sequences. Eye light. The first thing that strikes you about Splinter Cell is definitely the graphics. Spectacular and cared for in every detail, with excellent render quality. The work of the development team to be able to optimize the Unreal engine and squeeze the Xbox as it deserves is remarkable, even if not without flaws. The illusion of a game, which finally pushes the Microsoft console beyond the fateful 30fps, vanishes in front of the first structurally complex schemes and the first crowded sequences, but the Ubi Soft title always remains endowed witha stable and satisfying fluidity. Sam Fisher's thousand animations are very accurate and well connected to each other, but there are a few collision problems. It happens to cling to a rope with a bottle in hand and that it gets stuck in the ceiling above. Walking crouched on the steps of a flight of stairs, the soldier's feet will not adhere perfectly to them and Sam will be floating in the air. Aiming in the most scrupulous way, our bullets will not always hit the target for which they were intended. These small details are striking, like some game design choices, because they distract from an absolutely realistic and credible general picture. If, however, the choices in the gameplay are final, these small inaccuracies could have been avoided. They are, however, bread crumbs on a table where a sumptuous banquet has taken place. The study of lights and surfaces is unprecedented and at times exciting. You learn to recognize the type of light source in a room before you even enter it. The glow of a neon lamp, a copper wire, a flashing LED, a computer screen left on or in stand-by, each of these light sources has a different and perfectly recognizable warmth and intensity, before stand before your eyes. Even more impressive is the effect that these lights have on the backdrops, which react differently depending on the material they are made of. By moving the camera it is, therefore, possible to understand whether one is moving on a metal or marble floor only by the reflections that the light creates when it is refracted, it is possible to be convinced that one is looking at a wooden, plastic or other wall, only with the corner of the eye. These visual goodies are not futile, they are not a habit, but they are absolutely functional to playability. To know where a soldier, a passer-by is, we will have to follow his shadows through a curtain, on a floor, on furniture. And the shadows of Splinter Cell do not hide, on the contrary, they are admired and followed because they are needed to continue in the game. Turning a light on or off becomes fundamental and vital. As well as listening to the footsteps or the noises of the sound environment that surrounds us in the missions. The sound system of Splinter Cell is, without fear of contradiction, of the same level as the graphic one for the variety and quality of the effects. Footsteps resonate differently depending on the material you walk on, depending on whether or not there are debris or glass splinters on the floor. The same goes for the dubbing, entirely in Italian and of an excellent level, all the more important in a game where certain aspects of the plot can be revealed to us by a conversation that takes place in an elevator, caught with a laser microphone, in the midst of guards. By listening, we will find all the noises necessary to reconstruct the scene. The footsteps of the patrolling guards, their voices, the noise of the lift, the hum of the radio waves of the transmission and, ultimately, the words we are interested in hearing. Be careful, however, if we also hear a noise produced by our steps, it means that something has been done wrong and we will probably be discovered. Comment Splinter Cell was one of the most pleasant novelties of 2002, despite the choice to join the trend inaugurated by one of the most famous and celebrated games of the 32-bit era: Metal Gear Solid. However, it frees itself decisively from the heavy legacy of this game, taking up only a few elements and taking them in new directions, thanks to Xbox technology and thanks to some good, well-executed ideas. Splinter Cell is a beautiful game with a great personality, not perfect, but it remains one of the best experiences that the Microsoft console can currently offer. With the possibility of renewing the contents, thanks to the use of the Xbox Live service, which will allow you to download new missions and gadgets from the network, Splinter Cell is a must for Xbox owners and an excellent reason to consider buying it. The game from Ubi Soft's Canadian studios is also arriving on other consoles, but Sam Fisher's viewer, incredibly invisible to any guard, shines with a green light and our soldier seems to have Xbox sewn on him from the first to the last stunt. You can wait or you can play. To you the choice. Pros Sublime technical achievement Game system at the highest levels Cons Some bugs in the graphics engine High level of difficulty Sam Fisher was a Navy SEAL, was a CIA agent and retired to private life. He remains, however, one of the finest soldiers the United States has ever drafted into the ranks ofthe army and now his country needs him again. Sam is called by the National Security Agency to join the Third Echelon, a secret department created to resolve every international crisis in an absolutely discreet and unorthodox way. Only Sam has the numbers to succeed, only he can defend the American people from threats from outside. Alone, against everyone. The plot of Splinter Cell sounds a bit like the metaphor of the commercial enterprises that Ubi Soft and Microsoft expected from this game in the past Christmas season. Splinter Cell was announced as a high-level product, a title capable of giving Xbox users a worthy heir to Halo, capable of arousing interest in the Microsoft console, whose line up has always been subjected to fierce criticism. The Canadian studies of Ubi Soft have succeeded in their intent and Splinter Cell is a great reason to turn on Xbox and jump into the thousand lights and shadows of this stealth action game. The success achieved is undoubtedly deserved.", "date": "2003-02-27", "grade": null}
