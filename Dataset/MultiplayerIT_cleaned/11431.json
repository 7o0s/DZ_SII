{"name": "Okami - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/okami-recensione.html", "text": "Oh my Goddess! For those who hadn't had the opportunity to know it at the time of its release on PlayStation 2, we remind you that Okami is a 3D action/adventure vaguely inspired by Zelda, however strong with a charge of originality that already emanates from the themes of the storyline: the In fact, the user plays the role of Amaterasu, the sun goddess incarnated in a splendid white wolf in order to save a Japan oppressed by the darkness of the evil monster Orochi. The classic antithesis between Good and Evil lends itself in Okami to an almost environmentalist reading, with a nature poisoned by the forces of darkness that is reborn in a swirl of colors as our divine heroine cleanses the land of the Rising Sun from the scum demonic. However, the plot has all the connotations of the fable (including the presence of a ~shoulder~ who lightens the tone with his funny ways of doing, represented here by the elf Issun), and, although it does not prove to be particularly complex or intricate, it ends up really conquer the player, exciting him and remaining etched in his memory. However, it is certainly from a graphic point of view that the Capcom product shows off its most striking qualities, not at all affected by the passage of time or by the conversion process for Wii. Okami therefore continues to be a title with an extraordinary visual impact, so sumptuous and refined as to constitute a real work of art in movement: above all thanks to a masterful cel-shading that recalls the features of medieval Japanese illustrations and a use of the color capable of giving the idea of being in front of a watercolor painting. The final result is something that frustrates any attempt at comparison or comparison: it is impossible to describe in words the authentic spectacle that Okami offers when he shows the rebirth of the cherry trees or the luxuriant growth of flowers and plants that follows the passage of Amaterasu, not to mention the excellent special effects that embellish the whole. Okami is a true work of art in motion Oh my Goddess! In short, Okami is the demonstration that even in modern times a monstrous polygon count is not essential to leave spectators speechless. Compared to the original PlayStation 2, this Wii version differs only in a less marked use of the so-called canvas filter (which basically translates into brighter colors at the expense of a certain ~softness~ of the image), for slightly shorter loading times and for the support of progressive scan and widescreen format, while the occasional drops in frame rate remain, however decidedly limited. Evocative from a graphic point of view, Okami also delights the ears thanks to a particularly pleasant and spot-on soundtrack, the perfect accompaniment for Amaterasu's heroic deeds. The effects are also excellent, including the curious verses that replace the speech of the various characters, a solution totally in line with the fairytale tone of the adventure. Celestial gameplay It is certainly not the only graphic aspect that makes Okami a unique product within the videogame panorama: the title Clover, in fact, in the face of a play structure fundamentally comparable to that of the various Zeldas, puts a feature in particular on the plate of innovation on which a large part of the gameplay revolves. Let's talk about the Celestial Brush, an ability that allows Amaterasu to literally draw shapes on the screen that affect the environment or surrounding characters. By tracing a straight line on an objective it is therefore possible to cut elements of the scenario in half, or to do the same with an enemy in combat; again, a bridge can be drawn to be able to continue on an otherwise blocked path, or a bomb to detonate fragile rock walls, or a circle to make withered trees flourish again or to stun an opponent. There are 15 techniques to discover during the adventure (corresponding to as many signs to be made on the screen), a number that effectively testifies to the importance of this playful element. The Celestial Brush on Wii also has the added value of being able to be managed directly by the movements of the Remote: a solution that works well, even if it takes some practice initially. However, the game saves the user from having to draw perfectly straight lines by making available a key that automatically aligns the movement detected by the Sensor Bar. However, the brand new control system involves other aspects, primarily that relating to Amaterasu's attacks : to launch your shots, you need to shake the Remote slightly, certainly a colorful and fun gimmick but which makes chaining combos much more difficult than necessary due to thethe need to have to perfectly mark the time of each blow. The Celestial Brush on Wii has the added value of being able to be controlled directly by the movements of the Remote Beyond this, Okami on Wii is played like a beauty, for the sake of all those who have not been able / wanted to get involved in the PlayStation 2 version. It is therefore reconfirmed an authentic pleasure to embark on the adventure of Amaterasu and Issun, visiting cities, talking to NPCs, solving quests and sub-quests and facing dungeons full of enemies and the inevitable final bosses. Certainly Okami does not offer a sensational level of challenge, both in the smells and in the fights, but rather to define it as a shortcoming we would feel like deeming it a choice absolutely consistent with the general imprint given to the product. And it is in any case an aspect that definitely takes a back seat in the face of the depth offered by the Clover title, capable of engaging anyone who wanted to complete it 100% between 30 and 40 hours, solving all the quests and collecting every available weapon and upgrade. Comment In this new incarnation for Wii, Okami retains all the characteristics that made him the masterpiece that was on PlayStation 2: sumptuous graphics with exceptional artistic value, a complete and deep gameplay and a captivating and exciting story. A picture that is completed with the good performance of the control system via Nunchuk and Remote and with the coveted presence of progressive scan and widescreen support, for an adventure that really deserves to be experienced by anyone. Pros A real artistic masterpiece Complete and refined gameplay Deep and engaging Cons Somewhat simple fights Some small uncertainty of the control system The language of art Among all the compliments that Okami deserves, there is also a small pull on the ears for the lack of translation (again) of the text on the screen into Italian. An absence that is felt not so much because it causes a particular difficulty in understanding the plot or in continuing the adventure for non-English speakers, but rather because it necessarily limits the catchment area of a title that truly stands as suitable for everyone . At this juncture, in fact, Okami is as close as possible to the concept of ~Nintendo difference~, despite being the result of a third-party developer and originally born on another platform: the Clover work presents such a homogeneous balance between simplicity and depth to be able to conquer the hearts of hardcore gamers as well as those of less savvy players, just like the spearheads of the Nintendo stable. Okami is available for Nintendo Wii and PlayStation 2. The tested version is the one for Nintendo Wii.", "date": "2008-05-09", "grade": null}
