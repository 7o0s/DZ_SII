We have mentioned Fable Fortune since today we are going to dissect another card game, however decided to leave aside the competitive multiplayer modes, focusing instead on some dungeon crawler aspects, with a mix of perhaps not absolutely original ideas (the good Slay the Spire he had already given us a taste of it last year for example) but blended together in an intelligent way. Furthermore, Lost in the Dungeon is an all-Italian production born from the skilled hands of the guys from Eggon, a software house mainly dedicated to the creation of mobile titles born just over a year ago. So we spent entire afternoons among goblins, spiders and sorcerers in search of the meaning of this new adventure. Will we be able to find it? Forgetful Our hero has lost his memory, he doesn't know where he is or the reason that drives him to delve into the basement of a new wasteland. A story that starts with one of those trivial and tremendously obvious clichs, a small incipit useful only to make it clear that it will be up to you, with your choices, to temper the shape of this new hero. Magician, thief or warrior are the three options that you will be faced with, nothing more than a simple decision on the cards that will make up your deck at the beginning of the game. The warrior is obviously given to dealing high damage, the mage will fill his hand with protection spells and spells, and the rogue with sneak attacks and poisonous stabs. There isn't a real tutorial to explain all the basic mechanics in detail, with the exception of some explanatory slides on the main features, so much so that the first few games you will spend dying repeatedly in the initial rooms of the first dungeon just to assimilate how it works exactly the whole. In fact, Lost in the Dungeon is not one of those easy or permissive games, but rather it is a merciless bastard who enjoys seeing you die every time, as if that were the incentive to continue the adventure and try once again. And it can work: that's exactly why in the first hours you get entangled in a web of failures from which it's impossible to get out, because there must be a right way to face the enemies that are randomly proposed in each new game, there must be that combination of cards that escapes us to overcome the first dungeons without shouting at the monitor, there must necessarily be that quibble that allows us to easily kill these cursed mice. Slowly, after trials after trials, one sadly realizes that instead there is no way other than to continue to fail, accumulate experience and money and start over from the beginning always a little more powerful, until the critical threshold is broken and being able to finally juggle between monsters and snakes. In short, it is simply the difficulty curve that immediately soars in an incorrect and uninspiring way, transforming the experience of Lost in the Dungeon into something extremely frustrating. Advance without crying It happens then that for this design choice you find yourself repeating the initial clashes over and over again, collecting some loot boxes and then leaving the dungeon while you are still alive. You go back to the city, check the objects obtained, sell the useless ones and start working again trying to earn some extra stat points. In addition to hit points, our hero has mana and energy, both indispensable values for casting skills. Obviously, as the cost increases, the effectiveness or utility usually increases, so if we have to spend two mana points to cast an arcane wall, to use an area spell we will have to invest many more. The randomness in this case is extremely limited. There are no particularly strange effects on the cards present and the deck (consisting of 20 cards) almost always allows us to have what we need in hand, considering that we can insert up to five copies at a time. The strategy therefore comes from the possibility of performing only one action per turn, with the card used which is automatically replaced after the damage count and a deck that regenerates as soon as the last card is drawn. It's all extremely simple and straightforward and there aren't many feasible strategies: the most useful tendency to continue is to have a good armor value, so that enemy attacks don't scratch our hit point reserve, and poisonous attacks capable of slowly deal damage over time to opponents. Playing so cautiously becomesThis is essential given that upon death not only are all the rewards obtained in that scenario subtracted, but any coins used to buy potions and the entrance ticket to the dungeon are also lost, which becomes more and more expensive as you reach the more difficult ones . The balance between difficulty and rewards is not exactly at home and it will be very likely to abandon the title out of boredom before having a competitive deck. The skills that will not be assigned to you with the initial choice of the class you will have to unlock by accumulating experience and leveling up, a sensible choice but plagued by an almost maddening slowness in growth. Even the interface is quite poor, for a graphic impact that just failed to convince us. On the other hand, the artwork of the cards is pleasant but not the animations of the attacks, limited and repetitive.", "date": "2018-03-14", "grade": "6.5"}
