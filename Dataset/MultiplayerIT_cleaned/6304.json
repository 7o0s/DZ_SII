{"name": "Jurassic Pokmon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/150529-fossil-fighters-frontier-jurassic-pokemon.html", "text": "The Pokmon phenomenon has generated tons of titles which, some to a lesser or greater extent, have tried to enter the genre to take advantage of its fulminant success. Give Digimon to Yu-Gi-Oh! different houses have declined in many ways what in the end always remains the same concept: collecting a whole series of creatures and then taking them around the world making them fight each other for their own personal glory. Passing over the questionable ethical validity of such an idea, especially if aimed at a young audience, perhaps not everyone knows that among those who have tried to follow Nintendo there is... Grande Enne herself, who in 2010 released Fossil Fighters in Japan , the work of Red Entertainment and Chunsoft, which transported the dynamic of collection / combat in a world clearly inspired by Jurassic Park. After two episodes for Nintendo DS that never landed in Europe, finally with the third, this time on Nintendo 3DS, the Kyoto house deems us worthy of the title of Keepers of the Paleopark. Will we be deserving of such an honor? And above all, is it worth it? A prehistoric Pokmon dedicated to the youngest, with some interesting concepts: successful operation? Bloodthirsty little paleontologists The sung introduction immediately serves to clarify that this game is dedicated to an audience ranging from children to pre-adolescents, up to some young adults who still refuse to grow up. Beyond the judgments of its merits, the song and the images that accompany it project us into an atmosphere that is typical of those cartoons from a few years ago, full of positive values and which tried tremendously to be ~cool~. and they give us a first idea of the worlds in which the action will take place, worlds that we have the opportunity to explore practically immediately, with the first hours of the game which classically act as in-game tutorials. In the near future, a way will be found to reawaken the extinct lizards from their fossils; consequently, around the areas richest in finds, three Paleoparks will arise, in Asia, America and Europe, which will serve both as scientific reserves and as entertainment for families. The Guardians play a crucial role within the Paleoparks: they are in charge of going around the park, extracting fossils, awakening the dinosaurs (which thus become Vivosaurs) and keeping the most aggressive wild ones under control, for the protection of the more peaceful ones of scholars and visitors. All very fair, however, the reason why real fighting tournaments between Vivosaurs are organized in the parks... In any case, with the WWF abolished or looking the other way, it is just that of a very young Guardian the role that the player is called to play: after obtaining the title a plot begins, divided into missions around the world, which we could define banalotta and also clearly designed for a young audience, but which also knows how to give moments of healthy hilarity. However, the main missions are only a part of the life of a Keeper; there are so many tasks to be performed, and of a certain complexity. The usual routine A Keeper's typical day opens with a nice ride in the Paleopark aboard a Fossilstrada, which is nothing more than a vehicle adapted to travel along rough roads, to locate the fossils, extract them, and subsequently awaken them on the spot. There are several available, to be purchased with your hard-earned savings or to be won in Tournaments; moreover they can all be upgraded through new pieces, always to be purchased or won. Driving these particular jeeps is decidedly simple, but not exactly a joy, always remaining, even in the face of improvements, rather slow. However, they can actually reach practically every nook and cranny of the Paleoparco: the conformation of these is very rich in particular and secret places, as well as a real circuit in which to challenge the other Fossilstradas from time to time in a speed race, fun but not certainly the state of the art, and the exploration is made fluid by the map always present on the lower screen. In short, it is enjoyable, and really gives a ~Jurassic Park-like~ sense of adventure and discovery, with the problem, however, that during the raids it is not possible to save, and since the parks are quite extensive and complex, one begins to glimpse that problem of repetitiveness which we will elaborate later. In any case, each Fossilstrada is equipped with a radar (which can also be upgraded) for the identification of fossils, and the tools to carry out the operation, i.e. X-rays, a hammer and an auger. Extraction is a real mini-game to be played using the stylus/touch screen combo: within a time limit, and being careful not to ruin the rep too muchOf course, at least 50% of it must be unearthed, and the higher the score, the stronger the awakened Vivosaurus will be. For each lizard there are four types of fossil, plus four special and secret ones, each of which corresponds to a move to be used in combat: as there are about eighty different species in the game, you calculate how many fossils you have to extract. Finally, once a Vivosaurus has awakened (just one fossil is enough for awakening), you can face a fight, both against wild saurians and in tournaments organized in the Paleoarenas. The 3D effect It adds the classic visual depth that makes everything more spectacular, but with a very obvious trade-off: the fluidity, which is already anything but perfect in the exploratory phases, sometimes even drops below the guard level, without making everything unplayable, but still making itself felt a lot. The representation of reptiles is also an exception here: evidently this is the aspect most looked after by the graphics. It is not all fossils that are underground The battle takes place according to the classic Pokmon scheme: you choose a beast, then on your turn a move, and away you go. But there are interesting implementations: each reptile is akin to a different element, water, air, earth, fire and neutral, and clearly each element is strong against one and weak against another. We must also take into account the position of the Vivosaurus: some moves can in fact alter it, making it more exposed to attacks. Furthermore, the battle is not one-on-one, but you will be joined, as well as your opponents, by your Paleofriends, characters to be met along the plot, and by their lizards, who will act guided by the CPU. Finally, you are equipped with a series of power-ups, for attack, defense, recovery of life points and so on, to be used during battles: their number and the time you have available to use them, both limited, open up a whole range of strategic possibilities. The things to do are therefore many and articulated, wanting to deal only with the missions of the main plot, the game would also take on a dry and well-balanced structure, the problem is that you will soon realize that to go on you need to level up, and also much. The parks must be explored over and over again, just as the extractions and, above all, the fights must be repeated ad libitum. And if at first all these actions appear fresh and fun, they will soon lack that quid and become boring. It is a nuisance even for completionists, even more so for those who would simply like to get to the bottom of it while having fun: going on for about thirty hours doing the same things over and over again is not exactly a very pleasant experience, and paradoxically, in the face of a theoretically well-studied structure, the youthful plot and the situations it proposes become the strongest reason that could push you to move forward, youthfulness to which the anime style used is also well suited, gaudy, colorful and full of a certain humour, perhaps not suitable for everyone. The pure music adapts to the general trend, typical of a certain way of understanding the jRPG, while a more in-depth discussion can be made on the graphics department. This looks very good at first glance, full of elements, details, polygons and colors; but the price to pay is, especially during the exploration phase, a very remarkable aliasing, various slowdowns and a series of rather bland textures. A truly excellent point, however, is the representation of the Vivosaurs: beautifully characterized, each truly different from the other and endowed with its own personality, they also have many details, very remarkable textures and very evocative animations. Seeing them face off during the fights is a pleasure and somewhat limits the tedium that will begin to hang over you with the umpteenth ~Fight!~ Finally, the well-implemented multiplayer modes and a very well-maintained Italian translation should be noted.", "date": "2015-05-28", "grade": "6.5"}
