{"name": "Overland", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/overland-recensione.html", "text": "Overland has not kept many of its promises, as we will see in the course of the review. In short, it is a turn-based strategy game in which the player guides one or more survivors on a desperate journey across the United States of America. Strange alien creatures have appeared out of nowhere and have decimated the population. There is no hope of eliminating them all: the only possibility is to flee west, even if it is not known exactly towards what. If you haven't understood it, we are faced with a classic post-apocalyptic scenario that takes its cue from Cormac McCarthy's The Road and everything that followed, in which perpetual escape is the only viable solution to stay alive, in a world where there is nothing left to save. Survival and game interface Overland consists of single procedurally generated scenarios, to be tackled one at a time after selecting them from the map used for the journey. Dealing with them is used to look for fuel for the car used for the escape, or resources useful for survival (weapons, first aid kits, improvised shields, armor, luggage racks and so on) or even new vehicles that make the mission easier. Each scenario is divided into square boxes, is contained in a single screen and also houses at least one of the lethal creatures that hunt us. By moving the characters in turns, it is therefore necessary to be able to recover as many objects as possible, where there are useful ones around, while avoiding being killed. The most important resource to research is certainly the aforementioned fuel for cars. Moving on foot is not only not a solution, but it forces us to face an infinite sequence of scenarios that ends either with our death, or with the recovery of a new car. The creatures have several characteristics that make them interesting: the basic ones, for when they are horrendous, they move one square at a time and are not very resistant, but traveling in the areas in which our journey is divided, seven in total, all with different biomes (city, mountain, desert, countryside, and so on) unlocks new enemies that are more agile and stronger, posing new difficulties. Killing everything that moves is not a solution, because the creatures are attracted by the noise and, starting a fight or even killing one, the sounds produced would immediately attract new reinforcements, greatly reducing our chances of survival. Impossible to win against an endless stream of monsters. After all, Overland's gameplay is very ruthless from this point of view and sometimes it offers no escape route, to the point that on certain occasions it is advisable to sacrifice one or more characters in order to be able to distract the enemies and make the others survive. The game interface is very simple: once a character is selected, we have a certain number of action points available to move, open some containers, place objects, attack and interact where possible with some elements of the scenario. For example, it is allowed to turn on generators to attract enemies with noise, or drag obstacles to block their way. The system is so simple that there isn't even a tutorial to explain it to us: the burden of discovery is left entirely to the player. If we like, this is also a metaphor for what it means to survive. Game mechanics Unfortunately, this is where the beauty of Overland ends, which has a big underlying problem: to put the player in difficulty, the developers have made some really irritating narrative choices. In particular we think of inventory management, but also of the procedural generation of scenarios, completely unbalanced. But let's go in order. As already mentioned, in each scenario the characters can find resources hidden inside the various containers (cars, dumpsters, buckets, caravans and so on). Each of them can carry a maximum of two items at the same time, with the rest going either tossed, or stowed in the car. Despite the limits imposed, so far we can consider the system acceptable. Unfortunately some mechanics appear as immense forcings, which obtain the paradoxical effect of increasing the difficulty at the expense of the atmosphere. In particular we think about the fact that it is not possible to organize objects or use them outside the battlefield. Incidentally: Was a character hurt? You can heal him with a medikit only in action and not in moments when the group is camped (it happens every time you pass a scenario by car). Did you get some petrol but didn't have time to pour it into the tank? It will be possible to do it in the next scenario, but not in the aforementioned interludes, when in reality it would be more logical to deal with all these aspects with theateral. In short, rather than surviving the monsters, it is often difficult to survive such rigid and meaningless design choices, which greatly break the flow and create absurd situations, in which the player wonders why he cannot do what would instead be logical do right at that juncture. But let's go back to the characters and try to understand why it's so difficult to feel the slightest empathy towards them. The fact that they are randomly generated makes them always different, so anything can really happen to us, between men, women, young people and animal lovers. Unfortunately, however, there is no strong narrative vision that makes them interesting. Basically they are puppets whose weightless stories are told by lines of dialogue that are generic and devoid of any substance. Difficult to have for them the slightest transport when you leave them on the street or when you use them as bait to facilitate the escape of the others or the collection of some useful object. Gameplay If we want the same happens with procedurally generated elements: Overland is a game that focuses on survival and having to make difficult choices to be able to get to the end of our journey. Too bad it does nothing to balance the games and to make the player become attached to the characters, so much so that in the end they are perceived as mere resources to be sacrificed as needed. This is probably something intended, but the end result is to alienate the user from the game world, with the ultimate goal becoming simply to go from point A to point B on the map, worrying only about performing the right choices to succeed. Here the procedural generation of the scenarios also intervenes to complicate things. As we said, it is highly unbalanced. It is to the point that at the start of a game it can give us such poor resources as to compromise the rest of the adventure, or once the game has started it can generate several scenarios in a row without useful resources, so much so as to condemn us to certain death. The result is that we spent far, far too long restarting campaigns, only really starting to play when given a character with decent equipment. The alternative would have been to waste time trying to straighten games that could not be straightened. Also, during the game we died several times because for several scenarios in a row we didn't find anything worthwhile. Also in this case the effect may be desired, because basically surviving also means facing bad luck; pity, however, that it all ends up generating strong frustration in the player. We never feel completely inside the game, which we perceive as a superior entity that can decide our life regardless of the skills we have developed. To make a comparison: do you know when a sudden obstacle appears in a platform that kills you without you being able to do anything to avoid it? Surely in the next game you will be able to do it, but in your head you cannot avoid perceiving that death as unfair and the result of bad design. The same often happens here. Fortunately, the possibility of restarting the campaigns from the areas reached makes progression possible despite the difficulties to be faced, but honestly we had other hopes.", "date": "2019-09-27", "grade": "5.5"}
