And, just as happened with Sam Fisher's series, also for the nice and mysterious ~Ray Man~, recently set aside in favor of his former Rabbids supporting characters, he resorted to what is probably the episode better managed, Rayman 2: The Great Escape: originally released in 1999 for the Sega Dreamcast, Rayman 2 immediately placed itself as one of the greatest competitors of Super Mario 64, creator and according to many still the ruler of the 3D platform genre. The quality and success of the title translated into conversions that have involved more or less all imaginable platforms over time, including, six years later, the Nintendo DS: unfortunately, this version was limited by numerous factors, first of all the lack of the analog stick, not compensated by clever use of the touch screen. Is it time to strengthen the relationship between Rayman and Nintendo portables? A fairy tale Rayman 2 is one of the greatest proofs in favor of those who maintain that who knows what innovations and revolutions are not necessary to create a great game: from the way of declining the genre to the story, everything in the title is ~conventional~, and let's start right from the story, also because there isn't much to say. The usual intergalactic bad guys, this time in the person of the fearsome robot pirates led by the evil Razorbeard, decide to go and annoy Rayman's quiet world: they therefore break the ~Heart of the World~ into a thousand pieces, which takes away from the various beings fairies of this imaginary universe their own powers, and not happy they also imprison various creatures including the Teens, an ancient race that possesses all knowledge, so ancient that however all this knowledge has forgotten ... Even Rayman and his friend Globox, already recovering from a previous world rescue, are among the prisoners, but manage to free themselves and embark on the new adventure which basically involves the recovery of both the captured Teens and the fragments of the Heart of the World, now called Lum. If the story doesn't start from incredible premises and doesn't develop in an innovative way, however, it must be said that the atmosphere and the characterization of the characters are really well rendered, with many components that combine to develop the right involvement. Humor, fairy tale, mystery come together in a narrative world that now recalls Disney, now the best Rare games, now the best superhero comic for the youngest for a decidedly successful result, which remains in the player's heart and memory. The same goes for the more properly playful part: Rayman 3D is a very conventional and also rather linear 3D platformer, which sees us face a whole series of levels full of platforms to be tackled with millimeter jumps, enemies to be eliminated by shooting energy balls, objects and bonuses to collect, various obstacles to be tackled with a minimum of ingenuity and secret passages and alternative routes to discover; but the highly refined level design and the many powers available to Rayman contribute to a gameplay that is never banal and devoid of real dead moments. The same actions and situations will never be repeated twice consecutively, and new elements are introduced with skillful regularity over the course of the levels; is the formula, simple only in words, of the greatest exponents of the genre, and Rayman 2 is definitely one of them. Of course, one could reflect on the fact that twelve years have now passed since the first release and that perhaps all this means that the panorama of 3D platformers has not evolved very much, with only Super Mario Galaxy and a few others trying to open new streets, but this is not the place and above all it is not Rayman's problem... The 3D effect Overly calibrated upwards (the images tend to ~split~ probably due to the great dynamism of the action, creating a bit of annoyance), Rayman 3D's 3D appears in its best shape by lowering the appropriate lever even just slightly. In this condition it behaves at its best, further enriching a game world already in itself endowed with great personality. In reality, for almost all we are faced with a mere scenic tinsel that does not influence the gameplay even one iota, except for those few sections with a fixed camera in which it is important to establish the distance of obstacles and/or enemies that come towards us . In any case, an appreciable addition, not at all fundamental but always welcome. Team that wins sooner or later draws The fact that notalmost nothing has changed in twelve years, allows Rayman 3D to retain all the advantages of the original, listed above; moreover, the 3DS analog disc, sensitive and precise, avenges the honor of the ill-fated DS conversion, which by the way was quite well done. Unfortunately, however, the defects of the original have also been maintained, or rather the only real defect: the automatic camera, often directed by a good director but which occasionally, in drastic framing changes, goes crazy and makes life difficult to the player having to resort to an impractical re-centering in the most agitated moments. Another important advantage is longevity, yes approaches fifteen hours, and all of them pleasant, wanting to collect and discover everything there is to collect and discover; moreover Rayman 3D takes a small step forward in the difficulty sector: some mechanics, for example the combat, have been slightly retouched, eliminating elements of frustration. Nonetheless, the game remains difficult, showing in the last stages an ~old school~ vocation, which in hindsight is pleasant both for the more elderly players and for the fresher ones, who will have something to reflect on that evolution video game that, due to age issues, got lost. Good news on the technical side too: this conversion is based on the original Dreamcast, with various improvements in all graphic areas, and, thanks to the screen size, it's a great sight. Clean, colorful, detailed and full of even remarkable effects, the graphics of Rayman 3D show the side only in fluidity with 3D activated, without ever really annoying. Finally, even the sound leaves you satisfied, with evocative music and the nice incomprehensible shouting of the characters that reaches hilarious peaks in the case of some characters, such as the Teens for example.", "date": "2011-04-13", "grade": "7.0"}
