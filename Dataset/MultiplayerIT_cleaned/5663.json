Clearly abandoning its previous experiences between divinely-setting MOBAs and sci-fi shooters, Hi-Rez Studios has launched itself on the mobile market with a title that seems to come from a team of industry veterans, given the precision with which it captures the typical spirit of this particular method of use and the balance of the elements that compose it. Looking at it, it may seem like a sort of endless runner and its free structure with microtransactions can be misleading, but the game has a specific weight that is more reminiscent of old-school action platforms rather than the new trends that have emerged on smartphones, however declined entirely according to the typical interface of these platforms, i.e. the touch screen. In this way, the action is extremely fast and intuitive, with the need for short touches on the screen to ensure complete control of the movement and attacks of the protagonist and thus guaranteeing comfortable use in every situation. The action spirit is the classic one, there is an air of an old platform despite the structure being fundamentally different, with a challenge that is always tense and stimulating, although the levels are decidedly short. The free-to-play system works properly at least in the first few game sessions, becoming more annoying as you progress towards more advanced levels. In practice everything is based on the management of the energy bar: most of the levels (especially the later ones) require the possession of eight units, but once these are lost they must be purchased, or it is necessary to wait a few minutes to recharge them (about 10 minutes for each unit of energy). It's not a particularly Machiavellian way to extract money, but it certainly tends to break up the action in such a fast-paced game and the absence of a possibility to completely break the deadlock with a single purchase weighs heavily. In the end, the best solution seems to be to spend the gems won for free in the game to cut expectations rather than to buy power-ups which in any case are hardly of great importance. Jetpack Fighter features classic action and modern controls, all played at your fingertips At your fingertips It is the control system that largely characterizes the gaming experience, bending the typical dynamics of the Mega Man-style platform shooter, to name one illustrious one, to the needs of fast and sudden movements with simple finger gestures. All this is possible thanks to the use of the jetpack, which makes the protagonist completely mobile in all sections of the screen, with the possibility of moving him and directing him with precision by rubbing his finger on the screen. To simplify things further, the attack system is closely linked to the movement of the protagonist, therefore the movement of the latter also determines the direction of the attack, which is triggered simply by passing over an enemy. There is therefore no cross or virtual key, it is simply a matter of choosing the best angle of attack to penetrate the enemy defenses and hit them directly on the body with a series of slashing blows or launch penetrating ranged blows. There are also charged attacks that allow you to use the special ability of the various characters, such as particularly destructive beams or blows that can destroy elements of the scenery. It should be noted that the presence of multiple enemies on the screen and the search for combos and multipliers to maximize the damage requires looking for movements that hit different enemies in a line, making the arrangement of these a sort of integral part of the gameplay and level design. As regards this last element, since we are dealing with levels lasting less than a minute, we cannot expect particularly complex structures but the purely ~2.5D~ effect that derives from the continuous movement of the framing and perspectives is remarkable, maintaining the action always on a two-dimensional plane but creating a purely aesthetic three-dimensional movement of great effect within the scenarios.", "date": "2016-03-09", "grade": "8.0"}
