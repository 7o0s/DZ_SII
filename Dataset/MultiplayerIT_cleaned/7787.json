So he orders and receives in the mail a very special gadget, the Bullfrog Hypertrousers. He tries them on and flies out the window, falling from the fourth floor. Fortunately, nothing is done. In fact, he wears his spy trench coat, which allows him to emerge unscathed from any crash. This feat is followed by a phone call from an executive of an arms multinational who works in the building opposite, who informs Conway that she has video recordings that would frame him as the murderer of one of her employees. Conway is innocent and luckily the company executive is aware of it too. In fact, he wants to hire Conway just to find out who the real killer is. In reality, he would also like to know why he flew out of the fourth floor, but our spy prefers to gloss over this point. From now on begins a story of corporate espionage in which greed, thirst for power and sentimental ups and downs are mixed. The fact that everything from the dialogue to the soundtrack recalls an old black and white spy movie only serves to underline the irony of Gunpoint, a brilliant puzzle game, very different from the ones we are used to. Its developer, Tom Francis, must have had a lot of fun writing the story, narrated through a series of ironic text messages between Conway and the interlocutor who from time to time offers him the mission. Proceeding with the investigations, the picture becomes more complicated and, we admit it, at a certain point, between double games, triple games and lies, we no longer understood much. So we made our moral decisions with a light heart, as the game requires, because in the end it doesn't matter which side we choose to be on: what matters is the mood, the style. The story is only a valuable outline, if a little confused. The beauty is the missions, the actual game. It is there that Gunpoint abandons all superfluities and shines like a worked gem. In its genre, it is already a myth. Under the raincoat, the Crosslink The missions all have a common goal: to infiltrate a building and steal data from a computer. Or delete copies of a recording. Or destroy documents. It makes no difference what object we get our hands on. Our job is always to get past the security systems, outwit the guards, and press a button when we've arrived at the set point. Then it's all about escaping. The reason we love Gunpoint is that there is no set solution for every mission. The games are all different and we can invent our own style of play and strategy, even improvising from time to time. Gunpoint eliminates frustration and gladly rewards the player, encouraging them to come up with ingenious plans. The money we collect after each mission doesn't matter, even that is sideline, and it's only used to buy upgrades that don't distort the gaming experience. The only revolutionary gadget is the first one, the Crosslink. Thanks to that, the heart of Gunpoint is revealed. With the Crosslink we can in fact visualize the circuits that connect the electronic systems of the building. At that point using only the mouse, and without having to go around, we have a world of possibilities before us. Here's an example: A guard patrolling the floor of a building prevents us from reaching the elevator. We therefore decide to connect a security camera to one of the doors that are on the floor beaten by the guard. As soon as the guard passes in front of that door we let ourselves be framed by the camera which, when activated, triggers the connected door. wham! The guard is passed out and we can pass. To tell the truth, we have to admit that in this way we happened to open the door in our faces on our own. Conway was spread on the ground, he remained there for a second, the time to meditate on his idiocy, then he got up. But this is only one of the possible styles of play. If you don't care about being invisible and silent as a ninja you can also knock out the guards and knock them out with one punch (the micro animation, we assure you, is hilarious). Or buy a gun, or overwhelm an enemy super agent with a leap and make him fall with you out of a glass window. The game never punishes the player's inventiveness. He's not one of those who beat you if you made a noise or shed blood. At the end of the mission you get an evaluation, sure, but it's just a way to have fun replaying the levels; however you decide to tackle the missions, you will feel satisfied. But you can't do without the Crosslink. On one occasion we had to connect a noise detector to a lift and the lift to an ilight switch. Turning off the light, the elevator went up one floor, the detector went off and the guard turned in that direction. At that point we took the stairs behind him and goodbye. At the beginning, with just one type of connection it is easy to tamper with the security systems, but already after the first missions connections are added that belong to different circuits, each identified by a colour. In this case, if for example we want to reconnect the green cables, we must first tamper with the green control unit. An idea full of possibilities like that of Crosslink could tempt many developers to create a very complicated, slow and punishing game. Instead Gunpoint is only intricate in appearance, while in essence it is of a zen simplicity. In one breath Conway's not one to let death fool him. He can save at any time or rely on automatic saves, which take him back a few seconds. It is also thanks to this fluidity of the action that Gunpoint ends more or less in four, which seem few when in reality they are right. Besides it would become repetitive. Instead Gunpoint retires when we still want to play. To be honest, he gave us the impression that he had several tricks up his sleeve, but in the end he didn't play. Tom Francis was probably aware of his limitations and didn't want to overdo it. If the game is successful, and we are sure it will be, it will be able to dare more. Indeed, it already seems that Francis is working on new content. In the meantime we can entertain ourselves with the level editor, thanks to which we could soon measure ourselves with safety traps designed by more ruthless and brainy users than Francis. Or maybe play all the levels all over again to achieve secondary objectives and improve our score. But don't expect the enthusiasm of the first time. The substance is there but almost all of it is consumed on the first lap. However Gunpoint is not only gameplay, but also refined pixel art that you can admire in the images taken. The buildings are furnished with attention to detail and every detail contributes to creating the intriguing atmosphere of the game, supported by warm and catchy rhythms. All the elements of Gunpoint are in harmony with each other and form a system so solid and coherent that not even the shrewd Richard Conway would be able to tamper with. Or maybe yes. On the other hand, nothing is impossible for Conway. If you don't believe it, put him to the test: he will only ask you for nine euros and ninety-nine cents. Richard Conway knows how to do two things: fool the guards and bypass the controls. Will you be up to it?", "date": "2013-06-09", "grade": "8.0"}
