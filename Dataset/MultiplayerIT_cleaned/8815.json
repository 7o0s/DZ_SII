Battlezone and Asteroids clones proliferate on the App Store, pixelart or wireframe games come out every day, old classics are re-proposed in the form of real collections, while Jeff Minter continues to be Jeff Minter even thirty years after the release of Tempest. There are also those who try to renew old-fashioned mechanics, and just as Super Crate Box reinvented the first Mario Bros. by simply giving the player the opportunity to shoot, Forget-Me-Not tries to do the same by refreshing the formula of what it is the most famous maze-game ever. Brandon Williamson's mobile game is in fact a successful union between the mechanics of Pac-Man and those of games like Wizard of Wor, all presented through an extremely (and deliberately) obsolete graphic style. Waka waka waka bang! Being able to create a characteristic and recognizable character through a very simple figure is not easy, but Forget-Me-Not doesn't even try and puts the player in the role of an anonymous white square who must move through a procedurally generated maze trying to collect all the flowers inside it, avoiding enemies and eating fruit to increase your score. Everything plays exactly like in Pac-Man, except that the protagonist fires a constant stream of projectiles with which he can get rid of the enemies in his way. However, this is a double-edged sword, as the sides of the stage are sometimes connected to each other, and the player runs the risk of being hit by his own bullets. As if this weren't enough, enemies are also able to shoot from a distance, which pushes you to move continuously and change direction as soon as you meet an opponent's gaze. Each creature has its own behavior and the action becomes more frenetic as the screen begins to populate with little monsters, but their slow movement and their anarchic behavior sadly vanishes that incessant series of chases that made the iconic game of Namco at the same time stressful and fun. To add further complexity, there is a key to collect, which has the dual purpose of opening the exit of the labyrinth and protecting one's back from enemy bullets, but which from time to time can be stolen by a spiteful enemy and taken to walk around the whole scenario. Forget-Me-Not is unfortunately only appreciated after about ten levels, that is when the variety and quantity of enemies add more spice to the action and require a more strategic and careful approach on the part of the player. The risk of boredom taking over is partly mitigated by the recent update to version 2.0, which has introduced a series of improvements which, overall, make Williamson's maze-game certainly richer and more balanced: the new Arena mode, in in particular, it catapults the player into a huge labyrinth and sees him intent on eliminating as many enemies as possible before the arrival of a new and more numerous wave; for those who find the game too simple, a new level of difficulty has been added, with more dangerous and faster opponents. The second new mode is called Seed and differs from the classic one in the shape of the proposed maps, no longer randomly generated but identical for all players and different day after day. In reality, Forget-Me-Not hides several rather interesting game mechanics, such as a combo system to increase one's score or the possibility of entering a sort of berserk mode by performing a particular technique called grinding: a pity that everything is not clearly explained to the player, and that the instruction screen is relegated to an inconspicuous corner in the main menu. Added to this is an intuitive control system but not very suitable for the most frenetic moments: moving by rubbing your finger in the direction in which you want to move initially seems the most suitable solution, but when the situation starts to get hot and the map fills up with bullets and enemies, the slowness of the action could often prove fatal. On the other hand, the possibility of playing with a friend on the same device is very welcome, an addition which, although it is accessible both on the iPhone and on the iPad, can be appreciated above all on the larger screen of the Apple tablet.
