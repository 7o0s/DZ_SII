And when it is not possible to face the competition by resorting to ~brute force~, it is necessary to look for product diversification, a series of characteristics that in some way make it not an ~alternative~ but ~placeable~ to what one already owns or is about to buy. From this point of view, MAG: Massive Action Game partially hits the target, offering us an experience limited to multiplayer (no single campaign, therefore) but of a ~massive~ type, exclusively for PlayStation 3, with no less than two hundred and fifty-six players who face each other in huge scenarios. The game is set in 2025 and the war conflict represented there is fought not by warring nations, but by corporations, by private armies that collide to secure a dominant position on the market. The fight first takes place in silence, unofficially, so as to earn the nickname of ~Shadow War~; then he ends up coming out and goes on a rampage. Once the game has started, we are asked to choose which faction to join among the three available: Valor Company, made up of veterans from the USA, Canada, England and Mexico, who leverage patriotism and a sense of duty in their recruitment campaigns ; Raven Industries, a European company that focuses on efficiency and technological advantage; S.V.E.R., mostly of Russian origin, animated by the legitimate feeling of revenge of the oppressed populations. A life choice The developers have tried to make these armies as real as possible, putting websites online with lots of accompanying ~advertising~ material and actually opening a recruitment campaign that bases its appeal on the exclusivity of our choice: once you enter to be part of a group, we will be able to create a character and make him ~grow~ both from the point of view of experience and from the point of view of skills, and only once we have reached the highest rank (sixty) will we be able to start the career all over again, joining a different faction. The customization of our alter ego is limited to the face and voice, while the uniform is that of the army to which we belong and changes in appearance only based on the protections we intend to use, capable of increasing our resistance to attacks in exchange for lower mobility. The main menu consists, among other things, of the entries ~barracks~, ~armoury~ and ~line~. In the ~barracks~ we can take stock of the situation for our character, view the experience points collected and those missing to move on to the next grade, as well as spend the skill points earned to buy upgrades divided by category: some affect the physical abilities of the character (therefore increased resistance, breath, perception of enemy fire), others improve the weapons in our possession (kicks to increase stability, more precise sights, reduction of reload times), still others allow us to acquire new equipment ( submachine guns and sniper rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers). To obtain even a single skill point it is necessary to collect a lot of experience, therefore you must be very careful not to waste them with useless purchases: choose the sector that most interests you to enhance, dedicate all your attention to it and perhaps you will suffer less from the inevitable initial trauma, when you will find yourself fighting against people who already have numerous upgrades and who therefore have a clear advantage in direct confrontation. ~We need bigger weapons!~ The ~armoury~ section is used to modify the types of weapons available, as well as to create new ones. Our character initially has three different ~configurations~: the first provides equipment consisting of an assault rifle and a pistol, with fragmentation grenades and a medical kit as ~special weapons~, while the armor is of the ~medium~ and allows us a good mobility; the second is the typical ~sniper~ one, with a sniper rifle for long-range shots and a pistol, accompanied by the usual medical kit, a smoke bomb and light armor, which protects little but makes us absolutely free to move; the third is a ~support~ configuration: light machine gun, pistol, frag grenades and heavy armor, ideal for close quarters. During the games it is possible to change weapon between one respawn and another, completely freely and without limitations. With two main weapon slotsthem available and the rest dedicated to special equipment (grenades, rocket launchers, etc.), as well as the rank system to unlock new items and modes, MAG: Massive Action Game inevitably ends up resembling the most popular FPS at the moment, Modern Warfare 2. Unfortunately, the comparison with the title developed by Infinity Ward, from this point of view, leads to an inevitable and resounding defeat: the total number of weapons available is too low and is divided into only three types, while the skill points are too rarefied and are not obtained hand in hand with the experience gained, leading to too slow character development: you become competitive only after several hours of play. We got to try out a couple of sights for the assault rifle, and unfortunately the Zipper Interactive product pays duty in this respect too, completing the picture of a visual sector that is anything but friendly when you need to identify enemies and hit them. The control system, with the exception of the action of crouching, is almost identical to that of Call of Duty: the shoulder buttons to aim and shoot, the pressure of the left analog stick on its axis to run, that of the right to use the knife, etc. The feeling of the weapons seemed mediocre to us, too cold~, with visual solutions that do not fully give the idea of what is happening on the screen and really bad sound effects, too ~soft~ and of little impact. The vital energy does not restores when we are not hit, but is indicated by a number located in the lower part of the screen, on the right. Being hit causes this value to drop, which can only be recovered using a medical kit. Apart from some cases (headshot or grenade, mostly), the kills are not immediate and therefore you remain on the ground with the possibility of being healed by a companion with the ability to heal others, or you can press X and wait the twenty seconds that separate us from the next respawn. In action (massive)! The ~deployed~ item of the main menu is the one that allows us to play, adding ourselves to the queue of one of the five available modes: ~barrage~, ~sabotage~, ~acquisition~, ~domination~ and ~directives~. Despite the high number of players required to start a game, it must be admitted that the matchmaking works very well and you start after only a few seconds. The particular organization of the teams certainly constitutes a peculiar element of great interest, the importance of which, however, comes up against a linguistic wall that is difficult to circumvent. In the ~barracks~ section you can organize yourself with friends, however, and the goal of putting together at least a team of eight compatriots does not appear to be an impossible undertaking. Four squads of eight players, each with a randomly selected commander, form a platoon of thirty-two soldiers; and the total number of platoons per faction varies by mode. It is possible to communicate in chat within your team, while only the commanders can communicate with each other, from team to team, with the aim of coordinating maneuvers and developing a collective strategy to get the better of the enemy. To be honest, during our tests such an eventuality, unfortunately, never occurred: thanks to the fact of playing with a mixture of Americans, French and so on, we almost always found ourselves throwing ourselves into a desperate battle solitary, or at most we have followed some companions with the aim of ~making numbers~ in front of an opposing position, with the aggravating circumstance that the support for the clans is far from being on par with the best titles of the genre, even in home PlayStation, and lacks the ability to create private matches. Which is a shame, because MAG is probably the PS3 title with the best voice chat support: voice quality is clear, there are no ~echoes~ or anything else, and we didn't even experience the lag problems that one would expect from a multiplayer with two hundred and fifty-six participants. But what are these modes like? ~Barrage~ is the classic team deathmatch, which however in this case serves mostly as an internal training for a single faction, fought with non-lethal weapons, in which the team that first reduces the opponent's resources to zero wins ( understood as the number of respawns). The ~sabotage~ mode, on the other hand, is played between different armies: our objective is to conquer or defend two outposts for a certain period of time, then move on to a third objective. ~Takeover~ is the classic ~capture the flag~, with the difference that this time you have to capture two armored vehicles, while ~domination~ is a ~search and destroy~ with multiple objectives that you must take turnsdefend or destroy. Finally, the ~directives~ mode is a mix of the others. Playstation 3 trophies MAG gives away almost forty trophies. The most numerous are clearly the bronze ones, which are obtained above all for consecutive killings carried out in certain circumstances or using particular weapons, for example there is the ~Angel of Death~ trophy which is unlocked by killing twenty-five enemies while they are wounded on the ground, or the trophy ~They drop like flies~ which is obtained by destroying five enemy helicopters. The silver trophies revolve around more complex objectives, such as winning medals or destroying as many as twenty support vehicles. The gold trophies are unlocked by completing the career, ie reaching level 60, with each faction, while finally the platinum trophy is obtained by winning all the other trophies. The maps From a multiplayer with these numbers it is reasonable to expect huge scenarios, also because putting two hundred and fifty-six people to fight each other in a studio apartment would be quite chaotic. Well, the maps of MAG: Massive Action Game are big, yes, and to walk through them in their entirety you really need a lot of time, although our character can run almost endlessly without getting tired. Unfortunately it cannot be said that they are also beautiful, and indeed one is left a little disappointed in the face of their often ~monothematic~ design, for long stretches excessively bare and not at all interactive. The ~cold~ color palette that has always distinguished the SOCOM series doesn't help, but the problems derive more from a series of questionable choices that actually limit the number of maps to four per faction, for a total of twelve scenarios that we will be able to see them in their entirety only after having completed the complete tour of the degrees and having restarted the career from scratch in another faction. Such extensive scenarios had to be divided into ~neighborhoods~ to increase variety and stimulate exploration, even if tainted by the high mortality rate deriving from the disproportionate number of opponents ready to eliminate us even from a distance, and instead the differences from area to area are not so marked and indeed it seems to be in a sort of ~expanded version~ of any Modern Warfare 2 map. The comparison with the Infinity Ward product is always there, there is nothing to do, and also from the point of view of locations sees the Activision series win hands down not only for the number of maps available (sixteen), but also and above all for their full accessibility: it is possible to play any mode in any scenario, while in MAG each map is linked to a single mode. As mentioned above, despite the very high number of players at the same time we have not noticed any particular lag problems and the matchmaking works well. But it is clear that on a technical level the number of participants and the size of the maps are things that you pay for, in this case with frequent ~pop-up~ effects but above all with a frame rate that suffers significant drops and which rarely remains fixed at 30 fps. The character animations are very limited and ugly, certainly not at the level of those seen in the Battlefield: Bad Company 2 beta.", "date": "2010-02-16", "grade": "7.0"}
