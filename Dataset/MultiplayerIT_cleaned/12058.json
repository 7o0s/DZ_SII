Just moving around the rooms is already stressful, the movements are so woody. Each mech has ranged attacks and melee attacks, and often, contrary to what logic might lead you to think, the latter are the most effective and preferable on most occasions. A somewhat immature aiming system comes with the possibility of grappling with an enemy and keeping him fixed as a target using the left backbone, but the computerized enemies are much more precise and lethal than a human being could ever do, forced to fight with a wobbly framerate and imprecise controls even before evil robot opponents. repetitiveness arises inexorably, since the missions fail to guarantee the right rate of variety On board the mobile suit Throughout the game the repetitiveness arises inexorably, since the missions fail to guarantee the right rate of variety and indeed it seems that the only thing to really change is the setting, a bit like it happened in certain 2D games of the It was 8-16 bit. The possibility of buying new versions of mobile suits, new weapons or increasing offensive and defensive capabilities thanks to special upgrades, only slightly increases the attraction that Target in Sight manages to exercise. The two selectable campaigns are both quite short, but this is not a big flaw because in any case it is very difficult for someone to decide to dedicate more than one or two hours of their time to such a game. Graphics and sound Already from the first screens, the meager menus and the poorly cared for graphic interface constitute a sort of dark omen about what the game will be. The poor technical realization begins to breathe from there, and once the actual game begins, the impact is somewhat muffled, but still terrible. The environments are the first thing that catches the eye: repetitive, bare and of a worrying poverty of detail. To tell the truth, a bit of everything, perhaps excluding some decent textures, looks like a bad game for PlayStation 2. As if that weren't enough, despite this poverty of general detail, the fluidity of the game is often insufficient. The true potential of the new Sony console is not even touched upon. The dubbing is of good quality, as well as the music, but the sound effects leave something to be desired. Worth noting is the possibility of independently selecting audio and texts in both English and Japanese, but at the same time the lack of the Italian language, except on the packaging and manual. Final comment We are faced with the worst launch game for PlayStation 3, the one that will probably be consigned to posterity as the Fantavision of this new generation. Gundam: target in sight fails in every single aspect, and fails to ensure sufficient levels neither in terms of playability nor for technical realization. In short, there are already several games available, and each of them represents a better way to spend your money. Unless you're such an ultra-hardcore Gundam fan that you can close not one but even two eyes. To be avoided. Pros Nothing to report Cons Slow, boring and cumbersome Technical realization of a generation behind Mediocre from every point of view Good old Gundam Needless to hide it: Gundam is one of the many brands with a sensational potential that have never been exploited in a suitable way by the video game industry. Unfortunately, the game we are going to talk about is no exception, or rather it does it in a negative way, resulting in one of the poorest ever made. The story sees the two factions Earth Federation Forces and Principality of Zeon Army opposed in an all-out war (naturally based on battles between robots), but the player finds himself having to choose to take part in one of the two sides without particular references from the point from a narrative point of view. The plot also never affects the continuation of the game in any way.", "date": "2007-08-20", "grade": null}
