No more advertising claims or massive campaigns are needed to push the game in fact, anyone who loves digital card games has come into contact with the Blizzard title at least once and the staggering numbers of registered users and played games speak for themselves. While in Italy the good Turna scored important results also from a competitive point of view, the wait for the new expansion has gradually become stronger and stronger, so much so that on Twitch the reveal of the new cards has once again recorded record numbers. Yet despite all these positive factors, there is a feeling in the air that the growth of the game and its success could come to a halt next November, when Artifact will arrive on the digital shelves of Steam, a card game from Valve that seems to have all intentions to grab a good share of users. Operation Apocalypse therefore had to show its muscles and demonstrate that Hearthstone still has a lot of fuel and ideas, ready to withstand the shock wave of the toughest competitor that could happen to it. Few new mechanics, a serious flaw? Ben Brode's abandonment of Blizzard had already shaken the walls a few months ago and it would be foolish to think that his absence, especially as regards promotional videos, would not have been felt. Dave Kosak has been able to grasp the legacy, but the charisma of the gentle giant is not easy to match. However, all this only concerns the mere advertising point of view because Brode, before leaving the American giant, certainly worked on many of the expansions that are yet to arrive and, albeit not under his direct supervision, in the great design of the Blizzard card game the imprint is still strong and clearly visible. Yet something, starting from the last expansion, has started to not work as it should, showing a rather disappointing year of the Crow up to now in many respects, so much so that we have to brand The Witchwood as one of the worst expansions ever released. Well, Operation Apocalypse could be able to snatch the scepter after just three months, due to a chronic poverty of new ideas and mechanics, with cards almost unable to change the meta and give new brilliant ideas to the many top players out there. But be careful, we are not saying that Operation Apocalypse is a total disaster and has extremely unbalanced cards, only that we would have expected some fresher and more fun ideas that could go to counteract that general tiredness that has been registered on the title for some time now blizzards. So let's start trivially from the numbers: one hundred and thirty-five new cards put on the plate with the great novelty of legendary spells by class, a solution already adopted with the legendary weapons seen a few expansions ago. Even in that case, however, it wasn't the weapons that revolutionized the meta, but rather that they offered a new indispensable card to be included in competitive decks, and today that speech is repeating itself. Legendary spells, especially in these first few weeks, can be seen popping up everywhere since they offer quite strong solutions capable of overturning a game. The one-cost wizard can draw three cards, but having to necessarily discard them at the end of the turn, the wizard reduces the cost of all minions in his deck to 1, thus allowing the Exodia to come back into vogue after the Ice Block disappears , or again the shaman is granted the possibility of transforming his entire board into legendary creatures at a cost of seven. Therefore, they are not completely new decks, but enhanced and revised versions of old ideas, a situation that does not seem to be able to unpin the most effective decks seen in Boscotetro. The Sorcerer, both in its Control and Zoo versions, is in fact still incredibly performing, with about eighty percent of cards already present in the old lists, and the same thing can also be said for the Control Warrior or the Spell Hunter, decks that to this day remain extremely valid for climbing the rankings. But are there any original decks? Obviously the meta will stabilize and within a month you will be able to have a clearer idea but there is no doubt that the impact of the Quests and the Death Knights was much more significant and revolutionary than the new keywords. Magnetism, in fact, is the only new keyword in this expansion and allows two robots to add their attack and defense values to create a stronger card, usually to be used to catch the opponent by surprise. There are a couple of decks above the rest that attempt to take advantage of the new mechanic, like Warrior Odd Mech or Shovel Mech but sThese are the only two really solid examples that we would like to advise you at the moment. Magnetism is in fact extremely vulnerable to Silences and single removals, cards that devastate the entire strategy at very low cost. In short, the situation is not tragic but it is not even too different from what we saw a month ago with Boscotetro. They run improved versions of the old decks and very few new combinations, with the risk that players get tired of the new cards very quickly. Fresh ideas concern a hunter deck completely focused on bombs and also some combo decks dedicated to druid and priest, which exploit Mecha Cthun on one side and Azalina on the other that seem to be able to drag the meta. However, the players have already repeatedly expressed their discontent in playing against decks whose combos are not counterable, exactly as happened a few months ago with Ciciazampa making Blizzard run for cover quickly with a blatant and obvious nerf. Of course, there are now some cards to fight closures, just a pity that Project: Demons, a card designed specifically to transform the creatures in the opponent's hand into random demons, has been put for the exclusive use and consumption of the sorcerer, giving the power to block combos to only one class out of Nine. We couldn't close this review without mentioning the legendary Frizzabombe the magnificent, the first card banned from official Blizzard tournaments. Frizzabombe will basically completely replace your deck with a random deck created by him, decks that will update over time and will be modified by Blizzard itself. It's basically a way for casual players to try new decks without the need for them to have a large number of cards at their disposal. A nice idea even if it's an end in itself given that, although proven, the decks honored by the good Frizzabombe aren't exactly super competitive.", "date": "2018-08-10", "grade": "7.0"}
