{"name": "Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ancestors-the-humankind-odyssey-recensione.html", "text": "At first Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey, whose review you are reading, is unsettling. Someone described it as an Assassin's Creed with monkeys, but such a definition couldn't be further from the truth, despite the fact that the Ubisoft saga was born from an intuition of Patrice Desilets, the same author. Of course, the primates who control themselves throughout the adventure can climb rocks and trees and throw themselves from one trunk to another with great agility, taking advantage of the more resistant vines where present to give themselves momentum or to save themselves from disastrous falls. The fact is that starting the game for the first time we thought that this was the core of it, when in reality it is only an accessory, almost descriptive component. Not that it's little present, since we spend so much time in the trees, but there's also much more. Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey is a survival on paper, but it is in a refined, almost eclectic way. It doesn't tell a real story, even if basically it tells us about us human beings and how we became what we are, and it doesn't adopt many of the canonical mechanics of the genre, which it ignores or rereads in a completely autonomous way. Its strong point, if we want to call it that, is how it approaches the player, completely immersing him in the role of the primate protagonists: the player does not play a monkey, the player is the monkey. We try to explain ourselves. The player as a monkey In Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey we control primates fighting for their survival in a highly hostile natural environment, populated by creatures ready to devour them as soon as they get the chance. Our goal is to expand our progeny following a progression that goes from the state of nature to the construction of some simple buildings to create small villages, all along a series of chapters marked by the evolution of primates in different fields (neuronal , social and so on) to which points are assigned when available on screens that are basically the classic skill trees. This concept, already intriguing by itself, is developed in a surprising way: leaving the player in the dark about everything, apart from a simple tutorial that can be deactivated which provides some basics, but without ever going into too much detail. When we said that the player is the monkey, we really meant that like the monkey he must evolve by analyzing the environment in which he lives to find food, water and beds on which to sleep and at the same time put to good use what he has learned to evolve the species. All this translates into an almost complete initial disorientation of the player, who finds himself in a hostile environment without anyone telling him what to do. For example, one of the first tasks we will have to carry out is to recover a puppy that has found shelter in a hiding place after an elder of the offspring was killed by a large predatory bird. The tutorial broadly explains that the primate we are guiding, of which we only know the generic age (child, adult, or elderly) and sex (male or female), can use its senses, in particular the sense of smell , to identify other clan members or food, or he can use his intelligence to recognize some points of interest: plants of various types, food, fishing areas, beehives, landmarks and, of course, hiding places. Having said that, we are left completely alone to discover how everything works, that is, how to put our skills into practice. Using intelligence we find ourselves looking at a myriad of interactive points, white squares, of which we know nothing. Focusing on them we get the icon of the resource they indicate (but only after parsing it at least once). If you are in an unfamiliar area and the primate is afraid of the unknown, discovering what is around him helps to rationalize the fear by familiarizing himself with the new place. The system is complex and multifaceted, not immediate and it takes time to master. Discoveries Let's get back to us: after a few minutes we manage to find the hiding place where the little monkey is (it took us some time, but replaying with a second progeny the operation will seem incredibly simple) and we are placed in front of another game system of which we have to find out how it works, the one with which we can reassure the puppy to get him out of hiding and get him on our shoulders. Without starting to describe every single mechanic, let's say that the whole gameplay is like this, at least in the first few games: one discovery after another of how everything works. The very health system of our monkeys is a mystery we need to uncover.We know that to increase our life expectancy we must eat, drink and sleep, but as there are no indicators whatsoever, apart from a circle in the central part of the interface which gives us a general overview of our state, the only thing we can to do is interpret the situation and drink when we find a source of water, eat when we find food, and sleep when we are safe. Every action you take in Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey adds points to the neural development of your offspring, i.e. endows them with new skills and knowledge. Development varies according to our actions, whether or not we take a puppy with us on our wanderings and the time spent performing specific activities. For example, unveiling all the points of interest will increase intelligence, running through the trees will improve our mobility, examining many objects will give us skills such as the ability to hold an object by the hand (there is no inventory) and so on Street. In the advanced stages, the development will become even more complex because, as already mentioned, it will take into consideration other factors such as sociality or object construction skills, as well as the way in which we will manage our progeny by providing them with food and resources. Let's say that the arrival point is a caveman capable of defending himself from dangers with his own tools and able to make the best use of each of the available resources. The problems of evolution So far Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey is a conceptually wonderful game, which works really well. The first games are the ones in which you die the most, either because you don't know how to deal with the dangers you encounter, or because you haven't yet fully mastered the climbing system and you fall into the void more often, or because discoveries cost it also struggles for the player himself, who constantly oscillates between the frustration of not knowing what to do and the wonder of discovery. Every step forward that you take gives you incredible satisfaction, while opening up new possibilities for interaction that preclude new discoveries. Often you find yourself with decimated progeny and have to start from scratch, but it all works because you are driven by the desire to find out what the game system has to offer. The problem is that when you start again from the beginning you have to redo many actions that in the long run are tedious, such as identifying resources: we are talking about hundreds of white squares to analyze, even where we players are no longer monkeys and we know perfectly well what they indicate and what are we to do about it. Consider that the adventure begins in a valley and then opens up to wider territories, all full of resources to discover. Also consider that by passing close to a resource the primates will not automatically identify it, but you will still have to do everything by hand. Repeating everything with more offspring is suffocating in the long run. Another significant problem is represented by the combat system, which we have deliberately not mentioned until now. At the beginning of the game the primates are defenseless against snakes, tigers, pumas, wild boars and other wild animals that can kill them with one blow. When one approaches, the interface warns us clearly with a danger signal. Unfortunately the artificial intelligence of these creatures is essentially nil and each enemy is unusually fast. The solution is to flee to the trees (or try to intimidate him by making shrill cries that don't work very well), waiting to have developed the ability to defend ourselves. However, when we are reached, the only possibility left to us is to dodge: the action slows down and we are invited to press a button to avoid the blow and... that's it. Soon after the predator on duty will try to hit us again and we will have to dodge again and again. The most effective solution would be to flee up a tree, but sometimes the climbing animations are broken by the dodge request and you find yourself having to repeat the escape attempt several times, especially in the presence of very fast enemies. Unfortunately, even by developing defense tools, the situation does not improve much and the dynamics of the fights remain very woody, to the point that they almost become a nuisance. This problem is linked to the aforementioned bad artificial intelligence of all the creatures that populate the game world. Let some monkeys without tribes pass by and they stand still for hours waiting for our gifts to enter our progeny, but in general the same immobility is shared by all the animals, which stand still waiting for our passage and which are all other than natural. The tooro animations are not exactly beautiful and often produce not exactly pleasant nonsense, such as snakes that attack even if we are in the queue. Unfortunately, these technical shortcomings end up impoverishing the gameplay a bit, which in some moments is approximate. Too bad, because instead the general graphics are really not bad. It's not miraculous, but the forests are convincingly rendered, as are the transitions between biomes, truly sumptuous at times. Then the animations of the monkeys are excellent, always adequate in all circumstances, such as when they grab onto ledges or lianas to save themselves from a fall. Too bad that those of other animals are not at the same level. Finally the soundtrack: made up of natural sounds, atmospheric noises and a whole series of tricks that help enormously to immerse yourself in the game.", "date": "2019-08-26", "grade": "7.8"}
