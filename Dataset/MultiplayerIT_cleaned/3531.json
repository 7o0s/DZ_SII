{"name": "Control", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/control-recensione-pc.html", "text": "It took three years for Remedy Entertainment's new production to hit the market. Three years after the previous project: that Quantum Break which, while making itself known for some bold and decidedly out of the ordinary narrative choices, failed to scratch the heart and soul of the most savvy players and tied to other products of the Finnish developer , as did six years earlier Alan Wake and, even further back in time, Max Payne. In these three years that separate Quantum Break from Control, however, everything happened to Remedy: there was the separation from Microsoft, a sort of return to indie development, the publishing of 505 Games, the creation of the first completely multiplatform project and , absolutely not least, the team's willingness to leave aside its historical and most charismatic face, Sam Lake, to put on the scene another group of talented figures starting from lead designer Mikael Kasurinen and screenwriter Brooke Maggs. Let me be clear: Sam Lake is always there to play the role of creative director as well as writer of Control, but perhaps this title really wants to represent a moment of break with Remedy's past, waiting for this software house to be ready to come back up more traditional terrains, perhaps with the announcement of an Alan Wake 2 which, the writer, wholeheartedly hopes to be able to see and play on next-generation consoles. With ray tracing: note the reflections on the side windows Without ray tracing But let's get back down to earth because if you are reading these lines it is because you are clearly interested in Control and, in this regard, it is essential to underline a handful of elements that distinguish this article. In fact, yesterday, on the pages of Multiplayer.it, we published the review of Control in the PS4 and Xbox One version edited by Tommaso Pugliese. Our advice is to read that piece, if you haven't already done so, or even just to take a look at the video review that accompanies the article, to get a very precise idea of what the new Remedy game is. of its history, of the peculiarities of the metroidvania gameplay and to have a smattering of the graphics sector. All obviously accompanied by our reasoned judgment on the elements that work in the title and those that instead convinced us less and led to the final decision of a vote set at 8.7. Instead, what you are reading at the moment is the review of Control in the PC version: an article entirely focused on the quality of this conversion, on the graphic settings available to players and on the analysis of the title's performance on three different computer configurations that we have had at our disposal to thoroughly test Remedy's latest work of ingenuity. All machines based on the Intel/NVIDIA combination, not having high-level AMD RADEON components available, but which should properly represent the highest market segments, without reaching the excesses of out-of-scale configurations. Ray-traced: note the reflection in the front glass, the metal tube and the increased realism of the shadows on the left Without ray tracing The settings Control is truly a manifesto of Remedy's love for PC players and should be used as an example for all those software houses that limit themselves to developing multiplatform projects by pouring the exact same options and settings present on the console into the computer version , without even reflecting on what PC users would really like to see and be able to configure on their machines. First of all, the game supports any controller available on the market, provided it is recognized by Windows, and can also be perfectly played with the combination of mouse and keyboard. The settings concerning playability combined with those of the controls allow you to configure the two types of input independently, working on the sensitivity of the controller or mouse with a specific setting for when you are in aiming mode and allowing you to adjust separately the aiming assistance (for example if you want it with the joypad, but not with the mouse). It is even possible to set the type of keys on the joypad (PlayStation or Xbox) so as to make the correct indication appear on the screen and to have small adjustments on the layout of the commands. Among other things, in a very intelligent way, the game allows you to set up to 3 different buttons/keys for the same command to offer great versatility on this front as well. Nothing noteworthy in terms of audio settings and management of the on-screen interface, thist'last fully customizable, even if we greatly appreciated the partial configurability of the subtitles which, in addition to being able to be set in size, also allow you to have a black background so as to be perfectly legible in any situation of light and background. And we come to the graphics settings, all gathered under the heading Screen. The first element that catches the eye is the possibility of having a rendering resolution different from the output one. In this way it is possible to gain a generous number of frames per second in an instant without altering the visual geometry of the monitor or TV used in any way. It is obviously also possible to have super sampling by selecting a rendering resolution higher than the output one so as to exploit any brute force of your PC if you have a FullHD or 1440p monitor. At the same time we really appreciated the implementation of DLSS in the game, the advanced anti-aliasing technique compatible only with the 2000 series of NVIDIA GeForce RTX, it being understood that enabling it forces us to choose a lower rendering resolution than the output one without no possibility of forcing parity between the two. Under the heading quality are then grouped a dozen settings to adjust any aspect of texture, shadows, reflections, level of detail of objects, SSAO and the application of MSAA which is supported up to 4x. All these settings can be managed manually or by taking advantage of the three available presets. Finally, there is a space specifically dedicated to ray tracing which can only be enabled by starting Control in DirectX 12 mode and having an NVIDIA card installed in your machine. You can enable or disable 5 different real-time lighting settings: reflections, transparency, shadows, indirect lighting and specific ray tracing for debris. Also in this case we are given the possibility of setting a simple preset which, in addition to deactivating the feature outright, allows you to choose between a lighter and a maximum version so as to meet the greatest number of possible configurations. Needless to say, enabling any type of ray tracing on video cards prior to the 2000 family is violently detrimental. The performance And let's get to the heart of this review: Is Control on PC stable and optimized? We would like to answer in the affirmative, but with some exceptions. The new work of Remedy Entertainment presented itself from the very first review build incredibly clean and performing. Of course, the machines we ran it on are all high-end, but if we compare this game with the situation at the launch of Metro Exodus or Battlefield V, we are clearly in another universe, especially when it comes to ray support tracking. Control never presented a glitch during the entire review phase, with the exception of some cut-scene fluidity issues promptly resolved with the latest NVIDIA certified drivers released to the public on August 20th. To date, the only real problem we've experienced is a rare stutter phenomenon that seems to occur at random frequencies and with very short duration during long gaming sessions, possibly due to some non-optimized system memory management which probably gets heavier during the passage between the various sectors into which the map of this metroidvania is divided. Similarly, we did not appreciate Remedy's choice not to support HDR at launch on both consoles and PCs, together with a handful of additional features such as configurable FOV or support for multi-monitor configurations. All advanced settings that will surely be added with the next patches. Ray-traced: Note the reflections off puddles and the increased realism of contact shadows Without ray tracing Ray traced: Note the reflections off the floor and the increased realism of all shadows Without ray tracing When it comes to raw performance, here are our values. Keep in mind that in all the cases examined, the game was set to the maximum preset in terms of quality, while ray tracing and DLSS are specified according to the configuration. All three configurations are equipped with 16 GB of RAM and 64-bit Windows 10 while Control was launched with the DirectX 12 executable.
