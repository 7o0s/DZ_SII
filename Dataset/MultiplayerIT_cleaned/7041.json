The concept behind the game is very simple and involves precisely connecting the colored dots on the screen, proceeding strictly horizontally or vertically, with a view to different methods which however seemed designed to offer entertainment that did not go beyond impromptu , therefore devoid of those wide-ranging sequences and that progression on which many of the most popular puzzle games for mobile devices can count. With the release of TwoDots, this lack has been filled in the best possible way, through the implementation of a structure made up of as many as one hundred and ten levels (continuously updated) gradually becoming more complex, without a time limit to submit to but with precise objectives to achieve from time to time, whether it's clearing a certain number of dots of a certain color or dropping down a series of anchors. What really does not appear changed is the immediacy of the experience, the simplicity of its mechanisms and the solidity of the gameplay, which asks us, as already mentioned, to connect dots marked by the same color proceeding vertically or horizontally, in order to delete them and get the ~descent~ of the elements that are above them. From the first minutes, however, it is clear that behind this sequel there is also a precise stylistic study, which enriches that ~minimalist~ path undertaken with the first episode and adds various facets to it, always elegant and effective. TwoDots is an elegant, minimalist style puzzle game full of levels and quite challenging A framework of excellence One of the nicest things about TwoDots is the stage map, which is represented with a series of alternating scenarios, putting original and interesting visual solutions on the plate. The action is also accompanied by a soundtrack that is also perfectly themed, classy, which dynamically adapts to situations to give us space and concentration. However, the absolute protagonist of the production of Betaworks One is the gameplay, which starts with some very simple stages to act as tutorials and gradually increases the difficulty when you get in tune with the mechanisms and even the simple strategy that regulate the elimination of colored dots. As mentioned, the elements that disappear cause the descent of those positioned above them on the board, which means that we will get a different arrangement of the objects. Well, avoiding eliminating certain points can prove to be an effective tactic to be able to compose ~squares~, or connect four or more ~dots~ to form a closed circuit, capable of making all elements of the same color disappear from the screen and maximize , therefore, the collection that we are asked to do during the first missions, when the objective is to eliminate a certain number of elements of certain shades using a limited amount of moves. Subsequently this system is enriched by a series of variants, such as for example the anchors, which must be sent to the bottom of the board, or the ~broken~ points, which constitute another category to be collected. TwoDots is a freemium title of the ~honest~ ones, which leaves only any boosts and the possibility of obtaining additional moves to complete a level in the field of in-app purchases. It is therefore possible to play as much as you want without spending a penny, provided you wait for our lives to recharge when, after a series of failed attempts, their number has temporarily run out.", "date": "2014-06-27", "grade": "8.0"}
