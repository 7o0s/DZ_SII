A genre so mistreated due to a certain immobility that has characterized its major exponents, but also by the tastes of the players, who in large numbers have headed towards new shores. The prolific times of Super Nintendo and the first two PlayStations are long gone, only portables have continued a good tradition and in the meantime Japanese developers have struggled more than expected to adapt. However, the Japanese role-playing game is also one of those few genres capable of fully justifying the purchase price, guaranteeing all-round videogame sensations that are adopted even after having placed the game on the shelf. Just be patient, however, to find every now and then someone who pulls a memorable title out of the hat capable of renewing or at least refreshing the genre. In 2011 Xenoblade exalted all Italian Wii users, in the same period another title peeped out in Japan, developed by Level 5 with the collaboration of the famous animation studio Ghibli; yes, those of Dragon Quest VIII, Inazuma Eleven and Professor Layton together with the studio that gave birth to masterpieces such as Spirited Away, Red Pig and Ponyo on the cliff. The result of this collaboration? Dozens of hours of gameplay, dynamic combat, lots of extras, exploration and the world map, an increasingly rare commodity these days. Ni no Kuni: The Threat of the Cinerea Witch we followed him far and wide around the world waiting for the Italian release; a disproportionate amount of time for translation, but all fans of the genre, and those who have lost their will a little along the way, can look with an interested eye at this title, which follows the classic canons of the genre but does not fail to bring a healthy dose of freshness. Long live the good feelings The story that forms the background to the Level 5 title does not differ so much from the themes and canons that we are used to seeing with Studio Ghibli's animated films, that is, more or less important life clips of the main protagonists, respect for the nature and for values, importance of feelings and friendship. All told as a fairy tale which, if from a formal point of view it seems to be mainly aimed at a teenage audience, does not fail to have deeper facets and messages aimed also at a more adult audience. Oliver is a child who during the initial moments sees his mother die in an attempt to save him from drowning; in the throes of despair and tears he manages to give life to Lucciconio / Mr. Drippy, the puppet who accompanied him throughout his childhood and who is actually a familiar (animal) from a parallel world. Lucciconio explains to Oliver that this world is populated by the ~soul mates~ of the one in which he lives, people who are connected thanks to a character element or a physical resemblance, even if of different races. What better time to go in search of one's ~parallel~ mother? Obviously in a long adventure and with many digressions on the subject, because the other world is full of beautiful, fascinating and often dangerous places to visit. In fact, Oliver discovers that many of its inhabitants are no longer the same due to the lack of a feeling they were full of instead: courage, love, trust, kindness. Together with Lucciconio and the magic that he has given him, it is possible to borrow some from people who have it in industrial quantities, and donate it to bring the ~sick~ ones back to how they once were. The main protagonist will learn on his own skin the strength of these feelings, their importance and everything the lack of which can cause: the inevitable bad guys have in fact been devoured by them until they become completely insensitive and dangerous. We won't go any further in order not to spoil the surprise, just know that the story starts very well, it evolves in a rather classic way but there are twists and some themes close to the animated films of Studio Ghibli; in short, it's done well but you could have dared a little more to make it memorable. That said, Oliver will meet tons of new characters who will also help him indirectly and he will never be alone in the fight. The game world is in fact populated by a myriad (400 different species and variations) of familiars similar to Lucciconio, which can be used in battle and associated with each character up to a maximum of three. In some phases they are obtained automatically, after a few hours of play they can be ~captured~ - randomly or better when they are impressed by the clash - thanks to a specific ability of Ester, Oliver's faithful companion during most of the adventure. Like the prot~human~ agonists familiars gain experience and level up, can equip weapons and items and gain skills according to their inclination to the elements. And again, based on their degree of rarity and potential they can transform into a different and better form, up to a further transformation that leads to two different and mutually exclusive branches. Dulcis in fundo, it is possible to feed them with delicacies to enhance their characteristics such as attack, defense, magic and evasion one point at a time. From what is written above it is therefore clear that the role of the familiars is very important, Ni no Kuni: The Threat of the Cinerea Witch undoubtedly excels in this component of collecting and extreme personalization, within which various variables come into play such as the choice of which familiar to grow (only those ~equipped~ gain experience), which objects / spells to associate and whether to go around the map looking for new ones. In the main menu, reachable with the triangle button, there is a beautiful section/encyclopedia with the description of each pet, where it can be found, how much experience and money it releases. Not to mention the affinity towards one element or another, an absolutely vital characteristic during fights in order to counter the adverse pets and the bosses on duty. The combat system of Ni no Kuni: The Threat of the Cinerea Witch, in fact, offers an absolutely interesting hybrid system that assumes a lot of player interaction, at least in the most heated clashes. At any time it is possible to choose which character to control among the three ~owners~, as well as each of the three familiars available. The control is free on the battlefield and in real time: it is therefore possible to move to evade physical attacks or use skills from a certain distance and remain safe. When you switch characters or enter the character, skill and item selection menu, the game pauses; in all other cases an opponent can interrupt the summoning of his own spells or be anticipated in turn, up to ~cancelling~ the action if the blow is given with the right timing. Within the ~Tactics~ menu it is possible to choose the behavior of the two supporting actors; also in this case being too aggressive leads to premature depletion of the magic points, vice versa the support may not be adequate to defeat the opponents. Always in a tactical key, there is the possibility with the triangle and square keys to send everyone to attack or defend themselves, the latter being a vital choice when the opponents prepare to launch their highly destructive area magic. So how do the fights work? Very good, the new areas to explore offer a lot of headaches, we happened to die several times with the bosses and in general we had to ingenuity to select the best formation in battle, alternating the control of the characters, using the spells available and not skimping on massive use of objects, especially in the most important clashes. Obviously in places already visited or when doing ~grinding~ it is possible to attack without caring too much about it; the leveling seemed to us to be absolutely normal to complete the game, more necessary for all the side activities; if you really have difficulty with the clashes, among the game options there is the possibility of reducing the difficulty to focus more on the story. The combination of pets / collecting plus dynamic fights therefore brings a little freshness and manages to support the game in the hundreds of fights necessary to reach the end. Exploring never hurts More classic, however, the rest of the game structure, with the cities to explore, the characters to interact with, the shops to buy, the side quests that gradually join the main story. Then there is the much coveted World Map, which acts as a link between one setting and another and hides secrets that will appeal to JRPG enthusiasts. The progression here is perfect; the game initially offers only exploration on foot and in the dungeons, gradually gaining a spell to reach the already visited settings, the possibility of setting sail for the seven seas and finally flying to reach otherwise inaccessible plateaus. The same thing happens for the spells supplied by Oliver, in large quantities and reachable quickly with the square button without going through the main menu. Among those to levitate and get around traps, melt glaciers blocking the passage, return to your own world, build bridges or ~rejuvenate~ objects, the developers have madedid an excellent job to make the exploration more varied and the dungeons interesting, avoiding proposing only going from point A to point B, until you meet the boss on duty. Particularly interesting are the puzzle sections inserted sporadically, some of which assume skill with the pad (such as when you have to control two characters with both analogs at the same time) and others that instead propose riddles within which you have to move objects thanks to the magic to unlock doors and steps. And again, we happened to have to solve missions using the Wizard Companion (Abbecedabra by us), which can be consulted from the main menu and within which there is a super description of all the game material, including some elements of the story if they wanted to elaborate. Well, in one puzzle we had to read one of these pages to answer the riddle that was posed to us, in another we had to translate an inscription from the Nazcaa language, given that inside the book there is a table with the translations from symbols to Alphabet letters. Buyers of the Wizard Edition of Ni no Kuni will rejoice in knowing they can use the book without having to go back and forth from the menus every time, also because a last interesting section is represented by the alchemical formulas, which allow you to create objects and weapons of all the types; the best ones (120!), predictably, are unlocked with the secondary or story-related quests. To seal everything, there is a shop in each city that offers monsters to hunt, and next to it a bulletin board with all the secondary missions offered by the inhabitants. The reward for their completion, in addition to the experience gained in the fights, is represented by objects, money and stamps to complete special cards, which can be exchanged for benefits such as discounts at shops, more experience, a faster ship and even the jump, which is defined ironically as ~useless~, but nice to see. We completed Ni no Kuni: The menace of the witch Cinereain exactly 50 hours and six minutes, with about 60% of the side missions and 50% of the hidden treasures revealed; presumably the fastest and least interested in the extras will take about ten hours less, with the risk of not emerging victorious from the most difficult fights. Once the game is completed, a new save file is created which takes you back to the point immediately preceding the final battle: at the same time, new bounties are unlocked, new battles in Solossum (the fighting arena), new extras at the Casino (where there are several to win special items) and various side activities/missions released by notable characters. In short, there is quite a lot of stuff to do both before and after completion. In general, the variety is exceptional and is suitable for all JRPG fans, never too boring thanks to the numerous navigation systems available: as you progress in the game it is always faster and easier to move between the already visited settings. Playstation 3 trophies Ni no Kuni: The menace of the Cinerea witch offers 34 trophies, of which 5 are gold and 9 are silver. Only a small part, 35%, is obtained by completing the title, the others are dedicated to extras, side missions and the number of fights, ~adopted~ pets, levels reached, alchemical formulas and so on. Again, to get the coveted platinum, you have to play for well over 50 hours. A wonderful world All this beautiful package in terms of gameplay is included in an audiovisual sector that is nothing short of fascinating. The collaboration with Studio Ghibli can be seen entirely from an artistic point of view, the characters are masterfully designed and animated, the settings are often a feast for the eyes for their softness of colors and quality of the line, the variety itself is very high and even the mere exploration of the World Map is a pleasure for the continuous change between settings, with breathtaking sunsets and backgrounds. The same thing goes for the design of the characters, who suffer little from the syndrome of the already seen (and where instead in Dragon Quest VIII there was Akira Toriyamite). Most of the interlude scenes are made with the game engine and are supported by excellent dialogues, there are also complete animation sequences that really recall a Studio Ghibli film, beautiful but which are really few and do not follow a logic of presence real, so as to suggest that they were placed there as a pure fan service. Finally, from a technical point of view, the game does its honest job without rivaling the best console titles, but still has good fonts", "date": "2013-01-17", "grade": "9.3"}
