The resonance obtained by the new chapter is destined to be felt for a long time between consoles and PC, finally assigning Monster Hunter a prominent place in the western playful offer, with the mark left by this chapter that will be able to provide inspiration and examples from follow for those who want to try their hand at this particular meaning of the action RPG. Among the direct consequences of its success we can count the birth of new mobile titles that try to follow its structure, by now a physiological reaction of the portable device market to any successful videogame product. Rangers of Oblivion clearly fits into this trend of Monster Hunter research on the mobile platform, but that doesn't mean it isn't able to stand out for some specific peculiarities between style, setting and game structure, as we try to explain in this review. To tell the truth, rather than originality, there is a certain well-balanced balance between various sources of inspiration that strongly appear in the features of the game: essentially it is a small reduction of the classic Asian-style MMORPG (not for nothing the production is entrusted to the Chinese giant NetEase) focused above all on monster hunting and character growth through the accumulation of experience, weapons and armor. In fact, the two genres have a large area of intersection that can easily give rise to numerous experiments of this type and Rangers of Oblivion manages to place itself in a rather equidistant point from the two main sources of inspiration, even if during the game the proximity to the classic MMORPG becomes clearer. From a technical point of view, Rangers of Oblivion is simply spectacular and clearly demonstrates the value of the production fielded by NetEase for its development, with a truly high-profile graphics system for a mobile game that is reflected in the quality of the models of the various characters (although strongly afferent to the usual oriental-style gender stereotypes) and settings. The hunt and the role After a spectacular presentation in computer graphics and a fairly complete editor, at least by the standards of mobile titles, the game turns out to be an action RPG apparently completely comparable to the classic MMORPGs with a fantasy setting of oriental construction. The structure of the quests, however, refers directly to the aforementioned Monster Hunter, as is immediately evident, being focused entirely on monster hunting. The gameplay is divided between activities in the inhabited centers, where the social and character management phase ranking takes place, and the quest phase with exploration of the surrounding environment in search of materials for crafting and obviously the fight against monsters. Among these we find more or less powerful creatures and difficult to kill but we are definitely far from the epic levels that characterize many of the clashes in a normal Monster Hunter. The hunt in Rangers of Oblivion never reaches the impressive scale of some Capcom combat, limiting itself to a kind of balanced task, which can be challenging but hardly prohibitive or even epic. This is both due to the simpler design of the monsters and due to the very mechanics of the combat system. To meet the limitations of touchscreen controls, in fact, combat takes place simply by pressing keys corresponding to simple attack, dodge and special abilities. Given the power of the latter, we are essentially called to alternately touch the keys of the special moves, limiting ourselves to waiting for the cooldown times and possibly attacking the weak points of larger enemies to maximize damage and the collection of materials, the only strategic element entered into the fight. The attention therefore shifts above all to the growth of the character, to the conquest of the loot which leads to new weapons and armor rather than to the pleasure of the clash, even if the animations certainly make everything spectacular to behold. As for the free-to-play structure, the game seems surprisingly fair in managing resources and micro-transactions, so a try is recommended for anyone who is attracted by the setting and the particular mixed RPG solution.", "date": "2019-02-08", "grade": "7.2"}
