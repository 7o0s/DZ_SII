The complete series consists of six English-language episodes. There are no spoilers in this first review. Game of Thrones is perhaps one of the most ambitious licenses acquired by Telltale, which has tripled its presence on the market in the last year. The protagonists are four members of the Forrester family, whose deeds have remained in the shadows to this day. It will take Game of Thrones fans minutes to notice the similarities between the Forresters and the troubled Starks, to whom they have been loyal since time immemorial. Everyone else might be a little uncomfortable with this series. It is true that the Codex section contains a lot of useful information, but the many references to the history of the Iron Throne and the fact that the events take place in conjunction with the Red Wedding, so when the story told in the books has already begun long ago , make those unfamiliar with Martin's work feel less satisfaction playing this series. To this we add that of the three protagonists of this episode, the only one charismatic and pleasant enough is the young Ethan, who has become the lord of his own house against his will. The eldest Mira, grappling with the intrigues of King's Landing, is the least enjoyable figure of her entire narrative line, while Gared, Lord Gregor's squire, suffers from an anonymous face on which it seems that every personality fits perfectly . Perhaps this was precisely the intention of the authors, to have malleable characters that could bring out different characters depending on the player's choices during the dialogues. The result, however, is that they all have an indecipherable expression that suggests an ambiguous nature with which it is difficult to get in tune. It remains to be seen how they will evolve and above all how Asher, the fourth protagonist of the series, will behave, a Forrester exiled to Essos but on his way home. As for the original characters of the work present in this first episode, the writers have done an excellent job, giving them centered and coherent lines of dialogue. For the moment we have seen Cersei, Ramsay, Tyrion and Margaery on stage, and none of the three has deviated one iota from the idea we have made of them by reading the novels and watching the television series. And if, like us, you love the bastard of the Starks, you will be pleased to know that Jon Snow is also appearing, with whom we will almost certainly be dealing in the next episode. Iron From Ice immediately strikes its heroes with a catastrophe that causes one woe after another It can only end badly For the Forresters it starts immediately badly, and everything suggests that it will end even worse, as is the style of Martin. Their story is told by alternating the points of view of the three protagonists, separated from each other in space but united by a common purpose. Everyone is called to make choices that will have repercussions on the lives of others. It is still embarrassing to read that the story will adapt to our decisions, because this does not happen and all players who are familiar with the Telltale series know it, but there is a clarification to be made. The comparisons between the characters create a tension equal to that which is felt by reading some pages of the novel. Mira's hearing with Cersei and Ethan's reception of Ramsay kept us on tiptoes on the edge of our seats. Even choosing who should be our adviser forced us into long minutes of reflection. And in the end the result is always the same: after thinking about it thoroughly, the alternatives are all valid, and any choice leaves behind remorse and pain. It matters little therefore that the story would have gone on in a certain way anyway, at least in the main turning points; we have perceived all the gravity of the moment, and that is enough. We have also expressed ourselves with similar words on the occasion of other Telltale series, because this is what they do best, a number of illusions that they successfully reproduce every time, at least until someone overcomes them. Apart from this, however, there is nothing else. The narrative style of Game of Thrones, full of dialogues and psychological manipulations, has finally relegated to a corner the sad Quick Time Events, which appear only at the beginning and on few occasions. However, all the emptiness caused by the lack of exploration and use of reason that should characterize an adventure remains. The few items in the inventory are there just for beauty, or maybe someone will come in handy in the future, but we certainly won't be the ones to figure out how and when. Apart from this aspect, which will only disappoint those who expect more from a story with interactive dialoguesi, what detracts from the majesty of the episode is the hasty technical realization. The pictorial style is solemn in photos, but in video it reveals all the limits of an outdated graphics engine. Blurriness, jagged edges, and other inaccuracies add up to the poor exterior. With The Wolf Among Us, Telltale had delighted us with an excellent presentation. Obviously something must have changed, or too many projects in progress do not allow the development studio to devote all the necessary energy to each of them. Nonetheless, Iron From Ice snatched a cry of amazement from us right at the end, and we certainly want to see how it continues. If you know the hair color of all of Martin's invented characters, this series should help you bear the wait for the next book.", "date": "2014-12-05", "grade": "7.4"}
