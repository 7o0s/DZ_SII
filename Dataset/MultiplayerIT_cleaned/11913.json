{"name": "Portal - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/portal-recensione.html", "text": "Orange Box The Orange Box is THE ultimate package for Xbox 360 and PC (a PS3 version is also planned, but will be released later and we don't know if it will contain any extras due to the delay). By purchasing it, you take home the following titles: Half-Life 2 (Review - Score: 10) Half-Life 2: Episode One (Review - Score: 8.7) Half-Life 2: Episode Two (Review - Score: 9.2) Team Fortress 2 (Review - Score: 9.0) Portal (Review - Score: 8.5) In addition to the ~major~ products, the package contains several Extras including Half-Life 2: The Lost Coast, an additional level released for free by Valve a few months later the release of Half-Life 2 in stores and Peggle Extreme, a fun puzzle game from Popcap Games capable of captivating for a few hours with its extremely ~casual~ gameplay (you have to throw a ball hoping it hits the various buffers distributed for levels). The product is available in PC and Xbox 360 versions. Note for the PC version: Anyone who has previously purchased Half-Life 2 or Half-Life 2: Episode One can give a copy to anyone, as long as the recipient does not already have the two games registered on Steam. The procedure to follow is explained by Valve itself (look in the package sheet). For the rest, the quality of the titles speaks for itself: Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 are masterpieces, the two episodes of the serial trilogy are excellent games while Portal is a great extra (let's hope that in case of a sequel they opt for greater longevity) that is worth a try to understand what a group of students supported by a great developer can come up with. The Orange Box, from any point of view you look at it, is an essential purchase that you must not miss. Play it again Sam As you may have understood, the gameplay of Portal is very original. Made by a group of ex-students of the Digipen school, who managed to convince Valve of the goodness of their project by showing them a demo, this little gem succeeds in the difficult task of surprising for its playful characteristics more than for some technical gimmick and it is not little. Understand the simple portal rules, it's easy to get caught up in the action. You don't kill anyone (at most there are turrets to deactivate) and there are no other weapons besides the basic one, but you can't help but play, also thanks to the intelligent use of the off-screen voice, which will then be the source of the only twist of the plot (which we obviously don't tell you about). Moreover, the computer jokes, which continue throughout the adventure, are well written and represent an interesting extra. In short, we understand that they weren't put there just to add something, but they have their own function that culminates in the splendid finale (we can't tell you about this either... but trust me, it's very original and absolutely must be seen). In short, the voice of Portal, belonging to a computer, is much more human than most of the ~human~ characters in video games, thanks to a skilful and non-approximate characterization. Having said that, it is impossible not to mention the only other character in the game, the pet box (of which you will find a screenshot immediately below), who will be the protagonist of one of the game's most hilarious moments and who is irresistible with his little pink hearts printed on each side. It MUST become a cult object. We want one in every FPS! Short existence Unfortunately it ends quickly. It took us two and a half hours to finish Portal (extra levels excluded), but we suppose that talking about an average longevity of three hours and more is not unrealistic, unless we get stuck in front of some puzzle. It's really short. The end comes when you are still in full ecstasy from the novelty and longing to continue playing. Especially the final section, in which you are free and have to face unprecedented difficulties, makes you want to continue again and again. Too bad it's not possible. Frankly we would have preferred more levels and at least a couple more hours of gameplay. Yes, there are unlockable extras that stretch the game, but they're small compared to the disappointment after the credits roll. If it had lasted at least five hours, the vote would have been much higher, because basically we don't care that much about having exploited Half-Life 2's graphics engine too little. The scenarios are rather empty, even if there are some gems (especially in the final part), but playing you don't even notice the poverty of the graphics and, on the contrary, you are often fascinated by aesthetically pleasing moments produced by the portals. But the end comes suddenly and leaves salt. Probably extra levels will arrive over time, especially thanks to the users, and the originality of the idea must be rewarded without reservations. But we cannot overlook a defect of this magnitude that must be taken into consideration. System requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Intel Pentium 4 1700 MHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: DirectX 8 compatible or higher DirectX 9.0c Recommended Requirements Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3000 MHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1024 MB Video Card: compatible with DirectX 9 or higher DirectX 9.0c Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4Ghz RAM: 2GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7800GT Comment The vote you see in the box refers to the entire Half-Life 2: Orange Box package while the vote for Portal is 8.5. Purchase Portal with the Orange Box so as not to pay too much attention to its short duration. In any case, be aware that you will finish it within three hours but also that it is one of the most original games of the year and that it is definitely worth playing. It is certainly a product capable of bewitching but for this reason one misses a few more hours of play. You are warned. Pros The portals are one of the best gimmicks of recent years Beautiful dialogues and the relationship that develops with the voice-over The final battle is fun and challenging Cons Longevity, despite the extras, is minimal Visually not exceptional We would like it Still Portal is part of Half-Life 2: Orange Box, is available for PC and Xbox 360 and will be available for PlayStation 3. The tested version is the one for PC. You awaken Being awakened from a long sleep to be the guinea pig in a scientific experiment involving the use of a very powerful weapon must be a traumatic experience. Especially if things don't go as they should and to guide us is one of the craziest computers in the history of video games. Do you think that the protagonist will not be provided with shoes for the whole adventure (and this, on the other hand, is the most useless annotation ever written). In short, to summarize, our role will be to test a rifle capable of opening connection portals on some surfaces, and to do this we will have to overcome trick rooms in which we will have to be able to figure out how to reach the exit by solving various puzzles. Obviously the puzzles will always involve the use of portals, which can be used in various ways. The standard use is the one that allows you to reach otherwise inaccessible places, such as raised platforms or corridors enclosed by grates. A blue or yellow sphere is thrown towards the arrival point by creating the first portal, the other sphere is thrown in the vicinity of the player and the portal is crossed to reach the destination. Simple and immediate. Of course, portals have other uses as well. For example, they allow you to transport objects, to pass energy spheres to get them towards generators and to make very long leaps by performing a particular technique. Basically there are always two portals, but one must be opened on an oblique or, in any case, very high surface, placed in front of the platform to be reached, while the other must be placed on a lower platform than the one where find the character and where it is possible to jump with some precision. The dynamics are simple: once the two portals are opened, the protagonist jumps into the lower one and, taking advantage of the acceleration of the fall, she exits the higher portal flying towards the target platform. It sounds very complicated, put into words, but don't worry, Portal is a harder game to explain than to play.", "date": "2007-10-19", "grade": null}
