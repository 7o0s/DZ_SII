{"name": "Ferrari World Championship", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ferrari-world-championship.html", "text": "Ferrari World Championship is a title with quite bizarre contents. Most of the game is in fact framed within the world of Formula 1, but forget the fights between teams and the different liveries of the single-seaters; here everything is rigorously and only Ferrari. Therefore, even the choice of driver to impersonate is restricted to Raikkonen and Massa, against 20 other perfect strangers, all of them always and only driving identical Ferrari F1s. A sort of improbable one-make championship which, however, also becomes monotonous, repetitive and not very credible after the very first stages. The game modes are also quite limited, since they are limited to simply fast running and the championship. The latter takes place on only 9 of the theater circuits of the real world championship, in detail: Australia, Qatar, Spain, France, USA, Germany, Italy, Japan and Brazil. The feeling is therefore that the costs of the Ferrari license have forced us to cut the budget with regard to all the other components, and unfortunately the overall result is not good. Even the technical component leaves us dumbfounded: the choice of adopting a mix of 3D circuits and two-dimensional cars would not tend to be condemned, but unfortunately the reduced visual depth leads to seeing the curves only at the last moment, thus requiring you to always uncomfortably keep an eye on on the map above. Furthermore, although the single-seater has been faithfully reproduced and the presence of an internal view enhances the complexity of the cockpit, the level of detail of everything else is disappointing: the textures used for the trackside and the elements of the circuit have a marked chromatic predominance on gray, and consequently if it weren't for the themed 2D backdrop for each setting, it would seem to always be competing in the same place. In reality, everything described so far would be acceptable if Ferrari World Championship could enjoy a top-level play component, but on the contrary, Gameloft production cannot earn enough in this case too. The 3 different levels of difficulty add very little to the control of the car which is almost always glued to the asphalt as if it were going on rails. More generally, the gameplay is extraordinarily basic, not to say prehistoric: it's all about braking before the most demanding curves, and otherwise limiting yourself to maintaining the ideal driving line, remembering to stop every 3-4 laps in the pits since rigorously after this interval you always find yourself with worn tires and dry petrol. During the stop a little inspired mini-game intervenes, in which it is necessary to press the highlighted keys quickly to reduce the time taken by the mechanics to put the car back on the track. The artificial intelligence of the opponents is also bad, the same for everyone and unable to make the latter commit the slightest mistake. Lastly, the possibility of unlocking the historic 500 F2 once the championship has been successfully completed is of little use.
