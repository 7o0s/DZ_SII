{"name": "V-Rally 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/v-rally-3d.html", "text": "And from this world comes the latest work of Fishlabs games, distributed by Glu; we are referring to V-Rally 3D, a historical name for those who had to deal with the early years of the Playstation. In fact, at the time, V-Rally was one of the pioneering three-dimensional rally titles as stunning in terms of graphics as appreciable in playability. Since then, water has passed under the bridge, and the series has therefore abandoned the world of home consoles to devote itself to the mobile market. Let's start immediately with the positive aspects: V-Rally 3D is graphically a truly excellent product, especially as regards the fluidity of the action compared to the polygonal complexity on the screen. The cars, while not being able to enjoy official licenses, are still fairly faithful replicas of the originals, with a good level of detail. But it is above all the routes that give a good impression, both for the appreciable variety of settings and for the realistic reproduction of trackside elements and surrounding scenery. Sure, textures are decidedly grainy and visual depth is limited, but considering the average 3D title on mobile, it's safe to say that Fishlabs' work deserves at least praise. Obviously, the races take place only with your car on the screen; the challenge is in fact against the clock, or rather against the times set by one's opponents. Each race is divided into sectors, and it is possible to verify in each of them whether one's performance is better or worse than the first classified. There is also a robust multiplayer mode, both bluetooth and wap, which could be an example to follow for many listless developers. Faced with such valid premises, unfortunately V-Rally 3D does not maintain equally good levels when it comes to pure and simple gameplay. Although there is a sketchy physics management, which increases or decreases the grip based on the terrain, driving the cars is an all too simple task, which almost never requires the use of the brake, and which finds the only disturbing element in the need not to crash into the edges of the track. The car's response to key commands is also particularly imprecise; this kind of production is in fact one of the clearest exponents of the limits in the interface of mobile phones, thousands of kilometers away from the convenience and immediacy of analog sticks. The sound is not very incisive, which instead of the roar of the engines accompanies the action with an embarrassing silence, broken only by the navigator's voice.
