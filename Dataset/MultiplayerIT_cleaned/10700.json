What we know is a man who has already reached the pinnacle of success and fame. However, Poirot too has a past and Microids and Blazing Griffin have imagined a fragment of it to create Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot The First Cases, an investigative game for PC, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. Here is our review of Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot The First Cases. Poirot the agent Hercule Poirot as a young man, in a garden of a cottage Before becoming a detective, Poirot was a simple police officer at the center of a minor scandal that cost him his career in the big city. Fate has brought him to a small country town, where nothing in particular happens, at least until he finds himself having to solve a case of theft. As Poirot, we'll have to solve this little incident (which serves as a prologue and tutorial), but solving this case highlights the fact that justice doesn't always triumph. This event pushes the young Hercule to pursue the career we know and to become a first-class defender of the law. Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot The First Cases then takes us forward several years. Poirot is an experienced detective, even if he is not yet the man we met in the novels, and is recontacted by the family we met in the prologue. This time we have to solve a blackmail case, which soon turns into a murder case as well. Will we be able to? The story of the main game takes place entirely in a large mansion, on a snowy weekend that - conveniently - traps all the characters within four walls along with a blackmailer and an assassin. Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot The First Cases is a full-fledged mystery novel, divided into chapters during which we will get to know new characters and their secrets. The plot created by Blazing Griffin is respectful of Poirot's style both as a novel and as a character (with his speech well reproduced). There will be secrets, intrigues, unexpected bonds between characters and some red herrings. Various surprises in the game are actually predictable, but mostly because the adventure prepares us by sowing clues along the way: making certain connections and understanding certain events just before the game confirms them is very pleasant and is a symptom of a well written yellow story. At the same time, there are some connections that are a little too rapid and sudden on the part of Poirot or some conclusions that, although not illogical, seem too guided: in other words, one feels that, in some situations, the team had to speed up some phases of the investigation. However, there is nothing really out of place in the story told to us and each character finds their own space, reconnecting in one way or another to the events that form the fulcrum of the plot, which reaches a conclusion that is perhaps a little too simple. , but also for this perfectly believable. Gameplay Poirot in the snow, in front of a large villa However, the plot does not advance by itself. It will be our job to find out what lies behind the mysteries of the villa. Before even getting there, as mentioned, we will be dealing with a prologue. What we learn is all we need for the whole adventure, also because Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot The First Cases is certainly not a complex title from a playful point of view. With an isometric view, we simply have to explore each environment, interact with the objects available and talk to the characters, asking questions. In key moments of the game, there will be a sort of oral ~battle~ between Poirot and one of the interrogated, who will have to be convinced to speak by choosing the right approach (better to be aggressive or flattering? Poirot himself will suggest it). However, these sequences cannot be failed and in case of error you will simply have to start over, without suffering any consequences. A table with all the guests: who is the culprit? The focus of Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot The First Cases is the reasoning stage inside Poirot's head. Regularly we will have to open a menu in which the game gathers the clues in a very organized way. Each section of the case has its own part and includes everything we need (and more) to arrive at the correct conclusions. As? Simply by drawing a line between two clues: if they have a link, Poirot will create a new clue and once they've all been found we can move forward with the case. These menus indicate precisely if there are links yet to be discovered and, above all,All are organized as a logical map with a clear structure. This means that the clues to be linked are always close together and that there are no obstacles between them that block the connecting line. Added to the fact that it is possible to try to connect the clues to each other at random, this means that - even if you are not a great detective - it will be impossible to block you. Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot The First Cases is a very linear and simple game. Only in the final phase will it be possible to ~fail~ some logical connections, but it will happen after the resolution of the case, so in terms of narrative there is not much difference between perfect completion and a partial ending. However, the pace of the game is quite sustained and, if you are looking for an investigative game that is certainly not dynamic, you will remain glued to the screen until the end. Graphics and sound The entrance hall of Agatha Christie's villa - Hercule Poirot The First Cases Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot The First Cases is not a game with other production values, let's face it right away. The graphic presentation is adequate for an adventure that relies entirely on narration and investigation, but it is undeniable that there are several technical limitations. In addition to some stuttering (we played the PS4 version on PS5), the game offers somewhat rough polygonal models, with minimal animations and pleasant but unpretentious environments. Certainly not a game that should be bought for the glance. In terms of sound, the only part that makes sense to comment is the voice acting. The entire game is dubbed, with adequate results (we listened to the English one, the Italian dub is not available). All of the characters were voiced with proper accents in mind, but some got better treatment than others. However, we often found ourselves not waiting for the end of the recitation of the dialogues and we continued at reading speed, also in order not to slow down the progress too much. All texts are in Italian.", "date": "2021-10-05", "grade": "8.0"}
