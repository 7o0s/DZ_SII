{"name": "Frontline Attack: War over Europe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/frontline-attack-war-over-europe.html", "text": "~From! Wheel turret of Cuompagno Brezhnev cannon. No! Not that way!! Another pleasant surprise that Frontline Attack reserves for us is the powerful, flexible, solid and highly detailed three-dimensional graphics engine. We have absolute freedom in the movement of the camera, which can be kept fixed (rather awkward mode) or rotated in any direction, from a bird's eye view to grazing the ground, with a very high zoom factor. This allows us not only to keep an eye on large portions of the landscape or numerous contingents, but also to get around natural obstacles to the view, such as hills or forests. On the other side we can get close to our units so much to see the small soldiers with their rifles crawling on the ground or the sparks left by the bullets on the armor of the tanks. After a first, positive, impact with the user interface - very practical - which assigns all the visual evolutions of the camera to the mouse and designates special commands to give orders to the units, you will begin to appreciate the numerous goodies given to us by the programmers: an alternation between the hours of the day and the night optimally represented by the different lighting conditions, light effects and extremely realistic explosions and details of all kinds, from the smoke raised by passing vehicles to the tire tracks they leave on the asphalt to the small night lights with which they are equipped. Then the tactical map incorporated in the graphic user interface is inevitable: with it we will be able to keep an eye on the situation and move quickly along the perimeter of the war scenario. For greater immersion it is also possible to collapse the entire GUI downwards in order to have a completely free view - which requires a certain mastery of keyboard shortcuts to command the troops - and obtain a truly remarkable effect. Heavy bomber on the way ! In the first two campaigns you will face the clashes with the vehicles assigned at the start, and even if there will be occasions in which you will receive reinforcements you will have to get used to the idea of getting away with what you have. It will therefore be a good habit to learn to use the means of support (another touch of not indifferent realism); in fact, our platoon will often travel escorted by a repair vehicle, and if necessary it will be able to send an ammunition transport with which to reload the weapons and cannons. This in order not to leave an expensive and precious tank without shells in the middle of a battle and to keep the units efficient until the end of the mission. Your forces will consist of mixed land and air elements, although there will be a substantial difference: you can control men and land vehicles at will, while aircraft will have a limited, but no less important use. Once the pre-established point has been selected, you will only have to click with the mouse, press the appropriate button and wait: shortly the roar of the propellers will announce the arrival of air support, followed by menacing shadows that hang over the helpless enemies. Once their passage has been completed, the bombers (light or heavy) or scouts (able to fly over still unexplored areas of the map) will return to their base or high altitude waiting for another call. Be careful because the availability of air support in each mission is limited and sometimes the opponents have anti-aircraft artillery. The ground troops, on the other hand, are more assorted and include different varieties of soldiers (riflemen, grenadiers, snipers, anti-tank units and others), light vehicles (exploration jeeps or armed trucks) and heavy vehicles (ie the good old tanks). Combining their forces and exploiting their advantages obviously depends on the tactical skill of the player, to whom I point out that he will be faced with adequately reproduced vehicles, even in terms of performance. The tanks are slow and difficult to manoeuvre, the soldiers die very easily (especially if you run over them with a Panzerit can be done, I swear :P ) and the shots are not that accurate. Each single unit then has characteristics appropriate to the nation to which it belongs, therefore vehicle models, soldier uniforms and types of structures will be different and above all faithfully redesigned on the basis of the armies of the time. You can obviously select single units or groups, receiving detailed information on the status, damage and composition of the troops thanks to convenient ~on the fly~ indications that overlook each piece on your tactical chessboard. Uncle Sam wants you! The third campaignincludes an advanced tutorial and the final missions of the game, and basically has a structure more similar to that of skirmish/multiplayer maps: for the first time you will have to deal with the problem of producing units and structures. Impersonating the stars and stripes benefactors engaged in France and Italy against the Germans you will have to simulate their conduct of conquering important strategic positions on which to go and install your operational bases. From them you will start to expand your army, thus also addressing the management part. The way to secure constant funds is to occupy existing production facilities, such as mines or factories, and defend them. As the dindi will flow into our coffers we will be able to develop the base starting from the simple buildings and then build the advanced ones. Don't be afraid, realism wanted the number of buildings not to be too high as happens in more imaginative strategic games. The construction will take place within a given time and will be completed by a special vehicle that transports the material with its crane arm (very fun to watch). It is also essential to remember that many units require particular buildings in order to be built, and here too it will be suggestive to see the troops accompanied to the front by a truck or the tanks arrive quietly from an unspecified place beyond the trenches. Soon your camp will be a bustle of vehicles and soldiers and will be enriched with auxiliary structures such as bunkers and anti-tank or anti-aircraft guns that you can fill with soldiers. There is also no shortage of means of transport with which to carry the soldiers around more quickly. If you ever find yourself short on cash you can always sell an existing facility for immediate liquidity - which is a bit painful to do, unless it's enemy occupied facilities. The good strategist will then be able to infiltrate his units to also steal land vehicles from the enemy, thus adding them to his ranks, and will have a far-sighted perspective; in fact, every single mission is part of a large general picture that is affected by the positive or negative outcome of the tasks assigned. It is essentially a continuum of connected clashes that will make you relive the dramatic moments of the Second World War in a completely different perspective, that of the men who fought in it. Who doesn't bomb in company... Frontline Attack also features the typical multiplayer options of the strategy game: Direct connection, LAN or via the Internet (TCP/IP). It is possible to connect to the Earthnet service that supports the game or to another remote PC, be it an unofficial server or a friend's machine that you want to fight directly. In any case, whichever mode you choose you can play up to eight. The proposed clash modes are very interesting, which make use of a fair amount of maps (fifteen) specifically designed for the multiplayer environment: others will be available and then, with the included editor, you can always create them according to your needs. The options available in setting the parameters of the scenario concern the starting resources, the amount of starting troops (soldiers only or also armored vehicles), the squads and the factions, and obviously the map you wish to use as a theater of battle  there are maps more or less extensive, designed for an increasing number of players. However, there are also several combat modes. For example in Massacre you will start with a large amount of money available, but you will only have that, and you will have to economize as you fight to see who is left standing last. Calmer game modes recreate the situations of the single player campaign, while others like Free for All award a constant periodic influx of money to keep the fight going for a long time. As you see there are many approaches to quench your thirst for strategizing and never get tired of this really well made game. ~Verdammt! This video game didn't know how to leave, ja !~ Well, I hope you don't find yourself in this unpleasant situation once you install Frontline Attack. To avoid surprises, I can report the minimum configuration published on the official site: Windows 98 (but it also runs on ME and XP), a Pentium 2 MMX/350 MHz with 64 Mb of RAM and a 16Mb video accelerator card compatible with DirectX 8.1. The minimal installation takes up about 670 Mb of hard disk space. Well. This is the minimum configuration, you know, it's better to raise the target a little. To bomb the crucchi (or the yankees) without any problems it would be better to have a processor on 900/1000 MHz with a 32 Mb accelerator card. Just to say, a GeForce 2 is just fine. The game has been tested on a Pentium IV /1.8 Ghz with GeForce III Ti200 and 512 Mb of RAM giving excellent results at maximum detail, without any slowdowns even in the hectic phases of the battle. So adjust accordingly. The Final Comment I don't really like 'modern' strategists. I think I was one of the few who played Command & Conquer and Red Alert with ill-concealed listlessness. It will be the different type of approach to combat compared to the past, it will be the lack of charm that a too modern setting exerts on me. But so be it. I've always had memorable hours of fun playing games like Shogun, but it was a big surprise to find that I really like Frontline Attack a lot. It is certainly not a refined title, designed for tactical maniacs like the aforementioned best seller, but it is a more than valid product, released quietly and without too many pretensions, which could, in a short time and to everyone's surprise, climb the top of the top ten in the category. The technical realization is surprising, and the tactical element, in-depth but not excessively, mixes with a suggestive and engaging setting; the variety of situations and approaches, together with the inevitable multiplayer game modes and the scenario editor, make it very long-lived. But the thing that deserves praise and recognition is in my opinion the realism with which the game was made, the sensation of palpable physicality of the vehicles and the terrain, the maniacal detail and concreteness of the clashes, the precision with which many small elements, graphics and sound, merge to create a very real and lively picture. A little jewel of undoubted value, which will be able to excite both fans and those less accustomed to this genre, and which I can only warmly recommend to everyone. Jawohl Herr Commander! There are now numerous video games that in one way or another recreate the setting of the Second World War: Simulations, First Person Shooters and even Strategy Games. We are going to talk about an interesting real-time strategy in this review, namely Frontline Attack, which allows us to take a look at the war scenarios of the catastrophic conflict and to take part in it by leading the armies of the three factions involved, the Allies, the Russia and Germany. As the subtitle states, the theater of clashes will obviously be Europe, in particular France and Italy, even if there will be some detours to the lands of General Winter. Frontline Attack comes as a welcome surprise without too many ceremonies and offers us a difficult game scenario, both for the historical weight it represents, and for the period, very close to us and therefore affecting the detail with which it must be rendered in terms of reconstruction and gameplay. However, the arduous attempt seems to have given commendable results: after the installation from the two CDs included in the package we are faced with a coarse but impactful initial menu, an apt march with dramatic tones and we are immediately catapulted into the heart of the action. The choice may fall on the single campaign, which forces us to follow the three fundamental stages by taking command - in order - of the German, Soviet and allied forces through a series of missions, few indeed, but sufficiently long and ramified, which recall the great battles of the world conflict. Alternatively, we can try our hand at a skirmish customized by us, choosing which faction to command and which parameters to assign to the scenario of the clash. The game will start with a proper basic training mission, where we will learn how to organize troops and how to go into combat. We will immediately be able to appreciate the many details that add realism to the game, such as the slowness of heavy vehicles in maneuvering, or the need to supply them with ammunition or to repair them and so on.", "date": "2002-11-04", "grade": null}
