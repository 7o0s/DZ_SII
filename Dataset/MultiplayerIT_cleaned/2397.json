{"name": "Mario Kart: Super Circuit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-kart-super-circuit-2.html", "text": "Let's start the tests Let's now proceed with an in-depth analysis (time and ability of the undersigned permitting) of this 'new' Nintendo production. Obviously, also in this episode of Mario Kart, as in the previous ones, eight of the best known and most loved Nintendo mascots are grappling with the 'ruthless' world of engines. On board variously fake go-karts these Sunday centaurs challenge each other to the last window (although the go-karts have no doors) to win the five coveted cups of the entire tournament. The undertaking is obviously not easy and to excel we will often have to produce a high, almost unjustifiable effort. The frame is solid Let's first look at the Mario GP mode. Here we will first have to choose a class among the three available (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), then a rider (each one has different characteristics in terms of speed, acceleration, maneuverability and impact resistance) and finally a cup in which to participate. In the race we will then face fierce opponents and variously demanding and often treacherous circuits. To get a good result in a race we won't be able to count only on our driving skills and the goodness of the vehicle, but we will have to take advantage of everything the track offers us: zippers to accelerate, coins to collect which increase top speed, strategic shortcuts , but above all the numerous power-ups (or power-ups) widely available on the circuit. These are of various types: they allow us to hit opponents, to become invulnerable, to increase speed, to defend ourselves from the attacks of others and generally constitute that extra something that determines victory. Especially in the last few races, in the top class, without these upgrades it would be impossible to win. And this is where the difficulty factor comes into play. Mario Kart, as per Nintendo tradition, is one of those products that are easy to play, but difficult to master. In fact, if we choose the 50cc class and a medium-skilled rider like Mario or Luigi it will be very pleasant and fun (even too easy) to race and win. The situation changes in the 100cc and above all 150cc class, where control of the vehicle becomes more demanding and healthy competition is practiced (I would even dare to say dirty and excessive on various occasions). Indeed, in the 150cc class our adversaries seem invulnerable and all very fast, even those half-socks that on paper are considered very slow, so much so that high levels of frustration can be reached (from a frenzied launch of the console, so to speak); but this is mainly a situation that occurs in the first hours of the game, then with practice we should be able to redeem ourselves, we should. However, there is no doubt that a lot of patience, a lot of time and a large dose of luck will be needed to finish the game. Each Cup consists of four races and to win gold you will need to score as many points as possible (not necessarily win every race), trying to finish in the top four. In Mario GP mode it is also possible to play in two, subject to the availability of a cartridge each. Other single game modes are the Quick Run (a run and go, useful for practicing) and the Time Trial which allows us both to establish new track records and to view them. As for the multiplayer, up to four players can be challenged by choosing between Single and Multi - Pak. The Single-Pak version offers only four tracks and as many colors of Yoshi as the only driver. Furthermore, the graphics sector is heavily penalized by this configuration and the data transfer between the consoles is long. The Single-Pak mode therefore proves to be a clever solution to spread the thrill of the game and entice potential buyers (Nintendo is greedy for money, but at least, unlike others, it knows how to do its job well). Instead, by having each of them have a game cartridge in their own console, the competition becomes wider, more varied, fun and therefore lasting, being able to choose from all the tracks for classic races (where the winner is whoever comes first, so to speak) and battles on special arenas. The latter mode is now equally classic and consists in hitting the opponents, in order to gradually deprive them of all three balloons that are available. Of course, whoever survives wins. The bodywork is also OK From a technical point of view, this Mario Kart boasts a superfine realization. The graphics are clean, colorful and highly detailed. There are numerous contour elements on the edge of the track and effects such as smoke, dirt and fiammates are well thought out. The backdrops are drawn on two or (generally) three independent layers and provide wonderful parallax effects as a result of the superb rotation of the tracks. Equally pleasant are also the various drivers aboard their karts (excellently animated) which were first rendered from polygonal models and then converted into (many) sprites; the scaling of the same is very effective in making the pilots recognizable in the distance even if it is a harbinger of graininess (the video resolution is what it is...). The same graphic treatment has also been reserved for other elements, such as the splendid cubes containing the power-ups. As you may have understood, Mario Kart's graphic cosmetics are very good and among the best for GBA, furthermore the game speed is always constant, without uncertainties. As far as the sound is concerned, a few notes can be made: for heaven's sake, all more than enough, but nothing striking. Strangely, the music is anonymous and does not bring to mind any classic Nintendo theme, while the sound effects are not exactly of an excellent quality. Furthermore, the volume is generally low and to fully enjoy the sound accompaniment, as well as to benefit from the effects in the game mechanics, it is preferable to have headphones. The controls are simple and precise as well as now standard for three generations of Mario Kart, the fact remains that it takes several hours to fully master them and therefore to exploit them profitably in multiplayer challenges. Especially in the 150cc class, the effort necessary to control the particularly capricious behavior of the go-karts will be very high. The response to our requests is always immediate, detecting a slight delay only for the back buttons; unfortunately the small size of the console makes prolonged play tiring for those whose hands are too big (or for an adult). Maybe a slightly dated model Now, a comparison with the similar Konami Krazy Racers seems a must. I will be brief. Graphically MK is a few spans above the Konami title, which however boasts exceptional reflections on the water, but has its weak point in less stable images. The sound sector of KKR is instead unbeatable, without appeal. As for playability, the two titles are very similar and both valid, perhaps KKR has a little more, including some welcome novelties for the genre. Obviously both are best expressed in multiplayer. I therefore decree a draw. For the occasion, I also dusted off the previous two episodes of Mario Kart, reaching the conclusions that all three are very enjoyable, with the original SNES version penalized graphically, but always satisfying. ...but still very competitive The goodness of the controls, the charisma of the pilots, the superb graphics and the fast pace of the races make this Mario Kart: Super Circuit a fun, rewarding and incredibly playable game, provided, however, that you have 2/3/4 friends accessories, otherwise the solo experience can quickly get boring. ...but still very competitive Pros: Excellent graphics Proven, valid and solid gameplay Challenging, fun and (virtually) infinitely long-lasting Cons: Anonymous music and weak sound effects Sometimes unsustainable difficulty peaks We are going to begin Finally Mario Kart for Game Boy Advance has also arrived here in the West (after a small name correction), simultaneously in Europe and America, just a month after its publication in the homeland with the inspired name of Mario Kart Advance. Now, the GBA's (already large) portfolio boasts another sure-fire killer application. However, I immediately state one thing, compared to the two previous installations for SNES and N64 this new version does not bring any fundamental innovation; the only novelty is represented by the possibility of exchanging records and ghost cars. How is it then that we talk about killer applications? The reasons are easy to say: the presence of Mario (and other Nintendo mascots), a solid and fun game mechanic, finally an excellent technical realization (as is customary for the house). Nintendo basically works following two strands and/or ideological lines: tradition and innovation. Where new paths are taken and new ideas are developed, the environment is permeated by the awareness and need to guarantee qualitatively valid products; where, on the other hand, where an old, sure path is taken, innovation peeps out by providing new technical solutions and original ideas for productions of undoubted value and richiamo sul pubblico. 1", "date": "2001-09-28", "grade": null}
