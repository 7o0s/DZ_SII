War World is nothing more than the FPS applied to the simulation of mechanized assault vehicles (the Mechs in fact). A hybrid that does not claim to add the characteristics of the two strands, but to derive the least common multiple in order to return a product to the maximum of immediate usability. The simplicity of the game structure is almost disarming, as is the offer in terms of game modes. the player is at the controls of a gigantic bipedal robot with a single goal: to survive the enemies deployed on the map Metallic hybrids In the four modes present, essentially the fulcrum of the action always remains the same, entering a natural arena and facing enemies with mortar, machine gun and laser shots, avoiding taking more shots than the enemy. Following the typical FPS philosophy, the player finds himself at the controls of a gigantic bipedal robot capable of jumping (and possibly making small flights, thanks to the thrusters mounted on his back) and running, equipped with extremely sophisticated weapons, with the only objective to survive the enemies deployed on the map. Little changes in the other game modes, the concept is always this: find the enemy and destroy him by reducing the damage inflicted. The alternative game modes to the arcade one (which allows for gradual level advancement, as regards the number of enemies to face) are individual deathmatch and team deathmatch, as well as a ~custom~ game mode that allows manual setting of the parameters relating to the bonuses, the power of the mechas in the field, the arena in which the battle will take place and the level of difficulty. In Mazinger's workshop At the beginning of each match, the player is called to configure his own mech by first choosing the model (among the 5 available), ending up equipping the firearms on each arm and the devices within range on the back. Also on the back it is possible to apply a series of objects that allow you to obtain protective shields of various types or propulsion systems, which allow you to obtain short high-speed sprints useful in battle escape maneuvers. Each mech has its own characteristics of range, endurance, agility and speed. The choice of the type of mech to be deployed on the field is therefore very important and allows the player to be able to set up a draft of a combat strategy, evaluating the performance of the robots according to the type, the conformation of the arena and the type of enemies. the choice of the type of mech to be deployed on the field is therefore very important and allows the player to be able to set up a draft of a combat strategy In Mazinger's workshop The lightest mechs are agile and fast, in practice they manage to escape from focusing on the enemy's target by making movements at speed; on the other hand, they can only support small-sized weapons and do not bear excessive weight, thus reducing their firepower. The more impressive mechs, on the contrary, mount more powerful types of weapons to the detriment of agility on the field and speed of maneuver; they can count on more efficient armor and a greater number of life points, but on the field they are easy targets for enemy blows. If this isn't FPS... The choice of weapons to mount on your mech is fundamental and heavily influences the attack strategy. Firearms are mainly divided into two categories, lasers and machine guns; in support of them we also have mine launchers and mortars for long-range shots (obviously less precise, but more effective in terms of damage inflicted). The missile launchers (applicable on the shoulders) and the deflector shields close the line. Each weapon has its own reload time and limited number of bullets. On the battlefield, ammunition is distributed in very specific points, constituting one of the fundamental elements for the game strategy: control of the power-up respawn points ends up becoming fundamental for victory. The recharge of the mech's vital energy is instead a more difficult element to pursue, depending exclusively on the death of an opposing mech. This series of features give the title a fast pace that closely resembles that typical of classic FPS in which the game action was made up of a succession of chases, hits, deaths and continuous respawns. In the arcade version, death ends the current level and you are forced to start the level over. In this mode, the difficulty of the game is in some places decidedly non-trivial, forcing the player to face a much higher number of no less aggressive enemies. Last look ThereThe game interface is essential and compact, a radar for signaling enemies in a corner, the energy bar and ammunition indicators make up the whole. The maps available are complex enough to ensure good playstyle differentiation, and have good differentiation. The third-person view combined with the typically first-person shooter style give the game a pleasant appeal. The modeling of the robots, very detailed, combined with a good realization of the maps, gives a decidedly appreciable aspect to the graphics of the game, which is clean and impactful. The row of offers is completed by the possibility of playing in multiplayer through four types of game modes: in addition to the classic single and team deathmatch, there are ~capture the flag~ and ~terrorist attack~, i.e. a mission in which it is necessary to place a explosive device in the opponent's base in order to win the match. the modeling of the robots, very detailed, combined with a good realization of the maps, gives a decidedly appreciable aspect to the graphics of the game, which is clean and impactful Last look The online gaming system is certainly a strong point in terms of the gaming experience, but its implementation has left us a bit perplexed. There is no organized online game system, but the player is given the opportunity to directly create an online game by providing the IP addresses of the players or by connecting to a private LAN: a decidedly retro choice. Comment War World is such a simple and straightforward game that it doesn't need many words to describe it. This can be considered a strength or a huge handicap. From the point of view of technical realization WW can count on captivating and fluid graphics and effective camera management that never puts the player in difficulty. Good realization of the maps as well as that of the models of the robots. A little scarcer is the offer in terms of the number of mechs available and the type of weapons that can be equipped. Even if the manufacturers claim the presence of 50 different weapons, in practice they are the various upgrades of the same classic weapons. For its part, the game can boast a decidedly arcade appeal which makes it attractive to all those who are looking for a good compromise between FPS and any title that makes large robots available on a battlefield. We can assure you that at least the fun (without big claims) is guaranteed. Pros Simple and direct Good level graphics Fast and intuitive Cons Few types of mechs available Few types of weapons, only many upgrades of the same Multiplayer mode not very intuitive System requirements Minimum Requirements: Operating System: Windows ME, 2000, XP Processor: Pentium 3 1.2 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB (512 MB for XP) Video Card: any one with 32Mb of 3D accelerated RAM with Vertex and Pixel Shader support 1.1 (Nvidia Geforce4 or Ati) Disk Space: 450 MB Test Configuration: Processor: AMD Athlon 64 3500+ 2.26 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 6600GT There is a segment of users in the gaming market who are not so interested in the sought-after content in the titles displayed on the shelves. There is the compulsive player who always pursues the game that allows him the best value for money, the type of player who wants everything immediately without compromise. There is the passionate shooter player, and the passionate action game player. There are those who want a pinch of adventure, or the possibility of being able to manage a minimum of the cards placed on the table. In a world as competitive as that of video games you end up having to please everyone and this is why titles like War World are sometimes born. This title does not claim to enter the Olympus of ~unforgettable~, nor to oust the most loved games of all time from the throne. Nonetheless, it winks at a large and varied slice of the public, at all those who have always been chasing bright colors and a good dose of action. After all, what does it take to make a little mess and lead your hands? A futuristic setting, many nice mecha-style robots that remind us of cartoons from the 80s, an exaggerated and almost tacky amount of disproportionately bulky weapons and a handful of special effects, shots, explosions, laser beams and deflector shields to make enjoy your eyes and ears as well.", "date": "2007-05-10", "grade": null}
