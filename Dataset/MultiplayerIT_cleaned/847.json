{"name": "Of Bird and Cage", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/of-bird-and-cage-recensione-avventura-metal-parecchio-stonata.html", "text": "Gitta Barbot is a twenty-five-year-old woman with a truly unhappy life: she works in a restaurant under an abusive and verbally abusive boss, she stays with her drug dealer (she is a drug addict) who torments her to get paid for doses and beats her continuously and lives in a dilapidated camper with a abusive and drunken father. Her dream is to become a singer, but the night she goes to the only club in her city that has a stage for budding musicians, to try to make a change in her life, she will activate a series of events that they will overwhelm her. It is there that she will meet Bres Lupus, a grumpy and, needless to say, violent man, who will kidnap her for reasons that will be explained during the adventure through a series of scenes linked to the beautiful soundtrack, composed by Arnold Nesis with the participation of an ex Guns N' Roses, from Epica, Within Tempation and many other artists of the progressive metal scene. The lyrics of the songs will therefore form most of the dialogues of the game, in a mix between gameplay and music that honestly intrigued us very much. Unfortunately, as we will see in the course of the review, Of Bird and Cage does not work. Someone should have stopped him and turned him around, but they preferred to slam him into a wall. But let's not jump to conclusions right away because there's a lot to say. History From a narrative point of view, Gitta's story is not very original: she is the classic protagonist bent by events who must be able to awaken and make a change in her life, thanks to questionable characters. The plot paraphrases the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale in a modern key, adding that touch of metal brutality that will surely appeal to more than one person. In fact, poor Gitta spends her time getting punched in the face by everyone, then returning them with interest, in a series of over-the-phone calls and moments that don't really make sense. That said, don't expect who knows what mysteries, because the story, while jumping from the present to the past, passing through dream sequences, is very clear. The game has adventure elements, with puzzles to be solved by finding objects to use with other objects, but it also has several action sequences which we will talk about later. If the story is in any way questionable, therefore salvageable, sadly the rest of Of Bird and Cage is downright awful. Nightmare timer Gitta, the protagonist, travels the world with her apron The entire game design of Of Bird and Cage is buggy to the core. The idea of making a game that is a sort of video clip of a metal work on paper is really interesting, but it is the realization that is more problematic and the solutions adopted by Capricia Productions are not the right ones. Let's start from what we can consider the point of no return of the gameplay: the unfortunate choice to make each scene last the time of one of the songs on the disc or, in some cases, of a verse of a song. Now, imagine you're exploring an unfamiliar environment, with the game giving you goals without giving you any hints on how to achieve them. You need to calm down and think about what to do. To observe, to look for interactive objects. In short, to carry out all the actions that are carried out in such cases. Now imagine that you always have a sword of Damocles in the form of a timer that prevents you from doing anything lucidly, because it runs out at great speed. Bres Lupus, kidnapper and very violent man with a tormented past The only emotions you feel are deep anxiety and great resentment, because you always have the feeling that you are not following a story, but that you are experiencing it in the wrong way. It is true that the length of the game allows you to try again several times without wasting much time and, if you wish, you can select the individual scenes to find what you missed, but the point is that in a title theoretically centered on the player's choices he would like the final result to be the fruit of his will, not of mistakes made in too much haste. After all, in some scenes the timer just doesn't make sense. For example, why put it in dream sequences? Pure dreams in time? To aggravate the situation there are also the classic collectibles which in such a scenario are a real paradox. Imagine having to search maps for documents such as photos, texts and special items, but not having time to even read or look at them because of the timer. Practically we lose most of the background of the characters. A madness, from a gaming point of view, which is paid for with detachment and disinterest in what happens on the screen. The (many) other problems The cage and the birdsno As mentioned, Of Bird and Cage's problems aren't limited to the timer. If the adventure part doesn't work due to time constraints, the other game systems are one more disastrous than the other. For example, the characters have a bad tendency to punch each other, giving rise to brawls based on a slippery and very limited combat system, in which it is difficult to understand when you punch or miss. As if that weren't enough, at a certain point in the game, FPS phases appear, with shootings in which the shots seem to disappear in the enemies, worsened by the general slowness of the action and the imprecision of the aiming system. If desired, there are also the bad driving sections, fortunately sparser than the others, therefore heralding less suffering, but still based on an absolutely unrealistic and unsatisfactory model. Ah, we were forgetting the quick time events, which arrive suddenly (it is often difficult even to notice that they have started) and require very fast reactions in order not to fail. How Gitta's addiction is handled is also very questionable: when she goes into withdrawal symptoms, her vision is distorted and the maps are filled with flames. Too bad that all this in terms of the game has no other effect than to give a little annoyance and make what happens on the screen less legible. In some moments Of Bird and Cage feels like torture. Have we already talked about the problems? The game is also populated by nightmarish creatures As if the listed problems were not enough, Capricia's title is also very much lacking from a technical / stylistic point of view. We understand that we are not dealing with a large production, but the human models, including animations, are really ugly, including those of the protagonists, who spend a lot of time on the screen. The scenarios are less disturbing, which perform well especially in the most visionary moments. Sure, don't expect who knows what level of detail, but a minimum of taste for the composition of the environments is perceptible, at least in the most inspired moments. Gitta and Bres One last note: it is not clear why poor Gitta has to live her entire adventure wearing a maid's apron. She practically always wears it: when she sleeps with her boyfriend, when she goes to a club to try to get discovered as a singer, when she runs away from her kidnapper and in all the other scenes of the game in which she appears as an adult. We understand not wanting to create two separate 3D models, probably due to lack of resources, but at this point, wasn't it better to eliminate the apron, given that for the approximately two hours that Of Bird and Cage lasts, Gitta only works for five minutes? Why did you choose to make him always wear it? To remind us how life has been unfair to her? Wasn't it enough that all the men around her literally punch her in the face throughout the game and sometimes even try to shoot her?", "date": "2021-05-23", "grade": "3.0"}
