{"name": "Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/street-fighter-alpha-3-max.html", "text": "Ken, Ryu and the practice of Hadoken Despite being a simple fighting game, the strength of street fighter was undoubtedly that of adding to a noteworthy technical realization, a sort of personal mythology for each fighter present in the game, giving more depth to the characters, their greater characterization and making them perfectly identifiable: each scar leads to a known story, for each bandage or bow there is a motivation, the bonds of friendship and antagonism make the sense of the battle complete and each of its possible conclusions. Having reached the third chapter of the Alpha saga, the characters who live in the world of Street Fighter have now become 40, the game - it must be said right now - is what can be understood as an almost perfect transposition of the psx version: no animations static backdrops, everything is as it was left years ago with the evident plus of the psp display, 16:9 format and much brighter colours. The only factor that fails to keep up with the technological evolution is undoubtedly the pad: whether it is analog or digital, unfortunately it is inaccurate on more than one occasion (especially, who knows why, in diagonal jumps forward). However, constant use of the game leads to getting used to it quite quickly, especially in the creation of the infamous ~half-moons~ which are usually the viaticum towards energy bubbles and the like; more difficult instead remain all the ~right-bottom-diagonal~ combinations (and vice versa) useful -ken masters in hand- to make a shoryuken. Once the first difficulties with the combat system have been overcome, the marvelous graphic creation remains in the eye together with the numerous modes in addition to the many that already made up the original title. However, the combat structure does not change, organized according to the triad of ISMs (V, A and X, combat systems that regulate the use of super-combos and their reloading) and the canonical triptychs of blows for punch and kick, with initially strong punches and strong kicks placed on the lats. The configuration of the pad is obviously allowed and recommended, after all these years of practice the fighting game has turned into a kind of video game art with lots of players who follow their own style of play, who only play with their own pad and who know memorized combinations created by customizing the keys as desired. 1, 10, 100 and 1000... ... there seem to be many modes proposed by this SFA3Max when you turn on the console for the first time: the entire psp screen is full of boxes that indicate different game options, for a total of 15 including classic modes arcade, the world tour, an edit mode, different solutions to play with the tag team (two characters against the cpu or vice versa) and a full-bodied multiplayer component. The arcade mode needs no particular presentation, it is set up in the same way as it was twenty years ago: a character travels the world and meets ten wrestlers before reaching the final epilogue. The training methods are divided into two particular strands: in the first, the training mode, the player will be given full freedom in trying out his moves and in choosing a behavior for the CPU (it can be parried, in the continuous repetition of the weak punch , in a jumping position, etc.), this mode is perfect for testing your move combinations; the second training is instead the one dictated by the free battle which is none other than a match unrelated to the arcade mechanics, it is possible to select one of the modes present in the game (one-on-one combat, two-on-one, ...) and train endlessly testing the characters in the game as quickly as possible. The modes are separate: Dramatic and Reverse Dramatic which put the player in the first case to fight with a partner against a solitary opponent, and in the second in the opposite situation. The World Tour is a mode inherited from the psx chapter and is configured as a real story mode in which the selected character is put in front of different types of tests (beat the opponent before time runs out, beat the opponent with a super-combo, etc.) and whose positive outcome will lead to the victory of an upgrade. Within the story mode it will be possible to significantly customize the statistics of your character, with a series of modifiable data and graphs that will change its characteristics in battle, characteristics ranging from power, to speed, passing from the size of the parry bar and up to the capabilities of the ISM styles. The classic survival, the Final Boss (you fightexclusively against the final bosses of the game) and the Vs 100 Kumite which comes with the obvious phrase ~let's see how many wrestlers you can beat in 100 matches!~. The multiplayer mode, while not presenting any online wireless functionality (unfortunately), proves to be solid and rich as never before with four selectable modes to its credit. The normal VS mode is joined by the Team Battle (three against three combat), the Variable Battle (two against one, with two human players and one from the CPU) and finally the Dramatic Battle (always two against one but with all three players humans). Unfortunately, the bitterness remains for no sharing mode and therefore to play wirelessly you will need to find friends who have the UMD with the game. It is the perfect transposition of what was the psx chapter, it is the king of fighting games and enhances its Pick & Play peculiarities with a considerable number of game modes and the portability of the Sony console. Unfortunately there are still some dark shadows on the inaccurate commands (more due to console limitations than due to bad programming) and a thread of displeasure on the absence of online. However, what remains is an excellent game that lovers of fighting games will surely like, now supported by a series of multiplayer modes capable of significantly increasing the longevity and enjoyment of the experience. Pros: Transposition nothing short of perfect. Lots of single player modes. Lots of multiplayer modes. Cons: Commands imprecise. No Wireless online. To be picky, it's just a port, it's not a new game. There are games that need no introduction, games whose high-sounding name alone opens a temporal window of memory on the very history of video games. There are games that have been able to write the foundations of an entire genre and games that have been able to confirm themselves in multiple forms on multiple consoles. All this and even more is represented by Street Fighter, the infinite Capcom saga born almost twenty years ago (next year will be the twentieth anniversary of its creation), which returns in a portable version proposing the chapter that -probably- received most successful among fans of the series, both in terms of the care placed in the characters and backdrops, and in terms of the creation of one of the most technical fighting games ever developed.", "date": "2006-04-10", "grade": null}
