Utopia also retouches the game graphically The important thing is to have an excellent starting point from which to work to perfect the proposed formula. Nor is it indifferent to the fact that, since these are games usually played by thoughtful and intelligent people, among buyers it is easier to find those who want to reason with the development teams for the good of all, instead of running into ~toddlers~ with easy tears who bang their fists screaming in outrage at every problem. Stellaris is one of the most successful cases of collaboration between development teams and communities. Since we reviewed it, just under a year ago, Paradox's strategy has changed a lot. From update to update (recently arrived at version 1.5) the development team has perfected and improved it in every aspect, effectively responding to the criticisms related to the advanced stages of the game and introducing features and adjustments where required. The corollary of this growth process is Utopia, the first proper expansion. In truth, over the past few months two other official DLCs have been launched, the Leviathans Story Pack and the Plantoids Species Pack, but they were certainly not as substantial as Utopia, which adds a lot of new content and revolutionizes various aspects of Stellaris, starting from political system. Stellaris: Utopia is the expansion that Stellaris needed. Find out in our review Politics and factions Basically Utopia reviews all the aspects related to the internal management of the empire: from the processes of growth and development to those of government. Let's take the latter as an example: before there were selectable types of government which, put together, risked creating strange and contradictory political monsters. Now we start from four general systems: democracy, oligarchy, dictatorship and hereditary Empire, which can be associated with civics (two basic, three if a certain social technology is developed) which allow for the shaping of a government closer to what is our vision. Utopia's system of government is much more complex than that of Stellaris Combining a system with civics creates complex political organisms that influence the entire empire, making our population's reactions to ideologies vary greatly. For example, in a police state militarism will take root well, while a more democratic and environmentalist form of government will struggle to get it accepted. The intertwining of all these elements leads to the birth of factions, the real masterstroke of Utopia, i.e. of social groups united by a common cause or goal. Do you have too many wars? Be careful because in your empire the faction of pacifists could develop, led by one of the representatives of your ruling class, to oppose you. Are you careless about the environment? Expect the emergence of an environmental faction. Are you too prone to multiculturalism? Here are the right-wing racists uniting against you led by some general or ex-reality show host with his flap always down. The factions exert direct and inevitable pressure on the central government, each pursuing its own political agenda. Often the latter can be in contrast with our style of play, leading us to make serious decisions, with decisive consequences for the conduct of a game. There would be many more feasible examples of the complexity of the new political system, but it is not possible to go further. The only important thing is that you understand how complex it is and opens up to many facets that make the internal management of the empire much more interesting and central to the gameplay than it was in the base game. Imagine, for example, what a game can become in which you find yourself having to satisfy two factions in stark contrast to each other. Yes, if you don't want to exacerbate the factions, creating internal conflicts that could prove lethal for the entire empire, sometimes you have to compromise... or make a massacre. The difficult integration Utopia not only reviews the political aspects of Stellaris, but introduces many other innovations, such as a new resource, called Unity, usable with trees called Tradition, which, ultimately, unlock the ~Ascension~ Perk. The latter deserve to be mentioned separately because they are really fun to use, even if problematic. What dWould you, for example, create a Dyson sphere around a sun to suck all its energy and shut it down, thus killing all living species in an entire system? Tired of managing a population of weak fleshy creatures who waste their time copulating? Let's turn everyone into robots and forget about it. Ahem... we're about to do a very bad thing. What if instead we wanted to multiply the fertility of women? But yes, let's do it! The possibilities offered by the Unity resource are really many and, opening up towards the second half of the game, they make the most criticized phases of Stellaris, the middle and final ones, more interesting. The problem with perk ascensions is that you have to complete all Tradition trees to access them. This translates into the need to maintain contradictory behaviors with respect to the policies of one's empire. For example, if we have governed wisely, trying to open up as much as possible to other species through diplomacy, having to become bloodthirsty warmongers to get to unlock a perk isn't exactly the best. If desired, it is possible to reverse the example obtaining the same result: we made war on half the universe, why now do we have to start talking to insects to unlock a perk? In short, the Ascension system is certainly fun to experiment with, but ultimately it ends up contrasting with the possibility of specializing one's galactic civilization and does not seem perfectly integrated with the game. Other novelties also give the same impression, such as some new species with very strong peculiarities, for which the descriptions of the events have not been updated and the relationship values with the other species have not been revised. In short, in the final analysis, Utopia is certainly an excellent expansion, which revises Stellaris in almost every aspect and which enormously improves the basic contents, introducing new and interesting ones. However, there is still work to be done to better integrate them into the gameplay.", "date": "2017-04-12", "grade": "8.8"}
