{"name": "Space Hulk: Tactics", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/space-hulk-tactics-recensione.html", "text": "It's not the first time that Games Workshop's historic board game Space Hulk set in the Warhammer 40,000 sci-fi universe has been translated into a video game. The first attempt dates back to the nineties, but it is in more recent times that, between action and strategic, the scenario has had its consecration. Space Hulk: Tactics, the subject of this review, was born from a purist approach to the board game, while introducing a large number of really interesting and in a certain sense necessary innovations. Let's imagine that for Cyanide, the development team, it was not easy to develop systems that detached its product from the recent Space Hulk: Ascension, with which the comparison appears inevitable anyway. After all, having both titles the same basic objective, that is to reproduce the mechanics of the original Space Hulk, it is obvious that they are very similar in the part played. In short, the war between the Space Marine Terminators and the Genestealers among the galactic wreckage is that, as are the rules, elaborated and retouched in the four editions of the board game. Mechanics and news Space Hulk: Tactics is a turn-based strategy game in which the slow and armored Space Marine Terminators and the fast and treacherous Genestealers do battle inside the narrow metal corridors of immense ruined spaceships. The action is viewed from the top or from the units point of view. Each turn, units have a certain number of action points to spend to position, attack, defend, or interact with doors, command consoles, and other objects. The missions, taken or inspired by those of the board game, usually require you to reach extraction points, save other units, defend areas, or indiscriminately massacre the opposing faction's units. Started the game you have to choose which of the two campaigns to play (one for the Space Marines and one for the Genestealers). Cyanide has done a good job in structuring the various missions, placing them on strategic maps to be explored in search of resources and areas of interest, which reduce the sense of linearity of the previous Space Hulks. If we add to this the role-playing elements, which allow you to upgrade and customize the units that survived in battle, it is impossible not to praise the result, which at least tries to provide a more organic experience than the competition. As already mentioned, another interesting novelty offered by the game is the possibility to play the missions in first person view. Don't worry, because Space Hulk: Tactics never turns into an action and always remains a turn-based strategy. It can simply be played from a different perspective, more oppressive than the tactical one and capable of enhancing the graphics engine, even if it is less functional. Fortunately, you can switch from one to the other whenever you want, without any constraints. In total the two campaigns consist of twenty-six missions, with various skirmishes to be fought between them. To complete both on the normal difficulty level should take about twenty hours (also consider that they are all replayable at a higher difficulty level). Unfortunately we can't be very precise due to major instability problems that forced us to repeat some missions even three times (read the box at the bottom of the article for details). Another new feature in Space Hulk: Tactics that the competition lacks is a mission editor. Easy to use and very functional, it allows you to quickly create your own maps and upload them online, in order to share them with others. This is an excellent feature, which greatly expands the breadth of the title, especially in multiplayer. The latter provides for 1 vs 1 matches with one player playing the role of the Space Marine Terminators and the other of the Genestealers. Nothing new, but enjoyable. Gameplay and graphics In general, the gameplay of Space Hulk: Tactics is what all enthusiasts know well: slow, reflective and full of variables to consider in order not to end up massacred by your opponents, despite the confined environments in which you move. Genestealers are a little more complicated to use than Space Marines due to the division into two turns of their phases and blips, which require a little more practice to master and exploit. The same can be said for cards, which can be spent to give extra action points to a unit or to have bonuses in certain actions: they can surprise you at first, but you get used to it soon. Obviously those who know the board game will have no problem understanding what is happening on the screen. Having said that Space Hulk: Tactics is a very difficult title, unforgiving iin some circumstances, as indeed is the original game. However Cyanide was good at creating a good text tutorial and at modulating the progression of the difficulty of the campaigns, creating simpler first missions and gently increasing the level of challenge with more open and less defensible areas and ever more powerful units. From a technical point of view, Space Hulk: Tactics does its thing, perfectly reproducing the atmospheres and settings of the board game. The nature of the game itself, made up of maps divided into square tiles, does not allow for wonders, but the first person view offers some good moments and the units are made very well indeed (especially the Genestealers make quite an impression). Sure, there are some animations that occasionally jump and don't make it clear what's going on, but fortunately they're only decorative and fail to spoil the gameplay, which remains a must for all Space Hulk fans. Stability issues We confess that trying Space Hulk: Tactics was at times a real agony, due to the constant crashes. Being on the desktop three times an hour was not pleasant and greatly extended the game times, often forcing us to repeat large sections of the missions. We decided to highlight the situation in a box, instead of talking about it directly in the review, because we hope that the instability problems are limited to specific configurations and, above all, are resolved with the first update patches. Be that as it may, our experience leads us to advise you to check the state of the post-launch game before buying it, regardless of its playful qualities.", "date": "2018-10-09", "grade": "7.8"}
