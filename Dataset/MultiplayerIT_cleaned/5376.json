With the passage on Nintendo and then Sony consoles, unfortunately the disappearance of the franchise from the European panorama occurred, and it is no coincidence that the spin-off that we are about to review, Blade Arcus from Shining: Blattle Arena, has made its western debut on Steam instead of in the PlayStation 4 version, released in Japan last November but probably destined never to arrive in Italian stores. Enhanced by the splendid artwork by Tony Taka, who has been working on the series since the episodes released on PSP starting in 2010, the game is a traditional-style fighting game, which takes some of the most famous characters from the RPG version and makes them fight for the conquest of seven magical spheres: whoever manages to take possession of them will be able to see any wish come true. Reminds you of something, doesn't it? The cast is certainly varied: there is the inevitable boy who defies conventions to become stronger, the wise and in love guardian, the cat-woman, the pirate, the bow-wielding Elf, the samurai, the ~sorceress~ fighting with umbrella and so on. Blade Arcus from Shining: Battle Arena is a decently crafted, pleasant but generic fighting game Winning team... On a structural level, Blade Arcus from Shining: Battle Arena does not revolutionize the genre in any way: from the start screen it is possible to access the story mode, practice with characters and moves, consult the electronic manual, face a friend in local multiplayer or a any other user online, creating a room or searching for one. We waited a few days before publishing the review of the game just to experience the competitive multiplayer, which compared to the single player component boasts a not insignificant extra, namely the possibility of changing characters in the middle of the match like in beat'em-ups ~ in teams~. At first the quality of the connection was fluctuating, then a fix was released which fixed the problem and the situation substantially improved, but it is still quite difficult to find opponents in the ~Italian~ times, so this aspect of the experience does not contribute more so to the evaluation of the product. So let's go back to the campaign, which provides us with a roster made up of sixteen characters, each with its own story and a different ~wish~ that can be met at the end of the adventure, once the last opponent has been defeated. Isaac, who represents the final (or almost) boss of the story mode, is also present in the roster of this edition, more advanced than the one for Sony consoles which, as already mentioned, may never arrive in the West. Illustrator Tony Taka has done an excellent job of visual characterization, assisted by different predispositions for each fighter: there are the more balanced ones, who are able to express themselves best in any context, as well as those who need to build some distance with the opponents in order to be effective or, vice versa, they only make it up close. The controls see the presence of three attacks (light, medium, heavy) that act as modifiers for special moves, as per tradition, an assist button and various combinations that are used to launch real ~focus attacks~ and counterattacks . Almost all super are performed with the double crescent, and each character has two, usually one of the offensive type and one of the defensive type, capable of inflicting massive damage to the opponent. My clone's clone is my clone The mechanisms that regulate the single player of Blade Arcus from Shining: Battle Arena are peculiar, as we are asked to select two fighters from the start instead of just one, but it is possible to switch from one character to another only at the end of each round and not in the middle of the action: in this situation the intervention of our partner is possible only according to the constraints of a support attack. By default the match is won by whoever wins three rounds instead of two, but from the options screen it is possible to change these values and substantially speed things up, inserting the single round (thus nullifying the presence of the second warrior) and taking advantage of a truly trivial degree of challenge (at the Normal level) to assist in all the endings within a few minutes. In fact, the balance of the difficulty of the game leaves something to be desired and it is a must to selectonate at least the hard level to make the clashes interesting. However, there is also a personality problem that at first made us go back twenty years, when Street Fighter II clones were wasted in arcades, although few of them (usually SNK titles) boasted a minimum of charisma . The character design developed by Tony Taka is excellent, as already mentioned, and the artworks are a great sight, but in practice the differences between one fighter and another are few and are lost in the alternation of crescents and attacks loaded, without factors such as size, speed of execution and agility influencing the gameplay, although the quotes from the most famous fighting games are wasted (see the zoom during the burst of Pairon's kicks, clear homage to Art of Fighting, or the swords that hark back to Guilty Gear). From a graphic point of view, a discreet job has been done, but the polygonal models do not boast the detail necessary to do justice to the fan service, some animations leave something to be desired and various scenarios are generic. Nothing to say instead about the music, very beautiful and able to accompany the action in an exciting way.", "date": "2016-08-01", "grade": "6.5"}
