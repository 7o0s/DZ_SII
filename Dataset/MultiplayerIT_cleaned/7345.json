The series has also become very popular here starting from the episode developed exclusively for PS3, The Menace of the Cinerea Witch, but the connections with the world of smartphones and portability experiences have always been present: just think that the debut took place on Nintendo DS and that the first mobile chapter dates back to 2010. So what we are witnessing more than a revolution is a sort of return to the origins, albeit in the form of an MMORPG with some rather obscure aspects, see the blockchain and cryptocurrency-based substrate of which many speak with very little enthusiasm.A anyway, the wait is over: here is the review of Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds. History Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds, our character connects to Soul Divers The magical world of Ni no Kuni has been told several times by Level-5, even in formats other than the videogame one. It almost always happens that the protagonists of the story suddenly find themselves projected into this mysterious place, grappling with threats to face and people in difficulty to provide their help, and Cross Worlds from this point of view is no exception. However, the incipit changes, with a narrative device that is perhaps not very original, but effective: a multinational company has discovered how to connect our universe to that of Ni no Kuni, creating a sort of virtual reality game that people are eager to use . But when we connect to Soul Divers, something unexpected happens. The style of Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds In fact, it seems that our alter ego is a sort of hybrid, a creature that actually belongs to two worlds at the same time and that for this very reason has the ability to change things. Finding himself witnessing the fierce clash between a mysterious assailant and Queen Sia of the Nameless Kingdom, the protagonist receives a gift of great power before being teleported away from Cluu. The latter represents a bit the mascot of the adventure: a funny flying and talking pig that will liven up every situation and every dialogue (by the way: the game is fully dubbed in English or Japanese, with Italian subtitles), accompanying us on the mission to rebuild the Nameless Kingdom after asking for help from the surrounding territories , starting with Eostaria. Structure Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds, our Swordsman and his inventory At the beginning of the adventure we will be asked to select one of the five available classes, namely Witch, Destroyer, Engineer, Outlaw and Swordsman. Depending on our choice, we will be able to have different skills: spells from a distance, great physical resistance, the ability to summon mechanisms and weapons, to shoot with a bow or to fight with a sword. We will also be able to modify the appearance of each fighter thanks to an editor and an abundance of cosmetic items to unlock. After the introductory phase and landing in Eostaria, we will be able to take part in a huge amount of different activities, moving around the inside the scenarios together with all the other players on our server, just like in MMOs. As mentioned, our goal will be to rebuild the kingdom that has just been destroyed, and to do this we will have to explore a total of thirteen different locations, which however we will only be able to access by leveling up. Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds, the protagonist explores one of the first scenarios This type of approach inevitably shows the side to a certain degree of repetitiveness, given that often and willingly the tasks necessary to improve the reputation and therefore proceed towards new stages of the story turn out to be simple fetch quests, or even there are missions that we can complete automatically through the disbursement of a few coins. We must also accept the intrusiveness of an interface that always seems intent on distracting us with something new, whether it is an unlocked achievement or an object that has become available, tokens for summoning or rewards linked to access, special timed events or more: a decidedly ~oriental~ approach which, however, could appear too chaotic and fragmented. Gameplay Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds, one of the characters who will give us tasks The mechanics of Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds refer to the tradition of MMORPGs, therefore with real-time combat inwhich, however, we will have to deal with a rather chaotic and badly organized touch control system, currently devoid of options that allow you to set the commands in a different way. In fact, we have a virtual analog stick on the left side of the screen which, however, is too often confused with the movement of the view, deputed instead to the right side or, better, to the small space that remains between the (tiny) buttons reserved for the attack and special moves, jumping and dodging, and the icons that literally fill the display , creating an incredible confusion at first. Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds, a combat sequence highlights the crowding of the interface From this point of view, the comparison with the aforementioned Genshin Impact (review) is merciless: the miHoYo title, thanks to an already quite substantial path of updates, manages to manage its functions much better and offers controls arranged in a more rational way , as well as supporting the use of controllers on iOS: a feature that Cross Worlds unfortunately still lacks. Then there are the automatisms, which are really overwhelming and which it is not easy to deactivate completely. Accepting a quest, for example, activates the character's automatic movement towards the next point of interest by default and you have to touch the icon with the mission objective from time to time to return to manual controls. Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds, a huge cat acts as a mount to move faster For fights, the matter is even more complicated, and in fact we spent a few hours finally figuring out how to act in the options screen to prevent our character from coming into conflict with any enemy that came within range, automatically executing even special moves and healing techniques: absurd that the developers have set up a system that by default works without any intervention from the player, rather than the other way around. Having said that, even once all the nasty automatisms of Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds have been eliminated, we found ourselves faced with a combat system with some interesting extras, see the Pets and their abilities, but in general less refined, precise and satisfying than Genshin Impact, very inconsistent and slippery in the rendering of impacts (which however often happens with MMOs ), as well as spoiled by major problems with the management of the camera when choosing the closest view. Graphics and sound Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds and its Studio Ghibli-style character design It is undoubtedly the artistic sector that represents the strong point of the game, which effectively takes up the splendid character design of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli to deliver us wonderful characters and highly spectacular sequences, very well directed and capable of maintaining attention is always alive, even if perhaps we are witnessing a simple evocation. The graphics of Cross Worlds would not disfigure on consoles, thanks to a skilful use of cel shading but also a rich set of animations, in particular for the protagonists, and environments often able to give wonderful views. Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds. some of the many graphics options Everything can be set to scale resolution and effects depending on the device used, with quite a few options: from textures to shadows, from details to effects, from antialiasing to ambient occlusion, finally passing through the frame rate . On the iPhone 12 Pro it is possible to play with everything at its maximum but limiting yourself to 30 frames per second, given that at 60 fps the phone overheats quickly. As for the sound, the splendid music signed by Joe Hisaishi manages to enhance it very well any sequence and the dubbing appears very well done, both in English and (especially) in Japanese. The presence of subtitles in Italian is also an extra that should not be underestimated, given that other similar productions do not have a localization in our language.", "date": "2022-05-31", "grade": "7.8"}
