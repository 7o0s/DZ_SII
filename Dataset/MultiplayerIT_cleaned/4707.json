Indeed, without RPG~ Bender probably would have said thinking of a game like Battlejack. In truth, the videogame hybridization of the card game with characteristics belonging to other types of pastime is now a widespread and consolidated technique in the mobile sector, which has also led to very original and successful solutions, such as in Card Thief by Tinytouchtales, therefore has long since lost its charge of originality. However, this has also led to a general refinement of the formulas, so we can find really interesting titles based on the structure of ancient card games converted into more or less complex video games. In this case we are dealing with the good old blackjack, to which is added the usual sector of trading cards and a good dose of RPG-style evolution and the inevitable grinding, which associated with the free-to-play structure, as expected , skims dangerously and sometimes falls right into the ~pay to win~ hole, however not in such a systematic and inevitable way as to ruin the whole composition. The basis is the traditional one of the card game to which we refer: it is a question of trying to get as close as possible to the number 21 with a hand, without however exceeding it in order not to completely ruin the round. This is the random element of the game, the one closest to the spirit of the original gambling game, to which, however, is added a complex system for managing the deck of cards corresponding to characters to be deployed in battle, which are fundamental for the match patterns, as well as the luck and calculated risk that are typical of blackjack. In a certain sense, it is as if the latter represented the random (albeit partially computable) element within the role-playing superstructure, a bit like the roll of the dice is in the classic mechanics of the role-playing game. Match against evil The sum of the cards therefore determines the degree of effectiveness of the attack, but this also largely depends on the composition of the party of characters. This is composed of five cards corresponding to as many fighters, each linked to one of the five basic elements present (water, earth, fire, light and darkness), connected to each other by cross-relationships in the style of the classic rock / paper / scissors . Each character is characterized by special abilities that must be used and dosed with timing and wisdom, possibly combining them, so there is much more than reaching ~21~ to assimilate to win battles. The fantasy outline built around the game deserves very few words, with a quick jumble of clichs that basically see us engaged in fighting against evil with cards, pace of the narrative needs of RPG enthusiasts. Instead, what distances itself from anonymity is the graphic characterization of cards, creatures and characters that denote at least a certain care in the aesthetic aspect, and in a game that also focuses on the collecting factor it represents an element of no lesser importance. In any case, the lack of attention to story and background elements leads us to focus exclusively on the action, and it is only this that matters: the clashes sometimes last a few seconds and are quick flare-ups that adapt perfectly to mobile use, as well as stimulating the classic grind without weighing everything down with too long times. Certainly those who love deep and structured gameplay and care in the surrounding elements will hardly be satisfied by Battlejack, which rather rewards speed of execution and continuous progression. Each explorable area is marked by various levels corresponding to clashes, and at regular intervals we find ourselves facing a boss, making the progression of the difficulty rather balanced even if in the more advanced levels it becomes necessary to resort to a bit of grind and therefore also return to go through levels that have already been concluded to raise the statistics of one's cards/characters, also because the management of the various cards is fundamental with the possible assimilation of other cards or the spending of coins, all elements that can be conquered in battle. All this obviously leads to the emergence of the typical dynamics of free-to-play with microtransactions, which can greatly help the player by eliminating the waiting times for the opening of the chests / rewards and for the availability of food necessary to start the quests. The single player path is obviously destined to run out after not too long, but the introduction of a PvP mode in the arena helps keep interest alive, despite some discrepancies in matchmaking.", "date": "2017-08-31", "grade": "7.0"}
