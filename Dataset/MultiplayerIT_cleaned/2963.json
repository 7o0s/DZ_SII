{"name": "Milky Way Prince - A Vampire Star", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/milky-way-prince-a-vampire-star-recensione.html", "text": "For several years now, the video game has become an all-round means of expression. From a simple entertainment interlude it has evolved, also touching important artistic peaks, up to particular cases like this one that we are about to deal with in the Milky Way Prince review. Despite what the title might lead you to believe, this particular (almost) autobiographical visual novel has a difficult but equally important goal: to tell the sense of abandonment and the difficulty generated by a borderline disorder, through a particularly close surreal story to the atmospheres of the Japanese anime. All this alongside a plot that stages the love story between a boy and a shooting star, anything but full of joy and positivity. The fall of the psyche Milky Way Prince was born from the desire of Lorenzo Redaelli, a young game design graduate, to tell a portion of his life. The need to express oneself and convey this communication through the interactive images of the graphic novel is the basis of the whole idea of the title, both short and intense at the same time. It is no coincidence that at each start the game reminds us that it will confront us with particular issues such as abuse and personality disorders and that these elements could affect the sensitivity of the beholder, even and above all of those who may have experienced similar situations. Revealing the plot of Milky Way Prince would mean ruining the journey, which is why we will limit ourselves to telling you that the title will see us experience a fast and intense summer love story between a boy and a shooting star, also personified in another human being. Following the progress of the weeks, of the meetings between the two characters and choosing where we will be able to make decisions, the story will focus on different situations, more or less tragic and decisive. It is difficult to give further information without anticipating important moments of the narration, but what is easy to put on the plate is precisely the power of a few moments, which make the narrative aspect the most successful - as well as the one to which the most was held during the construction phase - setting aside almost everything else. Milky Way Prince is a disturbing story, which could kidnap you damned and at the same time leave you indifferent, basing everything solely and exclusively on your empathy, putting aside entertainment and fun. As bad and disinterested as these words may seem, they represent in all respects the will of the author, who on more than one occasion has expressed his closeness to the cinema and the need to exploit the videogame medium only to tell something, avoiding as much as possible to think about the needs of a gamer. One cannot deny a certain ability to kidnap and to work on the psyche, aware of one's own weaknesses and of the strength that communication imparts to interactivity, albeit so limited and limiting. Milky Way Prince is a decent starting point for understanding how to best use an expressive medium that is certainly more capable than this title suggests. Doubts about interactivity What unfortunately works much less and fails to scratch the rough surface of a good idea is the playful part. On the other hand, whether the author wants it or not, we are here to judge a video game. For the writer this name is still disparaging today, difficult to communicate to the general public and unable to really convey the idea of potential. Equally, however, it would be wrong to really believe that to raise the video game to the level of a good book or a good film it is necessary to forget its interactive part. In a world where there are works such as The Last of Us Part II and Death Stranding, strongly anchored to their playful part, we are sure that on the contrary we must enhance such a particular, unique and future-oriented aspect. In this respect Milky Way Prince fails, putting on the plate a static and all too little interactive visual novel, which tries to insert some interesting moments by exploiting the psychology of the characters, but really failing to scratch the interest. This is precisely its biggest flaw: the inability to convey in a clear and simple way the sensations on which it is based, perhaps making itself too hermetic and with a pinch of ~snobbish~ scent. Youthful sins that can easily be forgiven for a promising talent like Lorenzo Redaelli, but who at the same time highlights the need to blend even better the desire to communicate, film training and the still immature knowledge of the videogame medium. For all those who want to stay stillted to practice, Milky Way Prince can be ascribed to the most classic visual novels. Few locations, few movements, even too few words and many reflections, all managed through the progression of the texts and the choice of answers where required. The interaction with the objects is limited to the protagonist's house and a few other elements, which in most cases repeat the lines of text and the basic uses. In an uninspired videogame panorama like this, however, some important steps are taken in the direction of authorship, forcefully decreeing the will to go beyond the pleasure of the player, called to be dragged into the chapters that make up the short work published by the boys of Santa Reason. The advice we can give you is to give it a chance and also try to overcome the obvious gaps related to an almost non-existent budget and the author's lack of experience, because under the skin of the repetitive and inconclusive game there is an intimate and symbolic journey capable of touching several strings. Technique and sound As mentioned Milky Way Prince is a work that aims to the point, without getting lost in too much embroideries and also capable of fielding an interesting, albeit too minimalist, style. The stretch strongly close to Japanese animation and the psychedelic sounds help to get lost in a particular and surreal world. The figure of the prince and the passage of time on his body and psyche is rendered very well. Unfortunately the very little variety and the repeated presence of some locations over and over again collide with a particular search for details, where the minimalism of the scene allows it.", "date": "2020-08-12", "grade": "6.5"}
