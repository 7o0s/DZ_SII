{"name": "Doom III Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/doom-iii-recensione.html", "text": "Walking among the Zombies The game mechanics are the most linear imaginable in a modern first person shooter. As in the first Dooms, the basic concept is always to arrive at a specific point in the stage, possibly find a magnetic key or a code to open doors, and kill whatever is in front of you. However restrictive this type of setting may be, it is still valid for the enjoyment of a player. The secret of Doom lies precisely in this simplicity, at times disarming, which allows you to immerse yourself completely in the atmosphere of the game. The basic concept is always to arrive at a specific point in the stage, possibly find a magnetic key or a code to open doors, and kill whatever is in front of you Walking among the Zombies Even with regard to the artificial intelligence of the enemies, it is possible to make a similar argument: apart from some species of monsters, the typical behavior of our opponents is to come as close as possible by attacking us regardless of any defense or protection strategy from our attacks. One of the real flaws of Doom, however, is the scarce, minimal interaction of the character with the rest of the environments. Very few objects will be able to be moved, damaged or used, a gap which, if filled, would have added considerable depth to the title. The atmosphere, worthy of a survival horror, is the key component of Doom III. The level design is made to emphasize the sense of claustrophobia, penalize our movements through walls or objects, to guarantee the surprise effect at the appearance of monsters, and obviously the creation of the shadows and lighting are real touches of class , worthy of a title of this caliber, which acquires a completely unique value on consoles. The return of handhelds. Doom III as strange as it may seem to many, has an excellent realization of the background and storyline. Through our PDA, we will be able to analyze an enormous amount of data, private emails, personal diaries, various information on the members of the base, on the projects the scientists were working on, and on everything that happens with the evolution of the game . The negative side, or positive depending on your tastes, lies in the possibility of skipping any report or warning that appears on the Pda, using it only to be able to memorize the codes to access some areas. Therefore, no one will force you to read even a single line of what will be downloaded to your palmtop. At the same time, it will not be difficult to find the correct path within the stages, without consulting the details of our objectives, but in doing so we will lose much of the involvement and depth given by the developers. it will not be difficult to find the correct path within the internships, without consulting the details of our objectives The return of handhelds. As for the available weapons, the ~Doom-style~ is once again reconfirmed. The gadgets that can, and must, be found inside range from the banal service pistol, to be abandoned as soon as possible, to the rocket launcher up to slightly more futuristic weapons such as the revived BFG or the plasma rifle. Even the old trio, machine gun with rotating barrels, shotgun and chainsaw has been dusted off, with some improvements regarding the damage caused to enemies, in particular for the latter, as lethal as ever. Lights and Shadows of Doom From a technical point of view, Doom III is undoubtedly one of the titles that most highlight the potential of the Xbox hardware. Useless comparisons with high-end configurations on PCs, the technical difference, and in particular the amount of RAM memory available on the different platforms, are obvious limits, which cannot be overcome, despite the excellent work of Vicarious Vision. The differences with performing PCs are evident, but the yield on the Microsoft console is still at the top and in some situations it leaves you speechless. The always stable frame rate in single player, support for widescreen mode, and a good level of graphic cleanliness only strengthen the technical sector of the game. A separate note of merit, rightfully belongs to the management of lighting and dynamic shadows, among the best on the market. The differences with performing PCs are evident, but the yield on the Microsoft console is still at the top and in some situations it leaves you speechless Lights and Shadows of Doom The sound department is slightly different from the usual, including a soundtrack limited to the game menus, which disappears during the games, leaving room for sound effects, created ad hoc, thus favoringi total immersion in the level. Discounted Dolby Digital 5.1 support, without a doubt one of the best implementations on Xbox, which in Doom III manages to further enhance the atmosphere and gaming experience. Multiplayer what a passion The version of Doom III released on PC in 2004 was decidedly lacking in terms of modes and multiplayer support. Thanks to the features of Xbox Live, Vicarius Vision have developed this aspect of the game, making the console version the best available on the market. In Doom III we will have the opportunity to play classic multiplayer combat modes, such as deathmatch or last man standing, both via system link and Xbox Live, up to a maximum of four players per match. The maps available are not very many, but in any case they are designed specifically for fights to the death, in more or less narrow environments. In Doom III, forget about sniper ambushes or vehicular battles, here you will find the essence of true deathmatch. In Doom III, forget about sniper ambushes or vehicular battles, here you will find the essence of true deathmatch. Multiplayer what a passion Co-ops The other side of multiplayer in Doom III is the co-op mode. The great absent in Halo2, can now be found in the title Vicarius Vision. The implementation of this mode includes in addition to a slightly higher speed, a greater number of monsters in the levels, weapons and bonuses of different colors, specific to one of the two players, the ability to activate or deactivate friendly fire and, unfortunately, also some negative side, such as some drop in the frame rate, during the most chaotic situations and a duration of the ~campaign~ limited to about half of the levels of the single player game. This difference is also due to the need to redesign many parts of the stages, to allow for the inclusion of a second player, without penalizing movement too much. Multiplayer what a passion Be Limited A separate paragraph belongs by right to the limited edition of the game, which not only turns out to be very beautiful aesthetically, taking up the material and design of the Halo2 limited edition, all in metal, but which also offers some interesting additions, in addition to the dose of making-of footage and developer interviews, namely the Xbox versions of Doom II and Ultimate Doom. Perfectly playable even in split screen, a mode not present in Doom III, for a highly enjoyable return to the past for all fans. Comment Doom III in the Xbox version, thanks to the multiplayer support, is a more complete and enjoyable game than the PC counterpart, strong in an almost survival horror atmosphere, which is unrivaled in the genre. Despite everything, it is always Doom for better or for worse, the maximum expression of classic shooters, graced by an exceptional technical achievement. Old fans will see its greatest value in the linearity of the game, while others may expect additional innovations with respect to the basic mechanics. For all, Doom III is definitely a game to play and consider, no doubt another great release this Spring 2005 and a valuable addition to the Microsoft console line up.

After a long wait, the heir to the game that literally revolutionized an entire genre in the world of video games, Doom III, arrives on Xbox. Released last fall in PC version, the port for the Microsoft console was edited by Vicarious Vision, and results in hand, their work is undoubtedly to be commended. Not only for the excellent graphic compromise, obtained by squeezing the Xbox hardware, but also for some modifications and additions made to Doom itself, which make the Xbox version the most complete and most successful of the two, but let's go in order, starting from single player mode. First of all we can see that there are some minimal differences compared to the PC version, for example during the introductory sequence, some sections have been omitted or adapted, making everything much more immediate. The same can also be seen in the following levels, where some cut scenes have been revised and possibly eliminated. These changes are successful and necessary, thein fact, the game is less fragmented and nothing is lost as regards the atmosphere and tension during the course of the plot.", "date": "2005-04-12", "grade": null}
