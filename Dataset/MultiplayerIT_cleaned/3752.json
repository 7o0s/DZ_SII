{"name": "Xenon Racer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/xenon-racer-recensione.html", "text": "The arcade racing genre is going through an objective phase of tiredness, testified by the increasingly reduced attention that many titles belonging to this vein are capable of arousing in the paying public. Someone will probably have thought of Onrush, just to mention the sadly most recent case, but it is only one of the many alarm bells that over the years have pushed this segment of driving games to assume an increasingly marginal role compared to the past eras. However, the wind of change does not seem to have scratched the ambitions of 3DClouds, a local reality that in the recent past has already shown that it has the matter particularly close to its heart. As perhaps someone will remember, in 2018 the Milanese team made its debut on PC and console with All-Star Fruit Racing, a title that evidently winked at the well-known Mario Kart. Not even twelve months later, the team founded by Francesco Bruschi returns to the fray, this time with the intention of reawakening the frenetic atmosphere of a Ridge Racer from its torpor, combining it with a futuristic approach which, at least apparently, would seem to recall another great classic like WipEout. On these bases the colorful Xenon Racer was born, which makes extreme speed and lightning-fast drifts the cornerstones of its playful proposal. After getting our hands on the final code, we are ready to express our opinion in the review. Breakneck arcade racing Xenon Racer transports us to an imaginary not too distant future, where traditional cars are now close to ending up in the history books to make room for extraordinary flying vehicles. In order to honor a past that now seems to be truly numbered, the main manufacturers of hybrid vehicles have agreed to organize the Xenon Racing Championship, a crazy world tour in which amateur drivers are put at the wheel of very fast racing cars racing. As we highlighted during our open beta test, Xenon Racer draws inspiration from the aforementioned WipEout at first sight, although the more concrete affinities are captured with other classic arcade products such as Ridge Racer or OutRun. This is because, despite the design of the cars obviously projected forward in time, the competitions take place on rubber in circuits where asphalt still reigns supreme. Contrary to the prevailing trend of recent years, which has seen the number of simcade or simulation-type proposals grow, 3DClouds has moved in a diametrically opposite direction, focusing on extreme speed, turbo management and the immense drifts that must be performed to be able to keep your vehicle in trim in the center of the track. A truly uncompromising approach, which translates into the complete absence of the most basic rules of physics in favor of very direct and no-frills interaction, all based on pressing the accelerator to the floor. In the early stages of the game you have to take the measures for a moment, but once you have assimilated the spirit of the game you can manage even the most tortuous paths with great practicality. Accumulating drifts helps to load the boost bar, which will then be activated at will in strategic points of each track. Cornering can be managed by dosing the brake button or using one of the many fronts, but it is the latter solution that proves to be the most practical - as well as the most classic - to avoid making mistakes. And it is precisely when something is wrong that the driving system of Xenon Racer lends itself to some criticism. We are referring specifically to the collision system, far too approximate and rigid in relation to current standards. The impact with the barriers that delimit the tracks is really not very convincing and gives a rather unpleasant sensation, both when you end up ~sticking~ to the edge of the track and when the impact is of a certain size and the vehicle stops its run is completely unnatural. Contrary to appearances, in Xenon Racer the only bonus that can be used in the race is the turbo. In spite of the strongly arcade soul, there are therefore no power ups to collect during the competition, while there is an indicator to monitor the integrity of the vehicle; when this item reaches zero, the car is repositioned on the track and the player is forced to lose a few precious seconds compared to the other competitors on the track. The other problem that emerges is evidently linked to the presence of an artificial intelligence that is not very incisive, mostly giving up during the tussle and not inclined to stick to the player to try to mput him under pressure in some way. Overall, you have access to a total of 18 vehicles, which will be progressively unlocked by winning the victory in the available competitions. Each of them is associated with a series of slightly variable parameters: some models favor top speed at the expense of road holding, while others differ in terms of acceleration or durability and turbo power. During the races it is also possible to unlock a series of objects useful for customizing each car, including liveries, wheels, rims and so on. The changes made partially affect the performance of the individual vehicle, so it is possible to identify the ideal set-up based on your preferences. As for the tracks, Xenon Racer offers a total of seven scenarios scattered around the planet. The large tracks located in Boston, Miami and Lake Louise (Canada) are counterbalanced by places of a certain impact such as Tokyo, Shanghai, Dubai and the Cte d'Azur. In short, there is no shortage of landscape diversity, although some contexts have convinced us more than others in terms of structure and design. Immediacy and adrenaline, even in multiplayer Alongside the traditional quick race and the Xenon Racing tournament, the title allows access to the practical Edge mode, where you have to take part in individual competitions with different parameters from those of the traditional race. For example, you can opt for the timed race, where you need to optimize your lap time in an attempt to win gold. Alternatively, there are two other great arcade-style classics: the checkpoint race, where the passing of time appears directly on the screen, and the elimination mode, which requires you to remain in the lead of the group until all the pursuers are knocked out. It is still possible to opt for the traditional split-screen mode, ideal for triggering exciting challenges between friends on the sofa in your living room. However, Xenon Racer does not lack the online multiplayer mode, organized through the traditional selectable lobbies. During our test we did not encounter major problems in terms of latency, but it must be said that it was not possible for us to fill the room with competitors due to the limited presence of connected players. In these situations, the vacancies are filled by the pilots managed by the CPU, with the result of making the challenge less stimulating than it could be in reality. The presence of online leaderboards is undoubtedly essential in a product of this type, however the lack of alternatives makes the multiplayer component not particularly satisfying in the long run. The graphic sector of Xenon Racer uses the Unreal Engine with discrete results: the speed is well represented and the aesthetic aspect of the vehicles seemed appropriate to the context. It is not for nothing that the cars were conceived by Marcello Raeli, a designer known for having worked with renowned companies such as Subaru, Ferrari and Koenigsegg. On PC, where our test took place, a particularly demanding configuration is not required for the game to express itself to the maximum of its possibilities, although the general level of detail of the settings and cars is inevitably a step backwards compared to the products that dictate the standards today in the racing field. Finally, the soundtrack created in collaboration with Monstercat is effective, well blended with the distinctly over the top context offered by the product, with electronic music-based sounds that do their duty and succeed in keeping the player glued to the game.", "date": "2019-03-27", "grade": "7.0"}
