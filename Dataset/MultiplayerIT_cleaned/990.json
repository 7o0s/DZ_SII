{"name": "Constantine: tra il Bene e il Male", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/constantine-tra-il-bene-e-il-male.html", "text": "Between good and evil there is Constantine! If the DC/Vertigo ~Hellblazer~ comic tells you nothing, you probably don't have anything familiar associated with Constantine's name either. Yet the path of this character up to our monitors was precisely that of a comic book - film - video game. Let's go briefly to see the plot: born with the unwanted gift of recognizing the angelic and demonic creatures that populate the earth in human form, John Constantine attempts suicide to escape such visions. Deprived of divine forgiveness due to the act committed against himself, he is resurrected by God and sent back to Earth, in order to fight demons to earn eternal salvation. He will thus find himself investigating the death of the sister of a policewoman, Angela, who will support him throughout the adventure, investigating a Los Angeles populated by angels and demons (despite the comic being set in London). More than this does not seem appropriate to say, not to spoil the surprise for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the film and intend to do so in the future. Constantine is a video game structured in the classic manner of third-person action games, with some features that refer to cornerstones of the genre such as Shadow Man or Soul Reaver: thanks to the magical abilities that the protagonist possesses, the player finds himself interacting between the ~normal~ world and the infernal one, all this without disdaining some slow motion effects of ~Maxpaynian~ memory. The extras in the game are very interesting: thanks to some tarot cards that we will find during the game, various very attractive contents will be unlocked, including artwork of the elements of the game but above all juicy interviews with the actors of the film. The devil and the Holy water As we have already had the opportunity to say just above, we are faced with a title belonging to the vein opened by the kind Lara Croft, therefore do not expect anything different: like its cousins, Constantine too consists in fact in a part of healthy ~fragging  to the detriment of the enemies, a part linked to the now classic find-the-key-to-go-there and another, more reasoned, concerning the solution of some puzzles. It is no mystery that the component that offers the player the most adrenaline is the one dedicated to the use of weapons, and in this regard it must be said that Constantine offers a choice that can easily satisfy the finest palates: the weapons at our disposal consist in fact, in addition to the bare hands, in a pair of pistols, a flamethrower, a ~crucifixor~ (a sort of nail gun, whose ammunition can be collected again once dropped to the ground), a ~sacred pistol~ (a weapon very similar shotgun and therefore lethal from close range) and the so-called ~purge~, a kind of crossbow that shoots iron-tipped pins which, as in the case of the crucifix, can be picked up. They won't be 100% original, but there is a touch of diversity compared to what is seen in other titles. Alongside the weapons just listed, we find a triptych of secondary artifacts that will prove to be fundamental during the game: the holy water bomb (similar to the classic defragmentation bomb), the ~Amityville screeching cockroach~ (a sonic grenade that stuns demons) and the ~veil of Moses~, a very powerful weapon capable of killing all nearby enemies. If you believe that it ended here, you are wrong: a supernatural being like Constantine cannot fail to have a whole series of spells at his disposal, through which he can defeat the most difficult demons. Most of the spells at our disposal are of the offensive type, which can therefore be used to inflict different types of damage to demons, while for example, the protection spell is available to defend ourselves, which makes Constantine invulnerable for a certain amount of time. The most important spell is certainly the ~portal~, which allows you to pass from the ~normal~ world to the demonic one, from which it will be possible to return only once you have found a bottle of water, an element that acts as a link between the two parallel universes . As already seen in Soul Reaver, some puzzles must be faced by wiggling between the two worlds, taking advantage of the fact that in the transition between one and the other some things of the environment in which we find ourselves change in our favor. The devil and the Holy water Let's now examine the enemies, which offer a fairly good variety: starting from classic demons called ~carrier soldiers~ without any special abilities, going on with the game you also get to know the ~half-bloods~ (apparently normal people, possessed by a demon ) Andof other types of flying demons, armored or equipped with magical arts such as teleportation. From time to time we will find ourselves facing a particular final boss which in any case on balance will never be an insurmountable obstacle. Remaining on the subject of hunting demons, what was initially a torment for Constantine, turns out to be a fundamental tool: the so-called ~true sight~ in fact, allows the player to see clearly in dark places and to distinguish normal people from half-bloods . The only drawback of this tool is the headache that came to us after having abused it a little too much Given the nature of this film tie-in game, it is reasonable to expect a not exactly exciting longevity, as indeed we are been accustomed in the past by other titles of the genre. Although it doesn't last long, we can't even say the opposite: the game is divided into 14 different levels that could also fully satisfy, if it weren't for the decidedly low difficulty even if set to the maximum level. So if on the one hand Bits Studios have managed to avoid the classic frustration-effect of too high difficulty, we are faced with the reverse of the medal, that is, the boredom that can occur after a certain number of levels spent exterminating demons without any worries : certainly better calibrating the 3 different degrees of difficulty available would have helped to make the game more interesting in the long run, also because despite the unlockable extra content, which we talked about previously, you will hardly find yourself playing Constantine again after finishing it the first time . Disco Inferno The technical sector of Constantine is quite contradictory: both for the graphics and for the sound we are in fact in the presence of some guessed choices, but at the same time also of others that are a little more questionable. Starting from the graphics, we can say that the main characters have been recreated with the features of the film's actors through a good level of detail, but the demons, for example, are all very similar to each other on a visual level. As far as the detail of the surrounding environment is concerned, we are not faced with anything exciting: in fact, the console oriented nature of the game is noted, even if the infernal world has been created in a quite suggestive way, practically made from the same elements as the real world, transposed, however, in a state of devastation and anguish, also visible from the chromatic scale of red used for the occasion. A small criticism should also be moved to the camera, which in the most agitated phases proves to be too static, leading the player to have to do somersaults to defend himself from enemy attacks, also due to the fact that we do not have the possibility to perform somersaults or other emergency moves, except for a 180 rotation with weapon in hand, to tell the truth more beautiful to see than useful due to a slow motion effect that ruins its immediacy. The problem concerning the camera also makes controlling the player a little problematic, already not free from some imperfections: if I found difficulty playing with the joypad, I dare not imagine what would have happened with the keyboard, therefore I strongly advise you too to avoid it if you can. Moving on to the sound, we are faced with good audio effects and a quite pleasant soundtrack, which will change depending on the presence of enemies, making the action more frenetic and adrenaline-pumping. The biggest disappointment lies, once again, in the dubbing: it was in fact legitimate to expect the voice of the Italian voice actor to be associated with the features of Keanu Reeves, but in fact, although the voice looks a lot like him, some shortcomings can be highlighted, not to mention everything the rest of the side characters who do not stand out for their acting skills. Comment Constantine is a half successful game. Probably due to the classic haste necessary to release the game in conjunction with the release of the film in theaters, probably to make this product accessible to casual gamers as well, we are faced with a product with some good ideas but which on balance does not will offer over time no particular memory to experienced players. All the others will find Constantine a light, enjoyable and satisfying game, to be used as an anti-stress after a difficult day, going around exterminating demons thanks also to the level of difficulty (including puzzles) definitely within everyone's reach. If your intention, whatever type of gamer you are, is therefore to spend some time relaxing in front of your PC without squeezing your brains too much, then you can take this game, while if you are looking for dsomething challenging is better to look elsewhere. To be played, of course, even for those who enjoyed the film in a remarkable way. Pros: Quite fun and rewarding Fair extra content Cons: Longevity not exciting Low difficulty level even if set to maximum Control system a bit difficult The hard life of the tie-in I have to admit that over the years we have learned to be skeptical of video games based on movies and vice versa. After all, most of you will agree that it's not a paranoia, but a fact: in fact, almost all of you have surely happened to be disappointed by the celluloid version of your favorite game, or by the video game taken from this or that film, even in cases where the ~parent~ was an excellent title in its field. Yet, going more specifically and making a local mind, there are certainly some titles to save, or even to praise: following the trilogy of ~The Lord of the Rings~ we have in fact been able to admire various titles dedicated to it, among which the excellent RTS ~Battle for Middle-earth~ and some action adventure branded Electronic Arts. But how can we forget the old graphic adventures dedicated to Indiana Jones and the wonderful (and more recent) Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic? If we are here it is because we want to know something more about Constantine, you will say at this point, so let's stop talking and let's see what the title in question has in store for us, taken from the film that has recently been released in theaters, which sees Keanu ~The One~ Reeves.", "date": "2005-03-24", "grade": null}
