{"name": "OlliOlli World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/olliolli-world-recensione.html", "text": "We're on the island of Radlandia, a sort of skater's paradise, and we have to participate in the selections to become the new god of skate. It is not just a nominal title, but a mystical role that will make us the intermediaries between men and the gods. More precisely between the skaters and the gods, given the theme of the game. They are the ones who created Radland, dividing it into five different biomes, all with specific challenges to face. Will we be able to win their favor? In reality, as we will discover by playing, they are really over the top figures, even nice (yes, we also talk to the gods during the game). However, the fulcrum of the whole experience is not them, but skateboarding, understood in its clearest and most passionate form, as we will see in the OlliOlli World review. Gameplay The routes are varied and very cheerful A few weeks ago we tried the Roll7 game in a practically definitive version, so much so that we were able to keep the saves with the final one. Already at the time it had made a more than positive impression on us, an impression confirmed by the version that we have been able to test in the last few days and which, as already mentioned, is practically the same game. In strictly playful terms OlliOlli World is very simple to explain: having created our skater, we have to face a series of races in which the main objective is usually to get to the end of the course. Making it is not very difficult, at least in the early stages, which include a rich tutorial, but soon we realize that the crux is not ~going forward~, but the improvement of our skills. Don't worry though, because the control system is very simple, almost arcade: you accelerate with a button, you perform the various stunts with the controller sticks and, if necessary, you press another button to change lanes. That's all? Apparently yes, because the entire game system works on multiple levels ranging from simple running trying not to fall off the skate, to hitting a few good tricks in sequence, to combining spectacular evolutions in thrilling runs with truly satisfying dynamics. which translate into an increasingly marked growth of our score (and our ego). In OlliOlli World finishing a race means nothing. Often on the first attempt you find yourself disconsolate looking at a summary screen with most of the objectives unchecked. Maybe while running we also realized the presence of some secret, but we weren't able to reach it. Even more dramatic is the transition to the global rankings screen, where you immediately realize that it is as if a large piece of the track had been lost along the way, given that someone has scored dozens of times higher than ours. In addition to the races in which you simply have to finish, which are the majority, there are some variants such as points races, in which you have to accumulate the highest possible score within a certain time limit, and challenges, in which we will have to fulfill the requests of some characters. In general, however, you have to start from point A to reach point B, overcoming chasms, grinding on the various supports arranged along the track, jumping from ramps, running on walls and so on. Radlandia in all its pastelness As already mentioned, each biome has its own specific challenges that make the races unique. In any case, what really matters to improve is learning the morphology of the slopes well and dedicating yourself to mastering the advanced tricks, which require coordinated movements of the controller (do you know the supermoves of fighting games in matches?) Only in this way can you accumulate more and more points. To finish OlliOlli World, a few hours are actually enough, but to master it it takes an infinite amount of time, so much so that it doesn't make much sense to talk about longevity in classic terms, given that the playing time can vary enormously from player to player. Tinsel The art direction is fantastic OlliOlli World is not only very refined in its essential mechanics, but it has a world built with a unique and engaging style, the result of a shrewd artistic direction, which recalls the underground cartoon scene and which turns out to be a magnificent background to the entire gaming experience . The story is not needed, the customization of the character ditto (you can change the dress and appearance of your avatar at any time, perhaps making him wear the objects worn by overcoming the challenges, which in any case have only an aesthetic value), as well as the choice of filling the tracks of surreal elements, but everything still contributes to creating an atmosphere that recalls a cheerful and free way of conceiving skate. Sothe pastel scenarios, the bananas in the middle of the path, the giant bees and all the wacky characters that populate the island are welcome, because their sum creates a unique and noisy fresco, full of fun and joviality. In this OlliOlli World is a heartfelt celebration of a broad subculture, which it manages to interpret much better than much more serious titles, going beyond the search for the name of the star on the cover, to offer itself as pure love for skateboarding diluted in code and pixels . It is genuinely cheerful, while offering game mechanics that are much deeper than it seems at first glance, as already pointed out. OlliOlli World also tells a story It's not the skateboarding of professionals, but that of groups of friends who meet in equipped (or not equipped) parks, chat, have a drink, tell each other about the day and then leave to do some stunts, falling and getting up again and then falling and getting up again Still. At the end of the fair, the player is not invited to become a virtuoso of the skateboard, but of the controller, which he must learn to handle with graceful mechanicalness if he wants to become competitive. Yes, because that's the whole point: OlliOlli World is one of those titles that lets you enter its coils discreetly, allows you to leave whenever you want, but offers such wide margins for improvement that if you let yourself be taken by its formula you end up entangled for months, if not years, with each path becoming a challenge in its own right to be repeated as many times as deemed necessary to be satisfied with the final result.", "date": "2022-02-03", "grade": "9.0"}
