Also thanks to the structure of Xbox One, much more similar to the PCs with which it has been working for years and normally, Crytek found itself right there, in the right place and at the right time with Ryse: Son of Rome. Born as a Kinect project for Xbox 360, given the familiarity with the new hardware and the Cryengine ready to go beyond the current gen without particular adaptations, the German software house took what was of that code, pumped it properly under the technical profile and turned it into a naked and raw action, set in a Rome for the use and consumption of the general public, ready for the launch of the new Microsoft console. Among elephants, barbarians and young offspring Nero's Rome is under siege at the hands of the barbarians and a young general commands what remains of the troops to be able to save the Emperor. The two make their way to safety through a series of rooms in the imperial palace and, having reached a secret room, they begin a conversation in the dark in which Marius Titus tells his story, that of a young Roman soldier who, wanting to follow in his father's footsteps senator and army hero, dreams of becoming a general and a point of reference among the centurions. He dreams of stationing himself on the borders of the Empire and of distinguishing himself, only that, before being able to do so, he sees his father and mother killed by a group of unspecified mercenaries. From there, jumping from mission to mission, still linked by a logical thread, or at least trying to be, Marius' life is narrated through a series of played flashbacks that lead to the ending, which we don't comment so as not to spoil it for anyone of you, but who will see him fighting among legions of barbarians, elephants, and the lewd sons of the Emperor. The story, thus told, allows Crytek to vary the settings, ranging from imperial Rome to stormy coasts and sunny and mysterious forests, all with a visual rendering that we will talk about later but that comforts the heart of those who have just spent 500 euros for a new console. Pad in hand the speech is a little different in the sense that Crytek's first experiment with action shows its side to a series of criticisms that make it only a discreet title or little more. Rather than the continuous chain of combos and pirouettes of a God of War, here the term of comparison is the combat system of Rocksteady's Batman, the one in which the protagonist is surrounded by a series of opponents who take turns attacking and you have to respond with moves and countermoves. On this system, however, the team puts its own by attributing a perk to each of the directions of the digital cross that is activated by performing one of the final moves that can be triggered after a certain number of hits, indicated by a skull-shaped icon appearing on the enemy ready to be sliced. At that point a quick time event starts (there are a fair number of them) hyper truculent and with shots that change according to the position of the characters with respect to the seabed, during which you have to press the button of the color corresponding to the one it lights up the opponent. If you make a mistake, the sequence does not stop, but the bonus you get is less. The four perks are used to recharge Marius' energy (there's no other way to do it), the special power that slows down time, to make him gain more experience from the kill or to make him inflict more damage with subsequent hits. This adds a thin layer of strategy, since the player always has to choose which perk to activate (it's good even after the move has already started) depending on what he needs. The basic problem is that Marius has two moves, one with the sword and one with the shield and can combine them, but in a few different keystrokes, so much so that there isn't even a list of them, and that in the end there he finds himself pressing the keys rhythmically more concerned with the perks, except for parries or dodges with somersaults which are used for those enemies who have unstoppable shots. There are no weapons other than the sword, nor equipment to acquire; enemies come in a few different types and respond to three, four attack patterns that are easy to get used to. The system is fluid, even fun, but too shallow to worry about the other exponents of the genre and the choice of these quick time events that cannot be wrong is at least questionable. We are occasionally asked to lead troops into cover cnot the shields and advance in block to overcome the opposing defenses, but rather to use halberds installed on the ground or to call the coverage of the archers with Kinect, but there is very little else for the little less than six hours of campaign at normal level . Ryse: Son of Rome is beautiful to look at, but fails to convince in the long run Xbox One goals Ryse: Son of Rome, among the Xbox One launch titles, is certainly the most generous in terms of objectives and with the six-hour campaign and a bit of multiplayer it is possible to take home more than 600 points. For the rest there are the other difficulty levels and the gladiator to continue. With friends you will make it a few games. Gladiators! Where Ryse adds some substance is multiplayer with the Gladiator mode, imagined in a series of arenas inside the Colosseum that change wave after wave and that you can play with a friend online. Here the concept is different, given that you have to choose one of four deities to ~affiliate~ with, each of which gives as a gift only one of the four perks of the campaign, but a different special blow. So the choice is fundamental depending on how you prefer to play. As for the single player, in which experience points are used to enhance skills for executions or to improve Marius's skills, even here your character levels up and acquires credits with which you can, however, buy items, healing ampoules and weapons to strengthen and be able to properly face the ten different settings among those gradually available (at the first level there are only three, divided into waves with the backdrop that transforms under the eyes of the player). Consider that each of these sequences - reminiscent of the horde of Gears of War, but with swords - lasts about ten minutes, so we're talking about a couple of hours at full capacity, but much more if you consider consider the fact that to be able to do well you need to level up and upgrade your equipment. So playlists have to be played over and over again. The problem brings us back, however, to those few moves and those few enemies to face. In short, it's not that it doesn't work at the base, but long-range endurance and the degree of fun, once the visual wonder is overcome, are both under discussion because it seems that the combat system, after the initial idea, stopped there in the design of its creators. And it's a shame because Ryse: Son of Rome succeeds in what Crytek hardly fails, which is to amaze those who play with graphics that are in fact the best of the Xbox One launch games and among the most beautiful things you can see in around these times. It can be seen that it was born as a Kinect game, since the long sequences in the game are in which the characters move are well acted and very well done. Between light sources, texture quality and on-screen polygons, in addition to the stable frame rate, which only gives way a little in gladiator mode when the enemies are really numerous, sometimes you don't know where to look and certain glimpses are just memorable. There is no shortage of dust particles that rise from the torches and not even the pollen of forests or the fog of ports along hypothetical northern seas in this picture that gives a true meaning to the next gen, even accompanied by a good sound commentary and full dubbing in Italian.", "date": "2013-11-21", "grade": "7.0"}
