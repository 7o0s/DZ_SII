{"name": "Once Upon a Jester", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/once-upon-a-jester-recensione.html", "text": "Bonte Avond is a very particular development studio, made up of four musicians who by their own admission plan little and put a lot of music into their games, usually made straight away, without spending too much time meditating on the latest market trends. Their headquarters is the room of one of the four, where they develop the software, record the music and voice the characters. The goal of their games is simply to bring a little joy and a lot of happiness, without the pretense of revolutionizing anything. After all, how can you not smile in front of a game called ~The Dragon of Terzaville Who Got His Neck Broken in a Weird Accident~, starring a dragon with a bent neck, or ~Everybody Wham Wham~, in which you have to build snowmen? It is therefore with an equally light and amused spirit that we wrote the review of Once Upon a Jester, their latest effort. History In Once Upon a Jester the player drives Jester Jester and Sok are two improvised theater actors who use their business to carry out petty thefts and get by. When Princess Cristina announces a competition that has the prize of being able to organize a show at the palace, they don't think twice about attempting the feat, so as to try to steal the king's diamond, a gem of unspeakable value that would make them rich screwed up. To succeed, however, they will first have to obtain fifteen bouquets of flowers in three cities of the kingdom, organizing shows similar to the changing tastes of the local public. All this translates into a 2D narrative adventure with very simple and direct cartoon graphics, without major puzzles to solve, but full of music and jokes, some successful, some not, but all inserted with an amused spirit and written with a certain dose of improvisation, which in a game that focuses on the theatrical experience does not clash at all. Once Upon a Jester is divided into two quite clear-cut phases: in the first one walks around the city on duty in the role of Jester (not surprisingly dressed as a jester), one speaks with the other characters and eavesdrops on the dialogues of passers-by to understand which what kind of show they would like to see (action, drama, music, romance or horror) and which one would bore them to death. Then you have to create the theatrical poster for the evening, choosing the show, setting the background and putting some stickers and, finally, you have to start the show, kicking off the second phase. The shows Shows are an essential part of Once Upon a Jester The shows, four in total, are canvases around which Jester and Sok improvise on a stage set up in the center of the city, following the themes that are understood to be the audience's favorites. Basically during each performance you have to select the genres of the piece from time to time, giving life to different events, all managed through mini-games in which you have to press the keys at the right time or following a certain rhythm. For example, you can watch a fight between Jester and Sok with wooden swords, or you have to follow the lights of the stage spotlights to sing a song. The variations of the shows are many and are among the most engaging elements of the game, because they stimulate you to discover as much as possible, prompting you to replay the entire adventure to see them all. At the end of each show, based on the skill demonstrated with the mini-games and with the choice of themes, one is rewarded with one to five bouquets. The number of shows for each city therefore varies according to the player's ability to meet the tastes of the public and not to fail the tests that are proposed to him. On our own, playing on the normal difficulty level, we managed to get to the end of the adventure in about three hours, performing four shows per city. cheer! We'll even get to start a band to fight a witch From a strictly narrative point of view, Once Upon a Jester thrives on situations, often absurd and surreal. The standard structure of the adventure is in fact punctuated by small events, which keep the interest high in the exploratory phases, in even the smallest cities, always offering something new to see and interesting ideas, including rides on a Ferris wheel, fishermen they get devoured by sea monsters, squabbling old friends to reckon with, witches who turn people into sweets, and mythological monsters who are badass bass players (in every sense). In all of this we also find ourselves founding a band in a dark forest and being hosted by a local radio, as well as witnessing the love story between a tiny mayor with an unpronounceable name, a warrior and another mayor who pretends to be jealous of her but who loved the other. Sok is Je's inseparable friendster Precisely the variety of situations, the absurdity of certain narrative solutions and the way in which the schemes of the story itself are broken, which practically never proceeds as one expects it to do, are the strengths of an adventure that thrives on a melancholy joy that exudes fun from every pore, understood as that of whoever made it, so much so that it is also able to transmit it to the other side of the screen. In certain moments it is a bit uncertain and stuttering, true, but you get to the end driven by the desire to find out what will happen to its wacky protagonists and if they will be able to take that diamond they crave so much, empathizing for them and hoping they will be able to be happy.", "date": "2022-11-13", "grade": "8.0"}
