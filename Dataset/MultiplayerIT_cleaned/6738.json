Eerie noises come from the darkness, and it's not just the creaking noises of an old space station. Something is lurking and waiting to launch itself against those who unfortunately are not helpless victims. They are Space Marine Terminators, fearless explorers who infiltrate the depths of the Space Hulks to carry out recovery and cleaning missions. Dangerous activities, these, given that the Space Hulks, a definition that in the Warhammer 40,000 universe applies to all kinds of space wrecks, are infested by fearsome creatures. We're talking about the Genestealers, the Aliens from the Warhammer 40K universe who, like Giger's xenomorphs, are fast and are lethal if approached in close combat. And this is the central element of a turn-based gameplay designed for a board game that is definitely suitable for videogame transposition. It is surprising that Full Control's Space Hulk was, in 17 years, the only title to make use of this license but if nothing else, the wait has given us back a good product that adapts well to the mission structure and asymmetrical multiplayer fought between Genestealer and Terminator. The latter, among other things, also offers the uncommon possibility of playing in asynchronous mode, sending one's move to then close the game, wait for the opponent's and resume the game when possible. But Space Hulk is also a game that is content to transpose the board game in a digital key and does not show off a great variety of mechanics when compared to modern turn-based strategy games. Precisely for this reason, the developers have released the Ascension version which, thanks to a year of feedback, is in all respects a Space Hulk 2.0 update with new missions, weapons, skills, powers, customization options, character evolution and aesthetic improvements . The only thing missing, beyond the Italian adaptation, is the multiplayer, probably set aside to have no limits in the work of expanding the gameplay. Given the potential it is a real shame even if the contents included in this Ascension Edition promise to compensate for the lack of the online challenge with countless hours of play. Space Hulk is back in a revised and corrected version with many more things but also something less Chess game with death At the base, the gameplay is the same as the original version and already includes subtleties such as moving bursts, the possibility of retreating, well-studied guard mode, various attack modes, intuitive interface and a rather high difficulty. All of this in the Ascension version has remained unchanged but have been added customization options for the Terminators, psychic powers, weapons and a soldier evolution system complete with a skill tree. Advancement allows you to differentiate your soldiers by equipping them with specific weapons such as the power sword, essential in the extremely dangerous melee, and to enhance resistance, effectiveness and ability to perceive enemies. And the differentiation extends to the Genestealers that are distinguished from each other thanks to their feeding tentacles, acid and hooks. But there is no need to make aseptic lists. The best approach to get an idea of the offer is to frame the new Space Hulk as a whole which aims to maintain the balance of the original by exponentially expanding its complexity. The first phase involves the selection of the team or teams which must then be deployed on the field in some pre-set spaces. Some missions require specific Terminators such as the one armed with a flamethrower who can clean out the vents from which the Genestealers emerge, the close combat specialist who has some chance of opposing a close combat attack or the Librarian who has powers psychics. But it is not enough to take into account the roles. Each soldier has characteristics and equipment that determine his action capabilities. A good marksman with less than excellent reflexes must be able to engage the enemy at range. Instead, a tough marine equipped with a powersword is the best candidate for the vanguard. But it's not easy to make everything fit together while traversing the narrow corridors of a Space Hulk. Waiting too long means increasing the risk that our marines will be hit and it is preferable to move your contingent paying attention to cover ducts, doors and corridors. But taking into account all the possibilities is not easy, especially when you find yourself maneuvering ten large Space Marines in corridors a square wide while the Genestealers continue to arrive indefinitely, while the objective must bere reached in the shortest possible time and while the Terminator we need at that moment is at the back of the queue, blocked by his companions. In these situations, a pinch of Tetris and Space Hulk is added to the already complex formula: Ascension turns into a sort of chess game reinterpreted in a claustrophobic version. A game that transforms the maps, which reached a total of over one hundred divided into three campaigns fought by three different chapters of the Space Marines, into puzzles of varying difficulty, all to be tackled by carefully studying the timing and order of progress of our Space Marines. But even if you are armed with feline caution in some situations it is impossible to avoid direct contact with the Genestealers. The combat system is based on invisible dice rolls and in case of failure the attackers close in no time, often eliminating with a single shot the marine they are facing. The result is a rather high global difficulty which often forces us to try more complex missions several times in search of the right combination of ideas and shots. Adding this dynamic to the huge number of maps you get dozens and dozens of hours of gameplay which, especially if the player is not a huge lover of strategy, can include a few moments of frustration. The levels, however, do not have an excessive duration and there is no shortage of special missions to give further variety to a title that already takes a clear leap forward compared to its predecessor, expanding in RPG mechanics and acquiring a decidedly more refined graphic sector. We are certainly not at jaw-dropping levels but between new effects, more detailed textures, improved animations, advanced lighting effects and interface improvements, the change is clear and gives an edge to the action, giving us flashes of light and jets of fire very pleasant to see, and also to the atmosphere. And it is the latter that supports the inevitable slowness of turn-based strategic gameplay. Tension is a common thread between one action and another. Something that transforms waiting and the defensive phase into a lively emotion and not into a sterile wait. And to benefit from the technical improvements is also the main feature of the Space Hulk released last year, that first-person camera that allows you to admire the action from another perspective. Defects such as blood are exalted, the rendering of which is not at all convincing but the camera occupies a small box in the upper right corner and effectively recalls various science fiction films. Enough to combine with the nagging background noise that runs through the Space Hulks and give an edge to a technical sector that rests on modest foundations.", "date": "2014-11-21", "grade": "8.0"}
