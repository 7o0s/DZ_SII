{"name": "Onimusha Puzzle: Dark Castle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/onimusha-puzzle-dark-castle.html", "text": "The background story has zero influence on the actual game despite Capcom taking care to insert interlude sequences consisting of a screenshot and two-three pages of text linking each section of your path (each section contains roughly a dozen levels ), what matters is that it is a puzzle game of the most diabolical kind. The ninja must leave each room by first collecting the key (the number of which will gradually increase in the crescendo of the paintings) and reaching the door immediately after, the only catch is the presence of spikes, each step you take they advance by one position, if they get to the wall they reappear on the opposite side, if you get run over you die, that's all, that's all you need to know for the 50 levels of the game. However, there are some secret passages that allow you to fork the path towards otherwise inaccessible paintings, and if you are really that curious you can always retrace your steps with the room choice option to try to take them. You know those titles that you dismiss at first glance as too simple for your superior intelligence and then look up only to find out how you spent the last two hours stuck in the same picture? Onimusha rightly belongs to the group of the latter, with a disarming simplicity, however, it manages to make you angry in the most mangy points.
