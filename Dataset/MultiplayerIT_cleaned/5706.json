{"name": "Bombe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/163516-ultimate-briefcase-bombe-soldi-e-valigie.html", "text": "Nitrome is an independent London-based development studio that has already made a name for itself both on the mobile and browser game scene, as its games perfectly embody what should be the spirit of mobile titles: simple products but with fun mechanics and capable of exciting and addictive. With Ultimate Briefcase, however, the English guys take a step forward and decide to act as editors of another studio, Quite Fresh: will they have shown the same foresight they have as a purely development team? Ultimate Briefcase is Nitrome's debut as a publisher: is Quite Fresh's game up to it? Still twenty-four hours Ultimate Briefcase is the sequel to Super Briefcase, a browser game that was very successful at the time of its release, seven years ago, and is based on the same premise: the protagonist's city is the victim of an alien attack that manifests itself in the form of nice carpet bombing. It is right and proper to escape from bombs, and this is where you come into play, who simply by directing the little man (who has among his characteristics an important beard and a briefcase, the briefcase of the title) to the right and left you must make sure that he does not never come into contact with a device, in this also helping you, when the deadly rain becomes more dense, with the shadows projected on the ground. A somewhat insane premise, which however is then expanded during the game by unlocking some nice videos which don't make everything clearer, but they know how to give a touch of humor that is very appreciable especially if you don't mind the nonsense. More than a classic endless runner, Ultimate Briefcase could be defined as an ~endless high-score challenge~: the game doesn't end until you get hit, and the game takes into account, for the online leaderboards, the time in which you managed to survive . There are various types of bombs and devices, from the simplest ones to the largest ones, then the faster ones, the cluster ones, the incendiary bombs which, thanks to napalm, make it temporarily impossible to move along the whole level... The peculiarity is however, that practically right from the start the title shoots you (it is appropriate to say it) in the face with all its arsenal of death and in this sense it presents a difficulty curve that starts immediately very high. So how do you get those very high times that you can already see in the charts? Some of the alien bombs release energy balls and coins: the former are used to fill a bar, which once completed allows you to use the suitcase as a shield for about ten seconds or a little less. The latter instead give access to power-ups (major defenses, extra lives and so on), as well as two additional stages and other characters with different characteristics. Advertising bombing The peculiarity of the power-ups is that they are permanent, and thus a strange mechanism is created by which in practice the difficulty of Ultimate Briefcase, which as we said is very high, playing repeatedly and in all respects grinding as in any RPG, goes down instead of up. Choice made, most likely, to push you to buy in-game currency using real currency: the in-app purchase formula is also fairly honest, with acceptable prices, and furthermore by paying 4 Euros you can completely get rid of the very bearable advertising. But we are not entirely convinced of its success. In fact, by accessing the various power-ups, the game becomes not only easier and more manageable, but also more fun and varied; then how much you actually like it is probably a matter of taste, how much you are familiar with the various endless games, even considering the fact that we are seeing so many of them and the novelty effect has long since disappeared. In any case, it's a shame, because, while not making a miracle cry, Ultimate Briefcase can be a lot of fun and addictive if you can overcome the initial impact, and at least it's a title whose mechanics are perfect for the devices that is dedicated. The care taken by Quite Fresh in the realization is also evident from the graphic sector, a delightful pixel art that recalls the 16-bit era full of small bizarre details, such as the animations and expressions of the characters, and moving elements, such as the background of the city in flames, capable of making an atmosphere both light-hearted and humorous, and full of urgency and a sense of imminent catastrophe. The same cannot be said for the sound, as there is only one piece of music which, however ~catchy~, is really indigestible in longer game sessions.", "date": "2016-02-15", "grade": "7.0"}
