Once the game is launched, in fact, we find a really ugly main menu welcoming us, practically of an amateur level; but in truth it is the introductory phase in its entirety that makes you want to turn everything off and proceed with a sudden uninstallation, thanks to a confusing gameplay and mediocre graphics, made barely legible by applying a ~cathode ray tube~ style filter, with our avatar viewed exactly from above moving within a hostile environment, manned by robotic guards. As soon as game over occurs, fortunately, the nightmare ends and we are introduced to the real protagonists of Subaeria, a group of four characters that we will be able to control during a single player campaign that focuses on two factors to involve users: a procedural system for generating stages, capable of making the experience always different, and the possibility of accessing multiple endings based on the choices we make during the adventure. Subaeria is an action puzzle with a fascinating and original approach, but still needs a lot of work I am Styx Putting aside the first, bad impact with the game, fortunately things improve rapidly, starting right from the visual sector. The style of the artwork is in fact very pleasant, with very well-characterized characters, and the in-game graphics themselves are substantially improved compared to the introductory phase, devoid of that horrible filter and characterized by a slightly three-quarter view, which therefore shows something more than the head and shoulders of what, for the moment, is the only protagonist of the adventure, Styx. The girl suddenly finds herself having to escape through the corridors and rooms of the huge underwater structure in which the game is set, with the aim of reaching an area free from the control of the machines. His mission, however, will be far from simple: signaled to the androids who preside over the various areas and without equipment, beyond the small flying drone that accompanies it, he will have to make sure that his robotic enemies are eliminated at each other or end up on the laser traps that the locations are full of. With one caveat: act on the basis of the colors that distinguish the robots and the elements of the scenario, because the same shades cannot harm each other. In practice, this translates into an action game with a top view (slightly three-quarters, as mentioned) in the arena, with a reference to the twin analog shooters as regards the control of Styx and his drone, respectively assigned to the stick left and right analog of the controller. Indirect action The concept on which Subaeria's gameplay is based is that of indirect action, of extremely dynamic puzzles (considering the speed of some robotic guards) that must be solved in a few moments in order not to suffer excessive damage and end the game prematurely, which however current state cannot be saved. The game of ~starting over~ is exploited by the developers to better understand some mechanisms, above all the aforementioned procedural structure of the levels, which present different elements but in fact end up resembling a little too much, given the shortage of game models departure. And so we find ourselves repeatedly facing the ~vacuum cleaner~ androids equipped with rotating blades that strike a central structure of crates and barrels, and which can only be defeated by inserting an object inside a device; or those who go around a ~fence~ closed by energy threads, against which enemies must end; or even the room with the elevated area and the barriers, in which to place turrets and other hostile units. A certain freedom is provided on the narrative front, in the sense that it is possible to access the dialogue with many NPCs (the texts, however, are only in English) or simply not to do so and limit oneself to the information necessary to be able to continue from one sector to another , from the point of view of a path that is undoubtedly challenging but which can be completed within two hours. Early access It is clear that Subaeria's experience is still largely incomplete, and not only due to the presence of a single character compared to the four who will make up the definitive roster. Apart from the initial menu, in fact, there are several aspects of the title of Illogika that need powerful filings: the control of the avatar, often ~slippery~ and imprecise, but also key elements of the gameplay such as the use of the drone, to which we can assign two skills whose functioning, however, is not indicated. There are powers that allow you to restore the character's vital energy, block hostile drones or make them ~go crazy~, take advantage of a camouflage system to move undisturbed or change the color of the devices so that they can hit each other, but you really have to experiment to figure out what you're dealing with, which is anything but intuitive. So much so that we often ~forget~ completely about the drone and proceed without powers, using only the aiming system of the robotic guards to cause them to collide with each other or end up on the lasers. In this sense, the character's ability to jump proves to be more useful than the lateral swerve, which however in the intentions of the developers should be the main maneuver to avoid attacks. In short, there are various things that don't add up and that concern the fundamental aspects of the experience, not the surrounding elements. It must be added that there are inexplicable, massive frame rate drops in some situations, and that the graphics options only underline how the product is currently very little optimized, considering the low complexity of the graphics but its inability to run smoothly on medium-low range configurations. In short, Subaeria is certainly an original title with obvious potential, but right now we don't feel like recommending its purchase: we are waiting to see how (and if) the developers will improve it in the coming months.", "date": "2015-10-07", "grade": null}
