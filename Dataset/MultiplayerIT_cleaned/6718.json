Just to get an idea of the level of fidelity with the original, just think that to learn the rudiments you can use the paper game manual which, apart from the interface, describes its mechanics perfectly. The advantages of the virtual edition compared to the physical one are the lower price (about ten euros in all virtual shops around the globe) and the possibility of playing online and offline, so you don't necessarily have to recruit friends and relatives every time you wants to play a game. Now all that remains is to understand what we are talking about. The Witcher Adventure Game puts you in the shoes of one of four iconic characters from the series: of course Geralt of Rivia, the intelligent and beautiful Triss Merigold, Dandelion and Yarpen, each with a special ability and a personal set of dice, linked to the development cards as well as the generic ones. The four must embark on a journey through the world of The Witcher by completing quests to accumulate victory points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins. The quests are of three types and are obtained by pulling cards (the first is rolled at the start of the game). Each card offers a main quest, which generally requires you to travel to a specific location after accumulating the necessary resources; two side quests, which always require the collection of resources and conclude when the right ones have been accumulated; and a support quest, similar to the others, but can only be done in a location where another player is. Basically the game is this: you go around and collect useful resources to solve the quests, trying to be faster and luckier than your opponents. Nothing too complicated, therefore, even if the lack of an interactive tutorial and an Italian translation of the texts can cause confusion in first-hour players. The introductory movie and the rule book help a little, but as already specified they are not as useful as the paper game manual, which is saying something. Above all, the book of rules is very badly organized because it allows for clarification of the individual concepts, without however giving an organic vision. Game dynamics In The Witcher Adventure Game players take turns. Each turn it is possible to carry out two actions between investigating to obtain clues (to be spent to solve quests or to be exchanged for other resources), developing cards that give various bonuses, resting, traveling and so on. At the end of each round you have to face an opponent by rolling the dice. To win, you must be lucky enough to get the faces corresponding to the resolution slots, linked to attack and defense, otherwise you will suffer damage (light or aggravated) which compromises the action slots. The fights do not only take place at the end of the rounds, but also following the launch of cards related to other actions (for example, in some cases it is required to fight to solve a quest). In general, their development is always the same and requires you to rely on the dice. In addition to wounds, the characters can also suffer the negative effects of the doom tokens (amicably called the tokens of the fi... oh well), which give disadvantages to the performance of actions. If you wish, you can recover from wounds and misfortune by spending an action to rest. It soon becomes clear that in The Witcher Adventure Game running into adverse fate is really easy, perhaps a little too much, since it doesn't take many turns before being filled with tokens with the skull drawn on them, inseparable friends of every game. In fact, one of the problems of the game is precisely the preponderance of the luck factor over everything else, which, especially when playing against other human beings, gives the inevitable sensation of being more victims of the game than its creators. In short, we understand the need to entrust the resolution of some events to chance, because we are aware of being faced with a commercial board game, but amidst failed fights, even against the weakest enemies (there are three levels: bronze, silver and gold), and bad luck tokens, which are also awarded simply by making a fast trip (you move two places at a time instead of one), we often found ourselves having to manage the intermediate stages of the games more concerned with these factors that of the resolution of the quests. It is true that it is possible to obtain cards that give bonuses, once loaded, making fights easier (usually they affect the hero's personal dice roll), but in general we would have preferred to see more weight given to the player's choices .Will it be worth accompanying Geralt and his companions in The Witcher Adventure Game, fighting with dice? Interaction between players However, bad luck aside, the most relevant problem of The Witcher Adventure Game is the lack of interaction between players. In reality, the only possible interactions concern the support quests, while for the rest of the time you play practically alone making your own adventure. It would have been interesting if the developers had created victory conditions linked to collaboration or competition between the characters, perhaps allowing the exchange of resources, the depletion of the same on too frequented territories or creating more complex quests that can only be carried out together. with the possibility of betrayal and the like. In short, as The Witcher Adventure Game is, it only requires you to collect the right resources as quickly as possible, without the presence of others affecting your game. Of course, in terms of interaction, in addition to the aforementioned support quests, there are cards that affect all players if drawn. Unfortunately, these are automatic effects that don't give you a choice (just to go back to the luck factor mentioned above), i.e. you can't decide if and when to use them, linking them to some strategy, but you just suffer them. This is a decidedly serious lack, which makes multiplayer almost superfluous, since there is no stimulus for interaction with other human beings.", "date": "2014-12-01", "grade": "6.0"}
