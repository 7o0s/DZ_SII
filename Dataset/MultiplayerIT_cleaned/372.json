{"name": "Astropop - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/astropop-recensione.html", "text": "As a last resort, our shuttle can count on a deadly smart bomb, which can be activated with the Y key, whose mode varies for each of the four available characters (you go from nuclear warheads to powerful destructive rays), but which guarantees a safe salvation. These weapons are also timed reloadable, so they can also be used more than once in a round, but the reload time is long and doesn't reset at the end of a stage. Therefore, they should only be used in highly desperate situations. As you proceed, new types of bricks take over, such as stone and steel specimens, which must be absolutely destroyed, as they cannot be hooked up by our shuttle. The most worrying is the diseased brick, highlighted by a sinister skull, which infects those around it like a disease. It is essential to act quickly and destroy them before they spread dangerously. As the levels progress, the types of colors also increase, making combinations more difficult. Every certain level we will face a bonus stage, a real puzzle, in which we will have to clean up the screen in a certain amount of time. Without a doubt one of the funniest titles released on XBLA so far Another juicy feature of the game is the survival mode, in which it is necessary to resist as long as possible to a gradual speed advance of the nefarious bricks. For better results it is advisable to upgrade the special weapons through the classic mode, and unlock the two hidden characters. The times and scores of the two modes are constantly updated in the online leaderboard, thus always representing an exciting incentive to improve them. Too bad for the absence of multiplayer modes, both offline and online, which relegates the game to a personal challenge in search of the best record. Comment Astropop is a title of a simple nature, but which implies reasoned, challenging and aesthetically satisfying gameplay. Never as in this case the phrase ~another game and I'll stop~ makes sense, causing real addiction to the player, and a lot of room to develop personal survival strategies. The technical sector is fully functional to the game, its colorful and comic style looks good even on HD displays. We were only slightly disappointed by the omission of any multiplayer modes, which would have greatly increased the longevity of the product. However, looking for the record to proudly display on Live is very satisfying, as well as a valid excuse to occasionally return to this crazy universe of bricks and ships. Without a doubt one of the funniest titles released so far on XBLA, a highly recommended purchase. Pros: Pleasant comic style Difficult to let go once you get the hang of it Online leaderboards Cons: Lack of multiplayer mode Strange animal the puzzle game, alive and well since the mists of time, remains a strenuous bulwark of instant videogame enjoyment, that play and go that can occupy from a few minutes to whole days. A lot of water has passed under the bridges from Tetris, man has conquered space and travels on hyper-technological shuttles armed to the teeth... But he hasn't lost the desire to torture bricks in spaces to be left rigorously clear. Popular Java title for PCs and mobiles, Popcap Games' opus has been faithfully ported to XBLA, retaining its enormous fun. The aim is to destroy a certain number of bricks for each stage, preventing their slow progress towards the lower end of the screen. The only way is to form groups of four or more adjacent bricks of the same color, taking advantage of the peculiar ability of our shuttle. Although it can only move on the horizontal axis, just like the old shoot and run, it is able to attract a brick to itself, or up to six of the same color, and then throw them back on the impending wall. The required skill consists in ordering the bricks in order to cause chain reactions, or combos, also aided by a series of special items hidden among them. Among these we find highly explosive bricks, others capable of pulverizing an entire row, and most important of all, a special beam capable of ~charging~ a certain color of the group, with the possibility of creating even more devastating destructive chains. But the very short charge time requires considerable timing.", "date": "2006-09-14", "grade": null}
