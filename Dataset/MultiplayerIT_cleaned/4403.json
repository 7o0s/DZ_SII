We tried the game for the umpteenth time, after the mobile, PC and console versions, surprising ourselves at the fact that the story written by Joe Dever, with his inevitable crossroads, still had some secrets to reveal. It was enough to insist in certain situations to further investigate some parts of the plot, discover unpublished characters and take charge of their requests, confirming an actually substantial replay value, which paves the way for numerous walkthroughs even after the completion of the adventure. Similarly, for this new test we thought of creating a different Lone Wolf than usual, capable of combining the power of war clubs (strictly wielded in pairs) with an approach based on intuition and reflection, with a set of powers Kai halfway between attack and defense. And yes, we enjoyed it like the first time. The pages of our life After a long initial loading, which however has the merit of reducing the in-game waiting times, the structure of Joe Dever's Lone Wolf shows itself in all its peculiarities. As mentioned, the game is a successful mix between gamebook and turn-based combat: a fascinating reading experience, which often calls us to make choices and accept the consequences, producing different implications depending on the path we have decided to take. The village of Rockstarn was suddenly attacked by a horde of Giaks who put it on fire, massacring many inhabitants in search of something precious. Realizing what happened, Lone Wolf quickly reaches the area and faces the enemies still present, desperately looking for some survivors and running into Leandra, a very clever and courageous girl, who could have something to do with the reasons behind the assault . We will discover the truth over the course of four acts, each divided into three chapters, reading the engaging text signed by the late Joe Dever for the occasion and moving schematically within a map to reach the various places of interest. During the same journey, randomly, or once we arrive in a new area, the story will invariably put us in front of a series of fights with increasingly stronger opponents, to be faced as mentioned in a turn-based context. After each fight we will be able to collect a certain amount of loot, with resources and money with which to buy new equipment or improve the one in our possession. The touch of the wolf The controls of the Nintendo Switch version of Joe Dever's Lone Wolf resume what has already been seen on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, putting aside the touch screen in favor of quick time events based on the use of buttons and analog sticks. These maneuvers are called upon to consolidate certain attacks, to carry out rapid swerves in order to avoid enemy blows or to score spectacular finishers capable of restoring a large part of our spiritual energy. There are in fact three indicators to keep an eye on: that of health, that of vigor and precisely the mystical energy, which allows Lone Wolf to launch attacks based on telekinesis, on the use of shadows, on the call of wolves and on the self healing. During the round, the various options are indicated through icons that represent the buttons of the controller, which once pressed bring up a wheel of possibilities to draw on. Once we have selected our target with the back keys, we will therefore be able to attack him with the main weapon in a fast, medium or heavy way, throw him knives or arrows of various types, resort to the aforementioned Kai powers or finally extract the deadly Sword of the Sun, if its gauge is full, and perform a spectacular light attack. At the end of the fight our energy will inevitably be lower: we will have to take this into account before tackling a new duel, choosing to stop and meditate to restore all the values (with the risk, however, that some enemy will take us by surprise), stay in a safe inn or open the inventory and consume food or potions that can refresh us. The experience on Nintendo Switch As mentioned at the beginning, Joe Dever's Lone Wolf really has a lot to give thanks to its peculiar crossroads structure, which offers not only a high quality, epic and engaging narrative sector, but also a pleasant reading experience both in portable and by connecting Nintendo Switch to the TV. The developers have in fact set it by defaultlt the most legible font among the three selectable ones, added some changes to streamline the interface (although trading and crafting generally remain a bit cumbersome operations) and optimized the analog stick controls to the fullest, so that not even the opening minigames of locks with the lock pick are excessively difficult. Everything works great, but it must also be said that four abundant years have now passed since the game's debut and certain assets, textures in the first place, are starting to feel the weight of time, so much so that it would have been the case to refresh some of them. Nothing serious, in any case: the visual rendering of the fights remains excellent, especially thanks to the design of the enemies and the settings, while the soundtrack of 93 Steps is as fascinating as the first time: there are some truly splendid songs, which deserve without question of being heard.", "date": "2018-02-17", "grade": "8.0"}
