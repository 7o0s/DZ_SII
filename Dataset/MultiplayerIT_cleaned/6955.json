On this occasion, children regularly get lost in the neighboring forest, ending up falling victim to the grip of the cold: a tragedy that by now is experienced by the village mayor as an inevitable habit, and that it will be up to the user to try to prevent of fifteen (virtual) years of activity. Save the children The premises of Road Not Taken are undoubtedly encouraging, above all because it doesn't happen every day to find a puzzle game with such marked attention in the construction of the atmosphere: thanks to particularly successful interlude scenes, to a perfectly fitting musical accompaniment and to a highly sought after design, the title of Spry Fox exerts a mysterious charm that is difficult to resist, at least in the first lines. Part of the credit goes to everything that serves as a side dish to the actual puzzle play activity, and which takes the form of the relationship with the various villagers: it is possible to talk to each of them, delving into their private stories and trying to curry their favor by giving them gifts, kindness that is often reciprocated with amulets that can be equipped to have certain bonuses during puzzle solving. Beyond the strong personality of all the residents, it is also striking the existence of a behavioral dynamic that causes some subjects to literally become jealous of the protagonist's relationship with others, denying him friendship or asking for ever more expensive gifts to be able to put a stone above. Even the ranger's house which is entrusted to the user as a base of operations offers some interesting solutions in terms of gameplay, allowing you to choose which amulets to take with you in the next mission and even to close (literally) certain elements of the scenario in the closet , effectively removing the components that are less welcome from the puzzle experience. In short, Spry Fox undoubtedly deserves credit for having endowed his title with an appreciable RPG component, when he could have limited himself to proposing a simple succession of levels as happens in most puzzles. Road Not Taken is as fascinating in its premise as it is frustrating in its gameplay mechanics Uphill road When you leave the tranquility of the village to enter the forest, Road Not Taken shows its most controversial face, offering a playful structure that swings dangerously on the border between difficulty and frustration, often ending up falling back into the latter . Like any self-respecting roguelike, the levels are procedurally generated and the death of the protagonist is permanent, so if you fail you are forced to start all over again. Each internship represents a year in one's career as a ranger, and the goal is therefore to arrive alive and well at the end of the mandate, possibly saving as many children as possible. From this point of view, Road Not Taken offers considerable freedom to the user, who can decide to abandon some child to his sad fate if the risk is to lose his pen or if he can't find the solution to the enigma that would allow to save it: however, there are consequences to such an attitude that go beyond the mere score, and which mainly concern the bad reputation that one gets in the eyes of the inhabitants, compromising relations with them. The levels are divided into a number of areas, each with one or more puzzles to be solved to unlock access to the next area or be able to reach one of the children. The protagonist can move freely on the game grid, exploiting his ability to lift objects that are in his immediate vicinity to throw them in the direction he is facing, an action that fulfills the three main objectives of the gameplay: in fact, it serves to bring the children to safety (just throw them at the address of one of the mothers present in the area), to form groups of identical elements to open the closed passages and to create new objects by placing two or more different units next to each other. This particular crafting mechanic plays a fundamental role in advanced levels, when it is necessary to carry out a whole series of steps to obtain the indispensable object to be able to continue, an operation made difficultdifficult by the presence of over 200 types of elements with all their relative combinations. To complicate things then two main factors intervene: the energy available to the protagonist - which runs out when he is attacked by an enemy or if he moves while he is lifting an object - and the presence of more or less hostile creatures that move every movement of the user on the grid, constituting a very difficult variable to keep under control. Road Not Taken does nothing to make life easier for the player, forcing him to pay for every slightest mistake and carefully avoiding giving even a vague indication of the possible interactions between the various elements of the scenario: the only alternative is therefore to proceed attempts, but the ruthless game dynamics mean that on some occasions a single wrong move is enough to compromise an entire game. A truly cutting choice of field by Spry Fox, who not happy also wanted to endow the game with a level of difficulty that rises already in the very first years of work, making it a difficult experience to be considered enjoyable for anyone who is not a lover of extreme challenges.", "date": "2014-08-20", "grade": "6.5"}
