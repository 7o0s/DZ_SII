It is therefore the best time to try this experience if you own an iPhone, an iPad, an Apple TV or a Mac. Returning to the sports title from 2K Games, we are faced with a version without microtransactions and therefore with the MyTeam mode, deeply linked to that type of mechanism. For the rest, however, the developers have brought a truly complete experience to mobile, perhaps even too much if we consider the simulation approach that has always characterized the franchise and which does not go very well with the new context. Structure NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition, the polygonal models are the same as the console versions. Let's start with the contents. As mentioned, NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition renounces the MyTeam mode but not all the rest, given that from the start screen it is possible to try a quick game between two teams of your choice from the NBA championship, with online multiplayer, with background matches of the Blacktop mode and finally with the Career. It is inevitably the latter that represents the fulcrum of the experience: after creating a player using the tools of a surprisingly complete and multifaceted editor, we will be able to choose a team and begin a long growth path professional, measured on the degree of precision of each of our maneuvers but with some fairly obvious balancing problems. NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition boasts a surprisingly comprehensive editor. For a substantial period of time, in fact, our athlete will find himself unable to combine fundamental skills for his performance on the field, always remaining rather exposed in certain areas. A short blanket, very short, which often translates into the inability to finish the basket even when it would seem more difficult to miss the shot than to get it right. While waiting for 2K Games to fix these shortcomings in some way, it must be said that the rest of the contents work great and still allow you to have fun for hours with a system that immediately reveals itself to be profound and exciting, especially for that niche of users looking for of a simulative and realistic product to play on the go. Gameplay NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition on a graphic level only sacrifices the resolution of the reflections on the parquet. So we come to the most important strengths and weaknesses of NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition. We have said that this reduction brings a truly complete, simulative, multifaceted experience to Apple Arcade, with all the mechanisms and peculiarities that have contributed over the years to making the series a real point of reference for basketball fans. Well, this complexity unfortunately comes at a price, in the sense that the developers have not sufficiently adapted the controls and mechanics to the new context, giving life to a product that can only be played well and exclusively using a Bluetooth controller. With touch controls, in fact, it is really difficult to be precise, not only due to the useless abundance of buttons but also and above all due to the lack of responsiveness of the movements. NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition, the start of a match. This last aspect clearly depends on the differences between the various athletes and on the simulation approach of the game, but in concrete terms it creates a situation of unsustainable slowness, also giving rise to a sequence of sensational and frustrating errors that generally do not occur with physical controls . That a mobile game is not actually playable on the move is a bit of an anomalous situation, let's say so. It is clear that this situation makes NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition an even more elite product, to be used strictly at home, inevitably with a controller, by connecting your device to the TV via an adapter or with the iPad resting on a support. Technical realization On the front of the technical realization there is little to say: NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition uses the same assets of the PC and console versions, with the polygonal models of the players full of details and equipped with a large set of animations, as well as a rendering of the stadium and of the exceptional public, with an equally excellent sound. By setting the visual quality to the maximum, the 2K Games title undoubtedly stands as one of the best games available on the App Store. Naturally, all this has a price: on the iPhone 12 Pro and on the iPad Pro, you can run everything with the ultra settings and holding 60 fps, but even on these premium devicesyou can feel the fatigue of the graphics engine when there are small drops in frame rates or when navigating the options. The problem is that by dropping the presets even slightly, there is a substantial downgrade of the graphics, a sign that the scalability has not been managed in the best possible way.", "date": "2021-04-12", "grade": "7.5"}
