We refer in particular to ~tower defense~ such as Zombie Smash! or Castle Frenzy, but the list is long: titles in which using our fingers we can grab our enemies and throw them into the air, or use the fury of the elements against them. In the case of GodFinger, the context appears decidedly calmer and less devoted to violence, given that the ngmoco product is presented in the form of a managerial in which we have our beautiful planet to grow and prosper. The form of interaction, however, does not change one iota: using our fingers we can grab the fearful inhabitants of the world we have created and leave them where we want them to do our bidding. All after having amazed them with special effects, as they say. In fact, it is enough to place a cloud on their heads, charge it by holding down the tip of a finger and then direct a shower of rain towards the ground. Miracles: they convince even the most skeptical people. Our new followers will therefore make themselves available, dancing around the totemic symbol that represents the divinity and thus increasing the amount of mana that we can use to resort to the elements, or working in one of the farms that we can buy in the appropriate shop , or even resting by a fountain if we have the good heart to build one. Private God Once GodFinger has been downloaded (free of charge) and registered on the Plus+ social network (mandatory), we will find ourselves facing preliminary phases in which our ~powers~ and their repercussions on the planet we manage and on the people who manage it are gradually illustrated to us. populate. The latter increase in number as our ~crates~ fill up with gold and the scenario becomes flourishing. Yes, because at the beginning the planet is nothing but an arid and empty boulder, which we have to water thoroughly using the clouds and subsequently irradiate with the sun's rays. These operations will transform the dry soil into grass, flowers and trees, in short, into a perfect place to build a beautiful farm and entrust it to a couple of ~faithful~ to make it bear fruit. Also in this case the engine of production is the rain, therefore it is advisable to keep our beautiful clouds always at hand. Once the population has multiplied, the first threats will begin to arrive in the form of improbable skeletal zombies, but at that point we will also have a weapon to eliminate them before they do any damage: a new cloud, this time dark and threatening, from which we can launch lightning bolts. The divine picture looks complete, doesn't it? Unfortunately it is when the news runs out and the achievements are struggling to unlock that the ngmoco product shows its obvious limits. The action is in fact too repetitive, from a certain point onwards it asks us to dedicate time or money to our creation (real money, for the purchase of new buildings or other objects) and our opinion is that mobile gaming is not still ready for such an experience; which maybe works great when there's nothing to do in the office and you have to kill time somehow, but which has little appeal if played in an occasional and impromptu way. On a technical level, GodFinger does his best and is certainly nice, with a maybe immature but funny drawing style and characters that move convincingly, snatching a few smiles. The controls very often turn out to be imprecise, however, and make it tiring both to rotate the planet and to move objects.
