Game Dev Tycoon was born as a PC response to the mobile title, and the inspiration is evident in the entire structure of the Greenheart Games game, starting from the concept up to the different solutions and gameplay mechanics. It is a question of running a development studio, starting from the classic home garage up to the creation of a real videogame entertainment empire, obviously if we will be able to better manage every aspect of the work. Everything flows second in a progressive flow that takes us from the creation of the first indie titles with minimal budget and limited structure up to the gigantic triple A titles capable of grinding millions of copies, with a gradual advancement that always opens up new possibilities with wider choices. The creation of a video game is a complex procedure which here, obviously, is schematized through a series of linked choices, the combination of which determines the variables on which the success or otherwise of the project will be based. You must choose a title, the genre to which it belongs, the setting, the technology to be used (graphic engine and the like) and the platform on which to publish the game and based on the combination of these elements and the ability of the developers involved, the he outcome of our project, i.e. the quantity of sales, which also largely depends on the evaluation by the specialized press. In short, the glowing world of videogame development in a nutshell, one could say, even if the very complexity of the area in question must necessarily be filtered and greatly simplified in an easily digestible game structure, so as to be even too schematic and cold. Game development in the palm of your hand with the mobile version of Game Dev Tycoon From the garage to the limelight The beauty of Game Dev Tycoon is precisely its scalar approach to development, the constant progression that continually opens up new creative possibilities, substantially represented by further choices to be implemented in the various areas to be managed: from the increase in exploitable genres and settings thanks to larger budgets high and superior skills of more experienced developers (and in greater numbers) to the increase in visibility that games can obtain through new marketing strategies, taking advantage of institutional fairs or organizing specific events to promote their titles. It is clear that such a quantity of variables is difficult to represent in a way and keep under control, for this reason in the game we essentially find ourselves simply implementing a series of choices and trying to hit the right combinations between them. The problem, which had already been noted in the PC version, is that the functioning of this whole mechanism remains rather hidden: the process by which some choices determine planetary success while others condemn us to failure is never entirely clear and the whole path of development in Game Dev Tycoon remains closed in an incomprehensible hermeticism. Just like Game Dev Story, the result is a kind of extremely concise parody of the world of videogame development, only that in this case the implicitly humorous and caricatured note that is typical of Japanese productions is also missing, emphasized in Kairosoft's game by their classic style in pixel art, in addition to references to the purely Japanese environment. Game Dev Tycoon enriches the Kairosoft game structure with various additional actions such as the need to carry out market surveys, trend detection and investments in research and development which open up many new creative and organizational possibilities for the team. These are elements which, in order not to explain the deep mechanics of the simulation - which remains largely inscrutable - increase the involvement by keeping us busy on several fronts. The mobile version also adds some more up-to-date features such as the ability to stream games and manage piracy, as well as obviously having a user interface convincingly adapted to the touch screen.", "date": "2017-12-07", "grade": "7.5"}
