There's the exciting mobile opportunity, sure, and then of course there's Steam with its huge audience. However, arriving on the digital platform Valve does not mean automatically scoring a coup; on the contrary, once there you have to contend with many tremendously fierce opponents, perhaps endowed with enormously greater resources. So what kind of choice is the case to make to get a minimum of attention? The guys from Chasing Carrots have seen fit to create a curious mix between vertical scrolling shooter and top-down driving game, packing everything with a narrative component that winks at the humor of some classics of the adventure genre. The result is Pressure, a title with undoubted merits that we will not fail to list, but which at the same time stands on the often shaky foundations of a gameplay that, intentionally, is neither fish nor fowl. Within a fascinating steampunk setting, the protagonist of the game is Morgan, a sort of wacky but resolute inventor, who one fine day is preparing to take his usual morning bath in the lake in front of his caravan, but runs into a 'bitter discovery: an unscrupulous corporation is draining the waters of the area, depriving the inhabitants of this fundamental resource. All this is unacceptable, and so Morgan gets on board his armed buggy and decides to face the many thugs in the service of Count Soap II to eradicate the threat. Watch the tank Grasped the traditional Xbox 360 controller, Pressure immediately reveals its peculiarities. In fact, our vehicle is controlled like in a top-down racer, accelerating with the right trigger and braking (or activating reverse) with the left one, while the left analog stick determines the direction of the buggy. The main buttons of the pad are used to open fire with the main weapon (A) and with the secondary one (B), to make a quick sprint (X) or to give pressure to our possible playmate in the cooperative mode for two people, that we weren't able to test due to a manifest lack of online users (maybe we were unlucky, eh). The structure of the levels is very simple: it is a question of setting off, passing through a series of checkpoints (which restore part of our energy) and then arriving at the finish line without exploding and with a sufficient quantity of fuel (the ~pressure~ of which we've already talked), all while hundreds of enemies peep on the screen and target us with their weapons. Initially the experience arises as a sort of crazy race without strategy: the vehicle holds up well to the blows, the opponents are blown up with relative ease and the checkpoints are not too far from each other. Likewise, the impression is not the best and the picture seems to be that of a confused, chaotic product, devoid of precise ideas and equipped with at least cumbersome solutions for managing the arsenal. Fortunately, things improve quite quickly, as soon as the degree of challenge rises a minimum and the full-bodied upgrade system enters the field, which gives us the opportunity to spend the gold coins collected during each run to buy new weapons or upgrade those we have, equip the vehicle with a ram to ram hostile vehicles, modify the armor and select a secondary device that can, depending on the type, recharge our energy, fire a guided missile, emit a powerful electric shock, release bombs sticky and so on. Great variety In short, it takes a while for Pressure to show all of its cards. We are talking about elements of undoubted value, such as the AI of always shrewd opponents, full-bodied and engaging boss fights, very well characterized scenarios with some impact variations, but all without ever pushing the acceleration on the ~racer~ part of the gameplay , which ultimately remains purely ancillary to the rest of the action. The problem is that even if the weapons change and it is possible to think in strategic terms about which device to mount, carefully spending the few coins that are given to us at the end of the internships (which cannot be replayed to raise more money, watch out!), after all, the problems remain those at the basis of production, in this case the directionality of the fire. Our buggy only shoots forwards, which means that to hit an enemy you sometimes have to do somersaults and this is not very comfortable when, for example, youI love running out of pressure and just taking out a few opponents can earn us some. A dual analog shooter-style solution would certainly have been preferable, perhaps balancing the difficulty differently so as not to make things too simple for us, and it is strange that the developers did not take this into consideration. All the more reason because the outline is very well cared for: the style of the cutscenes is funny and effective, the in-game graphics appear detailed, fluid and above all very varied from one scenario to another, even the musical accompaniment is nice.", "date": "2013-04-24", "grade": "7.0"}
