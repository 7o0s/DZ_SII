{"name": "Championship Manager 01/02", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/championship-manager-103.html", "text": "A dive into history The youngest among you will surely not remember it, but CM (Championship Manager) was released for the first time back in 1992 on the PC platform by the hand of an unknown English team called Sports Interactive. Since then, a lot of water has passed under the bridge, I would say a lot. Year after year, release after release, the game managed to add new followers to its ranks, so much so that it broke record after record in the European (especially British) charts. For years that title has become the very emblem of football management and those unknown kids were sought after for billions by various publishers before settling down with Eidos Interactive. Despite good intentions and the desire for a console niche, the developers never managed to convert it to consoles for various reasons, first of all the impossibility of implementing the huge database within ram-limited consoles. But time passes and everything evolves... And now for the first time Championship Manager has landed on a console, and the lucky one was Xbox! In the footsteps of Luciano Moggi... The purpose of this game is to offer us the possibility of totally managing any aspect connected to the life of any football club in the world. The following numbers serve to provide you with just an idea of the work behind this video game. 26 of the most prestigious and competitive national championships (from the Italian to the Brazilian), each of which is made up of its three major leagues (for example in Italy we will find Serie A-B-C1 and C2), over 100,000 players, coaches and managers entered into the database, each with dozens and dozens of real parameters ranging from the contract to the technical characteristics, 500 people involved in collecting data for the database. Once you have selected the team to coach, the real game will begin which will lead you to manage the team on a daily basis through contract renewals, purchases and transfers, training sessions, choice of formation and tactics, availability towards journalists, adherence to company plans and much more. other. As you can see from the images (they all refer to the English version, given that the version distributed by Leader has been completely localized in Italian), the game is made up solely of screens within which we will be able to move both using the levers and the pad commands (each key is associated with a specific function as fully explained in the Help section of the game), or through the convenient menu arranged on the sides of the screen. A pleasant innovation comes from the introduction of the Under 21 selections and the second teams (the Primavera) in which we will be able to insert our champions recovering from injuries so as to rehabilitate them in a soft way or promote the most talented youngsters to the First Team. Precisely on the player management front we find the greatest complexity. One of the first problems to deal with will be precisely that of contract renewals. Leafing through the roster, in addition to the various technical characteristics, we will find all the data relating to the compensation received and the expiry date of the contract, and on the basis of these we will have to decide whether to reconfirm it, whether to lend it, whether to sell it ... Furthermore, during the game we will often receive offers from rival companies and it will be up to us to decide whether to accept, refuse or stall. Another hot front is that of purchases. Thanks to our experts we will be able to observe certain players, we will be able to compare the cards of two professionals or directly contact our favorite ace hoping that a generous offer will convince him to pass under our banner. Precisely in this regard you will have to be particularly careful not to rage too much on the company financial statements since each negotiation has a recommended price proposed by the marketing manager. All these operations will be enhanced by the presence of the press which will often try to understand the secrets of our market moves and it will be up to us, like the new Luciano Moggi, to mislead journalists eager for a scoop. And this is only a small part of the operations we will have to carry out to better manage our team and respect the objective that the management sets for us at the start of the championship, be it salvation or winning the Scudetto. Finally on the pitch All our coaching aspirations will necessarily have to go through the verdict of the field. During the season we will face not only the championship but also the various na competitionsnational and international ones to which we are registered. The first concern will be the choice of the eleven lions to send on the field. As in real football, you will have to assign a player to each position (you can vary the tactical module as you like), making sure that he is actually available: injuries, suspensions, call-ups in the respective national teams, personal problems are some of the unknowns of the new Trap. Once the starting line-up and substitutes have been decided, we will finally be able to start the challenge. You will not have to put your hand on the pad and take the field, as Fifa or ISS have accustomed us to, but you will simply be asked to observe the scores that scroll along the monitor and to observe the behavior of your team on the field (through special screens that illustrate ball possession, the portion of the field where the action is most concentrated, etc.), looking for any gaps to fill immediately. During the 90 minutes you will always have the opportunity to make the three canonical changes or to modify the team's tactics. For example, if you find yourself at a disadvantage it will be convenient to adopt an offensive mentality, offside and other similar amenities. I can assure you that the changes in the running, if spot on, will help you turn the outcome of the match upside down (a little controversy against the PC Calcio saga, in which the squad sent onto the field has very little impact on the results that seem pre-established). Xbox or PC? This paragraph tries to be of help to those who own both Xbox and PC and are undecided on which version of Championship Manager to invest their savings. In the substantial homogeneity, some small differences can be found: Due to the limitation of the Xbox central processor, it was not possible to make more than three teams of different nationalities manageable during the same season, contrary to what happens in the PC version in which theoretically ( but who will be that madman???) each of us can lead as many as 26 different teams at the same time. Unfortunately, the Xbox version will lack the ability to edit the player's statistics as, however, can happen in the PC version. The absence of a keyboard and the different type of console user have discouraged the developers from implementing this useful option, also by virtue of the fact that the database is almost perfect. In the absence of the mouse we will have to move between the menus using the lever of the pad or using the directional keys that will make us shift from option to option. Honestly, I would have imagined this passage much more traumatic, but within a few minutes everything became really intuitive thanks also to the possibility of moving around the menus by pressing a key associated with a specific function. A game for everyone? The title of this paragraph is emblematic. Hardly titles of this kind manage to become mass products. If already football titles, such as Fifa or ISS, often find obstacles in the population of gamers, let alone a title that exaggerates the concept of football fan to the nth degree. Investing hundreds of hours to finish a single season could become the biggest impediment to buying the product. Occasional gamers, those from 5 minutes and so on, would not even be able to pass the pre-season phase (honestly too long since it is divided into two moments for each day), just as non-ultra football fans would find themselves frightened by the plethora of options available. Furthermore, all lovers of 3D graphic effects and hyper-refined musical columns will turn up their noses in front of a product that, from a graphic-sound point of view, could run comfortably on our Commodore 64. But the point is right here! This is the king of football management so either you love it or hate it! I would like to make a final note on its marketing date in Italy. In other European countries, the product has been available since the end of March, i.e. in conjunction with the various championships. Unfortunately, and I repeat unfortunately, in Italy the game has undergone a series of delays (initially it was foreseen in the initial line up) which have only brought it to the shops in these days, after the championship is more than finished. How many of you will have the mind to return to the past championship despite the market rumors that are upsetting the roses and the world championships that magnetize our minds? To recap Championship Manager manit keeps intact the prerogatives that made it the undisputed leader in the European field, revealing itself without a shadow of a doubt as the best football manager available on consoles. A complex and initially cumbersome title that makes the immense database and the completeness of options its strong points. Recommended for lovers of the saga and for all those looking for a product capable of transforming them into the various Moggi and Capello while sitting comfortably in an armchair. Pros: Huge database Football summarized in a game The best football manager available on consoles Love it or hate it Cons: Neophiles will find it cumbersome and static It comes out when the championship is over and with the World Cup in between.. Love it or hate it Materials: Screenshots Preview Championship Manager A world game The start of the World Cup in Korea and Japan seems to have reawakened the football impulses of software houses and distributors, so much so that, in just one month, the shelves of Italian stores were filled with titles of the caliber of ISS2, Fifa 2002 World Cup and await the arrival of the upcoming David Beckham Soccer and Red Card Soccer. But on closer inspection one immediately gets the feeling that something is still missing... Yet we have the official license of the World Cup (see Fifa 2002), terrific visual and audio effects (see ISS2), a cover sponsored by an ace of the caliber of David Beckam (see game of the same name) and even beatings from orbi (see Red Card Soccer); We don't have a manager title on Xbox yet!!! Following this simple reasoning, the guys from Sports Interactive have decided to develop the first console version of their highly decorated Championship Manager. Let the challenge begin!!", "date": "2002-06-18", "grade": null}
