{"name": "Torre di controllo abbiamo un problema", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flight-control-recensione.html", "text": "Flight Control is one of those games that is so simple and immediate that it almost needs no explanation; everything happens in front of a single static screen, without variations of any kind or changes of settings or anything like that. A single image that represents, with a bird's-eye view, two runways and a helicopter pad. But as often happens, simplicity can win the hearts of many, if it is supported by a gameplay model ~one more game and then I'll stop~. And this is precisely the case of the product from Firemint, a software house that is making a name for itself in the crowded panorama of iPhone developers. The gist of Flight Control basically lies in managing air traffic by landing all the aircraft that gradually populate the screen; child's play in words, but which becomes decidedly challenging when the crowding in the sky begins to be comparable to that of a ring road during rush hour. There are 3 types of aircraft, each of them associated with a specific runway; airliners, to which a large red lane that cuts half the screen is dedicated. Light touring aircraft, with a smaller yellow runway to the right. And finally the helicopters, with the blue platform. Each time one of these vehicles appears on the iPhone touch screen, it will be necessary to trace the flight trajectory that it will have to follow until landing with your index finger; the problem obviously lies in being able to make everyone's trajectories coexist while avoiding dangerous approaches or even worse accidents, the latter causing the immediate game over. The game is really roughly all here, and the only real goal is to improve the number of landings and consequently your final score; to such a basic and unavoidably repetitive product despite the goodness of the game design, Firemint has commendably tried to add some variants with the 1.1 update which brought with it the online and localized rankings based on one's position, the never so praised ability to resume a game after an interruption, support for Twitter and also Google Maps from the dedicated website. With version 1.2, still in the works, the programmers also promise the addition of new planes and airports, the latter elements which would greatly benefit the limited variety of Flight Control. But as it stands now, especially considering the price of 0.79 euros, there are frankly no reasons not to recommend the Firemint effort to anyone. An excellent diversion to fill a break or a wait in line at the counter, with the risk, however, of finding yourself in every free moment trying to beat that damned record... The reviewed version is 1.1", "date": "2009-05-10", "grade": "8.0"}
