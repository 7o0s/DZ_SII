For the occasion, the authors of the series have decided to entrust Tag Games with the creation of a tie-in that on the one hand boasted the renewed aesthetics of the characters, on the other hand managed to offer a fresh experience, attempting a road not yet beaten for the franchise. So here comes Angry Birds Action!, a puzzle game that is more similar to a pinball machine than to one of the traditional chapters, on iOS and Android devices. Within a campaign currently made up of almost one hundred missions, to which new ones will undoubtedly be added with the next updates, the game asks us to use touch controls similar to those we are well used to (dragging in the opposite direction to the bird on duty and letting go to throw it more or less quickly at a target), but in a different context than usual: ~closed~ scenarios, seen from above, with the possibility of bouncing off walls and obstacles in order to come into contact with certain items to collect in order to progress to the next stage. Angry Birds Action! is an interesting spin-off, shame about the limitations of the freemium format Turn that turns you around The gameplay of Angry Birds Action! it therefore sees us intent on launching the usual birds, characterized as mentioned by the ~anthropomorphic~ design that we will see in the cinema, in a context of reduced dimensions, trying to destroy barriers and collect objects using the number of launches available to us at each attempt. In order to enhance the proximity of this approach to that of traditional pinball machines, the same solutions have been included, in this case the components that generate a bounce of the ball, together with expedients such as barriers, explosives, jets of air that modify the trajectories and even more. On our side we will have some upgrades that can be used to amplify the rebound on surfaces, inflicting more damage on any barriers, or to freeze objects in order to make them less resistant to impact. At first, all of these mechanisms appear limited and banal, but after the first third of the campaign it reveals an unsuspected depth and challenge, coinciding with the arrival of other characters (for example Bomb, the explosive bird, or the extremely rapid Chuck) and more stringent rules for completing missions, above all the obligation to collect chicks and place them in their nest rather than just coming into contact with the targets. Unfortunately, the freemium aspect of the experience has been managed foolishly, with an indicator of the energy of action consisting of only three ~tokens~, each rechargeable within fifteen minutes: too little to guarantee a minimum duration to the games , especially when compared to traditional episodes of Angry Birds, which do not aim to monetize in this way. On the technical front, however, nothing to complain: beyond a somewhat anonymous sound accompaniment, the developers have done a good job with the graphics, emphasizing the ~final touches~ of each level with nice slow motion.", "date": "2016-05-06", "grade": "7.0"}
