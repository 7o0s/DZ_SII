After failing the first attempt (UFO: Aftermath) and having recovered a little with the second shot (UFO: Aftershock) the Altar programmers try again to make all the fans of the X-Com series happy with this interesting UFO: Afterlight. As per tradition, the (unsuccessful) presentation movie introduces us to the game world of Afterlight. After abandoning the earth in the first chapter and returning to the attack from the Laputa orbiting platform to then succumb again and be forced into exile in the second chapter, now our group of space colonists seems to have resigned themselves by deciding to try to colonize the planet Mars, waiting for better times. Unfortunately communications with planet Earth seem to be difficult, the Martian neighbors don't all seem to be very friendly and, in short, the mysterious attack on one of our geological stations represents the beginning of a long series of wars and battles to the last ray laser. Split soul As per the tradition of the series, UFO: Afterlight presents us with two distinct but amalgamated souls and, again as per tradition, the managerial and strategic part is much more complete, profound and fun than the tactical combat section. Broadly speaking, everything takes place as in the Total War series, with the same degree of freedom (and replayability) granted to the user. different goals, many choices, many opportunities Split soul From our base we will have the situation constantly under control and, also thanks to the help of our advisers, we will have to manage the colonization of the planet Mars, diplomatic relations with other alien peoples, production, research and, more generally, the prosperity of the community. Much of our efforts will have to be channeled into the purely strategic management of the new conquered territories, in the exploitation of resources and in the research on alien technologies that will be financed with the trophies with which our teams of fighters will return from time to time. All our men (and women and aliens and...) in Afterlight have a name, a surname and a story. Every scientist has a specific cultural background, just as every technician will be more or less inclined to develop certain products and every soldier will have characteristics that will lead him to prefer certain fighting styles. From time to time we should also send non-combatant personnel directly into the field to be able to repair technical devices and so on. The amalgam of all this ~human~ material and its management halfway between a cRPG and The Sims certainly represents the most successful aspect of the game. Not to mention the management and research aspect, where we will find ourselves deciding which scientists to assign to which projects and in which order of priority. Prefer the study of that alien body or speed up research in the field of explosives, rather than dedicating yourself to the search for new forms of communication? And then, prefer the production of energy weapons or devote yourself to the construction of new more powerful space suits? Different goals, many choices, many opportunities. Beautiful and inspiring. All obviously interspersed with attacks on our outposts or raids on enemy bases. Alpha Squad: To Battle Posts! At battle posts Once we arrive at the mission site, a real-time game system with automatic pause will welcome us. In a similar way to what happens, for example, in the majority of BioWare cRPGs (from the two Baldur's Gates to the most recent titles in the Knights of The Old Republic or Neverwinter Nights series) the mechanics provide for a continuous and linear theoretical development of the action . Just like in any RTS. To facilitate the command of our team, fortunately, however, we will be able to set a series of triggers (or switches to put it in Italian) which, once activated, will automatically interrupt the actions in progress. It will be possible to decide to interrupt the game whenever an enemy is sighted, rather than at the end of the execution of an order given to any of the members of our team and so on. All this will ensure that, depending on the phase of the game or the style of the player, it will always be possible to set the most appropriate pace of play. Having said that all the purists of the genre, rather than all the fans of the X-Com series, could already stop reading cursing and cursing the casual player market and yet - in case you belong to these people - we assure you that already after a handful of missions as well as get used to it, you could also risk appreciating the ductility of this new t-shaped systemurns. Not to mention the new game situations that thus add an extra pinch of likelihood to the game: such as unexpected simultaneous killings or the simpler, but still lethal, simultaneous sighting of several enemies. On the artificial intelligence front, unfortunately, Altar continues to seem unresponsive by presenting us with unlikely and.... intelligent enemy behavior. We find other negative notes on the side of interaction with the game world. In Afterlight our landing parties will continue to move in a static and practically indestructible scenario. In fact, there won't be any explosion from a grenade or explosion from a barrel of petrol that will be able to change the characteristics of the area of action. the entire combat system is likely to start to get boring soon At battle posts Still in this regard, we conclude with a lack that actually represents a rather congenital defect in this kind of game: it is in fact practically impossible to take advantage of the cover opportunities offered by the scenario. In the face of the dozens of options available, there isn't one - similar to what happens in Full Spectrum Warrior - that orders one of our soldiers, perhaps stationed behind a wall, to shoot and then hide from enemy fire by taking refuge around the corner, rather than crouching behind a rock. Just like at the time of the X-Com team, the fights, however tactical and full of tension, are often reduced to an unrealistic - or at least anachronistic - face-to-face confrontation, in full Ok Corral style. Not to help improve the general picture, there is the total monotony of the game environments and the lack of variety of enemies to face. Often, we will even find ourselves fighting in the exact same scenarios, and to say that Mars seemed like such a large planet to us... Fortunately, Altar have shown at least a minimum of resourcefulness, and after having equipped our soldiers with the precious gift of 'hearing (!), now thanks to the possibility of having alien soldiers in our ranks, we will be able to exploit their psionic powers, giving us the opportunity to locate - more or less precisely - the position of enemy creatures without physically seeing them. All this can only add a further degree of tension and realism to our guerrilla actions even if, needless to deny it, the entire combat system risks starting to get boring very soon. Alien technique Let's face it, as a good PC-ista geek that I am, one of the first things I do once a game is installed is to take a look at the preferences menu in search of the customization of the graphic/sound component. Entries such as HDR and ~High Resolution Textures~ had made me hope for an efficient and cutting-edge graphics engine. On the other hand, it didn't take much to notice a barely sufficient audiovisual system with the excuse of the total lack of particular slowdowns and the fact that even systems from a few years ago will be able to run the game without major problems. The animations are poor, the three-dimensional models are pure and the level design itself is not particularly appreciated for inspiration or imagination. The general judgment reaches the sufficiency above all by virtue of the graphics in the managerial section and in the characterization (rather cartoony) of the portraits of the characters and some weapons. The audio is rather anonymous overall, except for the very good characterization of the voices of our team members. On the graphical interface front, the designers seem to have reached a good compromise between usability and the number of options available to the player, both in the managerial and in the tactical sections. In the latter mode, I would have preferred a little more fluid and simple camera management but it is also true that compared to other titles of the genre in terms of usability we are certainly above average. At least in this.

Conclusions All fans of this genre of games will soon find themselves at ease with a title capable of offering an always high and stimulating degree of challenge, at least from a strategic point of view. Sure, it's here nowIn the third chapter it would have been reasonable to expect a greater in-depth analysis of the tactical/military theme which instead, this time too, seems to have the same strengths and weaknesses as the previous chapter. We are not faced with a masterpiece or a new milestone of the genre, however UFO: Afterlight manages to bring back to our monitors part of the magic of the titles that clearly inspired it. It will be a faint and distant glimmer, but that little is enough to amuse. Pros Deep and varied managerial section Excellent longevity Little competition... Cons Poor depth of the tactical section Rather monotonous game environments Technically subdued Once upon a time there was Microprose, a veritable forge of videogame masterpieces - by someone more simply called games. Names like Sid Meier and Geoff Crammond were the example of a way of making toys imbued with competence, craftsmanship and a lot of passion. But we don't want to talk about them, but about two brothers - the Gollops - who, in the mid-90s, gave birth to a real instant classic: ~X-Com: Enemy Unknown~ (a.k.a. ~X- Com: Ufo Defense~). The title managed to combine in a very unique and perfect way two types of approach to strategy: the large-scale one (in the Geoscape section) and the small-scale one (the legendary Battlescape). The player thus found himself seamlessly managing his own base and intercepting alien UFOs or defending terrestrial cities from alien attacks. Just as happened (and happens) in titles such as Jagged Alliance, the player literally entered the game world and became attached to that set of moving pixels that represented the components of the assault teams. He called them by name, knew their strengths and weaknesses... he mourned their death bitterly. Ok someone, maybe, took advantage of their thaumaturgical powers and simply reloaded the game in progress, but that's another story. Today the X-Com trademark is hidden in some folder hidden in some filing cabinet of some trademark office - just like the holy grail at the end of ~Raiders of the Lost Ark~ - awaiting some exhumation in view, perhaps, of an ~unpublished~ First Person Shooter; while the Gollop brothers have embarked on a totally online independent project called Laser Squad Nemesis and so the heavy legacy of the brand is contested among a series of more or less promising projects which, more or less openly aping the characteristics of the X-Com series, try to bring its spirit back to our monitors. Among these, the most successful project seems to be undoubtedly the UFO project, by Altar Interactive, which has reached its third chapter today.", "date": "2007-03-28", "grade": null}
