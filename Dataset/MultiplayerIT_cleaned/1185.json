{"name": "Mario Golf: Advance Tour", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-golf-advance-tour_a.html", "text": "Engaging Mechanics and Excellent Presentation The heart of Mario Golf is obviously the control system, which incorporates many elements of the GameCube version and is presented as a refinement of the GameBoy Color version. The functioning is similar to that of many golf games (and sports games of the past), with a system of pressing the buttons and power bars: the success of the shots is linked to the correspondence with specific points of the energy bar, which moves more or less quickly once activated with the first press. If at the moment of the shot the view is from behind the golfer, the choice of the direction of the shot takes place alternatively with a view from above which gives an overall view of the chosen golf course. Before hitting the ball we will be able to evaluate the influence of the wind, decide which club to use, what effect to give the ball (first by holding down a button that allows us to specify where to hit it) and move around the map to examine it in detail. The control system interfaces perfectly with the interaction environment: if it is easy to understand the mechanics and have fun in a few minutes, it is quite another thing to perfect the more advanced techniques of special shots (with movements to be performed while the bar is moving) or learn to evaluate all the variables that will allow us to oppose a successful shot to a formidable competitor, avoiding shots that are out of par and ramshackle. Finding ourselves in front of a title with Mario, there will be no shortage of bonuses and special features: each map (there are six in all) has an unlockable Star version, and many are equipped with special items such as shortcut-pipes, Piranha-plants, bonus blocks that change wind direction and more. Engaging Mechanics and Excellent Presentation However, the control system is not the only strong point of Mario Golf: Advance Tour, which can also count on a large variety of selectable, gradually unlockable characters; of options ranging from the choice of ~themed~ matches (such as being able to win races using only certain types of clubs, just to give an example) to saving the best shots; of game modes, with the possibility of using the wireless adapter, of playing multiplayer with up to three friends or even with a single cartridge or just a GBA to pass from hand to hand (solution from the past but very effective for a game where you alternate shots), to embark on the RPG mode, with mechanics and graphic style very inspired by Golden Sun and in fact implanted from the same computer engine. The latter is the most important mode of Mario Golf, already present in the first portable title but decidedly more developed and central here: thanks to it, from an excellent pick and play title that it already is, Mario Golf also becomes a decent RPG, with a large amount of dialogues, side quests and a good dose of exploration, accumulation of information and experience. The best on the field Mario Gold Advance Tour is certainly the best portable golf title ever produced, not only for the excellent game mechanics (improved and enriched) but also for the quality of the presentation, the options and the immense attention paid to every detail . In surpassing its prequel and the GameCube version in terms of sheer playability and care, it also enters the ranks of the best sports and non-sports titles available for the GameBoy Advance in terms of fun and depth (also thanks to the RPG mode). If all this were not enough to make you a golf enthusiast, it is certainly enough to keep any golfer worthy of the name entertained for a long time. Pros: Gameplay tested and perfected Massive amount of options and multiplayer game Best portable golf game Cons: If you really hate golf Can you pass me the 4th iron, thanks While not touching the complexity of genre titles, and while not being able to actually enter Mario Golf in the category in question, the RPG mode is in any case a decisive factor in the economy of the game, because it is within it that the progress of the player's skills and experience points of the characters, together with the parallel missions (such as challenges themed or on certain skills or simple pseudo-puzzles with rich dialogues) and the evolution of the main story (challenge the champion Mario), give the greatest satisfaction to the player, uniting with golf-playing in a unitary experience. To all this must also be added a technical realization that is certainly not excellent but certainly of a good standard. Excluding the slight sense of initial graphic disorientation, due to the mingling of fixed objects and backdropszooming in Mode 7, the graphics are colorful, simple and effective, as are the presentation and narrative screens. Even the sound is pleasant, with excellent effects, the usual nice voices of the Nintendo stable and very enjoyable and unexpectedly well-arranged music, but obviously it can be excluded from the flood of other options (which include, among other things, the possibility of assigning ~ customizable taints~, some phrases of mockery or jubilation, to your character).

Excluding the initial slight sense of graphic disorientation, due to the mix between fixed objects and backdrops that zoom in Mode 7, the graphics are colourful, simple and effective, as are the presentation and narrative screens.

The types of Camelot, former authorsof Hot Shot Golf for the Playstation-progenitor, they had amazed the critics with the portable prequel of this title, the surprising Mario Golf for GameBoy Color. Capable of exceeding the thickness that one would have expected for such a title on an 8bit portable, the first Mario Golf had established itself (even above its big brother, which could be interfaced to him, for Nintendo 64) as the best pick-and-drop golf existing -play. This scepter, however, must now be handed over to Advance Tour. Here too the connectivity with the home console, in this case the GameCube, enriches the playful experience with bonuses and rewards, and here too the comparison between the two titles leaves the winner ~small~ portable version. If Toadstool Tour for GameCube makes the simplicity of the gameplay and polygonal impact its strengths, Advance Tour for GBA takes up the formula of its predecessor and enriches it, and not only thanks to the technological leap forward, from every point of view. The engaging mechanics, the gameplay both simple and refined, the huge amount of options and modes in single and multiplayer, the decidedly more developed RPG component and the care lavished on every single aspect of the presentation and implementation make it one of the best sports titles and not on the Nintendo portable, mandatory for enthusiasts but capable of thrilling any gamer.", "date": "2004-10-14", "grade": null}
