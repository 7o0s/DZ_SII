{"name": "Curse: the Eye of Isis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/curse-the-eye-of-isis.html", "text": "The context London 1890, the engineer Darien Dane is on his way to a prestigious Egyptian art exhibition organized by his friend Victoria Sutton, but once he arrives at the museum he realizes that the exhibition has been canceled due to the theft of the most important object of the entire exhibition: The Eye of Isis. This figurine was stolen by Le Chat, a very expert thief, who actually comes into view as a sort of ninja warrior. In fact, Le Chat is a mercenary who has been tasked by the bad guy to steal the statuette due to its priceless value. Bupo (the villain) is a very powerful Greek billionaire with a passion for antiquities. What Bupo doesn't know is that the eye of Isis carries with it a terrible curse that affects whoever possesses it. Inside the museum, in fact, the guards and attendants begin to fall victims of the curse, transforming themselves into terrible monsters capable of emanating from their mouths a cursed breath capable of infecting anyone who is affected by it. It is from here that Darien begins the search for his friend in the museum and between an undead and Bupo's henchman, our hero will also meet an old friend of his father, Abdul Wahid, a character who will prove to be very useful during the adventure, as custodian of the secrets of Darien's father, in turn discoverer of the statuette, and therefore generous with advice. The burly Egyptian will also act as a real wandering checkpoint, showing up from time to time to allow us to save our progress. ~Eye...~ In CTEOI we will be asked to get to the bottom of a seemingly intricate story, which will lead us to deal with a curse that haunts the Dane family, that of the protagonist. To move around the game scenarios we will use an interface very similar to that of the classics of the genre and we will have at our disposal an arsenal that will range from the British police truncheon to the flamethrower, the latter especially useful for burning the mummies brought back to life by the curse. During the fighting, the curse of Isis will also be able to infect the protagonists, who, once possessed, will gradually be deprived of their vital energy; in this case, to restore health, it will not be enough to use the amulets that will leave the mummies destroyed, but it will be necessary to use salts or menthol, useful for awakening us from the torpor into which the curse will make us fall. As for the fights, we can say that we are dealing with one of the most interesting ideas in the game. The aiming system will in fact allow us to focus on the enemy in the best possible way, in order to be sure of hitting him even from several meters away, moreover with some enemies (mainly end-of-level bosses) we will have the possibility to decide which part of the body to hit thanks to the use of the Y key. Unfortunately, there aren't many interesting ideas and the situation returns below average when we analyze the characterization of the protagonists, poorly cared for in terms of graphics and animations and lacking that personality that a video game hero should have; in fact, it seems really difficult to become attached to Darien or Victoria, both of whom can be used in turn during the adventure. If possible, on the enemy front the situation appears even worse and in most cases we will be faced with creatures that are nothing short of ridiculous due to a really poor AI and clumsy animations that mostly resemble some 32-bit title, in short, nothing comparable to other productions of the genre, read Project Zero or Silent Hill 2. ~evil eye,...~ As we mentioned before, the production has decided to play it safe, taking advantage of the Renderware graphics engine and a gameplay that, as we have seen, relies on already seen clichs. In fact we will find ourselves wandering around museums and tombs in perfect Silent Hill style, through 3D backdrops with which we will very rarely be able to interact, except to open doors or collect some objects. The formula is the typical one that balances action and puzzles, a pity that in CTEOI the former is always rather boring and repetitive and the latter are rather simple. Furthermore, on many occasions the graphics engine shows some limits, and it would have been reasonable to expect more especially in the decidedly fluctuating realization of the textures of the game environments, which only appear to be of a good level in the final area. Even on the front of the management of light sources we are not in the presence of a masterpiece, so much so that in this respect the Wanadoo title can be easily compared to a first generation Xbox game. ~parsley and fennel!!!~ If the gameplay and look and feel failsenchant, in terms of audio CTEOI certainly does not excel, we often find ourselves listening to rather anonymous or in any case uninspired music which, alas, goes well with decidedly standard sound effects. In fact, the moments in which the audio sector manages to press the more ~tense~ phases of the game quite effectively are exceptions. A slightly different speech for the dubbing (in English) which instead stands on the sufficiency, even if not all the characters enjoy the same treatment, obviously good that of the protagonists, while decidedly subdued that of the supporting actors. Up to here it seems evident that CTEOI does not appear to be a masterpiece, but it must be said that probably, thanks to a certain charm inherent more than anything else in the historical period in which the plot takes shape and to the mystical atmospheres of ancient Egypt, Wanadoo's work succeeds however to convey some emotion. In this respect it should be added that completing the game does not help the final judgment, but it is clear that given the chronic lack of survival-horror on Xbox, a title that mixes, albeit with dubious results, what are the main characteristics of modern productions, however also highlighting the defects that are often found in many of these: lack of originality, obvious plot and poor longevity, just so as not to test the players' desire to continue in the game too much. ~parsley and fennel!!!~ Comment There isn't much to say, or maybe there would be too much to say, the fact is that CTEOI is certainly not a masterpiece and often falls into trivialities that only make the final judgment worse; a pity especially if we consider that at the base of the Wanadoo production there is a well-tested graphics engine that probably could have been better exploited. Furthermore, not even the nineteenth-century atmospheres and the clear references to ancient Egypt managed to bring out from the pile a production from which much better was expected. A game recommended only for those who show survival-horror withdrawal shivers or for those who can't stay away from everything related to ancient Egypt, definitely avoidable for those who ask for at least a little depth and a technical sector in an adventure at the height of the console it runs on. Pros: Ancient Egypt always has its charm It's a survival-horror and Xbox is scarce Discreet combat system Cons: Short and too repetitive Ancient Egypt is not enough to give depth Technical sector decidedly below average It is evident that the survival-horror genre on the Microsoft console does not have many exponents and even fewer are those worthy of note. Wanadoo has decided to remedy this gap with its new title. Course: the Eye of Isis (CTEOI from now on) is an adventure that seeks to gather the best from more famous productions (see Silent Hill or Resident Evil) and transport it to a nineteenth-century context, highlighting atmospheres that inevitably bring mind a few moments of another well-known production of the genre, I'm referring to that Eternal Darkness that so impressed some time ago on GameCube. Wanadoo has tried to raise the standards of the genre using a formula that should give certain results: tested graphics engine, gameplay that incorporates the standards of the genre and a bit of ancient Egypt; will all this be enough to create a valid game from all points of view? Well, the answer is not exactly positive, find out why by reading our review.", "date": "2004-04-02", "grade": null}
