{"name": "Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tales-of-the-world-radiant-mythology-recensione.html", "text": "Namco's ~Tales of~ saga is certainly one of the longest-running ever in the videogame field. Suffice it to say that the first title of this splendid series dates back to 1995, the year in which the historic progenitor was launched on Super Nintendo entitled Tales of Phantasia. Since then, as they say, a lot of water has passed under the bridge and the games marked with this ~brand~ have followed one another over the years from console to console, from success to success up to the present day, to the various Tales of the Abyss for PS2 or Tales of Phantasia: Full Voice for PSP, remake of the GBA title of the same name. Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology, unlike the latter, is instead the first game in the saga to be conceived specifically for the Sony laptop, a console which, thanks to the vast number of oriental role-playing games recently hosted, is starting to recover in terms of sales, as demonstrated by the recent data that see it in the lead in Japan among the best-selling consoles of the moment thanks to a title of the genre, Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII. The end of days Radiant Mythology starts, as a narrative concept, like most J-RPGs: a world on the verge of a catastrophe, an ~anti-hero~ hero ready to defend it against his will with the help of the most disparate creatures of the place, a long adventure fraught with obstacles and dangers. But there is something new, and an important one, which we will talk about shortly. For now let's focus on the plot, which sees the peaceful planet of Terresia, always protected by the gigantic ~World Tree~, a mystical plant clearly inspired, ideally, by what has always been distinctive of various Nordic European cultures, but also Hindu, in grave danger. The largest quantity of ~mana~ in the universe is kept in it, which is tempting for the terrible being known as ~The Devourer~ (such Widdershin of Gilgulim). He moves from dimension to dimension destroying every world he comes into contact with, such as Yaoon, whose only survivor, a feline-looking creature named Mormo, travels with him in an attempt to anticipate him by warning in time ~the Tree of Life~ of the new planet at risk, in order to make it generate a ~descender~, a hero capable of stopping the monster. That is you. And it is here that the important novelty we mentioned before emerges: through an excellent and complete editor, the player can create the protagonist of the adventure almost from scratch, deciding his gender, name, features, skin color, clothes, Job (however always editable) and even the voice. A customization worthy of the best PES which is one of the most interesting aspects of this title. Dungeon Crawler Alongside our virtual alter ego there will obviously be other characters who will form a party of heroes. These are (or will be) part of the group of adventurers called ~Ad Libitum~, to which the protagonist of the game will join in turn together with Kanonno, a young forgetful rebel militant in the resistance of Ailily, and Mormo, and which boasts among the owns some well-known faces already seen in other titles of the saga such as Luke and Tear from Tales of the Abyss, Chester Barklight and Arche Traine from Tales of Phantasia, Lloyd Irving, Kratos Aurion and Refill Sage from Tales of Symphonia, etc. The gameplay of Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology can be framed among the ~Dungeon Crawler~, or that type of role-playing game that bases a large part of its system on the exploration of dungeons and labyrinths, and on the completion of the ~Quests~ entrusted to the player and other party members. So usually there are some cities in which you can interact with different inhabitants in certain specific environments, refuel in shops, drop by the local tavern or enter people's homes to obtain further information of various kinds. And introduce yourself to the Guild, a crucial element of the whole game, where the gamer will usually receive the tasks to be carried out in one of the many dungeons that arise in Terresia. The missions available will be selectable from a list of five available, some detached from the main plot, others directly connected to it, and therefore highlighted by the blue color of the writing. Once the elements that will make up the party have been chosen, we move on to action. Small note: however, not all the characters will accept to be part of the team, and will perhaps respond with a ~no~ to the invitation. Much depends on factors such as their esteem for the protagonist or the answers he gave them during the exploratory phases and cut-scenes with dialogue. In the labyrinths of Terresia Once in a dungeon, the exploration and fighting phase begins. Questi, as per the latest trend also for Japanese RPGs, take place in real time and are not random. When you come into contact with a monster, the ~Flex Range Linear Motion Battle System~ is activated, which is none other than a three-dimensional evolution of the combat systems already implemented in the previous episodes of the series. In practice, this battle-system exploits the three-dimensionality of the arenas in which the clashes take place, allowing the player to make his character move freely, and therefore no longer in a straight line as in the old ~Tales of~, attacking, for example, an enemy even from behind or avoiding blows by running. During the battle it will be possible to directly control only one character (even if not the protagonist), while the other three will be entrusted to the CPU to which, however, ~indications~ can be given on the actions to be performed by individual party members through a special menu. For example, it is possible to make him attack a specific enemy, or to assign someone to heal wounded comrades, or even to establish how many special attacks a certain warrior will have to perform. The control system is simple and immediate: in fact, the player has at his disposal a wide range of actions available, which can be performed with three keys and the directional cross. In particular, two buttons are used for the Attack and Parry/Jump, and one, the Circle, for special attacks or ~Limbs~, which can be performed in combination with the DPad at the same time. Carrying out the right shots, a bar is loaded which, once full, allows the execution of an ~Overlimit~, a special move, that is, with devastating power which sometimes, depending on the evolution and personal parameters of the PC, can also be performed in combo with other team members. Graphics and sound At the end of the battle, in addition to the usual load of Exp points for the level-up, the team is rewarded with various Items, many of which, however, can also be discovered by exploring the areas in depth, perhaps helping in their search with the help of ice axes or other accessories. Some scavenged items can be ~processed~ into food or other items. Furthermore, many of these accessories can then be exchanged between PSP users thanks to the multiplayer mode, which in reality is limited only to this, given that the game remains in single player anyway. From a graphic point of view, the product has a simple but effective style, with fairly detailed anime-style characters, all in all well-kept 3D scenarios and bright colors. The only flaw perhaps in the limited view of certain environments, especially during the exploratory phases, whose horizon appears enveloped in a mist. On the other hand, the special effects are splendid, especially those linked to elemental magic, and the cut-scenes created in an ~anime-manga~ style, that is, with static images in which only the expression of the characters changes, and which present subtitled dialogues. For the latter we also have an English dubbing, or rather, we have it in the most important scenes, well made, with the historical ~voices~ of the various Pg present. The same quality that is found in the decidedly varied and very pleasant soundtrack. Perfect for any occasion or particular moment in history. Comment Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology is certainly not the best title in the Namco-Bandai saga. However, it is one of those that lets you play in a simple and fun way, and that's why you like it. It doesn't have the complexity of other products of the genre, even from the same series, but this game full of characters taken from the other ~Tales~, of missions, of interesting fights certainly does not disfigure in comparison with them, with the due differences. Not a masterpiece at all. Precisely because of its characteristics, however, it is recommended mainly for fans of the genre. Pros: Excellent longevity. Good characterization. Simple but fun. Cons: Dungeons could bore newbies in the long run. Few points to remember. No localization in Italian.", "date": "2007-10-26", "grade": null}
