There is nothing more annoying than discovering that a fantastic anti-aircraft gun is not able to be aimed at any location useful for passing a checkpoint, because it is not part of the solution designed to overcome a damned area . Only thanks to an angle studied with rare finesse of the mouse did I manage to eliminate two soldiers, who perhaps died of fright, since the shot hit a house and not them. In fact, when we mentioned a union between Commandos and Cannon Fodder, we didn't mean bizarre, stimulating and complicated puzzles, mixed with a healthy carnage that chases away thoughts: unfortunately, there is little room for improvisation here and the arcade component is affected by uncertain controls and cumbersome. Furthermore, choosing to play the maps in tactical mode does not change the nature of the general experience: you will gain a rather coarse fog of war effect and a higher mortality rate (in the ranks of yours, of course). A dirty chore Basically, the entire game architecture suffers from too rigid a design. Most of the time you will be driven from one event to another on the map with no real time limit. In spite of the pyrotechnic explosions that often accompany the presentation of a hot zone, indeed very spectacular, just wait for the smoke to clear and you will notice that you can safely wait behind a wall, while the opposing troops wait patiently, repeating at best a pattern default. Let's realize that there are three campaigns available (but yes, it's them: Russians, Allies and cruel Nazis) and very rarely will you feel any urgency outside of the actual fights, which are the strong point of Faces of War. In this sense, the definition of RTS almost falls. In fact, it happened to hear me repeat that the reinforcements would arrive shortly, ~less and less time~, ~hold on soldier~ and so on, while in reality only after having made a clean sweep did they show up on board carts with trumpets and sequins, just in time to close the level and collect applause. You could also venture into areas not yet explored, but this doesn't mean you have to imagine yourself taking part in unscheduled creative actions: if you break the resistance in the north when the radio tower in the south comes first in the lineup, nothing changes in the economy of the map. basically it's the entire game architecture that suffers from too rigid a design A dirty chore We now come to the AI, because if it were at least adequate you could still enjoy the need to quickly develop winning strategies, while both the enemy and your allies seem to lack imagination. They don't even try to shut you down or send the armored vehicles forward towards the point where they are losing men like ants pounded in the grass; if the armored car has to fire from the square, that's where it will stay and it doesn't matter if the allies of the computer-controlled team remain motionless or pretend to aim while you are busy elsewhere. There was a moment when I was busy cleaning out a house, messing around with the incomprehensible view given to me by the camera, while near a bunker in the distance it seemed that the Horsemen of the Apocalypse were about to make their appearance. For the sake of scruple I therefore went to take a look with the cursor and look who I find? My boys busy unloading crates of ammunition without killing a soldier. Things are no better in team management, having to deal with the upper hand of the CPU, which occasionally bypasses your orders, giving the user a bad feeling of not really playing. A dirty chore But there is something good despite everything and it is what saves Faces of War from the abyss of irremediable mediocrity and it is the direct control of a soldier of your choice from your team (one at a time in short). In fact, with a key it is possible to permanently activate this mode, giving you the possibility to move with the arrow keys, while aiming with the mouse. The fun lies in the fact that you can also let all those poor men of the team die and finish the level with one man alone, having however the foresight to leave the aim with certain weapons to the computer, managing, who knows how, to immediately hit the target , especially with automatic weapons, which are by definition less accurate. Burning lapilli Aestheticallyand Faces of War defends itself well, but all the attention paid to detail does not coincide with credible game physics: a cannon shot designed to sink a ship ~must~ bring down a wall. Otherwise that finely embroidered ivy around the windows ends up looking like fresh paint, as if we were in front of a battle of toy soldiers in the courtyard outside Grandma's house in the mountains (um... you know what I mean right?). Unfortunately, the temptation to fill the scenario with any possible and imaginable element loses grip when you realize that the camera has to be constantly adjusted manually, with a great waste of time, especially if you decide to take the reins of the controls yourself. with Company of Heroes upon us, it is better to let the THQ title enter the house Beyond some very believable effects, even the audio remains something flat and devoid of three-dimensional depth, while some multiplayer choices prove to be successful: being able to cooperate with other players is fun and the dose of direct action remains very high even in the more traditional ways. We also point out a competition which consists in decimating unsuspecting farmers to win the greatest number of chickens collected in the sack (the army must also eat and in times of war bakers are scarce). Not to be contradicted, even in multiplayer mode something afflicts the game and it is a lag too present to be ignored, but if you've already gotten there it means that you've become accustomed to the Faces of War bugs. It's a shame anyway, if Ubisoft had believed in it a little more they would have had a good title in their hands while thus, with Company of Heroes at the door, it's better to let the THQ title enter the house. Final comment There is a lot of action and many enemies who will receive a medal of valor pinned on the coffin in this Faces of War, as well as some good ideas such as direct control over soldiers. Unfortunately not much progress is appreciated, because the rest is all reduced to a sequence of events triggered by scripts already designed so as not to undergo changes. Ah of course I forgot, there are also several bugs and an artificial AI in the way, imprecise controls and an ever-present lag in multiplayer mode. Much more could have been done and indeed it had to be done, otherwise why would you ever want Faces of War instead of a freshly published Company of Heroes? Let's put it this way, if you should have withdrawal crises following the abuse of the Relic title, take a look at Faces of War, you could spend a few carefree hours. Pros Hordes of enemies Direct control over soldiers Challenging multiplayer modes Cons Too stiff level game design Unresponsive and imprecise controls Annoying bugs accompanied by heavy lag in multiplayer The sacrifice of a few for the good of the many On the part of many developers there is a desire to produce at least one sequel to their games, not always for market needs, but often also to be able to insert ideas that have not found a place in the original subject. From this point of view Faces of War looks more like an unfinished or prematurely closed project, when compared with its successful predecessor Soldiers: Heroes of WWII. To appreciate it, you have to read between the lines of the code, beyond the gray areas of bugs and design errors, beyond which the Ubisoft title undoubtedly remains enjoyable. If there weren't Company of Heroes to play the part of the white elephant inside the room, the judgment on Faces of War could enjoy greater flexibility, but according to the current level of RTS based on the European theater of the Great War it is reasonable to expect standards much higher. The good thing is that you can forget any problem related to resource management or the longed-for reinforcements, since each level has its own automatic triggers that trigger the established events, essentially leaving you dealing with a river of blood. We add a style of play in which Commandos meets Cannon Fodder and the recipe would also begin to get interesting, if it weren't for the weaknesses that already from the tutorial dampen the enthusiasm a lot. Although the missions can be broken down into a series of strategic checkpoints to be tackled with different tactics, the game design suffers from a silly rigidity that forces the player along a well-defined trajectory which basically cannot be ignored, provided you don't want to face almost unmanageable hordes of additional enemies. If you can see the Ubisoft title as a pleasant battle of heroic actions displaced in the final phase of the conflict, a period that is, by the way, little considered, then you will certainly take full advantage of Faces ofWar.", "date": "2006-10-04", "grade": null}
