The story is almost completely narrated and takes place in the Middle East, a factor that helps to elevate the sense of realism, due to the latest world events in which the game virtually takes part. The developers of the game have based the whole game on trying to create the real atmosphere of a fight in the middle of the enemy front, and give you the feeling of being a real military in full guerrilla zone besieged by enemies everywhere. Although the game setting and the controls are easy, intuitive, full-fledged Arcade to be clear, the gameplay does not fail to amaze for the quantity and quality of the actions that can be performed. The same variety of environments is noteworthy as we will find ourselves rounding up enemies from the smallest city in the Middle East, in the African jungles to the Siberian ice, in some infiltration missions in full stealth game style. While on the one hand the merit of the Zombie developers is commendable for wanting to create varied settings ranging from closed levels to very open ones, it is equally true that the game action is typically from a first person shooter: that is, quite repetitive. We shoot, we cover ourselves, we boast. And so on. Not that doing it doesn't give satisfaction, quite the contrary. But Shadow Ops certainly doesn't try to deviate from most of the classic First person shooters out there and doesn't find its own original game dimension, resulting in a bit repetitive. being a Marines is fun...in a game As mentioned earlier, the control system is handy and easily tamed. The classic trigger opens fire, giving, combined with a good vibration response, a particular satisfaction in unloading the magazine on dozens of angry enemies. The white key can be particularly useful in situations of chaos, releasing a grenade that will explode with brute force on our enemies on the field. The idea of the left lever is nice: by approaching a wall and pressing it, we could lean out just enough to look at who is beyond it and shoot, in Headhunter or MGS style, if you prefer. Precisely for this particularity, the level design has been well studied in order to be able to exploit every nook and cranny, decaying wall or car left on the streets of the city and take shelter behind them by exploiting the spaces properly. The suicidal action, in Shadow Ops, does not lead to any result. Jumping into the fray by shooting everything that moves and screams will lead to certain death in seconds. For this reason it is always a good thing to remember to have this good L key available. The availability of weapons is very vast and worthily competes with any modern shooter on the market today, fully satisfying our desire for destruction. The whole construction of the game seems to have been studied to increase the spectacularity of the game to the maximum levels. Each level is introduced by good cut-scenes directorically speaking commendable and of sure emotional impact for the aspiring Marines which we are. Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse, Long Live Mickey Mouse! For once, let's start talking about the technical realization of a game by examining the audio sector, rather than the graphic one. It seems that in the Zombie studios no expense has been spared to create a soundtrack that is also Hollywood-style. The emphasis of the best scenes is underlined by inspired and adrenaline-pumping music, all certified with a powerful Dolby Digital THX. The sound effects are top notch. With a good audio system the explosions are tremendously real and palpable. The dubbing is beautiful, with voices, screams and shouts of incitement everywhere. Your teammates will call to you, scream for help, yell at enemies, and coordinate their team actions. Even the enemies will make themselves heard, with purely Middle Eastern shouts. On Xbox, perhaps only a game like Halo can compete with the high degree of sonic realism achieved by Shadow Ops. Furthermore, this factor greatly increases playability as the enemies will not always be easily visible to the eye, often being hidden on balconies or terraces, and by perceiving the direction from which the shots come, it will be possible to identify the hostile enemy more easily. It is no coincidence that we have reserved the graphics sector for the finale. The polygonal power of Zombie's graphics engine is certainly not impressive, settling on average levels for mid-range PCs. Excellent brilliance of the image and definition of the same, even if purtoo much the framerate does not stand out for particular fluidity and constancy. Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse, Long Live Mickey Mouse! Even the on-screen characters, while numerous, are not artfully modeled. The animations are better, very varied, fluid and natural. For example, the very beautiful one of the snipers stationed on some balcony who, once killed, let themselves fall dead weight on the lower floor. The quality of the textures is good, excellent choice of colors used, yellow ocher in Middle Eastern environments, green in the jungles, white in the cold polar ones. Excellent brilliance of the image and definition of the same, even if unfortunately the framerate is not distinguished by particular fluidity and constancy. In the most chaotic situations certain declines will be evident. Although not particularly annoying, surely the developers had the possibility to optimize the graphics engine and eliminate them permanently. Comment Shadow Ops is a well-packaged product, which focuses heavily on some aspects such as the amazing Hollywood-style audio sector and the cinematic plot. Shadow Ops is also a fun game in its linearity, realistic but arcade-style, perhaps not very well balanced with some too frustrating and repetitive passages. Not as good from a graphic point of view, Shadow Ops is lost in a certain visual flatness with numerous drops in framerate and animations that are not always perfect. If it is also true that on the other hand preciously chosen and excellently colored textures stand out, the general effect does not go beyond sufficiency. With titles around the likes of Rainbow Six 3, Shadow Ops gets lost in the chaos of FPS available on Xbox, failing to offer anything truly original in its gameplay. Recommended for fans of the genre and for players with Xbox Live. Pros: Audio at the highest levels possible Multiplayer and Xbox Live! Great variety of war scenarios Cons: Technical realization not at the highest levels Shooter certainly not original Guerilla in Multiplayer In Shadow Ops there is the cooperative mode via Split Screen and via Link with 10 specially created game levels. Although not particularly innovative, it is still a good game option, in case there are friends nearby. Even better is the multiplayer option via Xbox Live which allows you to participate in guerrilla action together with 7 other players. Deathmatch and Capture the Flag complete the picture of available options. Not bad, even if with games like Rainbow Six 3 around, everything takes on the vague flavor of a valid substitute. Heroes are born in firefights Ideal sequel to the ~Spec Ops~ that made no one cry for a miracle, the Zombie developers try it again on Xbox with this Shadow Ops: Red Mercury. Thought out big, in the intentions of the producers there is a Hollywood-style game, starting from the typically military story, passing through a first-class audio-video sector, at least in expectations. We are therefore faced with a product steeped in guerrilla scenes in full Rambesco style, with screaming Marines, furious fight scenes and patriotic cut-scenes. ~Heroes are born in gunfights,~ reads an entry at the bottom of the back cover. If the face-to-face confrontation with the enemy is what you are looking for, never a game was more suitable than this: Shadow Ops catapults you directly into the enemy fire, without much compliments.", "date": "2004-07-02", "grade": null}
