Zombie Highway, released in 2010, was certainly part of the first category, offering an interesting variation on the theme of endless runners that can be used for free without having to submit to excessively stringent limitations. Now the developers of Auxbrain have decided to give the franchise a new hand with this second chapter: let's see what has changed over the past four years... Hands off the car Not much, actually: far from wanting to overturn the formula of its predecessor, Zombie Highway 2 limits itself to enriching it with some new additions, but without exaggerating. Anyone who has had the opportunity to play the first chapter will therefore immediately feel comfortable with a product that starts from the exact same premises: the user controls a car with the aim of going as far as possible avoiding crashing into the obstacles of which the road is littered and above all by chasing away the zombies who manage to cling to the sides of the car. The undead that populate the apocalyptic game world must be avoided or run over at full speed, while there are three main ways to eliminate those who manage to jump on the vehicle: you can crawl against an element of the scenery to literally scrape them off or use the nitro to make them let go due to the high speed or still resort to the weapon supplied and shoot a nice bullet in the face. Zombie Highway 2 performs all these functions through a simple and immediate control system, with the car accelerating automatically (after all, it is still an endless runner), the steering managed by the device's gyroscope, a virtual key to the use of the nitro and the indicators that appear near the enemies clinging to the car, by pressing which you shoot at that specific monster. Everything works properly, even if in the long run there is a lack of a more precise alternative to control the vehicle, given that tilting the smartphone does not always guarantee great reliability, especially in the most agitated situations. Zombie Highway 2 is a good title, with solid gameplay and an honest monetization system Like all games belonging to its same category, Zombie Highway 2 is a title that makes repetitiveness its mantra, encouraging the user to try and try again the mad race towards salvation by always offering him new objectives and rewarding him with virtual money for each attempt. The money earned can be spent to improve the vehicle and the weapon supplied or to buy new ones: and even if there is the infamous double currency system (with dollars to be earned by playing and gold coins to be bought with credit card), the game still allows those who wish to continue without spending a penny, provided of course that they work a little harder to get the much-needed upgrades. A fundamental honesty that also transpires from another element: in the event of a game over, the possibility is in fact granted to rewind time for a handful of seconds and make one last attempt, all by spending a gold coin or agreeing to watch the commercial of an advertising partner. Beyond a balanced free to play model as God commands, Zombie Highway 2 is appreciable above all for its intrinsic technical and playful qualities. From a graphic point of view, Auxbrain's work is certainly commendable, with well-crafted cars, detailed scenarios and a solid frame rate, all surrounded by a complete interface and a clean and elegant design. The game is also fun in its simplicity, and a certain care on the part of the developers can still be seen in an attempt to keep the action varied, with the scenario changing frequently and above all with zombies with variable characteristics that must be eliminated using different strategies. On the front of the less positive notes, it must be said that very little changes compared to the predecessor, so those who expected a second chapter full of news could be disappointed.", "date": "2014-10-22", "grade": "8.0"}
