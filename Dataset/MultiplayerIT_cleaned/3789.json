{"name": "Guildmaster Story", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guildmaster-story-la-recensione.html", "text": "For some time now, puzzle games have become stories. Probably feeling the need to distinguish themselves from each other and to untie themselves from the standardizations that were beginning to be oppressive, those that were once games guided by the simple search for the high score without any pretension to tell something significant have become strange chimeras. We then saw hybrid puzzles linking the association of colors to the outcome of epic battles against dragons, to the collection of fantastic creatures or even to the conquest of more or less undressed maidens. Guildmaster Story belongs to this group of puzzles that alternate the purely playful phases with the telling of a story, adopting a rather simple solution compared to the more complex articulations of other games with a composite soul, as we see in this review. In this case we are not dealing with RPG-style character management or with the capture of monsters to train and deploy in battle while putting the colored bricks together: Guildmaster Story in comparison has a much more linear structure, limiting itself to proposing a sort of long story interspersed with puzzle sections, which aren't even that much integrated into the world represented within the narrative component. This simplicity is justified with humor, which pervades the whole game and makes it almost natural to solve Ganyo's existential problems by associating blocks by colour, trying to make the pre-set number disappear within the range of time and moves allowed. The parable of the protagonist, who as a rich scion of a good family, essentially inept and selfish, finds himself having to survive with his ingenuity and make his way in the wild world of creative finance to get back on the saddle, is punctuated by continuous jokes and paradoxical situations that they stage a veritable parody of modern life, capitalist society and the very free-to-play mechanics on which the game is based. Life is made of colored bricks What is most striking, in Guildmaster Story, is the quality of the writing, unfortunately proposed for the moment only in English. Ganyo's monologues and dialogues with the unlikely NPCs represent some of the most brilliant texts that can happen to read in the world of video games, demonstrating how the developer Will O'Neill has undoubted qualities as a playwright. Although the level is not always very high, the simple story of the protagonist's fall and personal redemption (if it can be defined as such) is truly a pleasure to follow, reviewing several distortions of modern society as well as of the videogame market itself, while fully participating in it this being a free-to-play with micro-transactions. Self-referential humor is obviously the backbone of the whole game, which takes on the appearance of a sort of mobile meta-game where the puzzle pieces, precisely in their being completely disconnected from context, make perfect sense. The problem - and this is not a joke intended by the developer, or so we believe - lies precisely in these puzzle phases, which offer simple and unoriginal mechanics, with an aspect of randomness which in the more advanced levels often forces game over and steers towards micro-transactions due to the expectations introduced by the depleted energy system. The mechanism is the classic one of color association, with chromatic blocks falling on a grid. When two or more of these, of the same color, find themselves side by side it is possible to make them disappear simply by touching them and the aim is to try to eliminate certain quantities of blocks of certain types in a pre-established number of moves or within a certain amount of time. In short, the puzzle component does not particularly shine with originality or inventiveness in Guildmaster Story and turns out to be a simple moment of playful interaction between one episode and another of Ganyo's story, which instead immediately emerges as the true pillar of the entire game. The linearity of the whole structure, which continues to alternate the puzzle phases with the simple narration, without further aspects to check or choices to make, makes the whole thing a sort of little interactive story with digressions from a basic puzzle, although always quite enjoyable. We are therefore quite far from the more complex applications of the hybrid puzzle, also because Guildmaster Story obviously wants to offer a type of entertainment that is fundamentally different from Puzzle Quest or even Puzzle & Dragons.", "date": "2019-02-28", "grade": "7.5"}
