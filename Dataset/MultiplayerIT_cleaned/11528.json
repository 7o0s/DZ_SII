In a nutshell, the digital distribution platform created by Microsoft for its Xbox 360 has been bringing new life and vitality to a market that is too stale in its endless re-propositions, remakes and sequels for the past few years. The scrolling shooter genre, in particular, has benefited from the ~new renaissance~ underway on Live Arcade: low prices, fun games, achievements to unlock and a second youth sustained and reinvigorated by a large group of nostalgics and enthusiasts who do not want believe in the final disappearance of shoot'em ups. The Japanese Warashi, former developer of Shienryu on Sega Saturn, has noticed this new public interest and has ridden the wave by proposing a high definition version of its arcade game Trigger Heart Exelica, which only a few years ago had appeared on the late Dreamcast with a very good conversion from Naomi card. Weapons and hook Trigger Heart Exelica is a vertical scrolling shooter made entirely in three-dimensional graphics, with a very classic concept, the overused clich of shuttles, powerups and end-of-level bosses common to all titles of this genre. The long-standing audience doesn't have to learn anything, as soon as the pad is touched the sense of familiarity is such that we feel a strong deja vu. The gameplay winds through just five levels, all of which are short in length but filled with enemies and bosses at every turn, including some mid-level ones. The game portion is restricted to the central field of the screen, thus recreating the exact proportions of the arcade original, while the two vertical bands on the sides offer the player a theme taken directly from the cabinet. As already happened to the home versions of many vertical shooters, for example Ikaruga, Trigger Heart Exelica also has an option to rotate the view horizontally, thus adapting the image to full screen. Although it is difficult to move the new LCD TVs in that position, this mode remains useful for anyone who plays games lying on a sofa or in bed (or for those who have a PC monitor with sensors that recognize the orientation of the panel). Warashi's game is canonical and very stereotyped, but it also enjoys some small innovations that make it attractive and in a certain sense fresh. By pressing the B key we activate the hook, a sort of anchor that manages to imprison the enemies on the screen to be able to use them to our advantage. Once a spaceship is hooked, it can be rotated using it as a real attack weapon, or it can be held in front of us as a shield. The larger the ~caught~ enemy, the longer it takes to complete the lock. Another of its functions is to convey our laser focus towards a precise point or a particularly difficult ship. There are two weapons, however, each in the hand of one of the selectable characters (two young girls). The former fires in all directions, but is less powerful, the latter the exact opposite. Variable Boss Attack System and technical realization The title has a particular ~dynamic difficulty~ which varies constantly according to the skill of the player. In practice, an AI checks the game statistics in real time, such as the percentage of fire hits, the number of bonuses taken, the time taken to defeat enemies and so on, and adapts the challenge based on the values obtained. The concept is relatively innovative and is called V.B.A.S. (Variable Boss Attack System): It was first implemented in the old shooter Zanac by Compile, released on NES and Msx. However, Trigger Heart Exelica is a very predictable shoot'em up, with enemies, bosses and weapons (with the exception of the hook) that are all too anonymous and not very characteristic. In spite of the general style of the game, which clearly draws inspiration from the world of anime and manga, the structure itself is exaggeratedly similar to a thousand other exponents of the same genre. Enemy spaceships, end-of-level bosses, structures and general design are barely sketched, and the use of polygons (few) has been exploited decidedly without inspiration. The two protagonists, on the other hand, are well designed and modeled, representing manga icons covered in a sort of enhanced exoskeleton. The two protagonists are well designed and built, representing manga icons covered in a sort of enhanced exoskeleton Variable Boss Attack System and technical realization Trigger Heart Exelica suffers from the years it carries on its shoulders, and the stThe simple and colorful Japanese comic book didn't help to exploit the potential of the old Naomi card, from which this Xbox Live Arcade version is a direct conversion. Already at the time you could count on quite different graphics, such as what was seen in Psyvariar 2 and Under Defeat. The novelties of this transposition are not many: first of all the conversion in high definition, as already happened to SEGA's Rez HD. The background music was then remixed and modified, to make it more modern and captivating, an operation that failed, among other things, as the whole audio sector suffers from a general tediousness, repetitiveness and lack of inspiration. The sounds are from the 80s, and the audio potential would be similar to that of an old Amiga game. The effects of fire and explosions themselves are very bad, certainly more could have been done. The Live Arcade version of T.H.E. enjoys an online ranking with scores linked to the various levels (as already seen for example on Omega Five), a factor that greatly increases challenge, longevity and replayability, but like its descendants Arcade and Dreamcast it lacks a two-player mode, especially through the excellent online service of Live. Comment Trigger Heart Exelica is a game that will delight many users of the ~old guard~, nostalgic in search of videogames with classic concepts now in danger of extinction, who are reliving a second youth on the Live Arcade. The Warashi title is canonical and not very innovative, but for fans this could be a positive factor. Enjoy the new HD graphics and online leaderboards. Much more could have been done on the audio side, perhaps by recompiling the soundtrack from the outdated 80s electropop style from scratch. The technical realization suffers a bit from the years that the original carries on its shoulders, and considering that even at the time it came out it wasn't the best, today it is even more outdated. Trigger Heart Exelica is still a welcome surprise in the Live Arcade panorama that we would like to recommend to true fans of scrolling shoot'em ups. Pros A classic shooter HD graphics and online leaderboards The peculiar use of the hook Cons Lack of two player and online options Dated graphics Repetitive and uninspired audio Xbox 360 - Goals Like any game on the Live Arcade, Trigger Heart Exelica is also giving away the canonical 200 points to unlock. By completing the story mode with each of the two characters, the first two objectives are obtained, the others are decidedly more difficult and are linked to the discovery of some secrets and the achievement of certain score thresholds, not easy to obtain in the first games. It will take perseverance and a lot of practice.", "date": "2008-03-28", "grade": null}
