{"name": "Sonic Mega Collection Plus : Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-mega-collection-plus-recensione.html", "text": "A tasty retro game Retrogaming is defined as the practice that sees us playing with past generation titles, technically now obsolete, overplayed, overplayed but always present in our hearts as enthusiasts. Perhaps someone thinks that the games of the past have kept a certain ~magic~, a certain feeling that modern video games are rarely able to give nowadays. ~It was better when it was worse~, some say, and surely this Sonic Mega Collection Plus could make you think a lot. The practice of retro gaming thus becomes frequent among longtime players, often romantics and dreamers. Surely among all those who have kept a childish and carefree part that leads them to look more at substance than at appearances. Of course these days the older 8 and 16 bit Sonics can no longer impress the young eye. ..Someone perhaps thinks that the games of the past have kept a certain ~magic~, a certain feeling that modern videogames are rarely able to give nowadays A tasty retro game They can perhaps move or excite those who experienced those games firsthand at the time of their first release. For this reason, evaluating such a heterogeneous set of titles objectively during the review is practically impossible without taking into account who actually uses them. Although more than ten years have passed, the first Sonics for Megadrive, reproposed today, are extremely fresh, colorful and fast, as per the good tradition of the Sonic saga teaches us. There are no differences between the PlayStation2 and Xbox versions, practically impossible to distinguish one from the other, they are identical both in appearance and in the playful and extra-playful contents. Some might then note that, apart from the recent ~Heroes~, this is the first official appearance of Sonic, with his own adventure, on a Sony and Microsoft console. And who would have thought that a few years ago. The complete list of games Sonic The Hedgehog (Sega Megadrive) Sonic The Hedgehog 2 (Sega Megadrive) Sonic The Hedgehog 3 (Sega Megadrive) Sonic & Knuckles (Sega Megadrive) Sonic 3D Blast (Sega Genesis, Saturn) Sonic The Hedgehog Spinball (Sega Megadrive) Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (Sega Megadrive) Sonic & Knuckles lock-on: Sonic The Hedgehog 2 Sonic & Knuckles lock-on: Sonic The Hedgehog 3 Sonic & Knuckles lock-on: Blue Spheres The Ooze (Sega Megadrive) Comix Zone (Sega Megadrive) Flicky (Sega Megadrive) Ristar (Sega Megadrive) Sonic the Hedgehog (Game Gear) Sonic Chaos (Game Gear) Sonic Drift (Game Gear) Sonic Labyrinth (Game Gear) Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (Game Gear) Sonic Blast (Game Gear ) A great museum piece Considering that the GameGear versions of Sonic were designed to be viewed on a small screen a few inches wide, the display on a modern TV could only be mediocre. The sprites, drawn at the time, today appear grainy on a 29-inch flat screen, and it couldn't have been otherwise. The colors are also slightly dull and faded. Despite this, the situation could certainly have been more dramatic. In reality, all Sonics let themselves be played with pleasure. Above all those of the Sega Megadrive, which are in all respects identical to the originals. Scrolling speed, colors and sprites are unaffected by the emulation. ..Sonic's tunes remain inside and whoever still remembers them, i.e. anyone who has already played them, can only enjoy them with every listen A great museum piece The audio sector, top-notch at the time, is today a little too ~croaky~ and simple. But Sonic's tunes remain inside and those who still remember them, that is anyone who has already played them, can only enjoy them every time they listen, regardless of the audio quality. The new Xbox and PlayStation2 pad controls perform very well, especially the latter's dualshock. Its directional cross, positioned in a more comfortable point than that of the Xbox, seems more appropriate to take advantage of titles in two dimensions. Matter of feeling Sonic's gameplay is nowadays universally recognized and known by those who follow video games at a minimum. Very fast scrolling, tight action and a well-kept level design are the strong point of the blue mascot of the SEGA house. Colorful graphics and captivating ingredients. Catchy and legendary music the juicy side dish. As already mentioned before, the judgment for such an ~elderly~ title (let's bring respect to Sonic) is incredibly subjective. A must-have for all SEGA fans, for nostalgics, for collectors or for those who simply want to replay all the Sonic chapters in the series or if they missed this onesomeone on the street. For those who have never played it, certainly a collection that makes up for the serious lack in a definitive way, but the new generations may not like the two-dimensional graphics and the now outdated technical aspect of these games. For this reason, the ~feeling~, the sentiment one feels for videogames in general or for Sonic in particular, should make everyone decide on a possible purchase. Even the final score, therefore, will take into account a summary average between a very high value, close to a masterpiece, and the inflation that Sonic has today on 128bit machines. Comment Sonic Mega Collection Plus is a beautiful picture from the past. A past for some never forgotten, for others never known. However, it is worthwhile for everyone to (re)experience certain beautiful emotions that only a ~Sonic~ platformer can give. Frantic, wacky, colorful and beautiful, today we look at Sonic with a feeling somewhere between nostalgia and amazement as we remember what a Megadrive (and a GameGear) could offer so many years ago. Hot purchase for all of us fans of ~mother~ SEGA, for those who have missed just one chapter of the long saga or for those who want to access any Sonic game in a single very convenient disc. Pro gameplay always fresh and fun definitive collection on Sonic will take some time to finish them all Cons technically dated useless for those who already own them And here he is back once again on our television screens. The fastest hedgehog in the world does it with one of the most delicious and complete collections ever to appear on consoles. All his most illustrious chapters, from the 8bit of the SEGA GameGear to the 16 of the Megadrive, collected in a single disc. Removing only the latest 3D chapters, released years ago for the Dreamcast and recently on the GameCube, we are faced with a practically complete list of Sonic's gaming universe. The ~Plus~ added at the end of the title is amply justified. Compared to the first Collection released on 128bit Nintendo, many other games have been included, and this time the collection can be considered truly ~definitive~ for fans of this famous 90s platform. Let's go and specifically inspect this ~Sonic Mega Collection Plus~, out for Xbox and PlayStation2 in these weeks.", "date": "2004-12-20", "grade": null}
