{"name": "Rule of Rose", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rule-of-rose.html", "text": "Haunting Ground... The gameplay is the usual proposed in any traditional survival horror. The player takes the role of helpless Jennifer and guides her through the various scenarios in an attempt to progress through the story, collecting items and clues, solving puzzles, escaping from attackers or confronting and killing them. Even the very structure of the sequences in which he will move within the environments to be explored maintains a ~classic~ component, indeed, in some ways perhaps a little higher than the average, given that overall the title flows away in a rather linear way. In fact, there isn't much freedom of movement (but by now it's almost the rule in this generation of survival), and often you will find yourself moving within a path forced by events, as at the beginning of the adventure, when you will have to follow the boy who gave us the book throughout the orphanage and if you try to go in other directions you will find yourself in front of doors that are barred or closed by some nasty little girl. The situation improves slightly further on, but not by much. To confirm its traditional being in the schemes, which in any case is not said to be a limit, Rule of Rose proposes an element already seen in Hounting Ground, namely a dog as adventure companion and bodyguard. The little beast, named Brown, after being freed will become our inseparable travel companion, often guiding us in the most difficult points in which to navigate, finding hidden rare objects for us and defending ourselves from enemy attacks. In these situations, the game instead shows a slightly more ~innovative~ aspect (so to speak, given that we also find this detail in part in the aforementioned Haunting Ground). Jennifer, in fact, is certainly not the Jill Valentine of Resident Evil or the reckless Lara Croft of Tomb Raider, but a normal girl catapulted into a waking nightmare. Therefore, terrified, she is clumsy when faced with an opponent with weapons in hand. Which can be frustrating for some (especially if you consider that sometimes a couple of hits to the enemy on duty are enough to knock us down), for others it is quite realistic. How can you kill a child? The strength of Rule of Rose remains, in our opinion, the adult and at times disturbing plot. She is the pivot on which the whole game revolves. Set in 1930s London, the title developed by Punchline can be defined as a psycho-thriller, in which the young protagonist, 19-year-old Jennifer, whose parents died in a tragic plane crash, is welcomed into an orphanage in the remote English countryside . On the bus to her new home, she receives a hand-drawn storybook titled ~The Little Princess~ from a mysterious boy. As per the tradition of themed films, the girl thinks it best to chase the little one who in the meantime has gone downstairs in a hurry. Shortly thereafter, lost in the misty moor, Jennifer finds herself in front of a dilapidated Victorian manor... The Rose Garden. Here something horrendous has happened not only in the twisted minds of some little girls who apparently seem to be ~the landladies~. They are the devious Diana, who calls herself the ~Duchess~, the perfidious and cunning Meg (the ~Countess~) and the stupid and sadistic Amanda (the ~Baroness~), ~inspired~ in their conduct by those who themselves define ~the red commandments~, which capture Jennifer and become her tormentors. What is the secret of the Rose Garden, where are the adults, what unspeakable happened in that place? Mysteries, questions that the protagonist will have to find answers to in an attempt to escape from that horror, before madness and terror take over. Rule of Rose plays on these ancestral fears, on Lovecraftian atmospheres, on the horror generated by the monsters of the human psyche, with a wink to films such as ~Suspiria~ by Dario Argento (the dark and terrifying college), to ~Grano red blood~, and ~How can you kill a child~ by Narciso Ibez Serrador (the little ones who become executioners) to seduce the video gamer and involve him in a game in which, as mentioned, he will not have to face hordes of monstrous creatures, but reason, ponder and untangle plot threads to overcome obstacles consisting of puzzles and situations where often nothing is as it seems. disturbing effect If the basic technique of the gameplay of Rule Of Rose can therefore be defined as ~classic~, for the genre, the same thing can easily be said about the graphics. From this point of view, the game does not differ from the qualitative average of its other more illustrious ~colleagues~: the various characters are formed by a fair number of polygons and covered with well-made textures, while the environments in general appear sstylistically a little repetitive in some situations and less cared for than Jennifer and Co. It should be noted, as if the programmers wanted to pay homage to the Konami title as well as exploit its advantages, deriving from the artifact, an optional filter on the model of the one seen in Silent Hill 2 , which coats the screen and images with a certain graininess. In addition to giving an even more gloomy effect to the events, this filter appears as a visual ploy to mask the poverty of detail of some of those environments that we mentioned earlier. In our opinion, the audio sector seems more interesting. In addition to the music curated by the same author of the soundtracks of Skies Of Arcadia and Panzer Dragoon Orta, Yutaka Minobe, really atmospheric with his solo strings, to underline the discreet English dubbing and, above all, the little voices, the giggles nervous and shrill, often creepy, of the girls, who accompany the gamer several times during the exploration of certain environments, arousing in him, especially if he has a special stereo system connected to the Ps2 or the TV, a continuous feeling of imminent danger and anxiety. Conclusions Rule Of Rose is one of those hard to rate games. If we focused on the purely technical aspect, the game would risk being given a fairly low score, given some programming defects and a certain linearity in the unfolding of the adventure. But a game, as we know, shouldn't be evaluated only for this. The plot, based on strong, unusual themes, undoubtedly not ~every day~ in the videogame world, is one of the most intriguing experienced by a videogame. The very atmosphere of the game is captivating, it pushes you to play, to see what happens to Jennifer, what lies behind certain situations or murders. Elements, these, that can give strength to a title more than anything else. There are games destined to leave their mark regardless of the intrinsic quality of its production, Rule of Rose seems to be one of them, even for indirect merits. It's not for everyone, so try before you buy. Pros: Adult and engaging storyline. Atmospheric sound compartment. Cons: Combat system to be reviewed. Sometimes frustrating save system. Fairly straightforward adventure. It has aroused much controversy, articles in the main national and non-national newspapers and weeklies, parliamentary questions, attempts at censorship and even the proposal to set up a special supervisory commission, unleashing the usual anti-videogames movement which at more or less regular periods returns to hear from our side. Rule Of Rose risked, risks becoming the scapegoat for all the evils in the world. Reason? The plot seasoned with strong themes, of those that sometimes, when we hear them on the news, push us to turn our heads away because they are too difficult to accept, and the features, the faces of those who are the bad guys in the game. Rule Of Rose has a peculiarity: the ~enemies~, the monsters to face, to defend against, are not the classic ghosts, zombies or creatures of unknown origin, but sadistic, cruel, ~normal~ children. And this can be scarier... A little personal consideration from the author of this article. That a video game, a film, anything that tells about certain themes can divert, disturb the mind of a young person to the point of leading him to more or less violent forms of imitation, I think is pure and simple demagoguery. Science fiction. Because a person who lets himself be influenced by something like this must have problems of his own. Problems that cannot be found in the contents of certain products (which, it is true, should if anything be prohibited for minors, monitored. But not censored) but rather in the psyche of the individual or in the education received. To think that the crisis of values into which many young people seem to have fallen and which is gripping the West is attributable to TV, violent video games or who knows what other factor, is the most specious and sanctimonious one can say. If young people rape a girl of their own age, if others cowardly beat a classmate, it is not the fault of the products mentioned above, but of their stupidity and of those who should educate them to respect social, human and religious values. Families, schools, institutions. Because the abnormality lies, if anything, in indifference, in the lack of care in dealing with certain problems, rather than in censoring something or someone. That's easy, that's how it becomes a sleazy buck: the fault is never ours, but that of others. In this way the problem is not tackled at its root, it is delegated to others, and in the end it is not solved at all and indeed, it reappears as soon as possible. One time it can be a game, one time a cartoon, another timethe what? A comic, a book, the neighbor... Forgive the outburst. Let's go back to our review.", "date": "2006-11-27", "grade": null}
