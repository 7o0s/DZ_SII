In the last six or seven months we have played even three, from Shin Megami Tensei: Soul Hackers to the recent Demon Gaze for PlayStation Vita, passing through the fourth chapter of Etrian Odyssey, exclusive to Nintendo 3DS. Considering that it's not exactly a very light genre, and that we played Demon Gaze just under two weeks ago, the idea of picking up another Etrian Odyssey after such a short time didn't exactly excite us, let's put it this way . But then we discovered that Etrian Odyssey Untold, a remake of the first episode released on Nintendo DS in 2008, was not only designed for diehard veterans of the franchise, but also for those who have never played it before or, in our case , for those who have already dedicated a lot of time to it and would like to see it in a different light. From this point of view, Atlus has fully achieved its goal. Let's go back to exploring the dungeons of Etria in the remake of the first episode released years ago for Nintendo DS Unsaid things It is useless to delay: the most important feature of this remake is presented to us right at the beginning of the game, when we can choose to face the adventure in Story or Classic mode. The second is the Etrian Odyssey experience to which fans of the brand are accustomed: the player creates his own character and party by choosing his classes and basic characteristics, then dives into exploring the floors that make up the game's two dungeons . In this case the goal is very simple: go lower and lower, drawing the map of each floor and tearing each monster to pieces to become stronger and better equipped. Clearer than that, one dies: it is the way all Etrian Odyssey have been played and the plot is only a barely touched outline. The Story mode, on the other hand, was designed precisely to reinvigorate this aspect of the franchise and impress those who are also looking for a narrative basis in RPGs: it puts us in the shoes of a Highlander, a young warrior invited by the regency of the city of Etria to investigate about the earthquakes that are shaking the city and the nearby forest of Yggdrasil, possibly originating deep within the ruins of Gladsheim. During his first mission, our alter ego comes across a cryogenic capsule inside which is a young blonde. A fateful encounter, practically, but far from casual: the girl, Frederica, has lost her memory and only remembers in flashes why she was in stasis, let alone how long. Our goal will therefore become not only to discover the causes of the earthquakes, but also the origins and identity of Frederica; we will also be joined from the beginning by Simon, Raquna and Arthur, three researchers sent from the Midgard library to study Gladsheim. The plot of Etrian Odyssey Untold, although well told as in a kind of visual novel, falls a bit into the clich, but does not disdain some interesting twists that will capture the players' attention thanks also to its lively and well-characterized protagonists : the player, in this mode, has limited control over the party members, who are assigned specific classes such as the new Highlander and Gunner classes. In this sense, the two game modes are interconnected, since once one of the two is completed it is possible to start the other by importing the save: in this way it is therefore possible to play the Gunner and the Highlander even in Classic mode, where they would not be normally available. from this point of view, Atlus has thought of it well, with a mode that basically introduces new players to the gameplay and universe of Etrian Odyssey and then encourages them to try the experience in the more traditional way. The idea is also enhanced by three difficulty levels designed to meet the needs of the players, with Picnic which even disables the Game Over and Expert which will represent a real challenge even for the veterans of Etrian Odyssey. The 3D effect Pleasant and well implemented, stereoscopy makes the exploration of dungeons more engaging thanks to the excellent feeling of depth that also affects some graphic effects individually, giving its best in fights. Deep Regardless of the game mode selected, Etrian Odyssey Untold looks just like a typical dungeon crawler. The city of Etria is our hub in which to manage the party, buy new items, learn new information from the various NPCs and accept new missions, whether main or optional. The whole is reprvisually exempted through the illustrations of the environments and the artwork of the characters; most of the dialogue is dubbed entirely in English, as are the cute cartoon cutscenes that liven up the story mode. Once you have selected the dungeon to tackle, you explore its floors in first person. At this juncture, Atlus has created an excellent remake, reconstructing the locations of the original Etrian Odyssey by drawing on the greater technical capabilities of Nintendo 3DS. The variety of settings is not exactly huge: the dungeons are basically two, divided into several floors grouped thematically but quite similar to each other. Thanks to the greater quantity of details and the care placed in the scenic effects, however, exploring them is always a pleasure, thanks also to an excellent soundtrack that can be chosen between the orchestrated version and the original FM version for the nostalgic. Different speech, however, as regards the planimetry, which moreover is at the center of another fundamental component of the gameplay and that is the cartography: one of our most important tasks will be to draw the map of the labyrinth on the lower screen of the console, using a large list of icons and symbols to mark the various points of interest. Most of the floors have been redesigned to match the standards of the latest Etrian Odyssey, Legends of the Titan in particular, and therefore offer a whole host of completely new puzzles and features. Fortunately, Atlus also took advantage of this to solve some problems encountered in the prequels, such as that of backtracking: however present, it is alleviated by the unprecedented Floor Jump mechanic, which is activated after having discovered a large part of a map and allows you to teleport instantly from one flight of stairs to another, eliminating the loss of time or any frustration in the case of particularly complex maps. What then, if in Etrian Odyssey the enemies sound like a thrashing to you it means that you are doing something wrong: party management is always fundamental and the player must commit to studying each skill in the skill trees of his heroes, choosing which ones to unlock with an eye to all possible synergies. The variety of builds and classes is incredible, and the new Grimoires even allow you to equip certain skills to classes that couldn't learn them. However, it must be borne in mind that we are dealing with a dungeon crawler, and grinding is still necessary - even encouraged - already at the intermediate difficulty level. On the other hand, the leveling and unlocking of new weapons and skills are the cornerstones of the genre, and from this point of view Etrian Odyssey Untold manages to be definitely one of its best representatives.", "date": "2014-04-26", "grade": "9.0"}
