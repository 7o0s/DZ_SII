However, it is a topic that obviously fascinates several developers, including the German Jan Schoenepauck, author of the Cavernaut here present, who however focuses entirely on the precision of the control systems and on a constant stimulation of the user to use his instinct to choose the path improve... Cavernaut is a simple and precise game that entertains without overdoing it Tight spaces Without getting lost in frills related to history and setting, Cavernaut simply puts the player at the wheel of a ship which, starting from the bottom of a cavity, must try to go back through the tunnels to reach the greatest possible distance before crashing or running out of fuel. We are therefore talking about a setting that has its roots in the ultra-inflated genre of endless runners, and which can count on another very common feature in this area such as that of the random generation of the scenario for each game. However, what distinguishes the Einheit B title right from the very beginning is the great care placed in the precision and promptness of the control system. Touching the screen activates the spacecraft's thrusters, while tilting the device causes it to rotate in the desired direction: a solution that is certainly not innovative, but which has never proved so reliable as in this case that it absolutely does not make one regret the more classic controls (a provided you select the axis inversion in the options, strangely much more intuitive than the default setting). Exploring the tunnels that make up the cave you can find temporary upgrades, artifacts to collect and above all green crystals that have the dual function of increasing the final score and serving as currency to purchase permanent upgrades for the ship, divided into five categories that include items such as tank capacity and armor strength. Fill me up with the rocket As mentioned at the beginning, the game continues until the spacecraft is destroyed or runs out of fuel. The risk in the first case is constituted not only by the walls of the cave, but also by a whole series of obstacles (presses, laser beams and so on) that are encountered along the way and which can affect the shields in a more or less significant way rocket protection. However, equal attention must be paid to the tank indicator located in the upper left part of the screen: each stress on the thrusters significantly drains the reserve, which must be filled by collecting the (rare) power-ups scattered around or by momentarily landing on the refueling platforms that peek into the cave at regular intervals. This element, combined with the fact that the design of the cave is a continuous succession of bifurcations whose path it is not possible to guess (due to a deliberately restricted view), forces the player to constantly evaluate the risk/benefit ratio: aiming straight towards the next filling station is a safer but less profitable choice than exploring tunnels that perhaps hide crystals or tasty power-ups. Even without inventing anything really new nor pushing mobile gaming towards new horizons, Cavernaut still proves to be a solid and well-built title, which for the few pennies it costs guarantees a good dose of fun despite a self-evident basic repetitiveness. From this point of view, the technical sector of the product does not help to improve the situation: miracles cannot be expected from the work of a single person, but the graphics and sound elaborated by Schoenepauck are as functional and minimalist as they are monotonous and limited, and they contribute to exacerbate the feeling of not making real progress advancing along the cave.", "date": "2015-10-21", "grade": "8.0"}
