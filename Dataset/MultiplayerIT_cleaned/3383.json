In this review of Sneaky Sasquatch we will try to explain to you how the work of RAC7 Games has found its natural habitat in Apple's subscription offer, presenting itself as a bizarre adventure seasoned with a lot of healthy humor but capable of showing off a non-trivial and balanced gameplay in its components. How I ransack your campsite The user takes on the role of the mythological monkey man of the title, in a decidedly non-serious context, given that his main occupation is to obtain food by stealing it from the visitors of the campsite adjacent to his cottage. However, the rangers who patrol the area do not see him favorably, and therefore our bigfoot must take advantage of all his stealth skills to be able to put something in his stomach every day. With these simple premises, an adventure opens up that is much more intelligent than it might appear at first glance, which also manages to insert a semblance of a plot to give an additional justification to the protagonist's raids: the campsite where he stocks up on food is in fact at risk of closure, and it will be his job to recover the parts of a map that leads to a treasure essential to revive the fortunes of the structure. In terms of game structure, Sneaky Sasquatch is somewhat reminiscent of Animal Crossing, both for the not enormous extension of the scenario (which however is subject to frequent variations) and for the division into days and the request for the user to respect a routine , ~working~ with the sunlight and returning home in the evening to slip into bed for a good night's sleep. The classic Nintendo also comes to mind for the presence of various non-player characters with whom you can interact to gain access to secondary tasks: there is the bear willing to buy our excess food, the fox who rewards us with coins gold if we perform pranks (sometimes really hilarious), the duck in search of lost objects and so on. Another fundamental figure is that of the raccoon, a shop owner who sells all the upgrades useful to the bigfoot to continue his mission, from the shovel to exhume hidden treasures up to the human disguise that allows the protagonist not to be recognized by camping visitors (with the exception of rangers). Sneaky Sasquatch therefore follows a cyclical trend, with the user having to collect food and accumulate gold coins on each day of the game to then spend on equipment useful for performing new actions or reaching advanced areas, to then start the process all over again. All this boils down to a decidedly simple gameplay to master: you move by swiping a finger on the touchscreen, while tapping on it you walk on tiptoe so as not to be heard by humans, whose state of alert in visual or auditory terms is manifested via a circular icon that fills up as they notice our presence. Then there are a whole series of contextual actions to be performed by pressing on the appropriate icons, for a title that - despite its fairly short duration - doesn't really skimp on variety, always putting new situations on the plate. The more advanced stages of the adventure even allow themselves excursions into particularly successful min-games and secondary activities, for a product that is very dense in content. Humor is also one of the driving forces of the experience, conveyed by the dialogues with the characters, by the nature of the quests and also by the funny dynamics through which the bigfoot grabs the food from the various containers and devours it, getting everything dirty. Sneaky Sasquatch doesn't even miss a respectable audiovisual sector, with perfectly fitting music and colorful cartoonish graphics full of details, which makes a good impression even if reproduced on Apple TV.", "date": "2019-11-09", "grade": "8.5"}
