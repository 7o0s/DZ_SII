{"name": "Panzer Corps 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/panzer-corps-2-recensione.html", "text": "The review of a turn-based strategy like Panzer Corps 2 is always complicated to write. Either because it's impossible to describe their complexity in a few lines, or because strictly speaking, what is sought in these games is something that, while describing their mechanics one by one, one can barely grasp. We are talking about products that may seem inaccessible in their austerity, but which paradoxically only work if, once all the mechanics have been mastered, they manage to convey the idea that the choices made on the battlefield have a real weight on the unfolding of events and not are simply the result of the reconstruction of the will of the designers. In other words, a wargame involves when the player is convinced of the outcomes of the battles, whether positive or negative, i.e. when he understands that he was the one who lost or won and that the result was not determined by some lack of the game system. Graphics: Complete makeover Panzer Corps 2 is one of those titles in which you find yourself observing the battlefield for entire minutes, studying the most appropriate chain of moves to achieve the set objectives, be they the capture of one or more cities, the destruction of a certain structure or defense of a territory. This is the official sequel to Panzer Corps, a 2011 strategy, also developed by Flashback Games, a spiritual sequel to the Panzer General series. In both, the player leads the German army during World War II. The first Panzer Corps is a title loved by turn-based strategy lovers and over the years it has been enriched by seventeen DLCs. For this reason, many feared that the sequel would come out mutilated, that is, with less content than the old chapter. Fortunately this is not the case and the basic offer is already very rich, since it includes five non-linear campaigns and about a thousand units, as well as a series of new features that add value to the whole. The most evident is the renewed graphic engine: Panzer Corps 2 will run on Unreal Engine and, although it is always played on maps divided into hexagonal boxes, it is much more pleasant to look at than its predecessors. Sure, don't expect miracles, but for the genre to which the work done is truly remarkable, between well-modeled and all different units and territories full of details. Those who are concerned about readability do not fear, because Panzer Corps 2 offers different zoom levels, which increase and decrease the portion of the framed map, as well as the precious possibility of switching to the tactical view of the battlefield at any time, which visually simplifies all the forces deployed, showing only the information that is really needed (movement points, residual actions, characteristics and more). The user interface is also a big step forward compared to Panzer Corps: not only is it more graphically pleasing, but it is been rationalized to the point of being able to be completely hidden and referred to when needed. Thus, during the games only the essential information remains on the screen, with all the others located in various pop-up menus, which however never drag you out of the game. In this case the reference models seem to have been titles such as the latest Civilization, something from Paradox Interactive, as well as Endless Legend from Amplitude Studio. After all, the controls are very similar to the titles mentioned: having selected a unit, you have to choose where to move it, based on its movement points and, therefore, whether to attack or perform other specific actions. All you need to do is a few clicks of the mouse, a sign that a lot of work has been done to make the entire system more agile, so that the player doesn't have to waste hours studying the interface. However there is a rich tutorial and a very complete manual to give all the information you need to start playing. The campaigns Panzer Corps 2 offers five campaigns, all inspired by real scenarios from WWII. At the beginning of each campaign the player must create his own SS general, who will have at least two strength points, selected from a list of fifteen, able to give bonuses on different fields (number of deployable reinforcement units, production, prototypes available and more). If you want to have more strengths you have to compensate with weaknesses (always fifteen), which obviously give malus. Once our general has been created, it's time to take command of the troops and choose one of the branches proposed by the selected campaign. The latter all make sense within the context of the game: do I attack the target from the north or from the south? Do I try to strike quickly or wait for a more favorable situation? Every choice has implicationsprecise on the tactics to be used and on the rewards received: betting on the more difficult challenge always yields more than the simplest route, but naturally requires greater knowledge of the game systems. Based on the choices made, the map changes completely and, for example, some units may be more or less useful, or the use of fast vehicles may be favored over more resistant but slower ones. These are two examples out of many feasible, because the situations proposed by Flashback Games are very many. Consider that to finish all the campaigns, exhausting all the possibilities offered, it takes dozens of hours, between branches, strengths and weaknesses and the possibility of selecting five different difficulty levels. Compared to Panzer Corps you can only win or lose, so there are no more marginal and decisive victories. There is no longer even the ability to alter the course of history with our decisions. From this point of view, the developers have chosen to completely change the game structure, probably to allow longtime players to experience something new. Gameplay Once on the battlefield, Panzer Corps 2 finally shows its turn-based nature. Field deployments act one at a time, exhausting the movement of all available units. Troops in the field are determined by the slots unlocked. Some units take up only one slot, while others require more to deploy. The first missions, the simplest, offer armies already set up, but in the advanced campaigns it will be up to the player to decide whether to have a few very powerful units, or many lighter ones. Let's say that the choice is not as obvious as it may seem, because various factors must be considered, such as the growth of the units (which drag themselves from one mission to another, growing with us), the assignment of heroes (which give big bonuses) and the tactics to be employed. There is also to evaluate the unlocking of new slots, which increase the tactical choices. Once on the field, it is only up to us to decide how to move the units. The artificial intelligence of the opponents is remarkable, in the sense that they tend to exploit all the options available to them, such as the advantages given by the encirclement, the exploitation of air supremacy and so on. There are some ingenuities, especially on a defensive level, but we can get over it since, overall, the work done is really excellent. Speaking of units, as already mentioned there are more than a thousand basic ones, all of which can be improved with various upgrades and additions. Listing them all would be folly. What matters is that somehow they are all usable, in the sense that, having studied their behavior, their strengths and their weaknesses, they can certainly be used in some configuration. Not that you have to select them all: with experience you can naturally create a group of favorite units to use almost any occasion. The important thing though is that if you want you can go back and try a different configuration, knowing that you will not be penalized for doing so and that you will be able to discover new tactics to use on the battlefield, which greatly increases replay value.", "date": "2020-03-11", "grade": "9.0"}
