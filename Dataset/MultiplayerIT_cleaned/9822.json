{"name": "New World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/new-world-recensione.html", "text": "Let's start with a dutiful premise: an MMORPG takes months, even years, to reach a number of contents and a maturity such as to allow you to really sum up the project and its eventual success. Please ring Final Fantasy XIV for references. This New World review therefore stems from the desire to investigate, probe public perception and give an opinion on the current state of the game, perhaps trying to think a little about its possible evolution. On the other hand, Amazon's MMO, the first major project success of the American giant, has laid the foundations for a future which, however, is currently difficult to scrutinize at best, both due to its particular and sufficiently original hybrid nature, but also - guiltily - due to the lack of a roadmap for updates clear, a now fundamental element in this sector. Aeternum New World: Field battles are chaotic, but rewarding If you want to get an idea of all our first impressions, we leave you with the latest test of New World, which arrived a few days after its release at the end of September. Today we are interested in dwelling on what Aeternum has given us over the hours we have spent inside it and on how its construction may or may not be functional to the future of the game. We have never made a secret of our admiration for the work done by Amazon to build a coherent and interesting universe on paper, made up of little narration and a lot of lore, contained in documents and insights with some NPCs. Aeternum is certainly alive and vibrant and capable of giving Amazon's MMO a solid foundation on which to build in the future. However, what we have perceived more and more urgently over time is the inability to give coherence and progression to the whole. New World: Workbenches are essential The main quests, if we want to call them that way, are nothing more than a long series of repetitive and aseptic tutorial missions, useful only for increasing the level of our character and introducing new portions of territory, always equal to themselves. Mind you: we are aware of the nature of New World and of its being profoundly different from a World of Warcraft or a Final Fantasy XIV - the two main MMOs currently on the market, at least Western ones - but it is a bit sad to note that the positive sensations of the former moments then turned into a structural tiredness that is really difficult to digest. Aeternum is all there, lost in the narrowness of its environments and the lack of really solid variants to biomes and situations. At present we are faced with a great introduction and nothing more, which not even in the course of the endgame - which we will resume shortly - manages to change the cards on the table. Huge yet tiny New World: cities are all a bit alike The feeling that New World gives in the first few bars is that of an excellent Action MMO hybrid, with a depth to be discovered, an interesting progression in terms of crafting and weapon mastery and a stratification in the settings that is anything but trivial. Accumulating hours means exploring the map more and more, probing the flaws of a system that would have been impossible to have perfect, but which certainly could have been more refined. Let's be clear: the lack of mounts is currently a precise logical choice. The need to balance everything may also play its part, but the key reason remains the greatness of a world that is anything but extraordinary. The single player open world structure represents an excellent original starting point, but which with the passing of the weeks is badly amalgamating with the desire to transform New World into the true MMORPG experience that it has always wanted to be. In this sense, the inability to to make sense of the productive schizophrenia that characterized the long gestation of the game. New World was born as a product totally devoted to PVP, to then be transformed into an MMO with a preponderant PVE component. The delays needed to flesh out these changes only created a mess that ultimately splits between bland repetitive PVE and less successful PVP than intended. It's a shame to be honest, because Amazon has filled the game with excellent bases, which however currently seem only and exclusively a long introduction that leaves aside players who intend to really spend their days on Aeternum. We would have liked to put together more positive thoughts on the current state of the game, but the lack of useful elements to understand its future and the myriad of management problemsand confusion - did someone say handling servers and moving characters? - don't exactly bode well. At least they give the idea of a team still navigating on sight, undecided on which road to take. The recent introduction of test servers is certainly not enough, something that is now common to many exponents of the genre and which will gradually make available in advance the elements to be included in the main realm. I am a crafter We come to that aspect of the game which, incredibly, now appears to be the most complete: crafting. New World allows for an insane amount of crafting, and each of them requires a level of use, as well as a skill in the related workbench. The system is so deep, albeit also tending towards extreme repetitiveness, that several players on the servers are totally devoted to this discipline. They spend their days recovering resources, creating objects and exchanging them for gold or similar with those who don't want to dedicate themselves to this practice. Paradoxically, this aspect of the game is truly the most refined and we don't hide from you that we ourselves have spent entire sessions absorbed in the desire to increase our collection and crafting levels. PVE and PVP New World: Dark presences roam Aeternum We come to the substance of the play structure and the related combat system. We really appreciated Amazon's willingness not to relegate itself to the classic target mechanism of most MMOs. The initial feeling with the New World combat system is both satisfying and shallow. However, the presence of many different types of weapons and the independent growth of each of them allowed us to spend several hours trying to perceive the difference between one category and another. The result was twofold, as in practically any aspect of New World. In fact, during the PVE phases, the game allows you to deepen, test and grow your experience in a category, unlocking the related skills and choosing how to transform your weapons into war or support machines. Then when you find yourself facing the actual dungeons it is important to keep your skills close, trying to use the right weapons for the right situations, on pain of a premature end that can put the entire team at risk. New World: Resources are key It's a pity, however, that the dungeons are few, a handful, and they all look alike, clearly demonstrating an addition that arrived at the last minute, to try to reconcile those players who didn't want to dedicate themselves to extreme PVP. This can also be seen by paying attention to the loot, often beyond the concept of random and impossible to understand according to a sensible logic. The deepest essence of New World is PVP which, together with crafting, certainly represents the most successful aspect of the game, albeit not without flaws. As we have already told you in the past weeks, it is possible to activate PVP from each outpost and, once done, then enable the clash with other players within the map. New World: some glimpses are really beautiful New World is strongly focused on the factions that inhabit Aeternum and affiliation with one of these puts you in the position of having to carry out missions useful to maintain control of an area or to push your company to question control by a 'other. Controlling a region means giving a number of benefits to all who participate in it, from reducing the cost of fast travel, to decreasing the resources needed for crafting or harvesting time. Once the dominance of a faction is questioned by opponents, a pitched battle starts through which to confirm control of the area or make it lose forever. Fulfilling a series of PVP missions in the open world, facing corrupted portals or putting a spoke in the works of other players are just some of the activities required to increase control of your own group or to undermine that of other factions. this system seems to work and is also satisfying enough, as the weeks go by the problems begin to be noticed. The companies that control the territories in the servers are always the same and the possibility of administering more than one region only amplifies this problem. In practice, the servers are currently fully used by those groups who really spend many hours on the game and who, by will or by necessity, always have the same fifty people play pitched battles. A pity, because believe us when we tell you that net of bugs that make you invincible and banned people who magically manage to get back into the game, thePVP component of New World is its very soul and should be preserved as such. The Endgame New World: Aeternum's lore has so much to offer We conclude with two words dedicated to the endgame. Two words really because currently this phase, the fundamental one for any title that must survive the test of time, is nothing more than the slavish repetition of a couple of dungeons, participation in group battles twenty against twenty and the recovery of legendary weapons. Once you reach level sixty it will, in fact, be possible to participate in PVP battles dedicated to maximum level players. These also represent the fastest system for retrieving a good number of resources. Too bad that currently everything is full of bugs and disconnections and being able to complete one is a more unique than rare event. When everything works, however, we are certainly faced with one of the most interesting features of the game. The combat system still requires a lot of balancing, but the feeling is more than positive and this is what matters to get you off to a good start. As for the legendary weapons, the system is similar to that seen in many RPGs over the years. Once you reach the maximum level of the player and the mastery of that specific category of weapon, new missions will be unlocked on the map that will require you to recover the parts necessary to forge the ultimate weapon. A system that, however simple, works properly and that increases even more the hours needed to complete the tasks. However, we would like this kind of quest to be introduced cyclically for other uses as well, perhaps putting players in front of real raids, completely absent from the game to date.", "date": "2021-11-19", "grade": "7.5"}
