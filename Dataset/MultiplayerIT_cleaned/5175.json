A house with roots the size of oak trees well planted in the ground of RPGs had reached the critical point, due to rushed and badly completed projects, incredibly botched titles and flights of fancy that ended in tragedy after a head-on with the very hard wall of reality . Then, suddenly, the rebirth. It is not the work of the (few) notable video games released from the dark period of the software house, but of a simple return to the past named Pillars of Eternity. In an era where action and spectacularity have eaten almost everything, the answer was in short only one: to give back to fans of the genre the essence of role-playing games. However, choosing to take this now abandoned road has placed the software house in front of new dilemmas, all related to its future. How to move once the niche of RPG veterans has been regained? How to stay on top when so many equally willing development studios have now smelled the economic potential of the thing? Tyranny is the answer, a new title that owes a lot to the glorious Baldur's Gate and company, but refreshes everything with a good dose of badness. If life can teach you anything, it's that ~evil always wins~: Tyranny's review! Power is order. Perhaps Tyranny doesn't attempt to uproot the foundations laid by its predecessors in the genre, or at least it doesn't try to do so from a gameplay perspective. The Obsidian have in fact chosen to scatter the cards on the table only as regards the narrative, which is based on an incipit that is to say the least unusual. In this title you don't take on the role of the hero of the moment, but you play one of the subordinates of a very powerful ruler known as Kyros, committed to imposing his master's edicts on the few regions still populated by those who have not submitted to his want. These edicts, however, are not simple laws but real mystical proclamations, capable of devastating entire populations instantly. It may seem like a meager premise, yet Obsidian have frayed and elaborated it beyond belief, creating a strange fantasy world where the classic races have all but disappeared (outside of the beastmen here are only human tribes and factions) and the territory of Kyros is controlled by the watchful eye of the Archons, individuals of rare power who have sworn allegiance to the dark lord. The end result is a web of alliances, discontents and unstable equilibria that it is up to the player to whittle and remake at will, with permanent results on the entire game world. Whether you decide to abandon yourself to the most vulgar violence or to meticulously apply the law to favor your lord, it makes no difference: you are not Luke Skywalker here, you are Darth Vader; your actions will inevitably lead to some large-scale tragedy and the most that can be done is to choose the lesser evil. Too bad that these gears full of potential do not fit perfectly into the messy tangle of ramifications of the game, consequently creating obvious imbalances in the late campaign due to one or another alliance. Impossible then not to criticize the closure of the adventure, which leaves a bitter aftertaste unfortunately perceived in more than one Obsidian title in the past: that of the hasty cut. In practice, the house does not seem to have lost the habit of the ~unsatisfactory ending~, although the times of limited money and restrictive terms are ancient history. Bow or die Our final criticisms do not represent a rejection of the game's storyline, we would like to clarify it; they are simply cracks that have dented a background capable of developing in excellent ways with a little more effort. Tyranny still boasts more than one notable moment and is at the same time an incredibly verbose title, in whose long conversations one notices an evident desire on the part of Obsidian to outline their new universe. The industriousness of certain elements is such, for example, that they have infiltrated the fundamental mechanics of the game, which are at least in part built around the relationships with the various factions and characters encountered in the adventure, and on the prologue called ~Conquest~. Precisely from this initial phase it is appropriate to start, given that it is a screen that shows the region of the Tiers (the place where the Tyranny campaign takes place) in the form of a three-dimensional map, on which the player is asked to select various strategies to conquer the main strongholds of the enemy. Already these choices, made during the very first minutes, significantly influence the unfolding of the adventure, opening up additional dialogue options and changing yourrelationship with some factions. The relationships are then reconnected to the second factor described above, i.e. the relationship of the protagonist with the various characters - mainly members of his team and Archons - conveniently indicated by two bars representing the level of favor and that of anger (or, in some cases of terror). Raise one of the two bars adequately and not only will the story and the dialogues change, but you will find yourself with comfortable additional powers related to that faction or supporting actor. Quite an interesting way of linking moral choices and conversations to combat mechanics. Cape and sword are always cape and sword Mark the presence of these additional powers linked to your moral choices, because they are the only real innovation within Tyranny's combat system. In fact, the group also includes the interesting Combos that can be performed by the protagonist once he has properly interacted with the various members of his team: these are powerful techniques, with high reload times (there is no mana, so these are the only limit use of most skills) that can often be decisive in high-level battles. A winning idea, to which are added even powers linked to special artifact weapons which can instead be reused only after resting in a camp; only that at the base the system is almost identical to that of Pillars of Eternity, with the same problems and limitations. From the point of view of positioning, in fact, the characters do not get flanking bonuses of any kind, ergo the damage increases only if you attack enemies from hiding (which is much less difficult to do than you might think) or if they wander around duty the opposing resistances with the usual mix of magical boosts and weakens. In short, we are still faced with mechanics that closely resemble those of Baldur's Gate, far from the complexity and interactivity offered by a product like Divinity: Original Sin, and enriched exclusively by gamebook-like elements inserted within the dungeons. Puzzles, alternative roads and changing areas of the game maps are in fact presented with clear icons, which offer limited options and require specific characteristics of your team to be overcome. It worked great in Pillars, but from the next title we sincerely expected a more creative use of this gimmick (or at least a greater amount of options in some cases). Beauty in devastation The system of spells and powers is significantly more innovative. The former can be customized thanks to a witty menu where you can combine runes and symbols found during the campaign, and can later be equipped to the various fighters in the group based on their mystical knowledge; the latter, on the other hand, are strengthened by being used and are not - at least in the case of the protagonist - limited by a class selected at the beginning, given that the development of one's alter ego is free and divided into numerous skill branches. Less significant, but still pleasant, are the spiers, huge towers scattered around the map that replace the upgradable fortress of the previous Obsidian RPG, and are closely linked to the progress of the story. In short, Tyranny is a game with deep and well-oiled mechanics, which however has not been able to evolve in a truly significant way what Pillars of Eternity had offered. On the other hand, it even maintains similar technical shortcomings, with companion pathing that often goes to hell and enemy artificial intelligence that can be circumvented with various tricks even at high difficulties. These are really annoying flaws, because apart from the usual bugs and dancing artificial intelligence, Obsidian knows how to use Unity properly and Tyranny boasts some damned inspired maps and an exceptional artistic direction. It must be said that past experiences seem to have paid off, since we did not find any bugs capable of breaking the game during our test. We close with longevity, on which it is appropriate to make a separate discussion. The title is not particularly long-lasting for an Obsidian product, so much so that an expert player can complete it in less than twenty hours (the presence of a ~fast mode~ which speeds up battles and movements can greatly shorten this duration); however, it is an extremely replayable RPG, precisely by virtue of the multiple moral and relational choices available, and the big changes to the campaign that certain choices cause (although the endings tend to all return more or less to the same point). Based on how much the game world will be able to conquer you, the duration of Tyranny will increase exponentially.", "date": "2016-11-10", "grade": "8.2"}
