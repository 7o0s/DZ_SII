Also in this case it is an upgrade that does not revolutionize the title in terms of content but goes to act exclusively on the technical sector, adapting it to the new hardware. Specifically, the different graphics options present on PS4 Pro disappear and you switch to a single setting, with a fixed 60 fps in all situations and a resolution that is described as ~up to to 4K~, ergo variable according to the situation through the use of the good old dynamic scaler. Are the differences compared to the previous version noticeable? Let's find out together. Structure Unfortunately, we have not kept the old save and therefore we do not know for sure if RIDE 4 on PS5 automatically detects any progress made on the previous Sony console, even if we take it quite for granted. Milestone has confirmed to us that cross save is not present on PS4 / PS5, as the two versions have equally different ids on the PS Store. On Xbox being in Smart Delivery, the cross save functionality is present. In any case, we found ourselves having to start the Career mode all over again and this represented an opportunity to verify some structural aspects that had left us a bit perplexed when cold. If in fact it is undoubtedly true that the developers of the Italian team have did a great job on the central contents of the experience, in the same way it is evident that there are some difficulty balancing problems that make the first impact with the game a little too rough, especially for those who are not very familiar with the genre . The reference is in particular to the classic tests for the license, which apparently have not been sweetened in the transition to PlayStation 5 and which require quite a few attempts to be able to pass them. Overall, this is an interesting approach, which aims not to trivialize certain aspects, but the fact that the question arises from the very first tests rather than after a few hours, considering the fullness of the career, leaves one perplexed. Speaking of body, the fulcrum of RIDE 4 sees us starting from the bottom with a rider created for the occasion, grappling with a long journey that goes from the European, Asian and American leagues to the world one, to finally arrive at the final leagues, to the Superbike and Endurance category. Then there are the single races and competitive online multiplayer: if you are looking for content, the Milestone title will satisfy you big time. Gameplay As we were able to write in the previous RIDE 4 review, this new episode takes the already solid gameplay of the series and improves it in several respects, paying more attention to elements such as the incidence of tire wear on the driving model, or the practical implications of the sophisticated neural network artificial intelligence, which makes opponents sufficiently ~human~ and therefore subject to errors, unexpected events and accidents. As per tradition for Milestone, a set of adjustments allows you to modify the experience and therefore make it suitable for any type of user, from absolute beginners to experienced pilots, by activating or not various driving aids, setting a arcade or realistic physics as well as the skill level of the other riders. There is also the classic Rewind function, to remedy small mistakes on the fly which can, however, jeopardize the outcome of a race, perhaps at the last corner. In addition to increasing the number of bikes on the track (twenty versus twelve in the PS4 version), RIDE 4 for PS5 also supports haptic feedback and DualSense controller adaptive triggers. This results in a variable resistance on the triggers that tries to simulate the harshness of the accelerator and brake during various bike handling situations. These are additions that increase the physicality of the gameplay and that we certainly appreciated, but if you prefer a more relaxing drive you can deactivate them from the options. The new feedback system goes hand in hand with the dynamic weather, which for the first time introduces even sudden changes weather conditions within an event. We therefore pass from clear skies to cloudy or rainy skies, with all that this entails in terms of grip, visibility and strategies. Technical realization Net of the doubts we have expressed about the balance of difficulty, RIDE 4 has already demonstrated on previous generation platforms that it is a very solid racer, with many qualities, but which inevitably pays the price in terms of technical realization when compared with the best driving games out there.How has this improved on PS5? As mentioned at the beginning, the game runs at a fixed 60 fps and up to 4K, thus using a resolution that changes dynamically depending on the situation. Probably the scaler comes into action especially during the sequences that on PlayStation 4 gave more problems, that is when the rain came on the scene; the fact is that uncertainties are not noticed and everything goes smoothly, even giving the impression in certain situations that the graphics splash at higher frame rates.", "date": "2021-01-21", "grade": "7.8"}
