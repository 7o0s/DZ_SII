Does an idea come to your mind? You take it and throw it in the engine, without thinking too much about it. After all, the whole game was born from a moment of acute bullshit, to put it mildly, and the developers didn't expect anything by putting it on the market. Instead it has currently eclipsed all their other projects. Goats and cops So here we are talking about yet another joke come true: Goat Simulator: Payday, born from a cross-collaboration with Overkill, who in turn made a DLC with goats for Payday 2. As we wrote elsewhere, how long can the same be tolerated joke, how funny? Let's say that if Goat Simulator made sense as a satire of a genre, that of serious simulators, proposing it today seems cloying, also because as usual the implementation effort was minimal and everything appears terribly sketchy. The Payday DLC offers little more than we've seen before. In honor of the inspiration, the player is entrusted with a group of criminal animals to be sent on a mission in a new city scenario. At the beginning you have to make them break out of cages, maybe make them wear the most iconic masks of Payday 2, then make them choose quests from one of the terminals scattered around the map. The rest is chaos. The problem isn't the usual slew of objects to blow up or humans to use as punchballs, but just the more theoretically serious mechanics, which just don't work. Take some quests, like searching around town for kittens to take to a kitty lovers club - they're just silly and unfinished. In short, going around making a mess is Goat Simulator, taking assignments and trying to finish them is not, especially if they are stuck to the game by force, put in so much to justify the money asked to buy the DLC. Will Goat Simulator: Payday have managed to keep the fame of the series down? Are we kidding? Still? Here there is no more satire that holds; on the contrary, it seems to be faced with a catchphrase that no longer has a hold on the public. We laughed, we had fun but that's enough, let's move on. It is not possible to continue to justify the repetition of an operation like this, which the more it is reproduced, the more it shows its limits. Each animal has its own useless ability The base game worked because it was short, absurd and every silly thing that happened on the screen was still a surprise. The many glitches that plagued it were actually to be considered part of the gameplay, because nobody cared that the game itself worked as such. After all, it was a bit like laughing at ourselves. But now we are asked to carry out complex quests and other more canonical activities of the genre starting from the same mechanics; it just doesn't work, because those mechanics were meant for something else. The goat that ends up on the ground repeatedly due to certain bumps is fine if we are doing nothing and aiming for nothing, but if we are carrying out a mission with objectives to carry out then it becomes unnerving. You cannot ask for concentration without a system to support it. The catch-all tongue with objects that fit into the scenario is fine if we don't care about those objects and we can leave them whenever we want to move on to do something else, but if we have to drag them around the city to solve a mission and we find ourselves losing minutes to get them off the hook, then something is wrong, and the promised light-hearted amusement turns to frustration. The long way Note the finesse: at the bottom right you see the Fraps counter The references to PayDay 2, the aping of its robberies, the references to other well-known games such as Rocket League, trips to the moon, sandstorms and so on, matter little in a similar context. Of course, a smile or two in some situations tear them away, for example the astonishing determination of the policemen in arresting criminal animals is funny, but at the same time you are always faced with the risk of passing from amazement to anger, perhaps just seeing the same cop who chased us pretty much everywhere, getting stuck on a rock or getting lost in the scenery. Even more relevant innovations such as the ability to drive vehicles leave the time they find, because, as we said above in reference to other aspects of the title, if you add tracks for us to race, you have to adjust the driving system so that it doesn't transform every attempt in an ordeal. Overall, in short, Goat Simulator: Payday does not work. The magic has broken and we would very much like to see a team as talented as Coffee Stain Studios return to larger projects as they werethe Sanctums. Of course, with this they have certainly earned more and, knowing how the gaming industry works, it is more probable that sooner or later a Goat Simulator 2 will come out, or that DLC will continue to be produced for the first chapter, which cost little to make and they yield a lot. But basically they are right, because many gamers seem to want just that: a game that allows them to make a few jokes to appear brilliant in some community.
