{"name": "Caos a Deponia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/110674-caos-su-deponia-personalita-divisa.html", "text": "Chaos on Deponia picks up where the previous episode left off, but not before effectively summarizing what happened in a short cinematic. This means that you can start from this episode of the trilogy and then decide whether to recover the other two, also because contrary to what happened in the previous chapter, this time there is a satisfying ending that rewards the player's efforts at the end of the long adventure. On the other hand, the leap forward that the vote made testifies to the clearly superior quality of Chaos on Deponia compared to the first chapter. The developers did a great job fixing almost all the flaws we noticed and taking the series to the next level. If the third chapter is also up to par, the Deponia saga could become one of the best adventures of the year. However, let's keep our feet on the ground and be content to find out what Chaos has in store for us on Deponia. As befits a mini-series, there are elements of continuity with the past and, which is rare in a video game, even the main character shows signs of evolution, albeit mild. But the real surprise is the dramatic streak behind the intrusive humour. We had glimpsed it in the first chapter and now we can appreciate it on more than one occasion. Deponia has matured along with her hero and is no longer afraid to put feelings into play. A world of jokes Chaos on Deponia is a complex adventure, although less complicated than the previous one. It must be said that we played the two chapters close to each other, so it may be that the prolonged immersion in their messed up world helped us, but the impression is that the puzzles make more sense than the past. Especially in the early stages it is easy to solve one puzzle after another without immediately entering the tunnel of frustration. Furthermore, the game is responsible for providing us with clear clues on what to do to proceed, so that losing the key to the problem becomes more difficult, unless you are a novice (in which case there would be nothing wrong with it). However, we said that it is a complex game. In fact, the central part is once again a city to explore, in this case no longer Deponia but the Black Market. The maritime nature of this port makes it less fascinating than the steampunk setting of Deponia, but the quantity and variety of screens play in favor of the new city. Naturally, with so many areas immediately available, it is easy to get disoriented. Luckily, there is a map with which we can instantly travel from one area of the Black Market to another. The advantage of an open setting is that it feels like you are visiting a world while solving puzzles. In short, fresh air for all adventurers. However, some may get confused and not know exactly how to proceed. To avoid crashing it is essential to pay close attention to all the details, especially those contained in the dialogues. For once, therefore, even talking to people serves to solve puzzles and some of these in fact ask us to choose the right answer from a list of possible sentences. The mini games that we already enjoyed in the first chapter are also back, one of which even has an arcade flavor, and once again it is possible to skip them if we see that they are too difficult or take up a lot of time. Regarding the quality of the puzzles there is little to say: if we liked them before, now they have really won us over. There are unsettling ideas and authentic strokes of genius. Even with a tried-and-true point-and-click structure, the developers managed to offer something new. From this point of view, the riddle of the door in the rebel refuge is memorable, but you will certainly find many others that will strike you. And after the Black Market the adventure is far from over. Indeed, new islands must be visited before the grand finale, and without a drop in tension. Coas on Deponia: the version for Italian-speaking adventurers Again dialogue is key to solving puzzles and there are hundreds of them in Mayhem on Deponia. So what to do if you don't speak English? For the moment nothing, but we are waiting for FX Interactive to announce the boxed version of the game which, as for the previous episode, will be entirely dubbed and subtitled in Italian. Unfortunately, the game is only available in English on Steam and other digital delivery services. The heart is commanded In this second episode Rufus is still grappling with the Organons, intent on destroying Deponia for a touching reason, which will be revealed to us by one of Goal's three personalities. In fact, the young girl who fell from Elysium has a damaged memory cartridge and it will be Rufus riu's tasknite all three of the girl's personalities into one self, switching between them at will with a remote control. To overcome their resistance she will have to adapt her behavior and hit her with targeted feats, just as if she were courting three different women. At least this is what happens during the central act, during which we will discover many details about the past of the two characters. Rufus in particular will meet a person he never expected to see and who will not fail to disappoint him again. There are even some murdered dead, just to reiterate that Chaos on Deponia is not as light-hearted an adventure as it would have you believe. In addition to the hero and his beauty, the two main shoulders also return and a very long cast of extras, some well characterized, others sketched out more hastily. The question of humor remains, which in the first episode was often cloying, thanks to Rufus' irritating character. Also in this sense something seems to have moved, although the dialogues are frankly too many, but a slight lowering of the tones has helped us to live more serenely in the company of this character who, despite himself, has become a hero.", "date": "2012-11-14", "grade": "8.0"}
