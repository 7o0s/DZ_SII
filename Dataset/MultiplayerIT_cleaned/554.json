{"name": "Fronte del Basket - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fronte-del-basket-recensione.html", "text": "A ~made in Italy~ game In addition to being based on the Italian championship, localized in Italian and being able to boast the presence of the fans' chants recorded directly in the arenas that actually host the matches, the development of 'Fronte del Basket' is also branded Italy as it was created by Idoru, a company of Padua who has already gained some experience in the sports videogame panorama thanks to the creation and marketing of a series of videogames based on women's volleyball (Female Volleyball League) and beach volleyball (Beach Volley Hot Sports). Strengthened by previous successes, the guys from Idoru have tried to bring all the experience acquired into this new product, in an attempt to repeat the success of ~Lega Volley Feminine~ which in 2004 was the best-selling local game in Italian stores. Right in order not to lose even an element of Italian spirit, even the testimonial of the video game as well as the element on which all the animations of the players on the field were made, carries the tricolor flag having been chosen Gianluca Basile, pivot of the blue national team, now a militant in Barcelona . Thanks to the 'motion capture' sessions to which the player underwent, the movements of the athletes within the game were in fact defined and implemented. Fronte del Basket is aimed at all those fans who have been waiting for years to be able to play matches using Italian teams Start siren Once you have chosen the game mode among the 5 proposals (Complete Championship, Playoffs, Italian Cup, Season and Custom Tournament) you will be called to demonstrate your skills with the ball on the pitch. The controls (subject to a ~healthy~ customization of the pad or keyboard) are quite intuitive and immediate even if only after several game sessions will it be possible to truly become aware of how to carry out certain steps and actions. The dynamics of the game on the field appear to embrace an arcade philosophy, sometimes leaving out elements of pure simulation such as the possibility of making jump shots, making feints or creating blocks. For the management of the team it will be crucial to make the right calls to the game schemes both in attack (3 points play, post up, pick & roll and isolation), in order to define the best strategy to go to the basket, and in defense (defense man, zone, 3-2 zone and 2-3 zone) to avoid dunks and shots from distance. To best underline the most spectacular actions or the most embarrassing mistakes, a replay function has been implemented in the game which can start in automatic or be activated at any time by the player. The most salient actions will then be recorded and saved so that they can then be reviewed even outside the current game. The different selectable difficulty levels will have a decisive influence on the A.I. of the opponents, allowing us to face matches without being frustrated by the excessive skill or ~jumper~ of the teams we will face. Start siren A separate mention must be made for the management of the squad of players present in each team; each of the more than 200 elements reproduced in the game has in fact been associated with the characteristics of the respective real athlete by referring to the official statistics released by the Serie A Championship. In this way, for example, players who in reality are famous for their ability to succeed to place three-point shots with relative ease they will have reproduced this peculiarity also in their electronic alter ego. Another note of interest that can be found within 'Fronte del Basket' is that given by the presence of a section dedicated to team management thanks to which it is possible to customize the teams by modifying both the squads to be deployed and the characteristics of the players who populate the game database. Idoru vs. EA? 'Fronte del Basket' is mainly aimed at all those fans who have been waiting for years to be able to play games using Italian teams. The game does not claim to compete with ~sacred monsters~ of the genre such as the ~NBA LIVE~ series by EA Sports and immediately makes it clear both through the hardware requirements that are decidedly more attractive to the general public and through the price, going to place in the budget range that is well suited to accommodate the product. For true fans of basketball video games, I would recommend Idoru's product as regards the good playful experience it manages to convey by immersing the player in an environment well known to him (teams, arenas, supporters, Italian players) while the game by EA certainly remains one of the best products out there as far as rilook at graphic realization and realism of game dynamics. Final comment Are you passionate about the Italian basketball championship? Do you know the names of all the players and do you follow the matches of the various clubs on TV? Have you always wanted to challenge your friends in the Assago Forum in Milan? If you answered positively to at least two of the previous questions then 'Fronte del Basket' is the game for you.
