{"name": "Il gioco delle deduzioni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/137940-cloud-chamber-il-gioco-delle-deduzioni.html", "text": "Crime literature was born in the first half of the nineteenth century and quickly established itself as a popular and entertainment genre. Some of you may not know it, but it is one of the most playful literary genres ever, with considerable social implications. The rigid structure of the classic mystery book, in which the details of a crime are discovered by an investigator (to be understood as the protagonist who conducts the investigation, not necessarily as a representative of the police forces) throughout the text, up to the ending in which the culprit is inevitably discovered, served not only to immerse the reader in a story full of tension, but also to test his deductive powers. The best readers of mystery books were those who managed to discover the murderer or thief before the book was finished; on the other hand the best mystery writers were those who managed to keep the solution of the case from being discovered until the end, obviously without violating a series of unwritten rules with the reader, who should never be deceived with cheap tricks. The most famous characters born from the pens of mystery writers are usually amateurs, to be understood as non-professionals. Let's take Sherlock Holmes, or most of the protagonists of Agatha Christie's novels to have some concrete examples before our eyes. The amateur sleuth who ridiculed the police was the plastic representation of the passionate reader of mystery literature, an amateur able to solve case after case before the police. Lovers of mystery novels often gathered in clubs dedicated to reading and solving the various books: someone read aloud one or more chapters, and then they dabbled in common reasoning trying to discover relevant details that would help in the reconstruction of the puzzle. When the arguments were exhausted, we continued reading. Cloud Chamber is a massively narrative graphic adventure where you have to think for real Budding detectives The genre of classic graphic adventures owes a great deal to mystery literature. In fact, the much-hated enigmas are the bringing into play of that ludic/deductive process, solitary or collective, which so delighted our ancestors (and even some modern ones, why not). Cloud Chamber goes even further. Rejecting the simplification of Telltale-style narrative graphic adventures, it seems to be the video game of those yellow clubs we talked about in the previous paragraph. Describing its mechanics is easy: the player must watch a series of films in sequence looking for clues in them to solve a fantasy/thriller case. Each film is linked to a so-called node in which other human investigators are located, with which to exchange conclusions via a bulletin board. In addition to the videos, it is possible to read documents, look at photos and consult various material that is unlocked as the adventure progresses. The community can then vote for the best comments, highlighting them, or bury spam comments or redundant and useless ones (very few). Some nodes are blocked until enough likes or dislikes have been received on their posts, an exceptional incentive not to write nonsense (or to write sensational ones) and to actively participate in the resolution of the case, which for the record is divided into ten chapters. That's all. If you want we add that the movies are well acted by real actors and are generally very accurate. At the interface level we can add that it is possible to watch the videos as many times as you want, observing them frame by frame to discover hidden details. But that's really all. What works and what doesn't Cloud Chamber is an experimental title with undoubted charm. As soon as you start it you understand that you are faced with something never tried before and it is easy to get carried away in the game of exchanging information and searching for the smallest hidden details to write your own deductions. Beautiful, beautiful, but the formula has its problems. Unfortunately we arrived in the game a few weeks after the launch and we found the various nodes analyzed in every detail, to the point that we often found ourselves with very little original to add to the discussion. Of course, the system tends to skim the comments of those who have long since abandoned a node, but there are many who recover the best material and re-propose it. In short, it is really difficult to enter the investigation when you are faced with discussions that have already started and settled. Warning: at this point, for reasons of analysis, we have to make a huge anticipation of the plot. Selfyou don't want to know anything, skip to the next paragraph. Maybe that's why Cloud Chamber doesn't end. The developers have deliberately chosen not to give the solution to the case, in order to leave the players the opportunity to continue discussing and to get an idea based on their investigations and those of others. Let's say that it is a radical decision, above all in an age in which there are many who demand ready-to-eat baby food and a telephonic twist to feel intelligent; but if we relate it to the problem raised earlier, that of the rapid exhaustion of the investigation, it is easy to understand that it makes sense. Indeed, it was an inevitable choice. Probably the ending written by the developers will come only with the definitive closure of the game, but in the meantime it is right that such a tombstone should not be placed on the adventure. Of course, many have been disappointed to reach the end with no certainties in hand, but it is quite clear that it would take only one troll player to know the solution to ruin the investigation for everyone else. End of anticipation. However, the problem remains of the difficulty of entering the survey for freshly purchased players, a difficulty that will make many give up trying what is in any case an original and very profound gaming experience. The ideal approach is to enter the nodes and not run off the bulletin board to devote himself exclusively to examining the clues. After having produced the first sensible arguments, they can be written on the bulletin board specifying the procedure adopted and that one is about to read what has been written by the others, apologizing for the repetitions. This way we found more than one person willing to give us their likes to help us unlock all the content. Another tip is to start playing with a group of friends, think with them and not read the comments of others until you feel you have exhausted a node, and then proceed to interact with the bulletin board. Of course, these are palliatives, but they are the only systems that currently allow you to enjoy Cloud Chamber.", "date": "2014-09-24", "grade": "7.5"}
