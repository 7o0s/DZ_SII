It is an RTS strongly inspired by Jackson's three films in their entirety, thus proposing an overview of the saga. In the single player mode, the player can embark on the perilous journey in Middle-earth by choosing whether to side with Good or Evil. The forces of Good, moved by the common desire to annihilate the power of Sauron, include the army of Rohan, equipped with a powerful and implacable cavalry, and that of Gondor, a proud and ancient bulwark of peace that grew up in the shadow of the Tree of Life. Sauron's evil ambitions will instead be supported by Saruman's White Hand army, strengthened by his hosts of Uruk-hai and terrible war machines, and by the hordes of orcs from the dark lands of Mordor. It is an RTS strongly inspired by Jackson's three films in their entirety, thus proposing an overview of the saga. Strategy and dynamism The game does not follow the classic structure based on the linear succession of missions, but is based on the possibility of dynamically choosing which mission to face considering the current availability of resources, the difficulty of the proposed missions and the bonuses offered at that particular moment. There is continuity between missions, as units saved at the end of a mission remain available for subsequent missions. Each bonus and malus collected are added to the previous ones, as well as the command points (which determine the maximum number of controllable units), which can be accumulated through the victories encountered on the battlefield. Peculiar is the setting with regard to the construction of buildings in camps and outposts. Debunking one of the most established myths in the RTS tradition, in The Battle for Middle-earth it is not possible to build buildings and structures anywhere on the map, but only in the areas reserved for this task. Only a limited number of buildings can be built around the main structure of a base camp, or within the walls of one of the glorious cities of Middle-earth; not even in all areas it is allowed to build any type of building, but depending on the position of the so-called ~buildable~ area, it will be possible to choose from a limited and specialized list of buildings. This setting gives camps and cities a more orderly appearance and above all forces the player to weigh carefully the choices regarding construction. Another peculiarity is constituted by the resources through which it is possible to construct buildings and recruit units. Abandoned the usual varied list of raw materials that can be accumulated through specialized collection points in this game there is a single type of good, generically called ~resources~. Timber, food and gold even if collected from specialized constructions constitute the set of generic resources available. The weight of a certain building rather than another is given by the bonuses that the latter exert on particular types of units and by the contribution that the specific units can give to the increase in resources if used in the relative buildings; farms, for example, provide resources and reduce the cost of producing cavalry units. The game interface The game interface is very rich and allows you to better control the action, special abilities and heroes. Each faction has its own characteristics, as well as special magical powers to be used at the right moment. Units in battle collect experience points as the number of their casualties increases. Each platoon maintains its experience score until it reaches higher and higher levels that guarantee greater combat performance. Along with this, the player personally collects experience points that can be converted into new powers to add to those previously acquired. Through the ~Book of Powers~ it will be possible to view the entire tree of choices with the relative costs of the powers that can be acquired. As regards the management of building skills and the creation of units, it is possible to act directly on the buttons that appear from the structures once selected. From here it is possible not only to control the recruitment of units, but also the management of the related upgrades, which are really effective and impressive also in terms of graphics. Once an upgreach single troop must be improved using the appropriate button, obtaining really useful and incisive bonuses (for example the upgrade for the Uruk-hai crossbowmen gives the use of flaming arrows, lethal against the Ents). Old friends and feared enemies There are numerous units and heroes available in this title, practically all those represented in the three films. The breathtaking effect of huge epic battles such as those of Helm's Deep or the final showdown at the gates of Mordor can be relived through the re-enacted battles in the Battle for Middle-earth. The graphic impact is truly remarkable especially in the scrums thanks to which you can better appreciate the potential of the graphics engine and the complexity of the models and animations of the units. The reactions to the different attacks together with the special abilities of the heroes make the battle experience truly innovative. Cave trolls, for example, are able to grab trees, boulders or even their own faction's orcs at the command of the player to use them as supplementary weapons with which to slaughter enemy forces. The Ents, the gigantic living trees of the Fangorn forest, extremely vulnerable to the fire of the gobelin arrows, catch fire after a few successful hits, continuing to fight devoured by the flames. As the battle progresses, the use of heroes can be decisive, for example the hobbits can hide and throw stones a long distance from the target, stunning enemy troops with ease. Among the heroes available to lead your faction to victory we will find Thoden, Eomer, Eowyn, Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam (available only in Campaign mode), Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Boromir, Aragorn, Faramir and finally Treebeard as regards the armies lined up on the side of Good. Much less numerous, but perhaps more lethal are Sauron's allied heroes, among whom we find Saruman, Lurtz the commander of the Uruk-hai, the Nazgl and the Witch-king. Among the neutral heroes we find the terrible Balrog (responsible for the ~death~ of Gandalf the Grey), Shelob and Gollum. Last but not least are the interventions of special units, usable only for a limited period of time such as the Elven troops and the armies of the Gray Army. It is also possible to meet on the map lairs of typical Middle-earth monsters such as the Wargs (the demonic wolves ridden by orcs), the Goblins and the mighty cave Trolls. From film to game Attention to detail is one of the strengths of this title. The references to the films are continuous, even reproposed in the identification icons of the units in which, from time to time, small clips and frames taken from the films appear. Many elements attributable to the events narrated in the three films are present among the upgrades, structures and units available, such as the ~secret ring~ available for the deployments of Gondor and Rohan (reference to the scene of The Two Towers in which Gimli and Aragarn rout the orc troops at Helm's Deep using a secret passageway). The animation of the Uruk-hai Abyss is really pleasant, complete with an orc engaged in extracting the deadly hybrid warriors created by Saruman from the slimy mud of the pool. The sound department can count on Howard Shore's powerful soundtrack, which he had already accompanied in the chapters of the film trilogy. Worth mentioning is the presence of the map editor, useful for anyone who wants to try their hand at creating new and unedited scenarios in which to make armies fight in Skirmish mode. Graphically satisfying, acceptable even at low detail levels, the graphics engine appears well structured even if at times it would have been useful to be able to use a wider overview to better control the larger battles. Comment The Battle for Middle-earth is a respectable title that brings into play very captivating cards and a few pinches of originality served on the plate of a very consolidated structure such as that of the classic real-time strategy game. The graphics are amply satisfying and the involvement is equally broad, taking advantage of the charm of the films that exudes from every frame of this game and letting yourself be carried away by the magnificent soundtrack obviously taken from the original one already heard in the films. To whom would we recommend the purchase of this title? To all those who want to try one last, fulfilling experience in Middle Earth, to all those who loved the trilogy directed by Peter Jackson and to those who love the RTS genre, because this title is a worthy representative of it. Pros: Graphically satisfying If you loved the movieyou can't help but love this title too Many heroes available, practically all the protagonists of the films Cons: Strategy is sometimes forced to give way to spectacularity as an end in itself The limit imposed on the construction of buildings can make you distort the nose [VIDEO=305.305.d.s]https://www.multiplayer.it/streaming/sda_terradimezzo_low.wmv[/VIDEO]The video review of ~The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth~ is also available in high resolution for all Premium Gold subscribers to this address. Once again Once again we are called to visit Middle-earth, once again we find ourselves following in the footsteps of Frodo, Sam and Gollum, Pippin and Meriadoc, Saruman, Gandalf, the heroes of Gondor and the hordes of the Dark Lord. This adventure, which began three years ago, shows no signs of dampening the tones with which it overwhelmed millions of fans around the world, bringing the events narrated in one of the greatest literary masterpieces of the past century to the masses. Exploited to the bone, eviscerated to the core by enthusiasts and newbies, analyzed in every light and every philosophy, to date no one can deny that Tolken's saga has proved to be above all a monstrous source of income. And so after three years of dizzying influxes to cinemas around the globe, after as many years of stratospheric sales of DVDs (extended and non-extended versions), merchandise of all kinds and all forms of marketing that can be expected from a great film (or rather three successful films), another PC title could not be missing (we don't even want to mention the slew of titles released in recent years for consoles) dedicated to the vicissitudes related to the One Ring.", "date": "2004-12-28", "grade": null}
