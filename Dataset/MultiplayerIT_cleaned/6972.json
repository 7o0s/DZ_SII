{"name": "Level design titanico", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/135669-titanfall-frontiers-edge-level-design-titanico.html", "text": "In an hypertrophic market, in which the development of triple A titles involves the management of increasingly complex and onerous capitals, technologies and coordination of workforces, with marketing at the same time swelling its chest, tightening its grip on the reins and severely dictating its deadlines cannot be postponed, it happens more and more often that a product can come out rushed, improvable, even incomplete or botched. Especially if there is a need to hit the launch window of new generation consoles with a decidedly bland identity and appeal, which need the help of all the hype bottles possible. The examples, more or less excellent in terms of prestige of the brands or development studios involved, seriousness of the release conditions, redefinition of the concept of ~day one patch~ or ~pardon, we put the promised feature in a DLC or in the followed, you will see the sequel, it will be the first real episode of the brand!~, are under everyone's eyes and in front of the pads, and are in such a number that they can now be considered a rather strong trend. It hurts to say it, to surrender to the idea, but one could even speak of normality. In such a context, in which the consumer's tolerance threshold has been constantly redefined upwards over time and one tends to get used to everything a little, the case of Titanfall still manages to make a category of its own. In fact, one could speak of ~AAA Early Access~, a full-price game launched with an essential quantity of content and multiple margins for definition, completion, calibration. A substantially ongoing project, whose status deserves to be followed over time, as we did in the case of the first DLC, Expedition, to then go on to even dedicate an entire special to it, following the release of Update 4, and on which we will inevitably return to the end of the article, in analyzing the innovations introduced by Update 5, which accompanied the release of this Frontier's Edge. ~Deserving~, yes, because Titanfall is still a great multiplayer shooter, doing many things in a fresh and interesting way and many others just right. Life, death and miracles of Frontier's Edge, the new DLC of Titanfall, and Update 5 Few frills, lots of beautiful substance Unlike Expedition, which could count on the self-referential trip and the conceptual and aesthetic hazards of Giochi di Guerra, and on the radical change of setting of Paludi, Frontier's Edge is not a DLC that comes with particular signs worthy of note. The triptych of new maps prepared by Respawn Entertainment is not characterized by design exploits (whether it is understood, vulgarly, as a stylistic gimmick rather than, more properly, a design solution) which in some cases do more good than the concrete reality of the game to the promotion machine, to build bombastic trailers and sparkling press releases, but it still represents a very solid offer, which fulfills the purpose of extending the life of the basic title very well, enhancing its qualities. As Joel Emslie, Respawn's Lead Artist says, creating a map for Titanfall is not trivial, because two orders of magnitude must be constantly considered: that of the Titan and that of the Pilot. In light of this, and in light of the swarm of interweavings in terms of navigability of the spaces, the development of the clashes and the rhythm of the matches that characterize the creature of the former Infinity Wards, an exceptional job was done in devising Export, Scavi and Oasi. All three maps are played very well, both on foot and on board your trusted technological giant. Zampella's team seems to have reached full maturity in preparing that careful distribution of interiors, exteriors, platforms inclined at different degrees, ziplines and architectural and natural structures of other kinds already appreciable in the base game, churning out three arenas that are explored acrobatically which is a real pleasure, allowing you to exploit the complex of movement possibilities offered by double jumps, parkour, crouch jumps and bunny hopping at different levels of depth, calibrating the positioning of windows and other entry spot, to be exploited like a rocket if you are able to maintain a certain momentum. All without leaving the Titans impaled, who can trample with their heavy gait an alternation of clearings in which to duel face to face, ravines and gradients where to plan ambushes and other hit and run guerrilla tactics and openings where to give more full vent to their impetus designed with an equally wise and convinced wrist. A leitmotif that each of the new entries declines in its own way, convincing across the board. A bit of Liguria, abit of Dubai, bit of factory work Export takes up the offices, small operational bases, warehouses and other buildings of a basically contained size in Cologne, distributing them in a more concentrated and continuous manner over an impervious territory, characterized by important hilly digressions both longitudinally and transversely (since it is a town maritime perched at the foot of a mountain). In addition to this, remember to offer some good incentive to consider a class that tends to be mistreated like the snipers, with excellent ambush points on the roofs of the outlying buildings and on the crack of the imposing column that dominates the entire map in height. Export also represents Respawn's first attempt to experiment with events, occasionally allowing a short but intense electric charge to be released in the central area, through which to try to fry some unfortunate person. An addition that is far from transcendental, but still nice. Contrary to what the gut of paths that cross it might lead one to believe at first glance, it is a location in which to grapple with satisfaction even with the Titans. The narrow streets allow for surprise attacks and various other cunning plays, with varying degrees of coordination, while offering interesting opportunities for players able to exploit unusual lines of fire, especially with Plasma Railgun and Arc Cannon. Those who don't like the strolling streets too much can always take and gallop more freely, quickly cutting across the map both passing through the port and, above all, along a very secluded mountain avenue, which flanks the entire area. Set at the Haven, a luxurious hotel located on the shores of a lake, among those of Frontier's Edge Oasis is the map that boasts the most pronounced verticality. Its flagship, however, is the extremely articulated but calibrated to the millimeter complex that dominates its center: on foot it is possible to continuously cross the lounge, the corridors, the restaurants, the pool area and other rooms of the hotel, choosing on the fly from a multitude of alternative routes. Or ride the cyclopean outer walls of the building at full speed. Or a bit of both, alternating in an interweaving resulting from a map design from authentic seeded, which allows, among other things, to reach quickly and efficiently even the appurtenances of the Haven, located in the areas margins of the arena. As well as on the beach, but above all on the streets surrounding the main area, thanks to the spaciousness of several of its premises, the Titans can also move with ease within certain wings of the hotel, offering an often essential contribution even in this context . Excavations is a map with a basically circular shape, set near a mineral extraction site. Also in this case, there is a great balance between the game on foot and the game on board the mechs for those who really want to exploit both solutions, although the structure of the industrial installation in which you find yourself fighting is more discontinuous than the others and you need a little more study and greater exposure to risks to find trajectories thanks to which you can run from side to side with agility, while the Titans have easier and more ~readable~ space available to battle. Do not underestimate the point of interest offered by the back of the huge excavator which points outwards from the center, above which it is possible to organize support or disturbance maneuvers of various types or carve out the conditions for ~sniping~. Each of the three maps proves to be more than adequate, without any real contraindications, for games of Marked for Death rather than Capture the Flag, Titan Survival or Control Point Domination, enhancing both the qualities of the gameplay and their specific quids. The exceptions are Attrition/Driver Hunter (we combine them by crossing them out, which after months and after a good hundred hours of honorable service in practice we continue to struggle to distinguish them. Respawn, were two photocopies really necessary?): in their case the matches often tend to fray, characterized by an excessively diluted flow, fertile ground for boredom. It was a defect that we also noted with reference to Expedition's Laguna, but which, in hindsight, we feel we can attribute to these same methods. Unless ~forcing~ the participants to move and expose themselves to achieve an objective, or to find themselves in maps with concentrated development or a few dead zones such as Angel City, War Games, Nexus or Pirate Cove, Titanfall pays duty to the relatively small number of players. The variants of the pure and simple TDM proposed by Zampella and his companions prove decidedly not very exciting when you are in larger arenas, where you dramatically feel the need for a more widespread presence of flesh and blood people. Contraband Above it was said that Frontier's Edge can not boast who knows what inventiveness in terms of aesthetics and style. However, this does not mean that graphically it is not very successful, on the contrary. Respawn seems to have reached greater maturity also from this point of view, proving to be more skilled both in exploiting the technology at its disposal and in visually expanding the universe set on fire by the tensions between the IMC and the Militia. Even if unlike the two most characteristic maps of Expedition we move in types of settings already widely seen in the base game, each of the three new entries boasts not only a great impact but above all a marked personality. Scavi is yet another industrial scenario, similar in some ways to Demetra and Relitto, but thanks to a particularly ~concrete~, metallic and dark rendering, in which not even a hint of sulfur is missing (see the red dust ~emanated ~ in certain refining rooms), it almost gives the impression of being set on the surface of a Mars made by the beautiful id Software of the past. Export, as already mentioned, has a lot in common with Colonia (and even recycles Angel City's karajishi), a genetic heritage which however develops in a radically different way, extending along a scenario where the eye is free to run towards broad horizons, dominated by imposing circular structures, in turn dominated by a placid and evocative sky, which is very reminiscent of Bungie things. And even more ~Bungie~ is Oasi, which pampers the eye with a panorama of the same kind, except to warm it with a dazzling sun, the result of refined lighting, while the windows, the steel of some load-bearing structures, the parquet certain rooms and paintings of the Haven museum delight with brand new shaders and materials, of particular value, which were hardly thought to be within the reach of the Source. When you consider that Respawn's other attempt at grappling with a somewhat similar architectural style was the flat Corporations, it seems like half a generation has passed. Everything moves with overall good performances, which seem to give credit to Respawn's promises regarding the optimizations made by Patch 5. Too bad that it is enough to go back to the old maps to realize that in reality nothing has changed from that point of view, indeed, in in some cases the game seems to suffer more from stuttering. Pessimism and annoyance. Where things have gone better is in the introduction of the Black Market, a space where it is possible to buy packs of Burn Cards and Insignia, paying out Credits, which now complement XP among the rewards of matches and Challenges or can be obtained by selling Burn Cards that are of no interest. A novelty that adds a small but pleasant management-style flour to the administration of jokers to be played in the game, even if it remains to be seen if and how it will be developed in the future. As long as the current implementation is maintained, the suspicions of those who fear that it could be the antechamber of the introduction of microtransactions, of the possibility of buying packs of cards by paying real money, should remain so: these are elements that can be purchased with the money accumulated by playing, even without having a lot of patience. We will talk about it again in the event that the ordinary drop of Burn Cards or Credits will be maliciously altered to give more centrality to the shop or cards with exclusive effects for paying players will begin to appear. One last important novelty are the Daily Challenges, particular challenges called in series of 3 once every 24 hours. The name should not be understood literally, given that they do not disappear the next day and it is also possible to have challenges relating to the past days (up to a maximum of 9) in the ~work in progress~. This is clearly an expedient with which Respawn tries to stem the collapse of users that has already been affecting the game for a while, proposing an incentive to entice people to return to it a little more frequently. Simple, guessed and appreciated, but with a not funny contraindication: the risk is to find yourself surrounded by users who, instead of demonstrating interest in the objectives of the game, stay there to ~farm~ the challenges of the day, ruining the fun for others. Maybe that proverb was right: better few but good...", "date": "2014-08-04", "grade": null}
