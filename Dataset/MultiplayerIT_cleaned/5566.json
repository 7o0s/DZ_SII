The same thing also happens with PKTBALL, a game that perhaps cannot count on the most convincing first impact there is, starting from the name in the style of the tax code to arrive at a decidedly simplistic presentation, but which manages to conquer simply with practice, proving to be perfectly designed for the mobile and above all fun context. The principle is that of tennis and sees two opponents on opposite sides of a playing field throwing and hitting a ball trying to score points, although the movement required and the rebounds of the ball are more reminiscent of air hockey. In fact, to throw the ball, it is sufficient to move your spherical character along its trajectory and give a certain direction by releasing your finger from the screen with the right timing, thus making everything extremely simple and intuitive, supported by an excellent and immediate response to commands. not insignificant element in a game of this kind. There really isn't much more to add and the variety of the action isn't exactly the strong point of this Laser Dog production, which moreover doesn't offer a large amount of different modes, but everything is concentrated and exhausted in the immediacy of the action, which various elements (control system, sympathy of the graphic style, immortal validity of the concept) contribute to making it always valid. Too bad for the lack of an online multiplayer that would certainly have enriched the offer, as well as some other game modes. A little tennis and a little Pong, PKTBALL is a pleasant entertainment of yesteryear Tennis thumb PKTBALL does everything to keep the game action simple and immediate, which is particularly appreciated when using the iPhone and realizing how the control system is perfectly designed to be enjoyed with one hand. The fast pace and fluid action, combined with the fact that it is completely usable in the palm of a hand, make this title a perfect pastime to be used even in very short breaks in situations that are not too comfortable, or a welcome return to the primordial essence of mobile gaming, especially if it is so well done. Short finger movements on the screen allow you to move your character and impart variable force and effect to the ball, with a simple dynamic that however does not close the way to interesting insights, for those who get caught up in the mechanics. In fact, it is not just a question of trying to score points with complicated shots for the opponent to take: the game also requires us to collect coins scattered on the field trying to direct the ball precisely to them, collect power-ups to change the shape and size of the character or the ball and in general adopt rebound and shooting techniques that tend to maximize the score, set on the basis of rigorous progressive multipliers that will delight high score addicts, here grappling with global online rankings. The main game mode is therefore well designed to guarantee a good challenge rate, a pity that it is practically the only option available. PKTBALL would also give its best in multiplayer, but this is only present in the offline local version and can practically only be used on rather large screens, obviously taking into consideration the iPad, on which up to four players can be challenged. At this juncture, the fun multiplies but it is not actually a situation that is easy to replicate at any time. Also pleasant is the inevitable collecting element represented by the possibility of spending the coins earned by playing (or bought through micro-transactions) in the purchase of new characters, which also bring with them entire themes capable of profoundly modifying the whole aspect of the game including field.", "date": "2016-04-19", "grade": "7.5"}
