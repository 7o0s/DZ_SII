We don't happen to use it often, yet it is the word that most of all manages to give an idea of the experience that the guys at Moon Studios have been able to pack with this new, awaited exclusive for PC and Xbox One. It's wonderful the world that the development team has created and extended in this sequel, giving us a setting that is practically three times the size of the Nibel forest and boasts very suggestive views, with splendid colors. The way the story is told is wonderful, with a delicacy and attention to the times comparable to those of the best animated productions. The characters are wonderful, you immediately become attached to them and end up shedding a few tears, once again. The level design is wonderful, which takes the metroidvania genre and glorifies it, elevating its peculiarities as has rarely been seen. The soundtrack is wonderful, which manages to combine an extraordinary variety of songs with dreamy, Nintendian atmospheres that accompany any sequence to perfection. And yes, the gameplay is also wonderful, which improves many aspects of the original formula without renouncing an approach hardcore that in some moments will make you shout the most terrible curses in the throes of burning frustration. Is it good? Is it bad? Calendar in hand, there are elements that have certainly benefited in the transition from Ori and the Blind Forest to this sequel, above all the combat system: having eliminated the assistance of the ray of light without fail, we find ourselves having to face enemies by greatly reducing the distances, paying close attention to their attack and movement patterns, as well as alternating the magical weapons available to the protagonist depending on the situation. There are times, however, when you have to bend the scenery to your will in order to survive, executing mid-air maneuvers with pinpoint accuracy, and on a couple of occasions you really wonder if you should emphasize the challenge so much, so much. ruthlessly. Story and scenarios Ori and the Will of the Wisps opens with an introductory sequence somewhat similar to that of the first episode, which welcomes us back to the world created by Moon Studios and its atmospheres. Ori, Naru and Gumo take care of little Ku, an owl who is raised with much love by the unusual family but who is unable to fly due to an ~unfortunate~ wing. The use of a special feather solves the problem and Ku begins to hover in the air holding Ori on his back, but the two are taken aback and fall, ending up being catapulted well outside the forest of Nibel. Grappling with a completely new scenario full of pitfalls, with a cumbersome and menacing presence in the background, we will have to do everything possible to find our little friend and bring her home safe and sound. The settings, as mentioned, are unedited and develop for an abundantly greater breadth than those of the first chapter, which is also reflected in the duration of the adventure, more than doubled. You find yourself going through lush woods and helping a whole series of characters and little creatures, until you reach a sort of central hub and from there go even further, towards areas characterized by very different shades: the ocher of windy deserts all to be excavated , the blue of cold and inaccessible walls of ice, the black of caves in which darkness kills and one must always remain close to a source of light. As a perfect metroidvania, Ori and the Will of the Wisps presents a parallel progression between character and exploration, given that it is precisely the new unlockable skills that allow the protagonist to access previously unreachable areas. Gameplay and enemies There are some important changes in terms of gameplay. As already mentioned, Ori has a greater variety of attacks, but often (and especially at the beginning of the campaign) you have to take risks by striking from short distances, perhaps using the quick dash to get away before the enemy reaches us. impacts, in any case, is excellent: thanks to a series of visual solutions and physics, the weight of the maneuvers is perceived and the system returns great satisfaction, although there are more chaotic moments when you find yourself facing two or more creatures at the same time . In Ori and the Will of the Wisps, only three moves can be equipped (to be assigned to the X, Y and B buttons on the controller), but it is still possible to select others at any time by pressing the left trigger, perhaps to use the bow, the spear, the ~hammer~, the mechanisms that convert energy into health and so on, for a total of twelve different powers that must be unlocked (and possibly enhanced) by spending the orbs collected during the adventure.To these are added perks that further enrich Ori's repertoire and allow him to perform triple jumps, adhere to walls, intercept projectiles to transform them into trampolines, increase the effectiveness of shots or resistance, and more. The much criticized instant save system of Ori and the Blind Forest has been shelved in favor of traditional checkpoints, with some points in particular where you can save progress and reload. These sources, once unlocked, can be reached via teleportation at any time, wherever we are, to avoid backtracking which otherwise would have proved to be really heavy, considering the size and complexity of the map. In this regard, by exploring the scenario, new details are discovered which are shown in the diagram that can be called up by pressing the View button, but it is also possible to buy maps at certain dealers and make life a little easier ... provided you find them, s 'means. Hidden a bit in the most remote corners of the setting there are also the time trials, another novelty of this sequel, with speed challenges to be completed in a limited time in order to obtain rewards. The Ori and the Will of the Wisps bestiary appears particularly rich and varied, with a great abundance of standard enemies to which are added several generously sized bosses, sometimes protagonists of daring chases in which you have to move very quickly until you reach a safe point, or hide to avoid a clash that would inevitably see us as disadvantaged. Each creature has a set of movements and attacks that must be memorized in order to be able to counter them effectively, resorting to the great agility of the character in order to avoid suffering damage. The system works very well, it is very solid and knows how to give satisfaction, but it is perhaps unbalanced when you come to terms with the many pitfalls present in the scenarios, capable of killing us after just one misstep. Fortunately, then we start again from a few steps away. The Xbox One version During the tests we made the transition from Xbox One S to PC as soon as possible, taking advantage of the providential cross-save, as the Windows version of Ori and the Will of the Wisps already includes an important update that solves a number of problems techniques that currently afflict the game on consoles. Beyond various more or less serious bugs and glitches, the most annoying thing on Xbox One is a heavy stuttering that occurs when loading new scenarios, and which stops the game for a few long moments even in the middle of the action. The developers have guaranteed that the day one patch will fix things and there is no reason not to believe them, also considering the fluidity we had experienced in the first episode. Technical realization Ori and the Will of the Wisps boasts an extraordinary artistic sector, truly of rare beauty, able to surprise anyone thanks to the strength of aesthetic choices of great taste. The colors that alternate on the screen are incredible and the HDR emphasizes the brightness, although perhaps turning it off allows you to enjoy a palette closer to the delicate and cartoonish style that the authors have tried to create. Compared to the previous episode, a massive use of visual effects that embellish the scenario between volumetric lights, reflections, particles and motion blur. Some gimmicks create a great feeling of depth, for example you see objects moving in the foreground simulating a perspective parallax: practically an evolution of the ideas introduced at the debut of the franchise. The design of the characters is excellent, whether it's protagonists, supporting characters or enemies: each creature has precise characteristics and a good set of animations; with a special mention for the villain of the moment, who knows how to be really disturbing. Unfortunately on Xbox One S we had to make compromises in terms of definition (and frame rate!), and so certain figures appear blurry or with jaggies in beautiful view. Of course, on PC there are no such limits, and apart from the lack of advanced options (in fact it is only possible to select the resolution and activate v-sync) the game runs on the test configuration at real 4K and 60 frames per second with very few uncertainties. After that there is the extraordinary soundtrack, of which we haveor already spoken: a selection of emotional songs, perfectly suited to the various sequences, which ~tell~ the story in concert with the graphics, creating a sensational mix and creating moments that will not fail to remain engraved in your mind.", "date": "2020-03-10", "grade": "9.0"}
