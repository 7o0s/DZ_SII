{"name": "Surf's Up - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/surfs-up-recensione.html", "text": "Surf Karting In the animated film the theme of surfing is central, and it is probable that the ~major~ console versions of the game go in that direction, with a structure based on board control and trick execution. All this does not happen on Nintendo DS, as the Ubisoft developers have decided to transform everything into a very simple racing game, in this case a clone of Super Mario Kart with the only difference being surfboards instead of cars. Once in the race, in fact, we will have to press the A button repeatedly to launch ourselves with our board, after which the acceleration will be automatic and we will have to do nothing but find the best trajectories to tackle the courses, not disdaining jumps and acceleration points. In the event of a collision with an obstacle, we will have to ~swim~ again to regain speed, perhaps using the backbones (which make our character make a ~tight curve~) the next time we fail to take the right direction in time. The participants in each race are numerous, and to defeat them we will have to not only be fast, but also smart: along the track there are weapons exactly like in Super Mario Kart, which it is then possible to ~shoot~ at those in front of us or leave them behind us and wait for someone to bump into us. The weapons in question are obviously themed: dangerous puffer fish, ampoules of blinding liquid, remote-controlled rockets or capable of making us gain speed, etc. etc. The races can also be influenced by another factor: by colliding with a ~flower~, we will have the possibility to press a sequence on the touch screen that can provide us with a decisive boost. The game Surf's Up is an extremely simple game and it is immediately clear that the developers have thought of a ~rewards~ structure, with new characters, new surfboards and new courses that are unlocked with each victory. The characters are precisely those that appear in the film, each with different characteristics that can change our approach to the races. In reality, the game doesn't have enough depth to justify one choice over another, so you proceed from race to race essentially to ~see everything~, even the animated sequences (of good quality). Unfortunately, all this does not last long: the difficulty level is filed down, probably due to the product's target audience, and you end up completing everything in a few hours. The problem is that in addition to the main game mode there is nothing else, apart from the multiplayer. The latter necessarily works with two copies of the game, while it is as simple as usual to set up an online session via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Technical realization On a technical level, Surf's Up reveals itself as a fairly good quality product. The characters are drawn well, even if they don't differ much from each other, but they don't boast who knows which set of animations, on the contrary. The design of the ~tracks~, on the other hand, leaves something to be desired... not so much for the general quality, rather for the fact that they all look a bit alike. For the rest, the graphics engine manages to manage polygons effectively, always maintaining a good frame rate if without any slowdowns. As far as the sound is concerned, there isn't much to talk about: the music is decidedly anonymous and doesn't leave a mark, while the effects are discreet but can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The control system does not make use of the peculiarities of the Nintendo DS, except on very rare occasions. The character is controlled using the directional cross, and the touch screen is called into question only when it is necessary to enter sequences that can earn us an upgrade. Comment While not in the order of tie-ins without art or part, Surf's Up offers a little too little. In this case, we have only one game mode in addition to multiplayer: the result is that you end up completing everything after a few hours. The different characters and surfboards available are of little use, because during the races you don't see a huge difference. And the races themselves are pretty repetitive, with a weapon and power-up system that fails to spice up the action. It is clear that the developers have thought of creating a product aimed at younger players, also taking advantage of the important license. And this is confirmed by the fact that the technical realization, although discreet, does not rely on any of the peculiar characteristics of the Nintendo DS. Pros: Technically discreet ~Prize~ structure Taken from an upcoming film Cons: Too simple Very short-lived The console is not used Surf's Up is available for Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii, PC, PSP, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.ion tested is the one for Nintendo DS. There are numerous CG-animated feature films that have decreed the success of the genre, so much so that now even those who understand graphics are not surprised by the (very high) technical quality achieved by American studios. Surf's Up is but the latest exponent of the genre, in theaters since October, and to coincide with its arrival are the various tie-ins for all gaming systems. And the Nintendo DS is no exception, of course.", "date": "2007-10-03", "grade": null}
