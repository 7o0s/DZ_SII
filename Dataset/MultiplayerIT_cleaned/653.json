{"name": "Need for Speed: Most Wanted", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/need-for-speed-most-wanted_a.html", "text": "Cyclicity Most Wanted does not go off the rails of the series, the main purpose of the game is to make a career by beating all the blacklisted opponents one by one in a series of races useful for unlocking respect points and new racing cars. As in all EA series there is an official license - in this case of cars obviously - which allows the presence of real racing cars to be customized down to the last detail. Each chapter relating to a particular opponent is made up of 4-7 races able to test the skill of the players in different areas, the classic head-to-head race is joined by time trials and obstacle races: limited sections of the circuit where the aim is to avoid the numerous police checkpoints by passing unharmed on the harmless orange cones. Between one race and another it will be possible to fine-tune your car with the replacement parts purchased or earned in the race, it will also be possible to buy new cars or simply design the logo to be applied on the side doors. If until now Most Wanted could have seemed like a racing game like there are many, going to analyze the game (not too deeply) the technical and stylistic gaps of the EA product appear evident. The driving management is simply bad, the cars are undrivable: at the beginning it may be thought that this driving defect is fixed by the best performing cars purchased during the game but this does not happen, the vehicles remain undrivable and the outcome of the races it is determined by the sensitivity of the pilot not to crash into the walls. Unfortunately, another serious defect of driving games is added to the undrivability: the physics of collisions. If the unfortunate player on duty happens to make a wrong turn by crashing into the outside wall, he will start an incredible chain effect in which his vehicle will transform into a pinball machine so that he will recover only after two or three hits on the walls. in the roadway; in the same way, if the unfortunate player from before happens to slip into the rear of any car on the track, he will see his speed suddenly reach zero. It goes without saying that using this defect to your advantage, it will be enough to have your opponents run into your car to slow them down completely and easily win all the races. It should also be noted that -unfortunately- one of the historical foundations of the entire saga is missing: the chases with the police. Most of the time, when you bump into a steering wheel, you will hear the activation of the siren which fades away in two to three seconds and looking back you will not see anything on the horizon: police, cars, sirens, nothing at all. The quick race (further divided into quick race, single race and toll booth) and multiplayer are added to the career mode, unfortunately playable only with the presence of two cartridges, one per player. Most Wanted? The ds is not a console suitable for driving games: the low precision of the digital in the management of 3d mechanics, the lack of use of the touch screen and the low power of the nintendo hardware have made massacres since the days of ridge racer. NfS: Mw, in addition to highlighting the obvious limitations of the console, puts a lot of its own into it, perhaps even too much.

Starting from the management of the menus, it is necessary to point out the effective lack of care (something quite rare for an EA title) with a few dark and confused animations, the whole graphic layout is tacked in colors ranging from gray to brown up to black, the most sometimes the understanding of the test to pass is not easy to intuit. The game engine remains stable on 30 frames per second, the artificial intelligence of the opponents is all too basic: it doesn't take much to put them out of the game and often it seems they almost don't see the other cars on the road. If this weren't enough to discourage the most inveterate fan of the series, we must add to the technical flaws also a bad graphic realization as regards the cars which, in addition to not integrating in any way with the course (they look like the result of a bad photo montage) are made in so as to look like a colorful and very reflective cube with two lights in the back; things improve a bit when you play with a first person view and you limit yourself to observing the good realization of the settings with a level of detail that closely resembles many psx racers. Last note for the soundtrack: even here it almost seems as if there is no hand of EA, we are far from productions with superpaid licenses and respectable soundtracks, studied in detailfor the product they were associated with. What remains is a set of riffs that are halfway between electronic and rock, without infamy and without praise, unfortunately. More than a racing game, this Most Wanted sometimes seems to want to be a manual of everything that a product of this type shouldn't be. After half a step forward with Underground, EA takes three steps backwards with a game that bears little resemblance to Need for speed both in terms of the historical foundations of the series and in terms of playability and fun. Bad handling of physics, bad graphics, insipid sound. Sin. Pros: Stage 3d of good long-lived, albeit not difficult Cons: Bad technical realization the machines look like big shiny cubes non-existent police Very low level AI By adopting the 360-degree multiplatform policy, it often happens that games born to be played on consoles also arrive on laptops: in recent years, the ~often~ time factor in the conversion equation has unfortunately transformed into an ~always  thus filling the video game market with half products, which recall the main franchise for what remains only the game title. It becomes the emblem of this negative trend. Need for speed: most wanted; saga born and raised on consoles and pc had been brought for the first time on nintendo Ds with discrete results with NfS: Undergound but all that was good a few months ago seems to have been definitively forgotten in this new chapter of the series.
