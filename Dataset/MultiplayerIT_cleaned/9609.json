{"name": "Il Regno  in pericolo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82658-kingdomconquest-il-regno-e-in-pericolo.html", "text": "Owning a latest generation smartphone, naturally not necessarily an iPhone, now inevitably implies the need to activate a data, wifi and/or 3G subscription, capable of completing and fully exploiting the multimedia potential of the device. This discourse, transferred in particular to Apple devices, is even more evident given the very close connection that binds these products to the App Store. iPhone in fact, once discarded and activated, can essentially only make calls or little more; in fact, the numerous Applications present make it the single terminal that everyone has taken as a reference for years now. The concept of ~always on line~, certainly metabolized in the daily use of the iPhone, however still represents a risk today when it is compared to the videogame level on the move; this is why an MMORPG-style experience like KingdomConquest, while theoretically interesting, pushes the imaginary line between mobile games and ~serious games~ even further, proving to be a real gamble. An RTS or an MMORPG? Theoretically speaking, it should certainly not be difficult to distinguish a real-time strategy game from an online Action-RPG, given the different concept that, at least on paper, distinguishes them; yet, once KingdomConquest is started, some certainties hitherto stainless could begin to waver. In fact, the initial tutorial, which starts after choosing the preferred class of your alter ego between Swordsman, Warrior and Magician, is already divided into two totally distinct parts: one dedicated to combat in the classic sense, where you will learn the rudiments of fighting physics, and the other instead in which we will find ourselves faced with a typical RTS scenario, with the consequent construction of buildings, collection of resources and creation of monstrous armies. The fantasy atmosphere, which permeates the whole game world, is the backdrop to a fairly stereotyped story but which always works well to justify online massacres: in the kingdom of Magna, the Land of Monsters, the throne of the ruler El Dor is now vacant, which is causing an inevitable instability. To return to order and therefore restore the serenity of these places, an Alliance will be needed which, only after countless bloody battles, will finally be able to claim the seat of power. The achievement of the objective passes through the demolition of 7 defensive towers, to be attacked only after reaching the appropriate level, within which 5 waves of enemies with increasing potential are faced in succession. The social component of the Sega title is already manifested on these occasions: the attack on the towers in fact always takes place with the help of 3 other players, selected at random or belonging to the same alliance if previously aggregated; in this sort of raid it will be possible to accumulate experience points useful for increasing skills. The aforementioned alliances are a further element of interaction that lovers of the category can only appreciate: in fact, during a random raid it is possible to ask a warrior who has proved to be particularly brave to join your alliance; contact between players is possible thanks to the integrated messaging system that allows communication between all participants. Once the mechanism linked to the actual fight has been addressed (ignoring the characteristics of the characters, given that the differences in approach to battle between swordsman, warrior and magician have been the same for decades), the reasons and the structure of the strategic part remain to be verified by KingdomConquest. The player's goal is basically to build a sort of personal fiefdom, a small private world with which to gradually expand into nearby lands using the squared interface of the game map. By collecting resources (also very classic, such as food and raw materials), you can create an army of monsters and upgrade it, as well as increase the production capacity of buildings. The armies thus created can then be sent to conquer neighboring lands; the outcome of the battle will be decided by the level and characteristics of the individual units. The creatures that make up the army are represented by cards, each endowed with certain qualities but above all with a health bar, which will be consumed after many battles; the experience level of the monster-soldiers is always indicated on the card while the type of troops chosen at the same time (by placing the preferred card on the appropriate spaces of the Unit interface) can reach a maximum of 3. Finally, a further element of interest is given by the exchange of the monster-cards collected with the other players. Technically speaking, the game is no surpriseand indeed it appears decidedly subdued, especially when compared to the standards recently achieved by other productions; it should also be noted that, due to the large amount of information on the screen (especially in RTS mode), the game hud could confuse the player not used to precise touch ~on the fingertips~. A praise goes instead to the online management: Sega, initially taken aback by the success of the game, has gradually opened new servers to expand the number of possible players and, at the time of writing, they have already reached the fifth. In Co-Op battles then there is not the slightest lag, giving a very fun gaming experience anyway. Too bad for the lack of support for Game Center even if it is possible to log in via your Facebook account. KingdomConquest, despite the vast world it contains and the servers to manage, is sold at a cost of zero euros. The reason for the free entry, however, is obvious: Sega focuses heavily on the microtransaction system which, with the purchase of CP (the game's currency), allows you to unlock dungeons, resources and monsters in advance that otherwise you would have to wait for days or even months . The icing on the cake, even the simple construction and upgrading time of buildings can be cut down by spending CP with the consequence, however, always quite annoying, of giving those who spend more than those who wait for the normal timing of the game an advantage in battles.
