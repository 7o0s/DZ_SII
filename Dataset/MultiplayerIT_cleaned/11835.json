{"name": "Rhem Collection - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rhem-collection-recensione.html", "text": "if we stick to the atmosphere, Rhem sails effortlessly with a wisp of wind The first Rhem however, unlike its sequel, abounds in open spaces, making the player feel even worse, forced to admire the freedom that the blue sky above his head offers, while he is forced to extricate himself in a labyrinth of walkways, doors and disturbing machinery with unpredictable functioning. It may seem strange said like this, but the low resolution of the first Rhem offers an added value to the morbid situation in which we got bogged down; we are so used to very high resolutions, even those of us who have played games since time immemorial, that moving in such a visually undefined environment greatly multiplies the sense of alienation. It must be said that as long as we stick to the atmosphere, Rhem sails effortlessly with a breath of wind, but the defects are not slow to take on water, although they may not sink the fun boat of the most diehard puzzlers. The first, glaring weak point, is certainly the absence of any story, or at least of a narrative thread. In this sense Rhem is not an adventure, but a puzzle game made up of puzzles arranged in three-dimensional environments connected to each other. So let's see how Knut Meller's diabolical machine works. Find out your brain age We have already said, Rhem and Rhem 2 are the same game as regards the setting of the gameplay and the concept from which they develop. The second however, unlike the old Rhem, is composed only of underground settings and we will never have the pleasure of seeing the light of day. Furthermore, our brother Zetais will make his sporadic appearance here in the dark, who will communicate with us via video sequences where an actor in the flesh appears to act, with an unconvincing effect and unrelated to the atmosphere of the game. All right, we've already gotten around to it enough and it's time to reveal the backbone of the two games: in a way not dissimilar to what can happen by leafing through the puzzle week, here too you will have nothing to do but solve cumbersome puzzles, one after the other 'other. But be careful because we are talking about complicated, cryptic and intertwined puzzles, to the point that we had to put pen and paper by hand, so as to be able to take note of the suggestions provided by a table or of the configuration with which a certain button sequence. Instead, it is useless to draw a map of the game: by dint of turning it you will have it printed in your mind as if it were the plan of your home. As far as interaction with the environment is concerned, everything takes place in compliance with the most common point and click adventures. With the pointer you will choose the direction in which to advance, immediately passing from one screen to the next without being able to move in the three-dimensional environment. tests of skill and intelligence are studied with care and elegance Find out your brain age Apart from that, an inventory and a compass complete the picture of the interface, reduced to the essentials. As for Rhem 2 in particular, you will have to reassemble a seven-pointed star and recover four keys. Easy isn't it? No. The tests of skill and intelligence are carefully and elegantly designed, but they are enough to make the vast majority of players lose their patience. If I hadn't had to write this article with Pierpaolo threatening to lock me in a labyrinth, I would have raised the white flag halfway through the first Rhem. In fact, after having suddenly met a human being, who told me that he had stayed on Rhem too long not to steal my vehicle and flee, I understood that dozens of sleepless hours awaited me. However, you must not think that once you understand how a display works, it stops being an element to take into consideration, because everything could hide a second function and the key to solving a puzzle can also be found very far from the location of the enigma. Puzzles, puzzles and more puzzles, with the unpleasant feeling that the situation is always on the verge of precipitation, distressed by the possibility of seeing a horrible shape reflected in the glass. An appetizing idea, but so an end in itself and without incentives to continue that it can only find acceptance among a niche of avid cryptologists. It was better when it was worse Once again we prefer Rhem's look and feel, albeit dated, over the more contemporary look of its sequel. It's not out of nostalgia or a spirit of controversy, but the blocky graphics of 1998 lived up to the standards imposed by those years, while Rhem 2's lack of detail and polish causes the rating to plummet.nor technique. If we can only appreciate static screens of an adventure, even if understood in a broad sense, then it is legitimate to expect excellent refinement and a sense of detail from them. It was better when it was worse On the contrary, here only the three-dimensional models are acceptable and even speech, very rare to tell the truth, has tones of voice that sound grotesque. On the contrary, the choice to completely exclude the soundtrack in favor of targeted and disturbing effects is acceptable. Silence in Rhem is undeterred, a cumbersome presence that never leaves you alone. Too bad, however, that it can only be appreciated by a very limited number of players, who, however, can enjoy Knut Meller's work in its entirety, created with Flash and Quicktime. silence in Rhem is undaunted, a cumbersome presence that never leaves you alone PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Operating System: Windows XP Processor: Intel Pentium 500 MHz or higher RAM: 64 MB Video Card: 800x600 32-bit color Sound Card: Integrated Disk Space: 100 MB Comment This collection is decidedly atypical: you have to be among those who found morse code more exciting than G.I.Joe as a child to get the most out of Rhem. The atmosphere is good, sometimes intriguing, but there is no valid reason why you should be where you are and want to leave, other than that you can finally archive the game in your collection after solving so many puzzles that make you feel inadequate Ryuta Kawashima and his damn Brain Training for DS. In retrospect, Rhem lives up to expectations, even if a posthumous judgment struggles to maintain itself, especially considering that the sequel keeps the solid gameplay unchanged, but does not even offer a hint of improvement, even a mild attempt to renew itself. Patience, as they are, they can only attract those who want to dive into a world of puzzles to be solved without respite, up to the final tunnel where a light should shine. If you get there, let us know if there is life after death. Pros Puzzles among the best you could wish for An atmosphere that sticks to the skin In its own way unique Cons Total absence of any narrative aspect Intended for a narrow niche Technical execution lackluster Rhem Collection is available for PC. Rhem is a non-place. You get there without knowing why or from where, in the hope of being able to escape, even if the destination elsewhere remains unknown to both the player and his avatar. Unfortunately these premises are ideal for setting up a heavy and oppressive atmosphere, but leave many doubts about the fact that Rhem can be considered an adventure in all respects in the widespread sense of the term. It is no coincidence that it was decided to omit the number that distinguishes the prequel from the first chapter, because although about seven years separate them, the game remains the same. Let's start from the hypothetical principle of a non-existent narration, or rather your arrival in Rhem (it was the year 1998 of the real world), by means of a locomotion vehicle. Uncertainty is a hallmark of this series. The reality around us is shown at a resolution of 800x600, at the time more than decent and effectively exploited by Knut Meller, who seems to be the only man behind the development of Rhem. No wonder if a bad feeling sticks to the nape of the neck without leaving us for a minute: who among us can imagine a place on earth where no human being really exists and the artifacts or buildings seem abandoned for millennia, as if they were have always existed.
