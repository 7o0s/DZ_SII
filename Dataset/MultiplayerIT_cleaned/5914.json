There is no need to make a drama of it, however, because the game deserves consideration under several aspects, both in terms of its really high-profile technical realization, and for the depth of the gameplay which, although not reaching the levels of the classic Firaxis, manages to propose a good and multifaceted strategic challenge to those looking for a game on their mobile device that can keep their brain busy. The story and the setting are presented as a reinterpretation of the themes of X-Com with some influence of Command & Conquer, and see the player engaged in a continuous fight against mutant creatures that arose on Earth following the impact with a meteorite, which has led to the spread of an alien mineral with precious energy properties but with a very high level of toxicity. The general instability that has spread throughout the world has led to a continuous state of war, in which various groups of mercenaries thrive, including the team that we find ourselves leading within the many missions (hundreds, it seems) of the Campaign by X-Mercs. Nothing particularly new or charismatic on the narrative and characterization front, therefore, but a rigorous adherence to a certain imagery that makes it a strategic one, decidedly more focused on the game than on the extra-playful elements. However, there is a curious tendency towards a certain sexualisation of the characters, given that all the managers of the sections of the base are provocative damsels with sexy attitudes, perhaps with a reference to titles such as Red Alert 3 but completely lacking the typical self-irony with which the EA game tempers the presence of various models. The structure is typical of turn-based strategy, with the sequential control of the various team members within the amount of action points available for each faction in combat and characters with different specializations to be placed on the field and used tactically in based on various characteristics. The battle phases alternate with management ones, also in this case taken from X-Com, with the construction of the base and various sectors to be controlled for the production of weapons, medicines and various technologies. If you're looking for a new X-Com-style strategy game, you've found it in X-Mercs Please wait The interface is well designed for the touch screen and perfectly responsive, with the only minor problem sometimes given by the small size of the icons and texts which on smaller screens can become difficult to interpret, but it looks good like X-Mercs , unlike its more well-known 2K Games model, is a game designed and structured for mobile devices in the simplicity and clarity, in some ways even excessive, of the game mechanics. Also in this case we have various action points to move the fighters on the checkerboard map, trying to position them in a tactical way, covered by any attacks but with the possibility of hitting the opponents. The coverage and line of fire system is simpler here, with fewer parameters to take into consideration and in general a more predictable and spartan game mechanic than X-Com but still enjoyable and more suitable for use on mobile devices, even in this case. The management of the base is also simplified, although the things to do between research, development and expansion of the structures are still many and offer a good variety of action. What largely ruins the gaming experience is the setting of microtransactions: it is true that it is possible to play even without spending money, but provided you have truly unwavering patience, since almost every event in the management sector requires long processing times. waiting, obviously pushing us to cut breaks with micro-transactions (which often aren't even that much ~micro~, since they cost 99 euros) capable of speeding up processes. Resurrecting a fallen character, healing soldiers, building a new structure, carrying out research are all actions that require several minutes of waiting, even whole hours, unless you proceed to spend credits, which forces you to limit the sessions I play about 20-30 minutes each time before running into a new forced wait. One cannot help but think that a Premium version release would have greatly benefited X-Mercs, or in any case the possibility of redeeming it definitively, instead of finding oneself entangledor in a somewhat sneaky micro-transaction system. It's a pity because beyond a certain flatness in the story and in the characterization, the game mechanics, although strongly derivative, work really well and there are really many things to do during the Campaign between the combat and management phases.", "date": "2015-11-06", "grade": "7.5"}
