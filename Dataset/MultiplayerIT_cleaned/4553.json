So why are we talking in the past tense? Simple: by now the time available to launch a game from the main series for the pink ball, a decent one, has expired. For that we will have to wait for Kirby Star Allies on Nintendo Switch next year. Instead, we had to settle for three spin-offs released within a few months of each other, all on Nintendo 3DS: Team Kirby Clash Deluxe (a fighting game), Kirby Blowout Blast (an action-platform), and finally the title in question. Namely Kirby Battle Royale, an action-party game that is probably also the most successful of the three, or at least it seems much more complete. Attack of the Clones (Pink) No, we are not talking about Star Wars, but always about Kirby Battle Royale. This time, even if it seemed impossible, the director has opted for an even more disengaged, light and enjoyable plot. We won't have to save the world or stop King Dedede's henchmen yet again. Instead, our goal is to get our hands on the prettiest (and probably the best) cake Kirby has ever seen. But it won't be easy: our rival No. 1 has announced the Gran Tort Dedede, a tournament in which the bravest warriors will compete, and only the winner will be able to enjoy the coveted prize. There is more. At the tournament it seems that the entries are only ... Kirby. Apart from our unique and original hero, we are literally invaded by an incalculable number of other yellow, blue, red and green palettes. This is because King Dedede has created a Kirby-print, a device with which to create clone copies of the mascot, equipped with his own powers. Some Indian saying comes to mind according to which we are our enemies, and similar melodramatic phrases; the fact is that Kirby is only interested in the cake, the presence of a thousand copies identical to him does not surprise him that much. All this (and little else) will be told to you during the initial stages of the Story Mode of Kirby Battle Royale, then the plot will completely fade into the background and the stars will be the mini-games. After all, the title consists only of this: a group of ten small party games, reshuffled, varied, reproposed, and basically always the same. The presence of a single-player mode makes solo use at least pleasant, creating a thin thread that keeps the different challenges together. In all, to win that blessed cake, we will have to complete five leagues of increasing difficulty: ranging from that for beginners to the platinum league, in which the opponents will border on infamy. To pass from one to the other it will be necessary to accumulate points after points by completing the various mini-games proposed. But don't think that it will take who knows how long: a couple of hours and the delicious prize will be yours. Powers, challenges, and online slaps The main menu, clean and intuitive, immediately shows how Story Mode is just one of the possibilities offered by Kirby Battle Royale. Of course, at the base there are always and only those ten mini-games we mentioned earlier, but they can be played both offline against the artificial intelligence (or three other friends locally), and online up to a maximum of four players. Are you among those who complained that in the last Mario Party you couldn't challenge friends and players from all over the world? Narrow escape, this time the direction begins to be the right one: the online features in a title like this do not only promote longevity, they are simply the basis. Even if the combination does not take into account the skill of the players on the pitch. We also thought the variety of mini-games was good, for what looks like the first real Kirby party game, even if still seasoned with action mechanics. They range from Implacable Arena, where the aim is simply to beat each other up and whoever stays standing wins, to Acchiappamele, in which we will have to accumulate more fruit than our opponents in our basket within the time limit. All this passing through numerous other inspired challenges, such as Cacciacoin, in which we improvise treasure hunters by escaping the curse of ghosts as well as the aims of our opponents. It goes without saying that both online and against artificial intelligence, improprieties and shoving are the life of the party, between stolen apples, fake alliances and opponents thrown in the air to buy time. Sometimes, perhaps, the confusion becomes excessive and luck seems to count more than the player's skill, but it is still a risk inherent in the genre, nor is the intent of the production to try other paths. The combat system is very intuitive. Our hero can jump, floatleap into the air and perform only two types of attack, the lunge and light blows (which at most can be charged). It is immediately noticeable that the peculiarity of Kirby is missing, that is the possibility of absorbing enemies by acquiring particular powers and abilities. Probably a choice due to wanting to leave the gameplay as simple as possible; among other things it is not that the transformations are completely absent, it is possible to select the ~form~ of Kirby before each battle and it will only have value for that specific period of time. In all there are 13 special abilities present, which must be unlocked by continuing in the adventure or with game coins, rewards for completing specific objectives. There is also an arena where you can test the various enhancements of the pink palette one at a time, to find the one that suits us best. Too bad that it is still a very sparing production of content, also sold at full price.", "date": "2017-11-14", "grade": "7.0"}
