The visual component is an excellence in the field of two-dimensional graphics that stifles discussions of video games as an art form, while the brutality of certain puzzles, especially if completed without taking advantage of the integrated solution, quickly bring even the most contemplative players back to reality. In between there is a perfect narrative style, with images and music almost without the aid of text on the screen, and an exciting yet simple story. Minigames that stick to the strictly videogame field and many references that instead clearly show how varied the knowledge of those who developed it. A really good mosaic and finally brought to Apple devices thanks to a conversion available only on iPad 2. The rescue The story of Machinarium is that of a small robot and the quest he will have to complete to save his metallic girlfriend, who ended up in the clutches of the Black Cap Brotherhood. The backdrop, a steampunk city of a dystopian future, is the perfect theater for the melancholic hues that characterize the entire experience. There are no extraordinarily imaginative or complex events to tell, it is true, but the way in which the narrative gears move is textbook and shows all the ability of Amanita Design in terms of use of images. In this sense, it is useless to dwell on the quality of the tables, over thirty, that make up the game because those accompanying the article are more than explanatory, while the animations are not in industrial quantities but always beautiful. The graphic adventure gameplay is traditional and asks you to collect, combine and reuse the objects found on the seabed, alternating the resolution of environmental puzzles with that of some puzzles which are also quite classic. Without the texts, the dialogues are also inevitably missing, but the gameplay is already properly supported by a number of situations on which to break your head, also because as mentioned at the beginning there are more passages that require you to rack your brain to understand how to advance towards the block following. The slender game structure and even more slender interface not only guarantee the effect of interacting with a wonderful cartoon, but also facilitated the conversion work. By pointing the finger, the interactions are carried out, the protagonist moves and the height varies, which can lengthen or shorten as needed. Sometimes it happens that some hot spots are particularly small and close together, with the mouse cursor working better than the index finger, but with a little patience the problem is solved. The two help systems are, at worst, always available in the double form of a single speech bubble indicating the object to focus on to solve the main puzzle of that scheme, or a more complex explanation but whose access is complicated by the completing a short shoot'em up. Finally, the icing on the cake is represented by the sound which, despite the apparent scope of the project, has received exceptional care and deserves to be enjoyed with headphones rather than with the small speaker integrated into the iPad 2.
