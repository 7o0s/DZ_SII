From references to the original material to the creation of an excellent cast of characters, passing through the participation of historical voices (such as James Earl Jones behind the mask of Darth Vader or Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian), Filoni and his team have concluded a first season receiving full marks from fans and critics. Developed by the Canadian group Gigataur, Recon Missions is a small video game for smartphones and tablets based on the heroes and settings of Star Wars Rebels. It must be said that attempts to make Star Wars games on iOS and Android have led to mediocre tower defense and bad card games, but this time fans find themselves in their hands a much more interesting platformer. Jedi, petty thieves and bombers in the first mobile platformer based on Star Wars Rebels Spark of rebellion Set a few years before the adventures of Luke, Han and Leia in A New Hope, Star Wars Rebels features a small group of revolutionaries intent on opposing the tyranny of the Galactic Empire, with the aim of igniting a first and small spark of rebellion. Recon Missions allows you to take on the role of three of the six Ghost members seen in the TV series: Ezra Bridger, a young and agile petty thief, can hit opponents from a distance with his energy slingshot; Kanan Jarrus is instead a Jedi who escaped Order 66, able to use both a blaster and a lightsaber; finally there's Sabine Wren, the Mandalorian bombshell who can plant explosives and fire rapid shots with her two pistols. While tackling each of the 36 levels, it becomes evident how the developers have drawn heavily from the genre: Recon Missions is a rich and fun platformer, but far from original, incorporating many of the more classic elements of the genre. From double jumps to platforms that sink into lava, from timed lasers to enemies that attack you only when you turn your back on them, in terms of design, Gigataur's game is a soup of ideas seen and reviewed, even in the Star franchise itself Wars. When Kanan leaps and swings his lightsaber, for example, Super Return of the Jedi can't help but come to mind. Between one level and another, the developers have tried to add some small theme variations anyway: it happens that you have to defend a radio transmitter from the attack of droids and stormtroopers, create havoc while driving an AT-MP, or face face to face with a TIE fighter. Combining jumps and blaster shots is a lot of fun, but it's a pity that drawing the lightsaber isn't so much fun. Of the three characters available, Kanan is the only one able to face enemies in close combat, but using the Jedi weapon not only does not give satisfaction, but it is also often the fastest way to take damage and risk your skin. Considering then that when you get hit you can lose temporary power-ups, paradoxically it's better to impersonate Ezra or just use the blaster from a distance. Furthermore, the characters are not the only ones who would have deserved a more careful balance: the difficulty level remains quite low for the entire duration of the campaign, but towards the final stages it undergoes a couple of sharp surges during the boss fights. To lengthen the stock, there is also a whole series of extra content that encourages you to replay the levels already completed even after the end credits. In fact, between one mission and another, you move inside the Refuge of the Rebels, a sort of hub that allows you to obtain new challenges and can be embellished by unlocking structures, graffiti, animals and droids. Civilians are hidden within the levels to be rescued, and who will gradually populate the Refuge, while the ~Hope~ points collected can be spent to unlock new skills and upgrades. Little to say instead about the aesthetic realization: even without particular peaks, Recon Missions looks pretty good, but most of the materials are taken directly from the TV series. This goes both for the few cutscenes (the game opens with a collage of highlights from the first season), and for the music and the voices of the characters, with some jokes and phrases dubbed by Vanessa Marshall, Freddie Prinze Jr. and the rest of the original cast.", "date": "2015-04-09", "grade": "7.5"}
