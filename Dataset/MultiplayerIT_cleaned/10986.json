Precisely speaking of the latter we can say that it fits perfectly into the usual schemes: you, elite paratrooper of the British SAS, will be sent for who knows what reason alone behind enemy lines to eliminate three prominent figures of the Nazi hierarchy, taking care of massacre anyone you meet on your way, also because, in addition to the Nazi soldiers, you will not be able to meet anyone else. The whole game is nothing more than advancing along a labyrinth of houses and walls built by the developers, until you get to the elimination of a soldier who has a slightly different aesthetic model from that mass of twins you exterminated just before, coincidentally , represents just one of the three leaders mentioned above. Don't even expect a fight with the boss at the end of the level, which raises the level of difficulty: your target will have the same artificial deficiency as all his subordinates, as well as having the same resistance to bullets and this leads, in essence, to the fact that you will be able to kill him as easily as you eliminated the others. For retro lovers, City Interactive also offers us the enigma of the key: more than once you will find yourself in front of an irretrievably closed door and you will have to go around the whole map (basically, get to the end of the long corridor) to be able to continue the adventure. The question is: is it worth continuing in a game that boasts 4-year-old graphics, a total absence of game design and, even more serious in a shooter, absolutely poor artificial intelligence, which does not offer the slightest challenge? The Concept of Budget Selling video games at a price lower than the market average is undoubtedly an excellent initiative to discourage piracy and allow those with limited funds to enjoy this means of entertainment. It therefore represents a contradiction to decide to invest your savings in securities that are not worth the amount spent: why buy a poor product, such as this Operation Thunderstorm, when with little more than the same amount you can enjoy certainly more rewarding titles? We therefore do not feel like counting its reduced selling price among the pros of this title: being a budget must not be synonymous with low quality and we have no intention of giving City Interactive such an extenuating circumstance. Comment Operation Thunderstorm is one of those games that for no reason we can advise you to buy, even if it is sold at a budget price, given and considering its long pedigree of negative sides: outdated graphics, ancient game mechanics, artificial intelligence at a minimum , boring after the first ten minutes of the game and we could go on like this for much longer. Pros Also suitable for 5 year old computers Cons Graphically poor Boring beyond belief Operation Thunderstorm is available for PC. PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 4 2.0 GHz or AMD 2200+ RAM: 512 MB Video Card: GeForce 5700 or Radeon 9700 128 MB Disk Space: 3.0 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core Duo E8400 @ 3.0 GHz RAM: 4 GB Card Video: AMD Radeon 4870 X2 Operating System: Windows Vista Home Premium The years go by, but it seems that for some developers it is hopelessly easier to focus on the usual hackneyed clichs, rather than venturing into something slightly more original. If you are not exactly strangers to the world of video games, you will also know that City Interactive is not only synonymous with budget games, but also with very poor quality titles, which very often do not even justify the reduced outlay: thanks to the purchase of the Jupiter FX license (the outdated F.E.A.R. engine), therefore this Operation Thunderstorm is proposed to us again, essentially a clone in a modern version of the never too mentioned Wolfeinstein 3D. It certainly sounds like a rather risky comparison, but the gameplay that the title offers is substantially identical to that seen in id Software's masterpiece, only re-proposed 10 years later: but instead of revolutionizing a genre, City Interactive's game does nothing but put themselves forward as a candidate for one of the worst games of 2008.", "date": "2008-12-08", "grade": null}
