Trenches is one of those titles that tries to fill this gap, but obviously thanks to a review and simplification of the theme, which is interesting in any case, it is quite fun. The scenario, however sketchy, is that of the First World War (God save us from yet another retelling of the Second) and the player finds himself in command of British troops in an attempt to drive the Germans out of France. We therefore find ourselves in a two-dimensional context in which, starting from the left front, it is necessary to reach the right one having the better of the opposing troops and without depleting the war funds which are accumulated automatically over time, and are used to acquire the various types of teams available. Let's hunt the invaders! In fact, we have light infantry, snipers, mortars, heavy infantry and the possibility of calling in special attacks and from above such as poison gas and missiles, to turn the battle in your favor. The conformation of the battlefield, made up of small ditches and barbed wire trenches, increases the strategic sense. In the first case, by placing the troops inside them, the defensive bonus increases considerably and therefore allows you to counter enemy attacks quite well, to clean up a piece of the field and then continue, except however being attacked from above. Conversely, trying to attack enemies in a ditch almost always means losing your troops, and even in this case you have to flush them out by backing away or hitting with special weapons. Barbed wire, on the other hand, simply slows down troop movements, and it is therefore good to cross it when there are no opponents nearby, to avoid nasty surprises. The money to buy your own troops, as mentioned, are added automatically, and their frequency increases or not based on where you are, the gameplay of the game is therefore all linked to maintaining the position, attacking and not too aggressive progress to avoid being annihilated. The main campaign has 3 difficulty levels, which modify the amount of enemies and their frequency of special attacks, while there is also a Skirmish mode through which it is possible to face the Germans in a map with customized characteristics, up to unlock some zombies for a timed endurance test. Supported by a simple but effective graphic style that does its job, Trenches therefore offers a rather interesting and intriguing gameplay, a pity however that the single player mode is very short and that it is possible to complete it in less than half an hour, with few extra modes and any multiplayer component - which would have been good given the type of game - it being understood that the title developed by Thunder Game Work currently costs only 0.79 cents. Last but not least, Trenches also supports Open Feint, a social network that provides objectives, 21 related to all levels of difficulty, and online rankings to compare the score globally and with one's friends.
