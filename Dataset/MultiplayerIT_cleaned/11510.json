{"name": "Alexa: Episode 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/alexa-episode-2.html", "text": "Among the most interesting action games in the mobile sector, those that have borrowed the structure of the famous Flashback, the masterpiece developed by Delphine Software in 1992, stand out. It is a setting that sees the stages divided into various ~screens~, with a certain number of enemies and/or obstacles, to be ~solved~ as if it were a puzzle game. Alexa relies on a classic scrolling to add dynamism to the action, but the references to the title Delphine are clear as regards the movement of the character, the jumps, the management of platforms and weapons. From the start screen we can access the only available mode, which sees Alexa hired to defeat a powerful terrorist group. Ours will have to wander around a series of stages, locate enemies and eliminate them one at a time, avoiding traps and trying to do their job in silence, without being spotted. The game is organized so that each level is a short challenge, to be faced at any time, respecting one of the peculiarities of mobile video games. This does not mean that it lacks depth, however: Alexa can perform a large number of actions and has a respectable arsenal, which strongly influences the way we approach opponents. Facing an enemy head on often results in the loss of part of our vital energy, so we can also proceed silently and catch him off guard. Among our gadgets, in fact, there is an occulter which makes us invisible for a short period of time and which allows us to carry out killings without making any noise: once it reaches the enemy, Alexa produces a series of lethal blows to knock him out . The management of weapons is simple, with a key assigned to their selection, and you can move within the stages with a certain agility, thanks to a control system that responds promptly to inputs. The presence of traps (mines, in particular) and holds add further variety to the gameplay, since we will be able to hang from the ceiling and proceed without touching the floor. The protagonist is well drawn, although far from sensual, and has a decent animation. There are games with an extremely similar structure, for example Cyberpunk: The Arasaka's Plot or the transposition of Turok, which however boast much better graphics, more accurate especially in terms of animations. The opponents are almost all aesthetically identical, while the locations boast a good level of detail. Unfortunately there is only one level of scrolling, and the sound sector as usual does not shine in quality. Finally, it must also be said that technically this Episode 2 is almost identical to Deadly Agent, so the developers didn't waste too much and thought, more than anything else, of creating a simple ~more of the same~ below all points of view. Finally, nothing to say about the control system: simple, immediate, it responds promptly to commands. PRO Good gaming facility Equipped with a certain thickness Technically decent... AGAINST ...but we've seen much better Identical to the previous episode Designed for quick use", "date": "2008-04-04", "grade": "S.V."}
