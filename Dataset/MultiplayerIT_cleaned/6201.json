{"name": "SD Gundam Battle Alliance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sd-gundam-battle-alliance-recensione.html", "text": "It practically happens that on a torrid August evening you are assembling a gunpla - a Cao Cao Wing from the SDW Heroes line, to be exact - when they offer you the review of SD Gundam Battle Alliance and, since you are a bit lost among all Gundam games that have recently also come out in our area, your first thought is that it's yet another multiplayer fighting game/shooter, like Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation 2, but with Super Deformed mechs which, for the uninitiated, means that their heads are huge and disproportionate to their bodies. So you accept the assignment with little enthusiasm, but you discover, once you have challenged the DualSense, that you have taken a blunder because the new title inspired by the immortal mecha created in '79 by Yoshiyuki Tomino is very different from what you expected. G universe SD Gundam Battle Alliance, the story is just a pretext It is useless to discuss the plot of a game like this, which is more an excuse to put together, in the same product, dozens and dozens of Gundams taken from the original series - the so-called Universal Century - and its thousand thousand spin-offs, including Iron Blooded Orphans, Wing, AGE and so on. Suffice it to say that, in the role of a generic Mobile Suit pilot during the famous One Year War, you will discover that you don't really exist, and rather that you belong to an immense database, called the G Universe, which preserves the history of Gundam. The artificial intelligences that monitor these recordings have detected a series of ~anomalies~ that tend to modify the canon: you will notice them when Ramba Ral's Gouf, attacking the White Base that you have to defend in the initial mission on Earth, will suddenly transform into Barbatos Martian by Augus Mikazuki. From that moment on, SD Gundam Battle Alliance is structured through a series of stages that are divided into two categories: Anomalies and Real. In the Anomalies you relive some iconic moments in the different Gundam anime, only there are Mobile Suits and characters out of place, which you will often have to fight or defend. The story develops between one stage and another and, during them, through a series of redundant dialogues between the various supporting actors and the artificial intelligences. Sometimes you'll even be able to chime in on the conversation, choosing an answer, but we didn't feel like it significantly changed the narrative. For each Anomaly, at a certain point, the corresponding Royal stage is also unlocked. These missions are the real gems for fans, as they allow you to relive the original story without interference, in the company of the authentic protagonists who exchange more or less the same lines as the reference anime with allies and opponents. SD Gundam Battle Alliance, the Barbatos (6th form) is one of the first Mobile Suits you will unlock They are hit and run missions, lasting no more than 5-10 minutes each, which at times seem much more suitable for a mobile experience such as the one that the Nintendo Switch version would offer, which however we have not had the opportunity to test. We have played on PlayStation 5, experiencing almost instantaneous loading between missions and headquarters, in reality a modest interface that allows access to various screens and customization services. It is clear, however, that SD Gundam Battle Alliance is a cross-gen production, which in fact is also available in the PlayStation 4 version, and therefore does not show off who knows which jaw-breaking technical sector. Fortunately, the Super Deformed style does not aim for realism and the search for lavish detail, hiding any graphic imperfections behind the squat but detailed and more than decently animated 3D models. Drawing on over twenty animated series, SD Gundam Battle Alliance also offers an important variety of original music, settings and Mobile Suits that tend to suffocate the feeling of repetitiveness that inevitably occurs once the claws are sunk into its actual skeleton. Gundam Hunter SD Gundam Battle Alliance, you can increase the individual parameters of Mobile Suits Once we understood the gameplay loop on which the entire game is based, we spent a few hours looking for a comparison, until our eye fell on the Switch Dock parked next to the TV and Monster came to mind Hunter. It seems like a risky comparison, but it's not. The missions are nibbled in more or less the same way, but this is not so much what establishes a connection between the two titles, as the fact that in the different stages we will randomly come across Parts and Projects. The former are essentially randomly generated components that are used to upgrade the Mobile Suits in the headquarters hangar, improving its parameters or adding skillspassives such as the automatic guard and the like. Projects, on the other hand, are used to unlock the Mobile Suits to control. Often multiple Projects are needed to complete the development of a new mecha, and for the most famous Gundams, such as Amuro Ray's iconic RX-78, certain missions will have to be repeated a considerable number of times. In short, we are in the field of ~farming~, even if the immediacy of the gameplay helps to alleviate the sense of monotony. SD Gundam Battle Alliance, the variety of scenarios is commendable The fact is that SD Gundam Battle Alliance is not really just an action game, but also a sort of RPG complete with experience points, level ups and statistics to be increased or decreased by paying in capitals, practically the currency of the G universe that we will find by defeating the enemies in the various stages. By reaching certain levels, you also unlock slots for modifiers that grant very specific skills and bonuses, which depend on the completed Mobile Suit pilots. The partners that we will choose to accompany us on a mission - a maximum of two among the Mobile Suit pilots that we have unlocked - also increase in level, but in the sense of Friendship, and in doing so they acquire additional skills and advantages that can influence the clashes in significantly. It's a shame that the artificial intelligence is flawed and that these battlemates just shoot a bit at random without respecting the predefined role of their Mobile Suits. For this reason, it is better to repeat the missions online, perhaps together with two friends, taking advantage of the multiplayer mode to complete them faster, especially when the game's tough bosses have to be faced. SD Gundam Battle Alliance, certain bosses are huge The many Mobile Suits are basically divided into three roles - Universals, Snipers and Fighters - which determine their specific skills. As you can tell from the names, the Universals are real wildcards, the Snipers are better off with ranged weapons while the Brawlers are unstoppable in melee. Archetypes are important for identifying the fighting style of a certain Mobile Suit, but nothing prevents you from enhancing the ranged weapons of a Brawler or, conversely, the melee attacks of a Sniper. Special abilities called Role Actions, however, grant specific bonuses, and it's something to keep in mind when assembling your team in the more advanced stages. Although it is possible to choose between two difficulty levels - Easy and Normal - some stages can prove to be tougher than they should be, above all because enemies tend to surround the player or target him from elevated positions that are not easily accessible. SD Gundam Battle Alliance, could the RX-78 be missing? Indeed, at first glance, the missions are reminiscent of titles of the musou genre: especially in the advanced stages of the game we will find ourselves fighting wave after wave of Mobile Suits, but the apparently essential combat system hides more than one gem, so the Tutorial missions, which are oddly optional, are worth playing. Basically you move around the 3D environment using thrusters to sprint or jump, always keeping in mind that they recharge over time. In addition to a generic and predefined ranged weapon, each Mobile Suit can attack with two melee shots and chain them into simple combos which, however, executed with a certain timing and in the correct order, allow enemies to be thrown into the air and prolong the chain of attacks. A series of special maneuvers, such as the Break Chain attack, parries and perfect dodges give the combat system a more technical flavor, and there are encounters, especially against certain bosses, in which every possibility must be exploited to WIN. Bosses are usually protected by mechanics such as the Balance bar, which prevents them from being thrown, or the Anti-laser barriers, which absorb a certain number of damage from a distance, which must be circumvented, under penalty of Game Over. SD Gundam Battle Alliance, Mobile Suits are divided into three roles Fortunately, in addition to the normal combos and firearms, each Mobile Suit also has two secondary Weapons that depend on the role and which usually invest precisely on its main capabilities. Each secondary weapon depends on a reserve that recharges over time, and can be chained into certain combos using the most sophisticated maneuvers, such as the so-called rapid interruptions, which in fighting games we would more commonly call ~cancel~. Finally, the ASPs take care of closing the circle, practically the super moves that are very slow to load, but which once activated inflict enormous damage to the targets complete with a cutscene.or of SD Gundam Battle Alliance is far from trivial and can give quite a few satisfactions, but the not exactly reactive controls and the dysfunctional camera, which often tends to go about its business, forcing us to manually reposition it each time, represent a real and own thorn in the side. Fortunately, these are not angularities such as to ruin an immediate title that does exactly what it is supposed to do: amuse fans with an immoderate fanservice which, for once, relies on a solid and engaging structure.", "date": "2022-09-03", "grade": "7.0"}
