{"name": "Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/psi-ops-the-mindgate-conspiracy_a.html", "text": "With only the laying on of hands I can anoint your jacket and tie Psi-Ops opens with the sequence of the capture of Nick Scryer and his men by the terrorists of the Movement, an armed group intent on conquering the world using the psychic powers of their senior officers. Locked in a cell awaiting brainwashing, our hero is freed by the charming Sara, a mole within the organization. And it is from this point that the player takes control of the action. Initially, due to amnesia, Nick does not have any psychic powers, so Psi-Ops appears as an action game similar to many others: it is possible to jump, crouch, punch and kick, walk close to walls and, obviously , shoot different types of weapons (pistols, machine guns, shotguns and sniper rifles). In short, nothing new under the sun. But it takes just a few minutes of play to get to the awakening of the first and most important of the six psychic powers executable by the brave Nick for everything to change. For the better, that is. In fact, Telekinesis allows you to move objects and enemies with the strength of the mind alone, with the related (exhilarating) effects that follow in terms of gameplay. Speaking from a strictly material point of view, Telekinesis proves to be useful in attracting distant objects (such as ammunition, weapons, medkits and so on), as well as in exploiting crates, barrels or anything else to create rudimentary stairs or bridges. But, obviously, this power proves its effectiveness above all in combat: it is therefore possible to throw objects (and why not, even corpses) at the enemies, or use Telekinesis on the opponents themselves, eliminating them by making them fall into the void, or slamming them repeatedly against the walls, or even simply approaching them and finishing them off with a volley of shots while they are helpless and suspended in mid-air. And these are just a few examples: Psi-Ops exalts the freedom granted to the player to use his powers as he prefers, guaranteeing an almost constant flow of fun for the entire duration of the adventure. But as mentioned, Scryer's prowess does not end there: therefore we have Remote Viewing, which allows you to look through doors and walls; Mind Drain, indispensable for recharging the psychic energy indicator by ~sucking it~ from corpses or enemies still alive, provided you take them by surprise; Mind Control, which as expected allows you to temporarily take possession of an opponent's body; Pyrokinesis, or the power to generate a lethal wall of flames; and finally Aura View, the most useless skill and protagonist of the most boring and frustrating section of the game, necessary to see elements invisible to the human eye. Compare versions Available for PS2 and Xbox, Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy denotes, as was to be expected, a greater graphic cleanliness in its incarnation for the Microsoft console. Nothing striking, mind you, but as in almost all cross-platform titles, the Xbox version comes out the winner from a cosmetic point of view mainly thanks to more defined textures and slightly better lighting effects. No difference, however, as regards the frame rate and the fluidity of the game. The PS2 version, however, compensates for the lower visual performance with a more comfortable control system, especially as regards the execution of the various psychic powers. Confessions of a dangerous mind The presence of six different psychic powers, however, would have had little reason to exist without a well-studied level design that stimulated the user to act in a different way from the classic behavior a la Rambo; in Psi-Ops basically every encounter with enemy units is susceptible to different approaches, depending on the situation and the skill you want to use. In fact, the player is rarely given a way forward in exterminating his enemies, thus leaving room for creativity. Let's take a room with a group of soldiers as an example: you can very well come out, attack your opponents with Pyrokinesis and finish them off with bursts of machine guns while shielding yourself with an object thanks to Telekinesis. But in the same situation you can take a look around with Remote Viewing, take possession of a soldier with Mind Control and make him kill his comrades with a grenade, and then get rid of the victim by making him commit suicide or finishing him with his own hands. These are just the first two examples that come to mind of a typical Psi-Ops situation, which makes interactivity with the elements of the game scenario one of its greatest strengths. Fun in terms of fights cwith the enemies and stimulating in the resolution of the puzzles (not too complex, but always and in any case solvable in different ways), the Midway title flows away which is a pleasure, to the point that the conclusion is reached all too soon. Five hours of play are enough to complete the adventure, which leaves the user with an ending that is nothing short of open and a decent selection of extras capable of extending the life of the title by a little. From a technical point of view, Psi-Ops performs its duty very well without however ever particularly surprising. Graphically speaking, the Midway product defends itself well, with convincing polygonal models, well-crafted (albeit a bit monotonous) settings and good quality animations. On the other hand, the physical model used by the game is exceptional, thanks to the Havok 2 engine, capable of making the reactions of objects and bodies to the user's requests extremely credible (and often extremely spectacular). Although there is a lack of style in terms of character design and characterization of the scenarios, therefore, Psi-Ops remains a cosmetically more than valid title. The sound sector is also good, with music and effects that may not leave their mark in the history of video games but which fulfill their duty satisfactorily. Comment Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy is an excellent action game, capable of bringing a breath of fresh air to its genre thanks to an innovative concept and of flawlessly implementing its ideas within a gameplay with a very solid structure. With the exception of some unhappy sections, playing the Midway title is a continuous pleasure, dictated by the variety of situations proposed and by the freedom perceived by the player in using his powers as he sees fit. Strengthened also by the support of a good quality audiovisual sector, Psi-Ops is a product that with a higher longevity and greater attention to detail could perhaps have risen to the status of a real milestone, but which at present still remains a title that all action game lovers should seriously consider. Pros: Innovative, varied and fun gameplay Functional control system Technically well done Cons: Rather short longevity Some less successful game sections If you thought psychic powers were only for bending teaspoons or exploding glasses, you were dead wrong. Or at least, this is what Midway means with the present Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, a brand new action game starring Nick Scryer, a marine capable of performing exceptional feats exclusively thanks to the power of the mind. In other words: machine guns and shotguns are fine, but psychic powers are even better for killing enemies. And after thoroughly testing the Midway product, we can only agree with that statement.", "date": "2004-09-16", "grade": null}
