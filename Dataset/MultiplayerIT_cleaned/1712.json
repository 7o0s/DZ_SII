{"name": "Dead To Rights", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-to-rights-7.html", "text": "Bullies, babes and... Rin Tin Tin? Dead To Rights is basically a shoot'em up with a third-person view, but it tries to introduce a certain number of variations to a gameplay already savored in other video games (first of all that of Remedy, of course). Already during the introductory tutorial you get a taste of what the game will offer. Sections in which one must have accurate aim and a cunning trigger alternate with sections in which, unarmed, we will have to resort to the use of the oldest weapon in the world, eight beautiful gnarled and bony knuckles, in what would appear to be an interesting union between a shoot'em up and a beat'em up. In addition to this, in some points it is mandatory to take control of our faithful ally Shadow, a beautiful husky ready to jump into the fray to disarm enemies or to sneak into narrow tunnels inaccessible to humans to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. In the shooter sections, the automatic aim is greatly appreciated, given the large amount of enemies on the screen: by holding down the right trigger, in fact, the target is locked, which remains in the center of the viewfinder until the trigger is released . However, this choice does not negatively affect the level of challenge, which remains high given the large number of opponents you are facing simultaneously. A positive and innovative note that Dead To Rights offers is that of using human shields to continue in the hottest and most crowded areas of the game. By approaching an enemy and pressing the B key, you can deprive him of his weapon. The unarmed man can be kept as a human shield and will take enemy shots on our behalf, at least until his energy bar runs out or until we decide to get rid of him with a headshot. Blood and brutality are therefore not lacking, and will delight all those who adore ultra-violent games and Hong Kong action films. There are also levels in which you have to shoot from a subjective point of view through a viewfinder as happened in the unforgettable Operation Wolf and all its clones. When you run out of ammunition or when you are unarmed, you have to use your hands to get the better of criminals. If the shooting phases of the game are all in all pleasant in their adrenaline frenzy, when you have to continue slapping the Namco title shows obvious limits. The availability of only two combos, one of kicks and one of punches, a couple of different grapples and a few meager evasive moves does not offer enough variety to satisfy the player in the long run. Dulcis, so to speak, in the end, here are the minigames. From time to time you have to overcome subgames of a different nature in order to continue the story. Any examples? You have to make a ballerina dance, punch a punching bag, pick locks, lift a barbell over 300 pounds or win arm wrestling, all by pressing the right key at the right time, or defuse bombs by moving a dot along a sort of path without letting him touch the edges. Someone might consider minigames as an added value, but personally they appear too unattractive to us and for this reason their presence does not enrich the gaming experience, but rather significantly breaks its rhythm. The eye would like its share Graphically it certainly cannot be said that Dead To Rights shines, especially when compared to the current standards of the videogame landscape. The greatest disappointment is felt by looking at the model of the main character: the protagonist of a game should not suffer from questionable anatomy, rough textures and wooden animations. If you can turn a blind eye to the enemies you meet along the way, also because they are often only seen from a distance, for Jack Slate the treatment should have been very different. The settings are quite squared, but in general quite pleasant, and from time to time we can see some attempt to give a touch of class to everything. A few volumetric effects, some particle effects like the one produced by the water from a torn up hydrant and little else. The sound of the heart? The soundtrack is of good quality. The music, although not invasive and difficult to capture in the midst of the most excited action, does its honest job helping to recreate the action-movie atmosphere. The sound effects are spot on and so is the voice of the main character, slurred and without too much emphasis as in the best tradition of ~on the edge~ policemen, and that of co charactersaround. The speech is entirely in English, but don't worry the less knowledgeable in the Albion language: the game is entirely subtitled in Italian. A very pleasant touch of class is the heartbeat made through the vibration of the joypad. When Jack Slate is seriously injured, the rhythmic vibration of the pad follows a hypothetical heartbeat of the agent. Comment Dead To Rights is a game that presents a remarkable variety, being after all a multi-event with all the advantages and disadvantages that this entails. Unfortunately, a multi-event title, in the face of a greater variety, usually does not excel in all sub-games but has ups and downs or, alternatively, settles on an average general quality. Dead To Rights falls into the second category. About ten hours are needed to complete the game, which can become much more depending on your skill with the pad and the difficulty level set, chosen from the three available. Longevity depends mainly on your attraction to violent and frenetic games and the desire to unlock all the moves to disarm enemies, a practice whose use is unfortunately not particularly encouraged but is mainly based on the player's preferences. Shoot'em up and action fanatics try Dead To Rights and they might find bread for their teeth. Let the others pass the hand, with titles like Panzer Dragoon Orta around on Xbox, the offer available to Microsoft users certainly doesn't stop at this latest Namco effort, dignified but nothing more. Pros: Action, frenzy, ultra-violence High level of challenge Cons: Graphics not up to current standards In the long run repetitive Minigames break up the action without engaging It was a dark and stormy night Jack Slate, an agent with effective methods of the Grant City police, receives a call for intervention for some gunshots. It seems like a mission like any other, but this time something is not what it seems and, from one moment to the next, Jack from policeman becomes a criminal hunted by police and criminals, forced to investigate alone and on the margins of society and the law to find out the truth about the people who framed him. No, we are not talking about Max Payne, but about Dead To Rights, Namco's latest product for Xbox. Even if the similarities between the plots of the two titles are many, the game structure of this Dead To Rights differs considerably from that of the distant cousin. It remains to be seen whether these differences lead to a general improvement in playability or to a dispersion of energies.", "date": "2003-03-24", "grade": null}
