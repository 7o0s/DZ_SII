Recensionen!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/132008-wolfenstein-the-new-order-achtung-recensionen.html", "text": "The review was carried out taking into account the dayone patch available at launch. Paradoxically, this new Wolfenstein contains more Starbreeze Studios than id Software: some subtle link with the past which, during the hours of play, made us remember the tunnels dark and cold scenarios of the two Riddicks, that frenzy in shootings stimulated by the long slides of Syndicate or, again, the fascinating and delicate love story just mentioned in The Darkness. In reality, however, The New Order is the first project of the small Swedish software house MachineGames, which was set up in 2009 by former employees of Starbreeze (including the two original founders) and then bought just a year later by Bethesda Softworks . But there is something in the developer's DNA that permeates the whole game and makes it feel decidedly far from the canons of John Carmack's former Texan software house and the previous remakes of that iconographic masterpiece that was Wolfenstein 3D. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, we still haven't figured it out and we'll leave you with the difficult task of siding on one side or the other. As far as we are concerned, however, we will try to tell you in this article what struck us positively about The New Order and what instead made us frown because the title certainly lacks some youthful mistakes but, basically, it is a frenetic , enjoyable and fun experience. Wolfenstein is back and better than ever. But are we sure it's him? Let's start with the fundamentals Wolfenstein: The New Order is a first-person shooter, with a decidedly classic style, which opens up the side to some of the contaminations seen in the shooters of the last two generations. And so if on the one hand we do not find multiplayer, of any kind, on the other we cannot help but notice some role-playing micro-elements and above all a good, absolutely optional, dose of stealth. But let's take a small step back not only in a figurative sense. World War II is at its height. The Nazis are winning thanks to the numbers of the army put on the field, to the ferocity of their offensive campaign but above all to the incredible technological marvels they are equipped with and which inexorably places them one step higher than the other world powers. To manage such a military apparatus there is the inevitable shady figure, ruthless and cruel, who seems to make decisions only according to his baser instincts, flanked by a small handful of rather anonymous and barely sketched supporting actors. In the role of the perfect soldier, American by adoption, infallible but with a tender heart, William BJ Blazkowicz, there is obviously us and after a long prologue that also serves as a tutorial, we find ourselves catapulted into the perfect dystopian future. Much of the game is in fact set in the 60s, in a world completely dominated by the Nazis who, nation after nation, have seen the whole of humanity fall, lifeless, at their feet. But of course, thanks to our fundamental contribution, we will first be able to bring together a small pocket of resistance and then start a slow but inexorable revolt against the regime. We will not go further to avoid the risk of running into some spoilers but we would like to underline, in our judgment, that the plot does not seem to be the flagship of Wolfenstein: The New Order. Or rather, the narrative also works quite well, adequately interspersed between scripted sequences, beautiful dialogues and small glimpses of humanity and everyday life that adequately represent the metamorphosis suffered by a world torn apart by the most tragic of epilogues. If anything, the problem is all in the lack of charisma of BJ's antagonists who, apart from their being practically out of the scene for three quarters of the game, just can't convince because they are barely sketched, not very credible even in their blind cruelty and therefore not able to adequately justify the actions of the player who in fact finds himself decidedly more attracted by wanting to see how the events of his supporting actors end rather than moved by the desire for revenge or justice. Returning to the concrete unfolding of the single player, the campaign is divided into sixteen chapters and guarantees a good dose of replay value. Aside from all the collectibles scattered in great abundance throughout the game's levels, The New Order actually offers a kind of parallel double campaign. In the very first level we will in fact be faced with a very tragic choice that will lead us to decide the fate of two soldiers dear to us. Depending on the outcome of this dramatic moment we will have access to a different special ability for Blazko: the ability to pick locks or cortocircuit some mechanisms. This will lead to some slight differences in the explorable areas within the maps, to the possibility of collecting a different upgrade for our favorite soldier (more maximum energy, compared to more maximum armor) and there will also be some small deviations in the story told since the supporting actors will change alongside William. This does not mean that there are multiple endings or two alternative campaigns in all respects, but MachineGames' decision to offer a sort of Game Plus to make the replayability of a title decidedly more interesting is certainly to be appreciated, which we remember, is only and exclusively single player. Unfortunately it is not possible to offer a precise statistic of the time taken by the writer to complete the game on the first pass, as there is no official data in the game, but we are roughly eleven hours with 62% of total completion and at least 70% of collected collectibles. All at the third level of difficulty of the five selectable. Playstation 4 trophies Wolfenstein: The New Order contains the usual fifty-one unlockable trophies. Aside from platinum, the only gold can be earned by finishing the game on any difficulty, while the silver ones are related to unlocking the maximum skill of each of the four talent branches, collecting all gold items, decoding of the four Enigma codes scattered throughout the game maps and upon completion of the game at the two maximum difficulty levels. All bronze trophies are instead related to unlocking individual skill perks and collecting other collectibles. Completing the game the first time we unlocked twenty-eight trophies. And then there are the shootings And here the true nature of Wolfenstein: The New Order comes into play, given that it is undoubtedly the pure and hard gameplay, the spearhead of the entire production. Despite its classicism and without introducing particularly innovative game elements, the title knows how to be fun and very engaging by offering stimulating, frenetic shootings that manage to represent a rather adequate challenge, also thanks to the abundance of five difficulty levels, all selectable from the from the first game and modifiable even after the mission has begun. The feedback from the weapons is always credible, the trigger is very reactive and the sensation of hitting the enemy manages to give back a pleasant enjoyment to whoever controls the pad or the mouse and keyboard combination. It is interesting to note that practically all the weapons can also be equipped in akimbo mode by holding two of the same type and controlling the guns with the relative triggers. Furthermore, some weapons also have secondary fire modes, such as the shotgun which is capable of firing explosive buckshot, or the service machine gun which will be enhanced later in the game even with a rocket launcher. There are also a couple of different grenades and knives that can be thrown or used in combat to carry out the classic silent kills. The character growth system, which offers that very slight role-playing flavor to the title we were talking about at the beginning, is quite basic but effective. Blazkowicz has access to four branches of talents (stealth, tactics, assault, demolition) each consisting of eight skills (mostly passive, but there are also a handful of active skills) that are unlocked by reaching certain in-game milestones related precisely to the characteristics of that skill tree. For example, by carrying out silent killings with the throwing of knives we will be able to equip a greater number of them, or by taking out enemies by leaning out of the covers we will have access to more capacious magazines for the weapon used during these killings. It will be possible to relaunch a grenade at the enemy when we have killed enough with explosives and we will be able to move by holding two weapons at the same speed as when we hold only one in hand after reaching a considerable number of kills in akimbo mode. In short, there is something for all tastes and the incentive to unlock this sort of internal objectives is always quite marked given that the rewards are all equally interesting. We talked a little above about covers and in fact in this new Wolfenstein it is possible to take cover behind any obstacle or wall and lean in any direction simply by holding down the left trigger and then using the left analog to ~lean~ in that direction. The system is quite effective when you limit yourself to ~peeping out~ from a bulkhead or when you want to lean out from the jamb of a door, but in conditions of greater chaos it is rather cumbersome and makes it practicalviewfinder vision is completely unusable, unless you have extreme mastery of your fingers. If we add to this the fact that leaning out of cover does not automatically put the player away from enemy blows (very old school as a mechanism) and we consider the presence of the slide to quickly approach an enemy, you can imagine how in the more substantial fights it becomes decidedly more comfortable and stimulating to perform in rapid runs through the scenario, perhaps with two machine guns shouldered, while shooting wildly against everything that moves. Another mechanic that comes straight from the past, albeit with the necessary updates, concerns the management of BJ's life. The energy is in fact recovered automatically for a maximum of twenty points after being hit, if you stay indoors long enough. To make it grow further it is necessary to collect food and medikits of which the scenarios are rich. With a real dive into the past of the series, it is also possible to exceed the maximum energy ~ceiling~ by continuing to collect cures. By doing so, life will start to drop rather quickly to return to the ~standard~ value. The armor management is instead rather traditional: this too can be increased by collecting the numerous pieces of armor scattered throughout each level, it has a maximum limit and is lost when you are hit, thus avoiding that the enemy's shots directly reduce the points William's wound. And since we talked about the collection, it is essential to point out a mechanic implemented by MachineGames but that we just couldn't digest. Every weapon, ammunition, medikit, armor, object, everything, absolutely everything that can be taken by the protagonist, must actually be collected by pressing a button (square in the PlayStation 4 version we tested). This results in a furious and repeated pressing of the same button every time you cross a room or a freshly cleared battlefield. This is obviously not an element that undermines the gaming experience, but we cannot deny that it was rather annoying after the first few hours of gameplay. Differently intelligent... It is essential to spend a few words also for the maps that make up the campaign of The New Order. Unlike what one might expect, while all denoting a typical linearity of the latest generation shooters, the work done by MachineGames to try to offer many secondary access routes to the player is absolutely to be commended, rewarding his desire to explore every single ravine and hidden tunnel, not only with dozens of collectibles but also and above all, with observation points and access to the various areas capable of putting BJ in an advantageous position over the enemy. This attention to level design even manages to enhance a stealth component that runs through the whole gameplay of this new Wolfenstein. It almost seems like a heresy to say, and here more than ever the distance from the id Software tradition is noticeable, but the game can be played with great pleasure and satisfaction even by those who love to move in the shadows trying to stealthily hit the enemy. And it is no coincidence that a whole branch of talents is devoted to this style of play. Don't come to hasty conclusions though, because we're not talking about a competitor to Thief or Dishonored, it is obvious that basically The New Order remains an old school shooter where numbers (of the opponents) are the masters and where it will therefore be necessary to accounts with several tons of lead on screen. If we really want to go nitpicking, we didn't fully appreciate the developer's choice to have us return several times to the same setting that serves as the basis of the resistance, to carry out some absolutely secondary and, at the limit, plot connection missions of ~pixel hunting~, but you get used to it immediately and are overcome just as quickly. The other inevitable element to judge in this genre is artificial intelligence. Don't expect miracles on this front: the enemies know how to do their duty in Wolfenstein but they never manage to shine for their strategic and tactical skills capable of leaving you amazed. They know how to properly manage shelters and sometimes they will even be good at surrounding you but they show a certain constipation in the use of grenades and when more armored enemies come into play, you notice their tendency to limit themselves to meeting you with your finger pressed on the trigger rather than perform some clever gamble. Let it be clear that, most of the time, this is enough to offer a level of challenge absolutely above the norm, but as the level of", "date": "2014-05-20", "grade": "8.3"}
