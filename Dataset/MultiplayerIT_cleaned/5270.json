The time will also come when spaceflight technology will allow us to take man beyond the imaginary edge of the Moon. Until then, the best solution to combine these two experiences will be Event[0], a graphic adventure set on a space base in which we will have to try to survive by discovering the secrets hidden inside and chatting via terminal with an Intelligence Artificial full of complexes and damn suspicious. An artificial intelligence, a space station lost in space... will we survive Event[0]? My friend Kaizen Imagine a ~retro future~ in which man discovered the propulsion for interstellar travel around the 80s and was quickly able to overlook the Universe and develop sophisticated Artificial Intelligences, this is the world in which ours lives alter ego. The background of Event[0] is narrated through a short sequence in which a few lines of text show us who we are and allow us to forge our past. We could be a kid from the African slums, have spent our life with hippies or have spent a normal childhood, but the fact is that we will still find ourselves part of a mission headed for Europe, full of expectation to be part of the future of 'humanity. Obviously something goes wrong, but luckily we narrowly escape it and, after a bit of isolation, we come across the Nautilus, a drifting space station near Europa. Inside the Nautilus there is not a soul, but there is Kaizen-85, an artificial intelligence that has been alone for many years who desperately needs to have a chat and who has complete control of doors, lights, elevators , life support systems and everything that regulates the functioning of the space station. In short, HAL 9000 with less desire to kill, as long as you do as he says. What we will have to do to get out of Event [0] alive is to be able to develop a bond with Kaizen, win his trust, navigate through dozens of log files and destroy a potential threat to humanity. Not bad, right? Terminal friendships Being a retrofuristic title, Evento[0] perfectly mixes unattainable technologies and 80s aesthetics, so we have advanced aerospace technologies and sentient artificial intelligences, but to interact we will have to use terminals that resemble a Commodore 64. This makes the game a sort of adventure textual in which every now and then they raise their eyes from the keyboard to look for clues or navigate to the next location. Obviously, being the game totally in English, a more than good knowledge of the language is required, not only to understand what Kaizen says, but to ask the right questions and treat him like a living person. Those who hope to proceed in monosyllables will have the same success as they would in impressing a foreign girl without at least knowing how to offer her a drink. Don't expect a perfect conversation simulator, because after a few minutes of playing it will immediately be clear what are the keywords to trigger the spring in Kaizen that will lead to the next sentence and which perhaps will allow us to unlock the door we need, but the excellent writing of the dialogues and the integration with the game scenes make in some points the illusion of speaking with a decidedly real human being. For example, due to a malfunction we will be thrown out of the Nautilus and to open the access door we will have to convince Kaizen that we are not intruders but the same person he had spoken to shortly before, all obviously avoiding running out of air. On another occasion we will have to convince him that we are not going to die, that everything is fine, that he will not lose us and we will talk to him again. If we have a friendly tone, perhaps giving him a nickname, he will do the same, if we are aggressive, he will be offended. Over time, the formal tone of the first conversations will give way to more relaxed dialogues, as one would expect from two friends trying to work together to get out of a difficult situation together. At the end of the game, you will realize that the developers have succeeded in their intent: you have developed a bond, however ephemeral, with an artificial being. The idea is undoubtedly amusing, but, in perspective, also frightening. Past future In addition to the care for the dialogues with Kaizen, Event [0] can also boast a really interesting atmosphere. Its mix of technology and past gives rise to environments that bring to mind materiali and architectural solutions of thirty years ago, but mix them with concepts still never reached by human beings. The result is bizarre, not far from the latest Fallout or 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's like looking into deep space while using an old panda as a spaceship. The Kaizen interface also follows this philosophy and this is even more evident in some moments, for example when we are asked to search for the image of a retina in its database made up of scanned photos with very few colors, just as they once were . It is therefore a real pity that Event[0] has the drawback that it doesn't last too long, no more than three hours if played at a good pace and having an intuition for puzzles, because it represents an interesting point of contact between the Walking Simulator and the Puzzle Game and is able to generate strange sensations in the user. Of course, you can also play it without developing too much empathy with Kaizen, but the title will give its best if you immerse yourself a little in the part and play along. After a few minutes you will realize that you have begun to believe it, that Kaizen is real for you, or almost. Event[0] is basically based on a great illusion: human beings tend to create bonds, even with objects, and if something behaves like a person we will end up treating it as such. With the development of ever more intelligent computers, personal assistants for smartphones and refined artificial intelligences, we will inevitably begin to relate to them as if they really exist. This brings great opportunities, but also dangers. Trust can lead to deception and computers are not people. Too much empathy at the wrong time can be a catastrophe. Science fiction has already extensively explored this vein, but Event[0] manages to have its say and fit into this genre with surprising strength. Technically, Kaizen is just talking to another fictional character, but the truth is, he's talking to us.", "date": "2016-09-29", "grade": "8.5"}
