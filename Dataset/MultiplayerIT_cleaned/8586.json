Developed by an independent team, Phil Fish's Polytron, this project has been making headlines since 2007, garnering a disproportionate amount of awards for its quirky design. After an interminable gestation it has finally landed exclusively for Xbox 360, and can be downloaded from the Live Marketplace at the price of 800 Microsoft Points, the equivalent of 10 Euros. The title is essentially a hybrid between a platform and a puzzle game, with very innovative ideas. The absolutely brilliant introduction takes us to the suspended world of Gomez, the humanoid creature that is the protagonist of the game. A series of floating constructions made up of squares and represented with two-dimensional bitmap graphics, where our hero lives with his family. The discovery of a miraculous Moroccan hat, the Fez of the title, allows Gomez to open the third dimension and dive into an epic adventure to avert the end of the world, threatened by a series of black holes that are gradually destroying matter. The only solution is to find all the golden cubes scattered around the world with the help of a fast cursor/entity able to communicate with the protagonist. This unusual pairing serves more than anything else to understand the dynamics of Fez, but above all to emerge unscathed from its complex puzzles. The salient feature is that of being able to rotate the scenario horizontally through the back keys, as if they were the faces of a cube. This allows the levels to be viewed from the four sides, which however always remain tied to a two-dimensional setting. I show her my cap Fez has a very particular structure, being based exclusively on exploration, the ability to jump and the exploitation of plans for solving puzzles. Although the first impact refers to the two-dimensional Super Mario, there is no rush and no sense of urgency, there are no enemies to jump on, deadly traps or anything else. The very concept of death is thwarted, as in the event of a disastrous fall we are brought back to the point where we made the mistake, and lives are infinite. This does not mean that we are faced with a game without a challenge, the brilliant level design offers challenging sections where jumping skills must match the analytical one. There are various puzzles that require the use of time bombs to destroy certain obstacles, crates to be placed in a specific order and so on, but most of all the correct use of the rotation of the floors, a key element of gameplay whose understanding is essential to continue. The most successful element of Fish's jewel is precisely the stimulating effect resulting from this idea. Referring to the art of Escher (and with an eye to Echochrome) the spatial logic undergoes considerable upheavals once the planes intersect, allowing the player the opening of unexpected paths to continue. Added to this is a notable reverential component that will make all nostalgics happy, and beyond. From Legenz Of Zelda to Tetris, from Resistance to Castlevania, there are countless quotations made by Polytron, practically never betraying the marked personality of the product. The adventure is long and full of secrets, in addition to the cubes there are ancient artifacts, treasure maps and even dark matter, all well hidden in the world. The duration can well exceed the five hours necessary to complete the basic story. Xbox 360 goals Fez offers the classic 200 player points of Live Arcade titles (although they will soon double), divided along 12 objectives. To get the perfect score you need to find all the hidden objects, and there are many, an operation that will take you away a considerable amount of time. Good luck! Digital art? Technically Fez is something that must be admired with one's own eyes, it is really difficult to find such marked attention to detail as to make one forget that what we are looking at is a fictitious universe. Gomez has countless waiting animations, and watching him play with his cap or fall asleep while a frog licks his head is priceless. But it is practically impossible to enclose in one review the amount of details that make this world so alive. The game features a day-night cycle embellished with masterful touches, such as the night constellations displayed at right angles, poignant rays of light filtered through the clouds, all rigorously represented with a vintage aesthetic that refers to pixel art and all the 8 and 16 Bits. But probably the effect would not bebe the same without the contribution of the music of Rich ~Disasterpeace~ Vreeland, nothing short of splendid and able to elevate the chiptune style towards the boundaries of ambient and progressive. Practically a heart sank for those who lived through the Commodore golden era. Each song fits perfectly with the proposed settings, from forests to ancient temples, from waterfalls to sinister cemeteries. However Fez is not a perfect product and the shadows come right in the playful side, the excessively marked personality of the game exposes it to a certain risk of self-satisfaction. The structure of the levels follows a bizarre and not always intuitive logic, with the player being sent to other areas unknowingly, perhaps by crossing a simple door, with the result of making orientation difficult for the recovery of any cubes left behind. The world map itself is not exactly comfortable to consult, although it is aesthetically very suggestive. Even the jumping system fails to fully satisfy, with a marked inertia that leads to falls that are not really necessary. Fortunately, and perhaps not by chance, as we have already said, the character is immediately reborn not far from the point of death, thus avoiding the frustration deriving from the trial and error.", "date": "2012-04-20", "grade": "9.0"}
