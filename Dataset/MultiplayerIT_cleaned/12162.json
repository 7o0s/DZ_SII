And to think that the idea for the film simply came from a Euro-Disney attraction! A lot has come a long way, and already from the second chapter the series had lost its overall childish tone by embracing much more ~dark~ and violent themes. In this third chapter, for example, Jack Sparrow is dead: or rather, he is locked up in Davy Jones's chest, a kind of purgatory in which he ended up after the beautiful Elizabeth had deceived him and let the Kraken kill him at the end of ~ The Curse of the Dead Man's Chest~. But now the India Company, in possession of the heart of Davy Jones and therefore able to control the powerful Flying Dutchman ship, is preparing to wipe out the pirates from the waters of the world: led by a revived Barbossa, the ex-crew of the Black Pearl prepares to free Jack from his prison to start the war. But everyone has their own reasons for fighting, and often they don't coincide at all with those of the others... The adventure programmed for the DS by Amaze Entertainment faithfully follows the plot of the film, consequently putting us in the shoes of the various protagonists and, from half to then about, even in the long-awaited ones of Jack Sparrow: from Singapore to Davy Jones's chest, up to the final battle on the Maelstrom. Aye aye captain! The adventure doesn't actually start immediately like the film: the tutorial is in fact based on the final sequence of the prequel, and in a certain sense it serves as a summary of the story told so far. And ~Ai Confini del Mondo~ is in fact decidedly similar to the previous videogame episode, ~The Curse of the Dead Man's Chest~, distributed just over a year ago: it is a three-dimensional scrolling fighting game, in fact, but the novelty is a series of stages of exploration, seasoned with a few purely platform sequences, which make it a little more intriguing. The model from which Amaze was inspired for the design of this product is undoubtedly Tomb Raider: in several moments the player will have to climb walls or grab on the fly to lianas and ropes, to reach the next platform and continue on the path established by the designers, between one fight with white weapons and another. The clashes are extremely simple, mostly made up of repeated slashing and occasional parries, which can be performed by simply pressing the keys. In some cases it is possible to perform special actions, such as kicks that will push the enemy to the ground or off a precipice, or stealthily reach an opponent without being noticed to take him from behind: they are extremely simple and almost naive mechanics, which add just a little depth to a linear and sometimes banal gameplay, enlivened by some timed puzzles or even by the ~bosses~ at the end of the stage: in the case of these duels, on the lower screen of the DS we will draw lines with the stylus that will translate into hits and parries on the upper screen, where a more spectacular and dynamic fight than usual will take place. The flaw in these most important battles is unfortunately the touch-screen control system, which is really not very reactive, in fact the animation relating to our command is decidedly slow and it becomes frustrating to face the enemy on duty with a delay like that between input and execution. Luckily the puzzles, very often with a time limit to solve them, break the monotony of the action, also frustrated by a fixed camera position which often betrays the actual distances between one platform and another during the jumps: it follows that the most of the gameplay is practically entrusted to luck, and even the mini-game with dice (remember the game of the Liar to which Bootstrap Turner and his son Bill challenge Davy Jones in the second film?) requires more skill and intelligence, in the moment where a jump must be performed after several unsuccessful attempts to understand the distance to cover. Comment All in all, it cannot be said that At the End of the World is a bad game: despite its notable flaws, it doesn't come close to the disastrously commercial tie-ins that have often afflicted toy libraries in conjunction with the release of more or less expected films. In short, we've seen much worse: after all, At the Edge of the World re-proposes the gameplay of the prequel, but improves it with some playful elements that make it more interesting and varied, while maintaining that basic monotony caused by the mechanics of a beat'em Scrolling -up with very few possibilities for action. The introduction of platforming elementsor exploratory is unfortunately marred by a sometimes incomprehensible camera positioning, but once you understand the distances the game flows quite smoothly and it's not even unpleasant to play. From a technical point of view, the ups and downs are remarkable, especially graphically: it is a pity that the trilogy has ended, the room for improvement was considerable. But who knows, Verbinski may not make a fourth film, and Amaze may not have the opportunity to redeem himself! Pros Definitely faithful to the movie Improved gameplay compared to the prequel Fairly long-lived and entertaining Cons Technically many ups and downs Poor camera position Gameplay too simple and repetitive 3DS and the Sparrow Pirates The three-dimensional engine with which Amaze reconstructed the film's sequences isn't bad, it must be said: it is an improved version of the one proposed a year ago with The Curse of the Dead Man's Chest, enhanced by higher quality textures and rendering general visual. The polygonal models are still a bit rough, especially those of the secondary characters or enemies, but the detail of the locations and fidelity to the film are remarkable. Too bad for the animations of the various characters, especially of the three protagonists, which seem copied and pasted from one model to another, depriving them of at least a little personality: the unfriendly frame rate completes the picture, given that sometimes the slowdowns are considerable in more exciting sequences. Thumbs up for the soundtrack instead, practically that of the film: the splendid musical tracks by Hans Zimmer are reproduced very faithfully, sometimes intertwined with others composed ad hoc and decidedly banal in comparison, proposed especially in the first half of the game, and when comes Jack Sparrow (who, unfortunately, is absent for most of the game as in the film) does not seem accidental the choice to reproduce the main theme of the trilogy and the most exciting songs, especially during the final battles.", "date": "2007-06-28", "grade": null}
