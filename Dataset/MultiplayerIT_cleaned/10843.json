What happened? Frank West, a shrewd freelance photojournalist, is determined to find out at any cost: after paying a pilot to accompany him by helicopter, eluding the roadblocks of the National Guard, he gets himself left on the roof of the shopping center and with his trusty camera he launches into an experience that could earn him the scoop of his life. Or a horrible death. This is the incipit of Dead Rising, released in 2006 for Xbox 360 and still considered one of the most representative titles for the Microsoft console. In the role of photojournalist Frank West, the player had three days available to build his own photo shoot and document the presence of zombies and bizarre characters inside the Willamette Mall, following a main storyline which was accompanied by numerous missions in which the protagonist had the ability to save some survivors from the undead hordes. Optional missions, in reality, which constituted one of the many peculiarities of the game: marked by time, the recovery expeditions could not all be tackled and it was inevitably necessary to make choices on who to save and who to abandon to their fate. Once reached, the survivors had to be protected from the onslaught of hundreds and hundreds of zombies until they reached a free zone, represented by the security room of the mall. Frank West's character could eliminate enemies in many different ways, using practically anything as a weapon: clubs, knives, boxes, garbage cans, televisions, musical instruments ... everything that could be found in the numerous shops of the complex , now a destination only for customers with questionable eating habits. I'll take a picture of you In the original Xbox 360 version, Dead Rising really put us in the role of a photojournalist, as Frank was never without his camera. Even the character possessed a slouching gait due to the hand with which he always held the reflex tightly, a gait that we can also see on the Wii but which in fact has no reason to exist as we will not be able to take pictures. No more close-ups, no gruesome images to which the game assigned a score based on the spectacularity of the scene: the only shots we will see will be limited to the interlude sequences. Sin. Conversion impossible Since its official announcement, the Wii version of Dead Rising has been accompanied by a thick blanket of doubts and perplexities: being the visual impact (in particular the extraordinary quantity of zombies on the screen) a fundamental element for the Capcom title, such as characterize the gameplay in many ways, everyone was wondering what solutions would be adopted to obtain a result not identical to the original but at least decent. To succeed in this enterprise, desperate on paper, the developers have dusted off the graphics engine of Resident Evil 4, making changes to the original Dead Rising to make it lighter and more manageable, making good use of the technical possibilities of the Wii. This inevitably means many (but many) fewer zombies on the screen, less ~dense~ locations, fewer interactable objects and therefore less weapons, much less well-kept shops (on Xbox 360 even cereals had perfectly legible packaging... ) and finally a decidedly more linear gameplay and less oriented towards free roaming: the rescue missions will be presented to us one at a time, we will no longer have to choose what to do first and there will be no particular pressure regarding how long it takes to complete them. Furthermore, at the end of each expedition we will be given the opportunity to save the game on any of the available slots. The game has a modified control system to better adapt to the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination, and shares the type of view with RE4 (behind the protagonist), which among other things makes it possible to use firearms ~aiming~ on the screen via the controller. However, the operation is not as intuitive as one might think: instead of using the B trigger to fire, you have to hold down the trigger to switch to shooting mode and then press the A button to fire. The A Button is used to deliver normal attacks (both bare-handed and using a weapon) in combination with wii-mote movement, which in mostin part of the cases it activates a ~special move~ capable of knocking down the enemies but which in the most agitated situations proves to be unreliable and precise. By pressing the ~-~ key you access the inventory, with ~+~ you ask the survivors to join us while the (not very comfortable) combination of the Z and A buttons allows us to interact with the environment, collect objects and talk to other characters. A totally different experience As mentioned above, the Wii version of Dead Rising differs from the original for Xbox 360 not only in terms of graphics, but also and above all in terms of gameplay, which in fact adapts to the technical downsizing through a series of all-round solutions. nothing but happy. Zombies don't form boundless groups, of course, but the clash is made practically mandatory by the lack of evasive maneuvers (in the original you could jump, for example) and by the presence of insurmountable obstacles, which force us to take certain paths. To give an example, the side canals and fountains found in the first locations after the warehouse are no longer viable and you must necessarily pass over the bridges to advance, bridges which, however, are swarming with zombies. When Frank is grabbed by an enemy, we have to shake the Wii-mote quickly for him to free himself, but the close-up view does not help in the least to get an idea of the dangers in the immediate vicinity, on the contrary it severely limits our field of vision, creating enormous difficulties even and especially during the boss fight. It is not known why, moreover, the developers have thought of making our lives more complicated by inserting a series of zombie-parrots and zombie-poodles in all areas of the shopping center that charge us continuously (providing us considerable damage in a short time) and which can only be eliminated by shooting or (in the case of dogs) by cutting. Also in this case the view only hinders us, given that aiming is not a very fast operation and turning around is even less so: very often we will simply find ourselves running away, hoping at least that the animals do not attack us just when we are about to deal with it with a group of undead. Finally, this Wii version is characterized by an evident propensity for the use of firearms, which in the original one really had to sweat and which here, however, are distributed like candy. We will be able to use a ~preferential~ system to equip the pistol or rifle, and extract them even while we are breaking some zombie's head with a guitar, a bit as if the game had the classic ~primary~ and ~secondary~ weapon system which is the most popular in action games. Technical realization While remaining crushed by the superiority of the original version, the graphics of Dead Rising: Salme di Fine Season appear anything but contemptible: there are no other titles for the Nintendo console that can boast such large and varied locations, as well as such a number of enemies present on the screen at the same time. In short, the work done by Capcom has something miraculous and pushes the Wii to levels hitherto unknown to the developers of the so-called ~third parties~. The Willamette Mall appears almost deserted in the eyes of those who have tried the game on Xbox 360, there is no doubt, but we are still talking about dozens and dozens of zombies that move between shops that may not be overloaded with interactable objects but have an assortment decent. The close-up view behind the protagonist, a clear legacy of Resident Evil 4, on the one hand allows aiming on the screen via the Wii-mote for firearms, on the other it immediately reveals itself to be unsuitable for the type of situations in which we will find ourselves during the adventure, hiding from us the dangers located in the immediate vicinity and lending itself very little to evasive maneuvers, essential especially during the boss fight. Intermission sequences, which used real-time graphics on the Microsoft console, are pre-calculated here and sadly lacking in detail and quality. The sound does not seem to have undergone major changes and therefore proves to be excellent for dialogue (in English), effects and art direction. The ~mall~ music clashes with the nature of the events and for this very reason it creates a very particular atmosphere, even if it does not give particular emotions. Comment Dead Rising: Dead of Season Corpses has very little to do with Dead Rising for Xbox 360: the structure, gameplay and philosophy behind the experience are completely different. Having made this necessary clarification, it must be said that the game presents a series of problems that often make it frustrating and unnecessarily complicated. The visual, in the first place, proves inadequatelook at the type of actions that Frank must perform in most cases, it does not allow us to control the enemies close to the character and it is too slow and cumbersome when it comes to facing fast and dangerous opponents. The controls do not make the best use of the characteristics of the Wii-mote and Nunchuck, in particular the movement detection of the former when you want to perform a special move is imprecise and unreliable. The curtailment of all the more particular components of the original version (the ability to take photos, the freedom of action with respect to the missions, the time limits, etc.), also reduces what should have been a real conversion to a mere spin -off aimed at a varied audience and little accustomed to what is used to define ~hardcore gaming~. That said, technically the game is all there and could win over, despite its flaws, those who did not expect a product like this for Wii. Pros ~Oldgen~ but spectacular graphics Great variety of weapons Interesting upgrade system Against It has nothing to do with the Xbox 360 original Often cumbersome, sometimes frustrating Not very long lived", "date": "2009-03-03", "grade": null}
