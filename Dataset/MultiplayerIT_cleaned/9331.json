Thus, while the first expansion of their sci-fi shooter is about to appear on the iPhone, and waiting to hear news about the third chapter currently in the pipeline, the developers return to the App Store with a certainly less ambitious, but not unpromising title. New entry in the sports franchise born in 2008 on older generation mobile phones, Snowboard Hero aims to replicate the frenetic experience of SSX on iOS devices, putting the player in the shoes of a snowboarder and launching him along snowy slopes made up of obstacles, and huge precipices. All this, once again, trying to bring together a good control system with a technical realization above the average of iPhone games. Someone is unbalanced and is already talking about one of the best sports titles on smartphones: will it really be like this? An avalanche of challenges SSX fans will quickly notice several similarities in Snowboard Hero. The game mostly emphasizes performing stunts, and so the player is constantly enticed to do wild jumps and backflips in mid-air. In addition to increasing the score, performing complex tricks serves to fill an on-screen gauge which, once full, allows you to perform fundamental accelerations in timed races. Once the character has been chosen, Snowboard Hero offers different types of challenges: sometimes you are asked to complete a descent in the shortest possible time, other times to perform slaloms passing through colored doors, others still to obtain a certain score through continuous stunts. The difficulty increases when two or more of these challenges are proposed at the same time, since you find yourself having to increase your score while being careful not to waste too much time between stunts. It's a pity that little importance has been given to competitions with other snowboarders: it is rare to have to face a descent together with an opponent and, the few times that it happens, his skill is so poor that it doesn't even represent a concern. With the stars obtained based on your performance, you can unlock new characters and tracks, while the money earned at the end of each race can be spent on new clothing, snowboards and incredible stunts. However, while the boards visibly affect the character's speed or his jumping ability, customized jackets and trousers represent only a meager aesthetic tinsel, giving very little reason to spend the accumulated money. However, all this becomes insignificant once you get on the track: pleasant models, a constant framerate and a great care for the game environment make Snowboard Hero a graphically impeccable title. Thanks to the ploy of far-clipping and the skilful but not at all intrusive use of fog, the developers have also managed to avoid annoying pop-in effects and create huge but at the same time graphically pleasing tracks, although they are especially the excellent and realistic backdrops. The sound component, on the other hand, fluctuates, as it alternates catchy music with questionable effects, while the voices of the various snowboarders, each characterized by jokes and exclamations in different languages, oscillate from bearable to pathetic. However, what the game lacks is the sense of spectacularity and frenzy that has always characterized the SSX series: even by unlocking all the stunts of each snowboarder, the experience seems slower and less dynamic, initially cumbersome also due to a control system which uses motion sensors to change direction and the touchscreen to perform various techniques. They range from simple taps on one side of the screen for short grips and arrive at slightly more elaborate combinations to initiate bizarre and original techniques, many of which are unique to each of the characters. Predictably, by performing several tricks with a single jump the multiplier increases bringing the score to the stars, where ramps and logs along the way can be used to continue the combinations and not interrupt the chain. In short, the gaming experience is enjoyable from the first to the last descent, but even if the unlockable objectives give you something to keep busy even after completing all the challenges, the absence of a multiplayer mode ends up weighing heavily on the evaluation the final.
