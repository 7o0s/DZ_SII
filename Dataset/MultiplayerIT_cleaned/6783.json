{"name": "A canestro con EA", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/140117-nba-live-15-a-canestro-con-ea.html", "text": "For several years now, we have witnessed a real trend reversal as regards the quality of the two major basketball games on the market. While the 2K Sports series grew in level, improving year after year until it became the reference point for any electronic basketball simulation, Electronic Arts' Live suffered a profound crisis, following an inverse path and sinking into the abyss of almost anonymity , getting bogged down in the swamp of a very unrealistic playability, of a graphic sector that was no longer able to amaze and of various general technical problems. Thus, after having failed a couple of attempts to relaunch, including the one in 2014, the Canadian company is trying again this year with the precise intention of reconnecting the interrupted thread with its audience and with its past, before the decline, looking in all ways to remedy errors, listening to user feedback and this time focusing their attention on the beating heart of the game, that is to say the gameplay, even at the cost of neglecting the game modes. In the end, as we'll see, despite some good ideas and some improvements, NBA Live 15 fails to make a bang. NBA Live 15 marks a step forward for the series, but remains light years away from the competition From Draft to Hall of Fame Once you have passed (or skipped) the initial part which serves as a tutorial under the guidance of Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers, and played the classic introductory game, you can finally access the main area of the game, where all modes are available. However, the latter are practically the same as the previous edition, and show no changes of any kind, except for the addition of some marginal elements. In any case, it is possible to choose to play a friendly match, or to dive immediately into one of the two main modes, which are, as always, the one called Rising Star, i.e. Rising Star, and the Dynasty one. The first allows the user to impersonate an emerging talent in North American basketball, from the draft to the Olympus of the NBA. But any initial enthusiasm is practically extinguished almost immediately, given that this game session immediately appears light years away from that of the competitor NBA 2K15. The editor with which to physically ~build~ one's virtual alter ego is, for example, very limited in terms of customization options, the events surrounding his career are absent (no player management in relations with sponsors, the press or the team), and the mode appears to be lacking even in the most technical aspect, that is to say during matches on the field. In this sense, it would be necessary to accumulate skill points to make the basketball player grow based on the role and style chosen for him during the creation phase, but the game tends more to punish the user than to reward him, and substantially it is easier to lose these points than scrape them together. This is because the title does not offer any freedom of action with regard to behavior on the field, it requires you to follow its directives to gain consensus, and it is therefore easy to make a mistake for a small distraction. The Dynasty mode, on the other hand, allows you to impersonate a General Manager, and structurally follows that of many other sports titles. In the role of a manager, the gamer must manage his team in the best possible way on and off the field, satisfying the initial expectations of the club, controlling and planning training sessions, enhancing the club's facilities or staff, up to obviously having to administer player contracts and market. Unfortunately, however, although the developers have tried to emphasize the identification aspect, also increasing the amount of news related to the teams and the real NBA tournament, with constant connections to the statistics provided by ESPN, in our opinion, the depth and completeness of the homonymous mode present in the aforementioned NBA 2K15. From this point of view, NBA Live Ultimate Team is perhaps more interesting, which allows users to create their own ideal team by collecting cards depicting athletes from the present and the past, basing purchases and exchanges on a particular trading system. However, it too has remained unchanged compared to the last edition, except for the introduction of an auction house where ~market transactions~ can be carried out. Still on the subject of online gaming, the head-to-head Seasons mode remains more than valid, if only because they constitute a fun variant of the more traditional dynamics mentioned above, where you can challenge friends and acquaintances in dozens of challenges to accumulate successes and access Leagues higher, and game variations within NBA Rewind. Here you can replay the most exciting real matches of this and the last NBA tournament, and relive firsthand some key moments of the same matches, trying to repeat the results also through the deeds of its protagonists. You can also decide to enter the match at any point in the four quarters of a match to replicate, for example, a final result, or to change it altogether. Perhaps even managing to complete challenges, such as making the same baskets in a game as a specific athlete, or scoring by shooting from the same portions of the field from which, in the real game, he scored points. Playstation 4 trophies NBA Live 15 offers players 40 trophies in offline and online modes, divided into 20 bronze, 16 silver, 3 gold and 1 platinum. To get the simplest ones, for example, just create a team in NBA Live Ultimate Team or be part of the All-Star quintet in Rising Star mode. While for the more difficult ones, more complex requests must be satisfied, such as winning an online tournament in head-to-head Seasons or a championship in Dynasty mode, up to the coveted platinum, obtainable after unlocking all the others. All to the basket Moving on to analyze the gameplay, the comparison with its predecessor is inevitable for NBA Live 15, but also, despite the unequal challenge, with the giant NBA 2K15. In the first case, all things considered, we should be satisfied, given that there are enough improvements compared to 2014. It's not about huge changes, capable of upsetting the mechanics of the game or distorting them in a positive way, but there was certainly a step forward. But if we make a comparison with the title of the competition, then from this point of view we are far below expectations. As mentioned in the introductory phase, the developers have focused a lot on gameplay, to try to finally make it more attractive and interesting. The result of this work is a more fluid playability, with a good general response to the commands of the virtual athletes, who however, strangely, are not always reactive and indeed, sometimes a little latency is noticed between an ~order~ given and its execution on the pitch, as well as transitions between defense and attack that happen more quickly, but little else. Other changes, in fact, have significantly concerned the management of the run and feints, which are now a little more useful during an offensive action, and the shooting system, which is now linked to a circular indicator and related feedback that are released by the game in relation to the right timing of the release or not of the shot by the user. In this way it is more comfortable to shoot, but the basket often seems more linked to the factors just described than to the technical parameters of the athlete performing the ~shot~, as if the CPU did not take into account or almost all his general statistics and the posture of the his body. Proof of this is that the artificial intelligence that manages the opposing teams often tends to adopt the strategy of ~conclusions~ from outside to reassemble a match or to take off, showing an anomalous and high average in three-point shots. However, the situation is different with regard to the defensive phase. In that case the title seems more attentive to these aspects. The right analog stick is used to perform cover functions, and with a small touch you can try to steal the ball from the opponent or, contextually with the position of the defender's body, block or otherwise get between the attacker and the basket. Blocks and blocks are quite easy to execute, but there is a downside, in this case the referees, who have a tendency to often give fouls. It is true that basketball is not a contact sport, but it is equally true that in NBA Live 15 the referees have an easy whistle, and sometimes the slightest touch is enough to be punished. Speaking of athletes' artificial intelligence, this one fluctuates: if they have to act individually, i.e. without user input, sometimes they seem to get lost in a glass of water, choosing solutions that are not always understandable in the context of the action in progress . When, on the other hand, as a team they apply the patterns given by the gamer through the directional cross, or execute a single order, such as making a single block by pressing the appropriate back button, then almost by magic they manage to make the right movements, allowing whoever he checks them to develop actions that are credible enough both in the defensive and offensive phases. But on balance the gameplay feels leaning towards an arcade rather than a simulation style of play, lacking that depth and realism of NBA 2K15, and you often get the feeling thathe actions take place in a certain way because they have to go this way, almost as if they were directed. If we add to this the fact that the movement of the ball still fails, from the point of view of physics, to restore a feeling of realism, the result can only be below expectations. An aspect of the game that has visibly improved compared to the last edition is instead that of the graphics. Thanks to the successful use of technology to digitize the faces of athletes in live 3D, and then reproduce them in-game, in NBA Live 15 they appear more realistic and natural, compared to those of 2014. Tattoos, sweat, moles , everything is reproduced quite well and nothing in this sense seems to have been overlooked. The textures that cover the polygonal models of the basketball players (and those of the playing facilities, uniforms and the ball) are also more detailed, despite the fact that they are inferior to those of NBA 2K15 in terms of sharpness and quality, while their animations seemed less convincing to us. Mind you, we note that there are more of them and that the movements have generally improved, but in different junctures or in some games they did not seem particularly fluid or natural, giving us the feeling of still being rather rigid, as if some animations were missing fitting. In any case, the restyling work carried out by EA also concerned the public: the ~people~ who populate the bleachers of the arenas now certainly seem more alive, managing to visually restore a credible ~building~ atmosphere, as is legitimate to expect from a sports simulation of this importance. And we're not just talking about aesthetic issues: the crowd reacts to what happens on the parquet, moving accordingly to a successful or wrong action, sonorously accompanying the maneuver and plays of their favorites. In this sense it must be said that the audio technicians have done a good job of sampling the effects relating to the buzz, the applause, the screams, the screeching of shoes on the parquet and anything else related to the typical ~noises~ background of a basketball game. Elements that join the good commentary in English and the equally valid soundtrack with almost exclusively rap and hip hop melodies.", "date": "2014-11-06", "grade": "6.0"}
