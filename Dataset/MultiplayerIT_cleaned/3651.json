{"name": "Resident Evil Zero Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-zero-switch-recensione.html", "text": "Of the triptych of Resident Evil remasters just proposed by Capcom on Switch, we feel we can say with relative certainty that the Resident Evil Zero whose review you are reading is the one that most deserves a little injection of media fame. If it is very likely that, in some form, the average consumer - even more the fan of the franchise - has already played the first or fourth chapter and their innumerable revivals, the Zero is the hidden gem in the dust, that episode which not everyone knows and which even fewer have tested. Great pity: a bit like Code Veronica, episode Zero was experimentation applied to the canonical formula, a summary of the best of the Osaka experience corroborated by the engine of the first remake. To sell it to you in short, the title contains the exact alchemy of elements to make it a chapter that collects the legacy of the first episode, its sequel, carrying it forward without distorting it, in full continuation of thought. We were saying, the hybrid port: directly from the Ecliptic Express train, Rebecca and Billy arrive at the Switch stage, in what we hope represents the synthesis of a popularity bath among the youngest that this episode deserves hands down. Trains and larvae Resident Evil Zero has a troubled history, starting from the Nintendo 64 and arriving at the GameCube for technical and technological reasons. Mikami rethought the whole structure, crystallizing that co-op element that had been buzzing in his head for a long time but which due to cartridge loading limits he had not been able to implement. This is a rather unique title in the general panorama: the progress is the result of a simultaneous collaboration between the two characters, with a view to a synergistic gameplay flow that leads the player to switch from one side to another without interruption. It worked at the time like today, albeit with a certain woodiness of the controls that has been smoothed but not supplanted by this remaster: Switch therefore obtains, curiously, its first single player co-op, while Capcom gives its prequel mobility, or rather a element that exactly as for the Resident Evil remaster is nothing shocking, but remains a very appreciable element. Derivative as it is, the Zero's gameplay remains compelling, a peculiar approach to the franchise that may make fans raise an eyebrow, but the truth is that it's a shining example of how much Capcom of the time valued exploring new horizons. Change of mode Some cards on the table change: inventory, collection of objects, a little key mapping and a lot of new level and puzzle design offer that sufficient freshness that today, on Switch, reflects as then a product perhaps less authorial but courageously different, less tied to the screens, certainly less full-bodied but more able to offer playful synergy to a single player franchise in the DNA. Before the change between characters, the approach to everyday life changes on Switch and it is also for a trivial reason of convenience that the path from docked to portable offers the Zero that quid certainly unobtainable elsewhere and in the same way perfect for enjoying it on the go. always accompanied by a decent set of headphones. The software works well in both cases: if the sign of time advancing on the TV has its weight, the Switch screen emphasizes a physiologically smoother, less burdensome visual framework, capable of uniting a very old school with technology on the go. It is a factor that helps, simplifies and makes a gameplay that is difficult to digest for newcomers more transversal and which blends perfectly with the simplicity of putting the console's operating system on standby.", "date": "2019-05-27", "grade": "7.5"}
