{"name": "Puffi Kart", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/puffi-kart-recensione.html", "text": "Karting games are easy to imagine. Take a colorful character (but not too much, see Bloodborne Kart), insert it into a two or four-wheeled vehicle, draw a course with a setting inspired by that character's original world and start the race. Any series can be adapted to this category of driving games. Then there is a problem: you have to create the contents to make the game not only full of races and characters to enjoy hours and hours, but you also have to create a fun gameplay and maybe with some new ideas that don't make you look like a Mario emulator Low budget karts. Few come close to the goal, but it is also true that just as many miss it completely: this is the case of the new game from Eden Games (developer) and Microids (publisher). Let's talk about Smurfs Kart for Nintendo Switch, a driving game that fails on the starting line. To know the reasons, continue reading our review of Smurfs Kart. Smurfs and paths There are 12 types of Smurfs, with their own aesthetic differences Smurfs Kart is exactly what it sounds like: a karting game dedicated to the little blue creatures that many loved in their childhood and probably still love. What you find inside the game is a group of drivers made up of the most famous Smurfs, each with their own design and their own matching and perfectly themed kart. In the game there are also twelve paths that take us through woods, swamps, Gargamel's house and other environments from the world of the Smurfs. On average, these are visually mediocre paths, with a notable graphic poverty, both in terms of texture quality and polygonal mass. In between there are also sections with badly calibrated light sources, some pop-ups, elements that don't start the animation cycle even though they are already in view and also sections where the camera doesn't effectively frame the path and it's not clear where you are going. The turbo platforms give a nice boost to the Smurfs Kart vehicles Not only are the courses visually ugly but, as mentioned, they are only 12. By completing the three cups, of four courses each, we unlock the mirrored version of the courses, which however do little to make Smurfs Kart more interesting. In addition to the Cups we have timed races, or rather the same courses to be faced against three ghosts that correspond to the Bronze, Silver and Gold times. Finally, we have free racing and local multiplayer for up to 4 players, but nothing online. That's all. There is no real progression or content unlocking system other than stickers that you get as you play with certain characters and perform certain actions on the track. In our opinion, this is too little to justify the expense of 49.99 requested by the publisher. Karting and driving Smurfs Kart tracks include forests and swamps It also doesn't help the actual quality of the routes. These are very simple tracks, with some acceleration platforms, jump ramps and gift packages that take the place of Mario Kart cubes, giving access to objects to attack other pilots or place traps. The only real move available to our is the drift which, if maintained long enough, activates a turbo effect of proportional power. The problem is that the Smurfs have no differences except access to a unique object, however to be found through gift packages: for example, we are talking about powerful attacks against opponents or a prolonged turbo effect. Otherwise, the only characteristic of a Smurf and his kart is the visual design. The courses are colored in Smurfs Kart There is no stat or customization of any kind, which makes it very boring to play already within a few races. One Smurf is as good as another and the routes are very few. In a couple of hours you have seen all that Smurfs Kart has to offer and it's very little. The only thing we can say positive about this game is that the soundtrack is pleasantly upbeat. It is a work for children and we know that many could be satisfied, but if you are a parent who has to give a gift and Mario Kart is not an option, rather take a look at Nickelodeon Kart Racer 3, which we recently reviewed.", "date": "2022-11-14", "grade": "5.0"}
