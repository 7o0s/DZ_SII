So, if you don't like slow and reflexive games that require you to read galore statistics and reports, do some quick counting and have some foresight in planning your moves, you can safely abandon this page and go collect some daisies. Belonging to the trend of management programs focused on historical commercial dynamics (in this case the period is that of the Hanseatic League, read the box for more details), the fourth Patrician is the evolution of a series that has a long tradition behind it. The concept is always the same: starting with a small capital in hand, one must try to create a commercial empire. Never as in this case is the proverb that between saying and doing is the sea. Curiosity The Hanseatic League Founded in the 12th century, but mainly operational between the 14th and 16th centuries, the Hanseatic League was born from the alliance of some large cities that managed to conquer the monopoly on the trade of the Baltic Sea, obtaining great power, both economically and politically . Lbeck, thanks to its position, became the most important city of the alliance, which, in its moment of maximum splendour, came to count more than a hundred associated urban agglomerations. The League imploded at the end of the 16th century, due to infighting due to the excess of conquered power, which had created internal and external envies and disagreements. Trades Starting the game you can select campaign mode or free mode. As the names suggest, in the first you have to carry out a series of missions by achieving different objectives, while in the second you can play without constraints. To be honest, the campaign is a bit too easy and doesn't offer much of a challenge. Much better to focus on the other mode. As tradition has it, at the beginning there will be few economic means and only one ship. In terms of gameplay, this translates into the possibility of practicing the main commands, having plenty of time to study the interface and gain experience in anticipation of the most difficult moments. As your earnings increase, you will be able to buy new ships and open up more routes. When the situation becomes more complicated, it will be possible to automate some functions and rely on trade routes, so as not to have to repeat the same actions over and over again, especially where a solid source of income has been found. To do this, just tell the ship captains what to buy or sell in the various cities. If desired, when a good overview of the trades has been acquired, it will be possible to make this sector of the game completely automatic, entrusting it entirely to the CPU. However, it's best not to do this unless you've had some practice and studied the best routes; otherwise you risk earning much less than you could. The Alternatives The most valid alternative to Patrician IV is represented by the recent East India Company of Nitro Games, focused on trade between Europe and the East. It is a very accurate product from a management point of view, which also allows you to take part in the fights between the ships. Paradox, the publisher of the game, over the months has released three full-bodied expansions that have enriched it further. Compared to the fourth Patrician however, political management is less developed. Another valid management software, released in July 2010, is Commander: Conquest of the Americas, which has a much steeper learning curve than the other two and has a few too many problems in the fights, even if in the long run it is able to offer great satisfaction. Politics Getting rich not only means having the means to buy new ships and establish trade relations with more cities, but also to rise in the ranks in society and acquire a more important role in the political sphere. This aspect of the game is the one that shows itself more slowly, but in the long run it proves to be the most important. In the beginning there is not much to do politically, but as you rise in rank, you will soon be able to influence the prices of goods sold in your city and will acquire privileges and rights. You can get to become one of the masters, with all the honors and burdens that this may entail. In fact, it will be important to be able to keep your reputation high and solve some problems that may arise, such as pirate sieges, lack of funds to build some key buildings (for example universities, which allow you to build more capacious and powerful ships ) or other disagreements. Unfortunately, it is not possible to participate directly in thefights, which are resolved in some manner animation and have nothing more to offer. Of course, it must be said that the Patrician series has always kept this line towards war conflicts, which have never been the fulcrum of the gameplay, but something more could have been done, given that the competition has already for some time been offering titles that offer also this aspect (think, for example, of East India Company, which we talk about in the box of alternatives). Light of my Eyes From a technical point of view, Patrician IV can be defined as functional. The graphics are certainly well designed and there is a certain attention to detail, especially as regards the animations of the water and the modeling of the buildings, but there is nothing that makes one cry for a miracle (as even the very limited system requirements). The same can be said for the soundtrack, designed as a natural accompaniment to the slow game action, and certainly not to rewrite the canons of the genre. Also in this case, there is no shortage of pleasant music and sound effects suitable for making the atmosphere that Patrician wants to convey well, but in the long run you end up ignoring them. That said, it should be noted that what is described is what was legitimate to expect from a title of this kind, certainly more focused on entertaining with its mechanics than with visual or sound wonders, so we will take little account of it in the judging phase (what must do, does).", "date": "2010-09-28", "grade": "7.8"}
