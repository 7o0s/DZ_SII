It is therefore now up to Ubisoft Montreal to have a decidedly difficult task, to live up to an amazing third chapter and at the same time try to go further, expanding (and arranging) mechanics and situations that had seemed decidedly well thought out and ~fresh~. The biggest problem of our excursion into the wild and turbulent Kyrat is therefore not so much related to sectors or sectors that don't work or work badly, but simply that today, November 2014, exactly two years after Jason's epic, Far Cry 4 in its entirety it appears decidedly ~normal~ and derivative. Not exactly a venial sin for a third chapter that had amazed at how it had managed to amalgamate in an original way its being a shooter with a sort of huge free roaming RPG, rewarding, imaginative and distinctly stealth. We dived into Far Cry 4's Kyrat: here's our review! Pagan Min, what a nice rogue! The setting is different, the hero is different. We are no longer in the sunny Malay archipelago of the Rook Islands but in the fresher Kyrat, an imaginary state but comparable to Tibet/Nepal, ruled by the despotic dictator with imperial foibles Pagan Min, half Chinese and half English, son of a Hong Kong drug kingpin Kong. The protagonist is instead Ajay Ghale, originally from Kyrat but American in all respects, who returns to his home country for the first time to scatter his mother's ashes. But just as he is crossing the border into Kyrat, Pagan Min's men kidnap him. Ajay is the son of the leaders of the first Golden Path rebellion, and obviously an unwitting and powerful symbol for the ongoing one. Even now, therefore, as in the third chapter, we wear the role of a perfect anti-hero, a normal person in an extraordinary situation. A perfect ~identification machine~, in short. Compared to the adventures of Jason Brody, however, those of Ajay are far more conventional; there is no real ~personal~ growth of the hero, the events never derail into madness (even if there are lysergic moments), and above all they never manage to instill in the player the urgency of the revolution. The ruthless Pagan Min, hilarious in his fuchsia suit and peroxide hair, is just a pale echo of the phenomenal villain that was Vaas. The prologue in which it is presented is however fulminating; the emperor of Kyrat is a ~nice rogue~: chatty, affable, courteous and quick to joke, but ruthless and unscrupulous. It would seem like a buddy, the perfect drinking companion, just a pity that he has the habit of killing in cold blood and having his people tortured by good American family men with a double life. On the other hand, how could a man bully himself for having put his face on the banknotes? The thing that has left us dumbfounded is that it is never a danger to the player. Obviously his men are, who this time also have the bad habit of trying to take back the outposts we laboriously freed, but for the rest Pagan Min is for long stretches a voice on the phone who makes fun of us and who only towards the Finally, he deigns to show us his clean-shaven face and fresh dental hygienist smile. In short, a real waste of charisma, too bad. In this sense, to make up for a villain who wants to harm us only by revealing shreds of our past, there are the two lieutenants of the rebellion, the beautiful and ~progressive~ Amina and the ~reactionary~ Sabal. At this juncture, Far Cry 4 confronts us with choices that will change the continuation of the story, thus deciding who of the two will be the only head of the Golden Path. It's not just a question of doing one thing in one way or another (the missions that act as crossroads change significantly in terms of performance and challenge rate), but they are real moral choices, in which future development is at stake socio-economic of the post Pagan Min Kyrat. Obviously we are talking about consequences that we will never experience functional to the narrative, but without a doubt the motivations of the two lead us to reflect and meditate carefully who to follow. In short, a big applause to the Ubisoft writers who at this juncture have not limited themselves to just the classic ~kill him yes-no~. Furthermore, towards the end, after a couple of very tight missions, we arrive at a good ending that is not limited to only alternative endings before the freedom of the gigantic end-game to be properly gutted. We therefore discover Ubisoft's ~bluff~, which made us believe for the entire duration of the game that the enemy to be killed was Pagan Min, when instead our conscience is divided in two between unscrupulous pragmatism and respect for traditionAnd. It's just a pity that the message with its ~hardness~ only arrives almost in the Cesarini area and that the first performance is anything but memorable. We also have to pull the writers' ears for the cast of supporting actors, who sadly are little more than specks. For example, the two toxic pranksters who saddle us with spliffs and mystical missions, the arms dealer who is crazy about biblical quotes, not even Jules Winnfield are two perfect examples of characters that are far too over the top and boring with their being necessarily ~original~. Fortunately, however, their missions are of a very different caliber, but even here we are always in the context of a strong deja vu, even if turned into the acid colors of a multicolored trip. Even Pagan Min's lieutenants don't come out well, they enter and leave the narrative without a fight, although they play important roles. In short, the narrative part of Far Cry 4 is perhaps the weakest side of the game. It's a well done little homework which, however, knows it has already been seen, it always seems to be on the verge of exploding but at the most beautiful moment it misfires, it never derails from a path we know by heart. It fails to excite to the end, it does not give us memorable characters or equally unforgettable moments. Here too, to say, there is a mission in which we have to burn fields of poppies, but it is only a mission in which we have to set fire to fields, nothing more. The music chosen in this sense is also normal. Attention we are not talking about a negative narrative sector that does not work, only one that dares little and which remains on normal tracks despite a certain ~political~ drift. In short, once the game is over, forget to see Pagan Min's cosplay with his dubious outfit. As I say If the story takes a step back, the pillars underlying the gameplay take two forward. The foundations are the same: everything you do contributes to the growth of Ajay's skills and statistics. The progress of the story passes through the main ~war~ missions of the Golden Path and those relating to the various supporting characters, also to be understood as main missions, but which can be tackled in the order we want. Obviously, when it comes to choosing between Amina and Sabal, the narrative takes a sharp step forward, but everything else should not be discarded or postponed lightly. Basically, unlocking Ajay's perks and level is simply by running around and ~doing things~ around the Kyrat. All as per the textbook, but now to obtain the advanced perks it is not enough simply to gain experience but we must necessarily also engage in various main and secondary missions, whether they are truly optional, such as hunting ones, car ones, hostage rescue ones, of destruction of convoys and so on, whether they are assigned by supporting actors. Both in the growth branch relating to combat, the tiger, and in the one relating to health and crafting, the elephant. In practice, we are now much more inclined to really do everything, even if obviously in a more guided way, without however ever having the impression of seeing our desire to grow as we want limited. When it comes to how to spend your free time in Kyrat, you are truly spoiled for choice, it being understood that there is still a lot of hunting to increase the capacity of the luggage we wear. Without of course forgetting the collection of flowers to create status buffs. The list of activities is impressive: as we clear the outposts (increased compared to the past and made more difficult thanks to multiple alarm systems) the map will start to fill up with ~job~ opportunities. Hunting, pest control, car racing for the local film industry, targeted assassinations, destruction of propaganda material, armed escort, truck theft and so on. We are talking about fifteen types of assignment, to which we must add all the various collectibles scattered around Kyrat and the Karma missions, which commit us in a completely random way to help the soldiers of the Path. The prize for our good revolutionary heart? We get advantages in buying weapons or more ~tokens~ to pay the mercenaries that we can call as helpers in the most difficult missions (not the ones in the story), effectively simulating the cooperative. A decidedly vast system, truly exuberant in terms of content and absolutely well thought out and obviously tailored to ensure that the player decides to unlock the perks based on his style of play, thus choosing whether to adopt a more silent and furtive or more ~caciarone~. Suffice it to say that we will eventually be able to get a melee takedownspecific to kill the cursed super-armored soldiers with the dagger, or at the opposite extreme we will be able to greatly speed up the reload time of the weapons or even reload while aiming. The cursed honey badger! The most bastard enemy of the game is not the armored soldier armed with a flamethrower but a cute little furry animal with a white tail, as cute as it is lethal and hungry. A single badger can be enough to kill Ajay torn apart by his sharp teeth. More generally, the fauna is really ferocious, and unfortunately a magazine is not enough to kill the biggest animals if you don't have the right expensive weapons, but even the smaller ones, such as wolves, canids and real dogs can be our nemesis for excellence. More generally, their resistance has something miraculous, indeed frustrating if something bites us on the most beautiful part of a mission or if we accidentally come across a herd. To complicate matters there are also rhinos and eagles. Better look up sometime if we hear their cry. Maybe if we're lucky they can catch a pig or a wild boar and then crash it to the ground. All skins for free! Issues and improvements Pad in hand, all this is grafted into missions that never appear trivial and obvious, always fun even if the first half of the game can be a little too easy for veterans of the third chapter, now accustomed to tactical reconnaissance by camera and at the same time deflect enemies to take them from behind. Things get much more interesting when the missions get longer later in the story, with the environments that gradually become bigger and more ~complicated~, where the level design is enhanced in real sandboxes that really put us to the test, where even the scenography is far more impactful and spectacular. We are talking, for example, of the long mission in the Himalayas (by the way you reach the ice only when the game commands it), of that of the brick factory or of the airport. Really very long missions, fortunately with all checkpoints in the right place, tough and demanding, where we find the best of Pagan Min's army, from hunters capable of bewitching animals and shooting explosive arrows while remaining in the shadows, up to the aforementioned armored soldiers. In between, a whole set of really well diversified and very agile infantry. In short, artificial intelligence is valid, perfectly at ease in exploiting the possibilities given by the environment and that we have only rarely seen it in crisis with the behavior of individual victims of sudden dementia. Among the lowest ranks, the explosive kamikazes or those equipped with machetes stand out, rising in rank comes those wearing helmets and bulletproof vests, all then equipped with a different type of rifle and related situational script. In this sense, however, we encountered a critical issue that made us turn up our noses a little. It's impossible not to get angry when emptying an assault rifle magazine at point blank range on a soldier equipped with a bulletproof vest, he barely feels the bullets he has just caught nonchalantly, perhaps getting up and continuing to shoot if fortunately we have landed him. In the same way, even the revolver could tickle him despite four or five shots at the big target from less than a meter. We understand that raising the level of difficulty passes not only for the number of enemies but also for their energy, but sometimes it borders on the ridiculous, with ~resistance~ too compartmentalized that do not best address the contingent situations. It being understood that the headshot is always the best choice, but in the midst of the most agitated shootings it is not always possible to aim. We understand that the game encourages stealth but sometimes it just feels like the game is ~cheating~. And still to stay on the subject of critical issues, in addition to the usual biblical treatment times in the absence of instant syringes, we are sad to note how pure stealth missions, those in which we have to be silent and if they see us it is instant game over, are plagued by same usual unresolved problem, namely the lack of information. The minimap shows enemies and their movement, but does not show buildings. In fact, the planning of the movements takes place only on sight, as it is not possible to decide in advance where to go. It runs a bit haphazardly, with the risk of falling once again into a frustrating and unfunny trial and error. Obviously if there is no instant ~failed mission~ such a choice is less burdensome since we can retrace our steps with greater freedom, but more generally if there has not been time or space for tactical reconnaissance", "date": "2014-11-14", "grade": "8.5"}
