The blockbuster in question was of course Street Fighter II, but it seems like things haven't changed all that much since then, judging by the amount of revisions the latest installment in the series has been the subject of. Since the debut of Street Fighter IV, back in 2009, we have in fact witnessed the release of a large number of updates and a spin-off (Street Fighter X Tekken), up to Ultra Street Fighter IV, the latest variation on the subject before the advent of the fifth chapter, which as we know will be released exclusively on PlayStation 4 and PC, complete with cross-platform online multiplayer. And so, after reviewing the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 version of the game, a year later we see how Capcom worked on the next-gen edition. Ultra Street Fighter IV brings the solidity of the Capcom fighting game to PlayStation 4, but with few new features The second is good The launch of Ultra Street Fighter IV on PlayStation 4 was unfortunately not without its problems. Specifically, several users have encountered excessive lag during the fights, several glitches and even some audio bugs, so much so that the organizers of EVO 2015 have fallen back on the Xbox 360 version of the game to avoid problems for the participants in the famous competition. We therefore had to wait for the release of a patch to carry out further tests and definitively evaluate the product, fortunately without encountering technical criticalities and indeed appreciating the fluidity and definition of the graphics at 1080p and 60 frames per second, as well as the balancing act done by the developers, which is quite evident if you've spent some time with the previous incarnations of the Capcom fighting game. It seems like a detail but it's not: some characters inflict greater damage, others have seen the effectiveness of certain maneuvers reduced, while details such as staying knocked down longer or the introduction of Red Focus have added further strategic implications to a already solid and convincing gameplay, undoubtedly among the best that this videogame genre can include. Of course, many nuances can be noticed and above all exploited only by those who go beyond an occasional use of this experience, instead entering the microcosm of combos, feints and calculated risks. In short, all those things that clearly distinguish a beginner from an expert player, and which manifest themselves in a ruthless way during online matches. In this regard, the usual options have remained, with the possibility of making quick matches (which however often ~fail~ matchmaking), adjust preferences on a territorial basis to avoid excessive lag, access mini-tournaments and fun group matches . In our experience, the netcode seemed quite efficient. Playstation 4 trophies Ultra Street Fighter IV starts from the list of Trophies already present in previous editions of the game, adding nine new achievements. Some of them are obtained by completing the arcade mode with the various Rolento, Poison, Hugo, Elena and Decapre without ever continuing, while to unlock others need to successfully engage in online battles, completing certain actions. The five of the Ave Maria Without prejudice to the changes to the gameplay, there is unfortunately nothing to tear your hair out when analyzing the new features of Ultra Street Fighter IV on the content front. Yes, there are more than a hundred costumes that previously it was possible to get only by purchasing various DLCs, but those who pay little attention to this type of trappings will not be impressed and will rather dedicate themselves to deepening their knowledge of the five new characters (relatively new, as we will see later), which bring the roster to a total of forty-four fighters. The first of the group is Elena, a splendid African princess expert in capoeira, who knows how to assert herself in a whirlwind of kicks and pirouettes, although some maneuvers expose her to easy counterattacks. Then we have Rolento, the ruthless military from the cast of Final Fight (later reproposed in Street Fighter Alpha), armed with an insidious stick and annoying throwing knives, often evasive thanks to his somersaults and undoubtedly designed for more technical, capable users to fully exploit its potential. Poison also comes from Final Fight, the ~street woman~ with long pink hair, whose accessories denote a passion for bondage but whose exhibitrio turns out to be unexpectedly consistent, adapting to various approaches. Also from Final Fight there is therefore Hugo, the tribute that Capcom had wanted to pay to the legendary French wrestler Andre the Giant, who also had such popularity in Japan, especially in the first part of his career, therefore before arriving at the court of Vince McMahon. It is of course a tank, which performs more dynamic wrestling moves than those of the good old Zangief and probably more accessible even for those who do not own an arcade stick. Finally we have Decapre, a really strange name for what is to all intents and purposes a clone of Cammy (a true clone, narratively speaking) even if with the English warrior she shares only the physiognomy and not the fighting style, based in this case on maneuvers at short range and on few air variants. What's the point? In reality, as many as four of the five new entries, with their respective locations, have been ~recycled~ from the aforementioned Street Fighter X Tekken, which inevitably makes the enrichment work carried out by Capcom less interesting and the package less valuable in terms of content. In short, the value of the game remains indisputable, but perhaps it would have been appropriate to evaluate the opportunity of yet another re-edition.", "date": "2015-06-05", "grade": "7.5"}
