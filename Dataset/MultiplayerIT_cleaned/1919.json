{"name": "Kingdom Hearts", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kingdom-hearts-4.html", "text": "A fantastic world Kingdom Hearts begins its narrative on the island of destiny, a lost islet no-one-knows-where they live Sora, Riku and Kairi, a longtime friend of Sora who will live a parallel but opposite story to the main protagonist. The events, at least initially, will revolve around the disappearance of the king of Disney Castle, namely Mickey Mouse, who before disappearing will leave a note indicating a person who ~holds the key to saving the world~. Queen Minnie then decides to send Goofy and Donald Duck to find such a person and coincidentally our Sora has a large key as an offensive weapon (called the Key Blade). The two then decide to follow the victim in his adventure, thus forming a trio who will be the protagonist for most of the game and who will face obstacles of increasing difficulty. In fact, the story will take an ever deeper turn, up to the eternal struggle of man against the darkness that dwells in every soul of living beings. The locations that we will explore during the course of the game retrace many Disney classics such as Aladdin, Tarzan, Pinocchio and Alice in Wonderland. The same enemies, called Heartless due to the lack of the heart and its light that guides living beings, draw liberally from Disney productions, just note the spade guards who will block our way or Jafar's soldiers who will sell dearly the skin. But ultimately what is it? Kingdom Hearts is a classic Action Rpg with some platform elements in which we will be in command of the main protagonist Sora, supported by two other characters (who can also be chosen in turn from the worlds we will visit). Although controlled by the computer, we will be able to change the behavior of our two companions through special options, as well as interact with them during battles thanks to spells and support objects. The fights will have many points in common with titles such as Zelda, in fact we will be able to lock ourselves on a particular enemy while attacking, or we will be able to perform magic by pressing the L1 key and choosing the appropriate option. Of course, the inflated and useful Summons could not be missing, which in some cases will be hilarious and crazy (just think of the Genie of the Lamp or Dumbo!). The bad camera will instead have a negative effect on the game, not being able (even in the automatic version) to always position itself behind the protagonist and leaving the player with the difficult task of fixing it (by pressing the r2 and l2 keys) especially in fights. which are thus made quite confusing. On the other hand, they are extremely fun, thanks to the hordes of enemies that will stand against you and to the intuitive but at the same time complex and satisfying control system. In fact, the growth of the characters is entrusted to the canons of oriental role-playing games, with our Sora who will accumulate experience during battles and learn spells, new moves as well as very useful combos to take down the most difficult enemies. There are also skills shared by the three protagonists, which will prove to be very useful for reaching, for example, hidden and otherwise unreachable places. The characters that we will meet during the course of the adventure will fully reproduce the cartoon atmosphere of the game, we will also be able to come across various acquaintances who have populated the various Final Fantasy, such as Tidus, Cloud and Squall, who will appear as children and will assume different tasks and crucial in the game economy. The unfolding of the plot is always quite linear, as it will lead the player to visit the various worlds in succession until arriving at the final location, even if more than one visit to the same world will be needed to continue further. However, the feature that gives added value to the title is the impressive amount of subgames and side quests present, some very amusing and entertaining, others very useful for enhancing the characters and for discovering secret bosses and locations never visited (yes, there is also him , perhaps the most charismatic character of all Final Fantasy ever ..). Audio & Video Graphically speaking we are faced with a little gem, not so much in terms of brute power but in terms of design and care in general. The Square programmers employed in this production (a good chunk of which comes from another action rpg, Brave Fencer Musashiden) have recreated the Disney world to perfection, giving the game the exact same atmosphere thatcharacterizes any production of the great Walt. The graphics engine, while not moving an impressive amount of polygons, manages many enemies on the screen with very few uncertainties and gives its best in terms of graphic effects used. The settings are of the same quality, except for the initial location, made with a certain approximation compared to the rest of the game. In any case, the real strength remains the creation of the characters, who shine with facial expressions and hilarious and very varied animations. The direction of the sound sector has been entrusted to Yoko Shimomura and the results are immediately visible. The main theme (Simple & Clean, remix in English of the original Japanese Hikari) is nothing short of excellent, as well as most of the music featured in the game (also present in the form of remixes of the counterparts on vhs, as in the case of the Little Mermaid). The speech remained in English (with an excellent performance by the voice actors, most of whom lent their voices to the Disney characters in the cinema) while fortunately the texts are localized in Italian, generally of a good standard. Unfortunately we have to point out once again the absence of the 60hz option, which therefore ~gives~ us a slower version of the NTSC counterpart and equipped with annoying black bands, which overall occupy about 1/5 of the screen. With all the criticism leveled at Square after the blunders of Final Fantasy X, we could have expected at least a better optimization for the pal version. Comment Kingdom Hearts is certainly an atypical project from the start which however fully achieves its objective: that is, to give a fun action rpg that manages to please both the numerous Square fans and the lovers or ex-amateurs of Disney productions. The numerous extras and subgames present give that added value that allows the title to stand out and position itself as an alternative to the more serious titles of the genre. Another center therefore by Square, not recommended only for those who have never been able to digest the characters and settings created by the great Walt Disney. Sprite technique and well animated backdrops, 60 frames per second fixed even if it suffers from a very marked aliasing. Gameplay Some camera issues make controlling Sora difficult, otherwise it's a great experience. Longevity Over 30 hours of gameplay ensured by the numerous quests present that will entice you to complete the game. The announcement of Kingdom Hearts two years ago left quite a few people surprised, above all for the strange combination that would have seen a historic Rpg-grinding Software House work together with one of the most famous film companies ever and dedicated to children (but not only ). Eventually it became known that the project had been in development for much longer and that it involved over one hundred people from the Square and Disney staff, including the designer Tetsuya Nomura (FF8 and FFX among his latest creations).
