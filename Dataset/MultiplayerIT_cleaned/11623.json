{"name": "3D Battle Chess", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/3d-battle-chess.html", "text": "The publication of 3D Battle Chess does not represent a revolutionary event for the world of mobile gaming, which looks to the IndiaGames title only as the latest incarnation of chess on mobile. In fact, products of this type are quite widespread and have appeared on our terminals since the first generation devices: visually, doing justice to such applications is really simple. The Indian software house tries to increase the appeal of its chess title by providing it with a nice three-dimensional graphics. An effective solution to ~rejuvenate~ chess? The start screen of the game allows us to create a new profile (there are five slots available), then try our hand at three different modes: ~classic chess~, ~arcade chess~ and ~pass and play~. The first option translates into a classic chess game, in fact: you choose the level of difficulty and then move on to action, trying to beat an artificial intelligence that immediately turns out to be quite cunning, even by setting the challenge to a minimum . In short, we realize that 3D Battle Chess is a rather advanced and demanding product, which requires a certain skill and does not allow lightness. The ~arcade chess~ mode is the most complex one, since it allows us to choose between three different types of game: ~quick chess~ (distinguished by a strict time limit for each move), ~situation~ (a series of ~scenarios~ in which we have to take control of a game halfway and turn it in our favor) and ~puzzle~ (the most advanced and challenging option, which involves carrying out particular missions). Finally, the ~pass and play~ mode is nothing more than a very simple multiplayer that is based on the use of a single mobile phone to organize challenges with a friend. At any time of the game you can call up a menu useful for changing the game view (going from 3D to a really poor 2D), making a save and changing other parameters. How 3D Battle Chess works is very simple: the joystick moves an indicator on the screen, while the FIRE button (or 5 on the numeric pad) allows us to select units and determine their movements. The moment one of the pawns ~eats~ an opponent, we see a short animated scene in which the two characters quickly resolve the fight. Technically, the game certainly doesn't make you cry out for a miracle, but it does its job in the right way: the chess design is quite well done, the color palette used is very scarce (it is a necessary choice to differentiate the pieces) but the movement on the playing field is always fluid. The three-dimensional scenes in which the warriors fight are characterized by rough graphics, where they should have made the IndiaGames title more captivating. The sound consists of nice but short music, which therefore tends to repeat quickly, as well as some short ~jingles~ that are played during the fight scenes. PRO Different game modes Interesting 3D approach Great for chess lovers... AGAINST ...boring for everyone else Technically modest Sound thin and repetitive", "date": "2008-02-14", "grade": "S.V."}
