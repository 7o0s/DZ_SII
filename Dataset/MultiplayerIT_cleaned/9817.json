{"name": "Tremenda vendetta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/80571-shank-tremenda-vendetta.html", "text": "The Game is available for download on the Xbox Live Arcade service and PlayStation Network There was a time when scrolling fighting games were the most popular genre, especially in arcades where you could have fun beating up all sorts of criminals with the sound of coins; then the fashion passed, and as for other genres, the advent of 3D gave the definitive coup de grace to a type of production that has never been able to find itself in the world of the polygon. But you know, fashions are always destined to return, and so if it is obvious that we will never relive a ~golden age~ like that of the various Final Fights and Streets of Rage, in the same way it is fun to note how every now and then it also appears nowadays some new title that refers to those models. This time it's Shank's turn. We were friends! Shank is a game available on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network at the certainly not very popular price of 1200 points or 13 euros; created by the Canadian team Klei Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts, it is precisely an old-fashioned scrolling fighting game. The basic objective is simply to go through the levels by eliminating anyone who stands in front of the protagonist with stabs, grenades or weapons of various kinds. Where Shank undoubtedly finds a great point in favor is in the graphic component, which rests on a comic style (on the style of ~modern~ American cartoons) and of sure impact: the characters are well characterized, the settings too, the animations appear very pleasant as well as the use of colors, and finally the non-playable sequences are very enjoyable. As if that weren't enough, the game is also very, very violent, with very large doses of blood destined to spread on the screen following the many bloody killings of which the protagonist will be stained. The plot, trivial but not boring given the clear references to Tarantino's pulp cinema, revolves around Shank's desire to avenge the killing of his woman by eliminating the perpetrators of the crime, his former ~adventure~ companions. Issues that are therefore obvious but in any case this is certainly not the problem, since an Oscar-worthy background is certainly not expected for such a product; rather playability is important, especially in the ability to support what inevitably is a repetitive mechanic in the long run. Unfortunately in this aspect Shank fails to prove particularly brilliant, offering gameplay that is basically devoid of treble and which soon exhausts its qualities. The control system uses practically all the keys of the controller, to manage the attacks with the white weapon, those with the firearm, the grenades, the jump and the parry; a more than discreet variety, but which has not been exploited properly. First of all, the required dose of strategy is really minimal: the dear old button mashing, or the repeated pressing of the random attack keys is often rewarded by proving to be more than enough to be able to eliminate almost any opponent. This is because the enemies are not managed by particular intellectual qualities, nor are they equipped with a sufficient range of actions, thus becoming little more than cannon fodder. Secondly, the number of combos available to Shank is also small and limited; it won't take long to notice that he is always repeating the same moves, reducing the surprise factor to a handful of minutes. The level design, very basic and flat, does not come to the rescue; a few walls to climb or a couple of jumps to do don't improve one iota what is basically a continuous linear progress from left to right. The only truly positive and gratifying moments are therefore the clashes with the Bosses, which require a minimum of strategy and commitment; the dimensions of these opponents then, in many cases much greater than those of the hero, give the right epicity to these passages. But probably what definitively sinks Shank is the price/duration ratio, compared to a really poor longevity: 3 hours and it's all over (3 and 24 for the writer), without even particular incentives to repeat the adventure. As a partial consolation, the cooperative multiplayer should be mentioned, with a separate campaign and adapted gameplay, which however is only locally; in an era in which online is so developed and integrated, such an anachronistic choice struggles to find justification.", "date": "2010-09-10", "grade": "6.7"}
