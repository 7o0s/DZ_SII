{"name": "Actual Sunlight", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/121981-actual-sunlight-il-sole-finalmente.html", "text": "We had already come across a wonderful video game that dealt with the theme of depression, The Cat Lady, but this is something different. The mental suffering of Evan Winter, employed in an advertising agency, perhaps gifted with talent, but obese, lonely, alienated and bitter, is a means to talk about some aspects of life that concern everyone. The author of Actual Sunlight, Will O'Neill, knows that video games are very addictive and is aware that his words, through Evan's mouth, are hopeless. This is in fact the story of a man who decides to end it all and there is nothing we can do to stop it. Therefore he intervenes immediately to advise against anyone who is not in the right mental state to face this journey. He also offers words of support from those who, like him, have had to suffer some of the moods that afflict Evan, although he seems convinced that after the age of thirty there is no escape: if you have played your cards badly, don't it remains only to resign. Maybe that's not quite what he meant, we don't know. These are words spoken outside of his work, which is what interests us here, but they didn't seem exaggerated to us. Actual Sunlight has in fact the ability to confront us with our lives which, even without painful depressive tendencies, question us with the evidence of the results, which are rarely those expected. We talk about video games, and the illusion that they hide goals that can be replaced by those achievable in real life, but we also talk about indifference in the workplace, where colleagues are expendable human beings. And where we are often the first to ignore, out of laziness or selfishness, the signs of discomfort from those who perhaps share our room. What do you say, do you feel like waking up one morning as Evan? If the answer is yes, continue reading. Actual Sunlight tells in a direct and brutal way the last glimpse of Evan's life before his suicide Evan's will Actual Sunlight was developed with RPG Maker VX Ace and lasts just over an hour. There is no obstacle to overcome, no choice to make, the path has already been written. We just have to exhaust the possibilities of interacting with the people and objects around us. Clicking in front of each of them activates a short dialogue, enriched by a beautiful hand-drawn image or, much more often, a white text box on a black background. The textual brackets are actually the juice of the game and concern Evan's thoughts, from his conception of the world to self-analysis. They are usually presented as micro-essays, complete with the title and signature of the author - Evan Winter himself - but in some cases they appear as transcripts of a dialogue between Evan and a mysterious psychoanalyst. These last excerpts, which suggest a cure, are one of the most painful aspects of the game. Evan in fact tries to get out of his situation, or is the world around him to offer him a foothold; there's even room for a shred of affection and romance. But no, they are all illusions. Evan will eventually take his own life, and the game is clear on this from the start. But we still hope that something can change. You will too, even after our confirmation. You will tell yourself that the editor missed an object or a conversation that could have made a difference. If this happens to you, take it well, it means that you are alive and able to feel empathy. Unfortunately Evan can't do it anymore, and that's what partially makes us angry. In his stubbornness we see a touch of unforgivable cowardice. On the other hand, the strength of this work is all in the words, which are intimate and partly autobiographical. They therefore allow human imperfection to shine through, all its infinite nuances. O'Neill has exceptional lucidity and writes without frills or drifts. He gets straight to the point with sharp words and doesn't discount himself or the world. Eventually you'll feel that Actual Sunlight didn't finish what it had to say, that sooner or later you'll have to go back to those words and Evan's life. From our point of view this is the sign that the work has succeeded: it has touched us and questions us. We also wondered if there was some moral, or a thought that could sum up the whole story, and we were reminded of a documentary that you find on YouTube, signed Vice, about a Japanese forest renamed by the locals ~the forest of suicides~. If you've successfully tackled Actual Sunlight's mass of English texts, you won't struggle to follow the few, sober words of the documentary's Japanese guide. At the end of the video, this gentleman, observing the gifts left by relatives and friends at the scene of a suicide, says that no one is as alone as he believes, that we are all together in thishis life and we have to take care of each other. Who knows what Evan would have thought.", "date": "2013-08-14", "grade": "8.0"}
