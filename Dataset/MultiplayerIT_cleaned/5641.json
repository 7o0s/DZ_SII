Today we finally take it into consideration, about two years after the western publication of the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions, thanks to the recent arrival on Steam. Like any visual novel, XBlaze - Code: Embryo is an adventure with simple mechanics, based almost exclusively on semi-animated tables and tons of dialogues. But it must be said that in recent years the genre has evolved, it has been enriched with secondary mechanics and has shown us that it can surprise us without betraying its nature. Also in this case we can count on the addition of a pinch of gameplay which, among other things, is the tool through which the title leads us towards one of the different endings. Among the wave of Japanese titles that arrived on Steam there is also XBlaze - Code: Embryo The importance of rhythm Before talking about what makes XBlaze - Code: Embryo peculiar, it is good to give space to the narrative component that represents the backbone of the title. The events take place in 2050, 150 years before those of the BlazBlue series, and feature Touya Kagari, a typical student who gets into trouble for being too curious. Returning from the inevitable part-time job of the typical responsible student, Touya is distracted by a mysterious sound and decides to follow it, even if it comes from an area closed to the public due to a terrible accident. In this place begins a supernatural journey that has its roots in the past, precisely in that incident that ten years earlier involved both the lives of Kagaru and her adoptive sister, Hinata Himezuru. At this point, without revealing anything else given the centrality of the plot in the experience, we limit ourselves to saying that the story is immediately intriguing starting from the justification of the mysterious powers possessed by some characters, but it clearly lacks in terms of characterization and rhythm. To begin with, the main character is the classic empty shell which, excluding some sporadic juncture, has the sole function of acting as a window on events for the player. Furthermore, the main plot is diluted by tons of filler dialogues, sometimes too short to be able to say anything, sometimes exhausting in terms of length and sterility. Some opening lines of the scenes are not bad, enough to elicit more than a smile, but stereotypes in quantity, forced winks and, to say the least, superfluous exchanges risk putting even the most passionate fan of visual novels to the test, especially if not knows the BlazBlue series and cannot enjoy the added value of references to it. In any case, each link, although sterile if you don't know it, is explained and XBlaze - Code: Embryo, set 150 years before the fighting games of which it is a prequel, can boast a life of its own that finds one of its strengths in a High quality Japanese voice acting. The work of the voice actors, especially considering the inconsistency of some dialogues, is nothing short of commendable and given the genre we are talking about undoubtedly represents the soul of the audio sector, although the soundtrack, implemented in such a way as to match the tenor of the excerpts to that of the situations, it's not bad. In short, the quality is high and the same goes for the graphics sector. Although technological modesty is an intrinsic factor of this genre of games, the Arc System Works visual novels show off various interesting graphic solutions, some more than average animations, several well-differentiated environments and a rather lively direction that lightens the inevitable static nature of the situations by exploiting rapid changes of shot, flashbacks and zooms. The most recent XBlaze - Lost: Memories is even more refined but the effective trait, the solid character design and the visual solutions also give XBlaze - Code: Embryo an edge over the average of the genre. A dark fate At this point we just have to talk about that peculiar element that we mentioned in the previous paragraph and which differentiates XBlaze - Code: Embryo from the classic visual novel focused exclusively on dialogues. The gameplay of the Arc System Works title is entrusted to the ToI (Technology of Interest) system which offers us countless articles and dossiers, leaving the decision to read them or not to us. Based on our choices, accessible by pressing the J key when the ToI icon appears in the upper right corner of the screen, the title leads us to one of several endings which also include a premature end. Thus described, the ToI system may not seem too bad, but the implementation is not the best. Decidewhich articles to read without a solid system of clues to help us in the choice means arriving at an ending without really understanding why we got there and this demeans a potentially interesting system by transforming it into a sequence of articles to read or not to read. To suffer the most, also in this case, is the rhythm of the narrative and to make matters worse the limited number of save slots entails the risk of having to start over to be able to see different endings. Luckily it is possible to consult that huge database called the internet to discover the main narrative nodes and therefore arrive at the desired ending but, even in this case, we are forced to suffer hours, because we are talking about at least eight hours of gameplay even skipping several dialogues. of things already seen. It goes without saying that this approach, from whichever boss you take it from, completely nullifies the attempt to add a gameplay element to the game and even risks debasing the presence of six endings, which represent one of the strengths of the narrative sector. Among other things, as for the saves, the rest of the interface does not present any changes compared to the console version and this means no mouse support and options reduced to the bone. Obviously we are talking about a visual novel that can be enjoyed without problems using the keyboard and is compatible with the Xbox 360 pad but almost three years have passed since the Japanese debut of XBlaze - Code: Embryo and despite the price not being very high we would have expected something plus the addition of a handful of resolutions, the ability to hide subtitles by pressing backspace and the option for full screen. Instead we even find ourselves having to digest an image alignment problem that sometimes causes a horrible colored frame to appear at the edge of the screen.", "date": "2016-03-22", "grade": "6.0"}
