{"name": "Mad Dash Racing-PAL-", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mad-dash-racing-pal-.html", "text": "Platformer or racing? It hasn't been long since XBox arrived in our living rooms that the lineup of available titles is already starting to get substantial. Between shooters, racing, action and fighting games, there seems to be something for all tastes. Nonetheless those who, like me, have numerous evenings in front of the TV with Crash Team Racing or Mario Kart behind them, will have noticed the lack of a carefree racing title to be played preferably in four. It might seem like a small problem to you, but it's not for those who consider these games as a killer application with endless fun to share with friends. Having said that we would expect a clone of the aforementioned titles if it weren't for the fact that Mad Dash Racing also runs, but on foot! This small exception radically changes the point of view of a game that was born as a racing and developed as a platform. And so my mind flies away (not too much :) ) to remember that Rayman M. by Ubi Soft, reviewed by myself a few months ago, which seems to have a strong kinship with Mad Dash Racing. In both cases the platform component is very strong and enriched by a series of unforeseen events materialized in the form of insidious traps. In addition to this, in Mad Dash we will be faced with rivers to ford, mountains to climb, winding slides, crumbling bridges and an infinite number of other situations. As if that weren't enough, our journey will be made even more difficult by an army of evil midgets ready to do anything to stop us, by aquatic monsters, anacondas and even fire-breathing dragons. All of this should be enough to convince entrants to withdraw their entry, but unfortunately the image of the prized prize is as vivid in their minds as ever. What you wouldn't do for a pig... The protagonists Only a madman could think of completing the difficult task of recovering the Red Meteorite, and in fact for the occasion here are some of the funniest and most bizarre characters ever seen in a video game: Zero-G: bionic dog suffering from postwar traumatic stress. He lived for years in a tiger's cage, feeding on his own urine to survive. Chops: Female-loving biker boar. Due to some intestinal problems, toxic gases of rare power are often let out. Big Blue: mysterious blue thug with impressive strength and size. Sid: punk girl who bores the other participants by constantly complaining. Betty: sweet girl armed with a powerful wrench. Roscoe: feisty armadillo that is best avoided. Faze: very fast alien from a not very hospitable planet. Spanx: animal of an unidentified species born from a laboratory experiment. Ash: could an Italian be missing? a cute little dragon with a funny walk. The characters, not all available initially, are divided into three categories: thugs, speedsters and flyers. However, belonging to one category rather than another is not accidental since, for example, the thugs will be able to carry out attacks against their opponents, the sprinters will have the gift of super-speed and the fliers will be able to take prodigious leaps and glide like gliders. Can anyone show me the way? One of the winning features of Mad Dash is certainly made up of the race courses, often very long but which are particularly striking for their incredible extension (far and wide) and variety. And so we will have to pass through intricate forests, boundless expanses of sand dunes, ruins of ancient civilizations, lakes of incandescent magma and much more. Individual tracks lasting 4-5 minutes, full of shortcuts, dead ends, secret passages and anything else you probably won't be able to see due to the frenzy of the race... Precisely due to the complexity of the structure of the courses, Mad Dash Racing reveals sooner than expected, also due to a control system that is not exactly easy to master. The character is controlled via the left analog stick while the other keys on the Pad allow you to jump, use specific skills, perform special attacks or activate weapons and power-ups collected along the way. Like any game of this genre, it is in fact possible to collect objects of various kinds that will temporarily give us new powers, even if to tell the truth, the usefulness of these ~bonuses~ is somewhat questionable. In addition to the single-player Adventure mode, great importance is rightly given to the multiplayer section which allows a maximum number of 4 human players to challenge each other along the paths unlocked in the single-player game.And this is where Mad Dash Racing probably reaches its peak of fun. It will be difficult to resist the temptation to challenge your friends in intense races where the skill of each character will make the difference and where only those who manage to avoid the pitfalls of the course will be able to arrive safely at the finish line. Even in our language... Graphically, Mad Dash Racing is a mixture of good and bad things. While it's true that we certainly don't expect miracles from XBox from a game like this, it's also true that we would have gladly done without the slowdowns that occasionally afflict the graphics engine. This is nothing particularly serious but it will still make those who believed that the Microsoft console was free from similar drawbacks turn up their noses. Mysteriously these slowdowns almost completely disappear in the four-player mode, although a worsening could be expected instead. For the rest, both the design of the settings, with some goodies such as the excellent realization of the liquid surfaces, and that of the characters are very appreciable. The sound sector is even more valid and enriched by the hilarious and qualitatively valid dubbing in Italian of the voices of the characters. Also noteworthy is the choice of audio tracks, among which pieces by Moby, Fatboy Slim (remember ~Right here, right now!~) and Propellerheads stand out. All from the roaster... In conclusion Mad Dash Racing turns out to be a pleasant surprise that has something to do with the target while not excelling from a technical point of view. After all, what does it matter that our console for once hasn't flexed its muscles if in the end the product is equally enjoyable and infinitely fun. We are dealing with a title that is not perfect but which is still a must for anyone who wants to enjoy the healthy fun offered by a racing full of humor and for anyone who has three crazy friends to challenge in multiplayer mode. Finally, let me disapprove of the choice of attaching the pig that is talked about so much in the game to the packaging of the game, but this shortcoming can be easily remedied by visiting your trusted roaster :) Pros: Fun alone and in four Characters released from the asylum Vast routes Dubbing in Italian Cons: Control not easy Some slowdown All for a pig... In the land of Trem there is an evil wizard named Hex who dreams of world domination. His powers are due to a magical scepter which, however, alone is not enough for Hex to complete his diabolical design. And so our wizard has nothing left but to take possession of the Red Meteorite, the only tool capable of giving him omnipotence, which however is scattered around the planet in five distinct fragments. The task would seem really prohibitive were it not for the fact that Hez decides to organize a competition among the inhabitants of Trem, giving away nothing less than a pig. Attracted by the coveted prize, numerous adventurers flock to them willing to risk their lives to recover the pieces of the Red Meteorite. Get ready for the starting line because the competition that will decide the fate of the world and, above all, of an unfortunate and tasty pig is about to start.", "date": "2002-04-12", "grade": null}
