You should know that the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons, the popular ~pen and paper~ role-playing game that has fascinated for 25 years (and still fascinates) many players all over the world, has been out for a few months. Many things have changed, the purists of the genre will already know everything, I will limit myself to saying for those who are not accustomed to the environment but equally intrigued, that the system has been simplified, both in the fights and in the management of one's character, from the creation ( with new classes and races) to growth (improved multiclassing, introduction of golden classes)... On the other hand, the feeling of that fringe (let's say fringe...) of players who have played Advanced D&D for years, is that these new rules bring out the power player hidden within us a little too much. However, in general the reception was good. When the 20 die merges with the pc Why did I focus on this aspect? PORROMD is the first PC game to boast the use of these new rules, and I confess that the possibility of dealing with them has greatly piqued my expectations... let's see why, after trying the game, the disappointment appears on this weary face of a warrior dwarf. Let's start with the rules. They have been introduced, yes, but only partially. Meanwhile, classes such as the bard, the druid and (hear, hear) the wizard (!) are missing. Of course there is a sorcerer... but you shouldn't have taken away the wizard from me! I realize that for someone this can be interpreted as fussiness, and in this regard I refer you to the final judgment, where I will justify these ~fixations~. Secondly, and as an aggravating factor, the impossibility of choosing the skills and talents of the character to one's liking along its growth, (one of the strengths of the 3rd edition) limiting the player's choice towards increasing one's class or bi-classification with a different class. Point. A little bit in terms of freedom. Based on an unspecified system, abilities are arbitrarily assigned... But let's get to the heart of the game mechanics... Beat, smash, bring back the treasure and gain experience Well yes, die-hard fans of massacre and the craziest power play! This is PORROMD: does it seem little? Indeed yes, but let's not forget that it can be done with style. Let me explain: playing a RPG based on fighting can also be a pleasure, because it doesn't take up time in bizarre situations, it satisfies (I repeat) the powerplaying hidden in each of us with experience points, objects and ever more powerful weapons. The problem is that this system assumes that everything is created in a workmanlike manner.. and unfortunately this is not the case. Mind you, efforts have been made and it shows. But something doesn't seem right. Meanwhile, it must be said that the fight takes place in ~dynamic turns~ in the sense that each character, both yours and each of the monsters, will perform one or more actions in his turn, but there is a set time for the turn, symbolized by a small bar green that runs out gradually. The unfortunate thing is that, however, the pace of the game suffers a lot especially when for each and I emphasize Every fight, even with a loser zombie, the turn-based mode starts, making the game overall slow at times disarming. A navigation menu system has also been designed which is very similar to those we usually use with Windows, ie menus and submenus. A real convenience if we think about it, it's a pity that the mistake often pays off! To know why, you need to bother another cumbersome guest. Make way for... A graphics engine certainly not forged by dwarves! 3D. Here is another innovative element of this game. The characters are entirely polygonal, as are the different elements of the landscape. The movements are fluid and everything is very pleasant, even the monsters render well, not to mention the excellent work of the backdrops and the always pleasant light effects of the spells. End of the positives. When you enter combat everything slows down and clicks in a flashy alas .. and here is the menu system becomes a real Russian roulette. the pointer moves jerkily and more often than you think you lose your turn in a vain attempt to reach an object or a spell to click (often you click and it doesn't start, so again you instinctively c-l-i-c-c-a slower to do it ) all to favor the monsters, who are eagerly awaiting farci in meatballs. And then she recharges and tries again and so on. Still with regard to the engine, other things blow your mind a bit. But how, for years we have been playing with a petty thief in the party who goes around where he wants and how he wants and now as soon as we get him 5 or 6 meters away from the group, a message comes out that does not allow us to get too far from the leader of the group . And what is it? My mom who has to keep an eye on me? Another engine limitation so they say. How, after all, aren't we all used to dragging the pointer to select the characters on the screen and make them move? Well they took that away too! There is only one button that makes the whole party move, or just one character at a time... to top it off, there are no pre-packaged formations that quickly make us organize the positions of our heroes as we see fit, but we have to make them move one by one and once this is done, a button is clicked which ~stores~ the formation. A somewhat cryptic system, above all because it seems to me that they have already invented the optimal recipe, and if the team that wins does not change, it can be said that this game is... Born under the sign of the pheasant Of course it's a joke... but one really thinks that this game has been struck by bad luck. In reality, human error is always the basis of everything. The game released in the American version presented some very annoying bugs, including one which, when uninstalling, also took away some system files. Has this only happened to a few people? Ok, but it doesn't have to happen and that's it! At the end on the shelf we expect something that will repay the money we leave ourselves in satisfaction. In this regard, it must be said that Ubisoft immediately took action to correct the bugs and to listen to users, and soon several patches will be flocking to improve the situation. Furthermore, the Italian version will be ~bug-free~ so rest assured. Born under the sign of the pheasant What I want to say is that the feeling I had is that originally the creation of the game wanted to leverage the so-called ~elitist~ aspects such as the rules, dice rolls, etc. All characteristics posed to excite ~hard-core~ gamers, and instead the greatest criticisms come from them. Management and development problems arose along the way of programming, and if you want to get an idea of how things went and exonerate PORROMD in part, read this interview with the project manager which recently appeared on the mother network. Obviously in English. However, it is necessary to get used to the Albion language quickly, given that the version on the market in our country from the middle of the month (and it is confirmed) will be distributed in English, without subtitles of any kind; then the CDs will be replaced in January with the Italian version. Do you know how to nip a game in the bud? Is it worth creating a ~hype~ of biblical proportions, Jordan stone-cutters' revolt style, when the only result you get is being overwhelmed by the rush to get things done? After all, to break the delicate balance of fantasy and immersion, ergo the desire to play ... it doesn't take much. Wrong data, an expense to be returned, a wrong decision in the control room. A game to throw away? It certainly disappoints those who have fantasized about it for months, or those who expect radical revolutions, or simply the lack of respect for some healthy ~clich~ of fantasy role-playing games (call me crazy, but I don't accept a dwarf without a beard !!). However, it can be a good link for those approaching ~role-playing~ video games for the first time and for those who are not frightened by a long succession of increasingly demanding battles, until their character grows to semi-divine levels, through the 100 and more hours of gameplay that PORROMD has to offer. However, there is also a masterpiece of the ~beater-breaker~ called Icewind Dale which, for several months now, has created followers all over the world and certainly does not look bad at a distance. The choice is yours friends! Once upon a time... The legendary history of the Gold Box. In 1988 the progenitor Pool of Radiance was released, which is also the first RPG on PC to implement the rules of Advanced D&D and moreover, tactical combat enriched by an exciting adventure, and lots and lots of exploration. Its success has inspired many titles to come in the Forgotten Realms, or in the Dragonlance and Dark Sun universes. It's time to draw your ax and smooth your red beard. It's time to dust off the tome of spells. It's time to saddle up the horses and get readyi at departure. Pool of Radiance - Ruins of Myth Drannor, the sequel to its acclaimed predecessor (hereafter PORROMD..blah! what an acronym...) is a role-playing game that to many may seem ~old style~ as they once did , at least as far as the conception is concerned.
