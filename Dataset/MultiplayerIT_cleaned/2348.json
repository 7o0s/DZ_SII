Not so much because it is a game that is truly different from the mass of mobile RPGs with management grafts, nor because of an excellent quality of its realization (indeed), but simply because of the slightly different and almost classic RPG spirit that seems to animate this production by Atari, making it something quite different from what one might expect by reading its ingredients, which seem to lead to a now overused recipe. Sure, the setting isn't the most original, but using it as a starting point for such a game isn't exactly a hackneyed idea and the result is something like a handcrafted mix, made with simple 2D drawings and a smattering of 3D map, between Fallout and State of Decay, making the necessary proportions. Days of Doom features classic RPG turn-based combat The premise is decidedly classic: a mysterious disease has led to the awakening of the dead and ancient beings who now roam the earth's surface and as a result, humanity has been practically destroyed. The few remnants of civilization try to organize themselves into small self-sufficient centers but are constantly besieged by hordes of zombies and similar creatures that infest the world, forcing a continuous struggle for survival. In this desperate situation, we find ourselves trying to build an increasingly large and organized village until it becomes a fortified city, which serves as a base for a handful of heroes intent on cleaning up the world quest after quest, in progressively difficult missions in wander through the wilderness. Not the height of originality, we said, but it is a setting that always performs its function perfectly when it comes to staging extreme survival, especially if it is represented in a rather particular way as in Days of Doom, which seems to all effects a sort of animated comic, or a real pen and paper RPG with hand-drawn illustrations. Between Mad Max, Left 4 Dead, State of Decay and Fallout, the suggestions from other famous titles are numerous but they form a mixture capable of maintaining a certain interest in the story, all the more so since it is not - for once - the usual Fantasy. Days of Doom is divided between building and managing a city and questing with RPG-style combat City management and quests The gameplay of Days of Doom is spread over two main sections: the management of the village which is the basis for the characters and the quests to be undertaken around the world, essentially made up of a series of battles in sequence. Where have we read something like this before? In pretty much every free-to-play mobile RPG review for a few years now, in fact. The Atari game slavishly follows the typical plot of the genre but manages to stand out above all thanks to its characterization and management of the characters and fights that recalls the more classic tradition of role-playing games more than many other games. Already the fact of not filling the home screen with banners with promotional offers for special drops or overloading the character management system with dozens of sub-menus and growth mechanics built to push micro-transactions makes Days of Doom more likeable than many other similar titles, even if the distortions are here too. In particular, the management part includes all the classic system of waiting for the construction or evolution of the buildings which aim at spending the in-game currency to compress the times, just as each new quest requires an expenditure of other in-game currency. game to be able to access it. In short, these are the usual free-to-play traps, even if the internal rewards manage to maintain a good balance, in addition to having to be patient to dose the waiting times. The management of the characters of Days of Doom is quite simple and classic, but also satisfying The clashes and the management of the characters are perhaps the most genuinely role-playing aspects of Days of Doom, although these too are bent to the needs of the modern mobile structure, so there is a gacha system for the recruitment of the characters (through a random system of encounters at the tavern) nor the possibility of enabling autoplay and speeding up the fights, which derive from a mechanic that is not too strategic in most cases and from the abundant recurrence of the same type of enemies and clashes. Theturn-based combat, however, has some interesting aspects in the management of special abilities and in the possible assortment of characters in the party with different characteristics, also becoming challenging in certain situations, especially when facing bosses. The management of the characters always depends a lot on the expenditure of in-game currency but has a more classic and simple aspect, focused on training and equipping various objects and disengaging from too brainy mechanics. The result of all this is an initially pleasant progression between quests and fighter leveling, but the repetitiveness becomes evident after a few hours. In the same way, the peculiar old-fashioned comic characterization that helps outline a rather unique identity for Days of Doom ends up increasing this monotony, however, given the repetition of the elements and the even excessive simplicity with which he builds the setting and puts scene the fights.", "date": "2021-03-03", "grade": "6.7"}
