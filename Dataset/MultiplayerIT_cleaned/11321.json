{"name": "Family Ski - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/family-ski-recensione.html", "text": "With summer in full swing and temperatures well in excess of 30 degrees, probably the last thing on your mind is to put on your overalls, boots and cap and go skiing. Due to an oddity of the programming of the European releases, however, this is precisely the theme of Family Ski, an effort for the Wii created by Namco Bandai and distributed directly by Nintendo itself. Fresh snow on the scales Despite being made by an external softco, Family Ski could very well be a first party game given the marked presence of the ~N factor~ from different points of view. First of all the integration with Miis, which can be used as an alter ego as an alternative to the approximately 200 characters designed by the programmers; in reality, the adoption of a Mii leads to a limitation linked to the impossibility of wearing hats and glasses, but even if you accept this small inconvenience, you still have the option to customize your skier with a large number of parts of the equipment, from skis to gloves, drawing on a list that is also extended in parallel with the progress in the adventure. But the bulk of the work was undoubtedly done on the control system, which denotes the team's particular familiarity with wiimotes and nunchuks as well as a determined desire to exploit their characteristics in a thorough and non-listless way. The two parts of the Nintendo console controller must in fact be used together, since they will then effectively simulate the two sticks held by your character on most occasions. Moving them from top to bottom at the same time is equivalent to planting the rackets on the ground to push forward and gain speed, and in the same way, instead turning them outwards allows you to assume the ~egg~ downhill position to minimize the resistance of the air during descents. But the bulk of the work has undoubtedly been done on the control system, which denotes the team's particular familiarity with wiimotes and nunchuks Fresh snow on the scales The curves are instead performed by tilting the wiimote and nunchuck to the left or right (+C for a Fantozziano snowplow), while the use of the keys is limited to interaction with the characters (A), braking (analog stick back) and technique del Wedeln also known as wag (B + Z while cornering), the latter being essential for successfully tackling stretches of slope with humps and bumps. However, Family Ski is also and above all famous for being the second game to take advantage of the Balance Board, after obviously Wii Fit; unfortunately the impression is that it is a last-minute addition, since the peripheral is delegated purely to replace the controller in order to be able to turn, obviously by shifting the weight to the left or right. It would have been nice to be able to exploit its precision and characteristics also to detect other weight shifts backwards or forwards, in such a way as to affect speed, but unfortunately this is not the case. It should also be considered that using the Balance Board makes the experience even more ~physical~ and therefore tiring, thus imposing in this case the need to restrict the duration of the game sessions. How much does the ski pass cost? Family Ski is set in a single ski resort, or rather a resort built on the model of those present in the Japanese mountains; there are 14 slopes, all connected to each other, diversified by difficulty and characteristics, as well as by the quality and type of snow with which you will have to deal. And so you can start from the ~bottom up~ on wide slopes without particular complications, only to then climb in altitude by tackling icy sections, or full of humps, or particularly steep, or still dedicated exclusively to evolutions and tricks. A big pity is that the tracks are delimited by invisible barriers which in practice absolutely prevent off-piste, limiting both the realism and the exploratory factor which, on the other hand, soon runs out given the non-particular dimensions of the resort. Aware of this, the Namco Bandai team has therefore inserted as many challenge factors as possible, to thus always keep the interest at an acceptable level; in addition to gaining an evaluation on your skiing automatically every time you start to tackle a slope, what stimulates the most is the constant presence of many other skiers, some of whom limit themselves to descending with more or less haste, representing an obstacle to take into account, others with which you can interact distinguishable from a detective story. These characters can provide information, but above all offer the player quite varied challenges (about 150), ranging from simpledownhill or slalom racing in search of characters or items, delivery from one end of the resort to the other, rescue, trivia questions and so on. Also worth mentioning are the numerous details which however confirm the care with which this Family Ski was made; for example the vibrations that the controller returns when, during the trip on the chairlift, you pass over a pylon, and again the possibility of being photographed in 50 different poses or on special occasions to then create your own photo album, the faculty of choosing whether to ski by day or by night with lots of lighting and fireworks, not to mention the music that recalls other Namco Bandai titles such as Pac-Man or Katamari. And faithfully to the title, there is also a multiplayer mode for up to 4 users in split screen which allows both to challenge each other in races and to cooperate to solve missions. In reality, everything could have been developed more, and furthermore the graphics engine - already in itself certainly not capable of surprising - shows evident difficulties in managing the split screen. Comment Family Ski is a product made with care and attention, which finds its main virtue in an immediate and well-crafted control system and in a gameplay structure that is far from original but quite stimulating and satisfying. In general, the work done by the Namco Bandai programmers should be appreciated, capable of reproducing the Nintendo factor so well as to make Family Ski seem in many respects like a game baked directly from the ~parent company~. If the mild and relaxing rhythms, the level of difficulty that is affordable to say the least and the inevitable repetitiveness do not represent a problem for you, then Family Ski can represent a valid and pleasant product with which to dream of a few hours of refreshment during this scorching summer. Pros Great control system Has Nintendo flavor even if it's not made in Nintendo Fun Cons Few tracks Underused balance board Repetitive", "date": "2008-07-03", "grade": null}
