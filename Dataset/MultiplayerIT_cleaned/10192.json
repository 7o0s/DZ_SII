Tehra Dark Warrior is the classic 3D hack&slash that will take you to explore a fantasy world in an attempt to slice as many evil monsters as possible, thus saving what there is to save. From this premise it is immediately clear that the originality of the plot is not the strong point of the title in question: Tehra is a warrior-sorceress who lives in the world of Sistar who, after centuries of wars between men and Urka'h (a race of demons who, like all self-respecting demons, spend their time trying to exterminate the human race) has found a fragile truce. Tehra's task will be to fight all those who try to jeopardize this painstakingly achieved peace. A few automatisms too many The protagonist, in order to fulfill this task, soon reveals her sharing in the demonic nature of the Urka'h. This allows her, when the mana bar fills up, to transform into her darkening counterpart with powers that make her able to defeat even the strongest monsters. Beyond the lack of originality of the background Tehra Dark Warrior is however a game that overall can offer about ten hours of fun. The difficulty of the game is in fact calibrated in such a way as to put the player in front of a challenge that is at times demanding which however has the advantage of tending not to lead to ~mission impossible~ frustration. The combination of Tehra's warrior and sorceress skills enriches the depth game by giving it that acceptable number of variations that allow you to invent ~tactics~ with which to face the different combats. Physical and magical abilities are then connected: to obtain the mana necessary to cast the spells, you have to kill enemies with swords. This obviously forces the player to make choices about the spells to cast and the moment in which to do so, taking into account the limited resources he may have at his disposal. Add to this that there is a good variety of spells and skills to learn, at the cost of hard cash that we generally find in the chests scattered around the schemes or more rarely from the monsters we kill. However, the combat mechanisms have undergone simplifications through automatisms: on the one hand these have the advantage of making life easier on the other, they could dissatisfy less casual players. So, for example, it is sometimes irritating that spells are automatically cast on the closest monster or that the protagonist in melee automatically turns towards the monster that hit her, thus preventing her from attacking a dying monster. There is also a lack of a second attack button, which could have generated combos that would certainly have improved the feeling of variety in the gameplay. Even the continuous respawn of monsters can sometimes be boring, considering that it happens at such a speed that on some occasions we are forced to run around the screen shooting a single shot every now and then rather than directly facing the hordes of enemies that attack us. The mechanism works, but should perhaps have been filed a little. Other important elements are the presence of various mini-games scattered within the plot and the possibility of engaging in challenges such as the one offered by Survival Mode, with related online rankings. The latter option can undoubtedly help give the title an extra notch on the scale of fun and longevity. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, the game is generally well cared for: the graphics render well even if the textures sometimes appear a little ~flat~ and not all the settings and monsters are at the same level of detail. Thus, for example, the bosses are often notable in terms of realization while many trash mobs are attributed the role of expendable supporting actors, even aesthetically. The sound sector has a good quality even if perhaps in the long run it tends to be a little monotonous. Also valuable are many graphic effects that often give color to the fights. The opponents' AI is rather rudimentary but more than acceptable, considering that its limits are in any case compensated by the commitment generated by the number of enemies who generally attack us without respite. The controls are quite simple even if not exactly very precise and require a minimum of practice to learn how to maneuver the protagonist without risking that instead of slicing a large and drooling ogre she goes hunting for butterflies. In conclusion Tehra Dark Warrior is a game that somewhat respects all the canons of the genre to which it belongs without inintroduce particular novelties but still offering a good level of fun.
