{"name": "World Tour Soccer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-tour-soccer.html", "text": "Disappointing gameplay But as often happens, ~the dress does not make the monk~. And World Tour Soccer cannot disprove this saying. Once you take the field and beat the kick-off, all the typical flaws of the series from which it originated jump out like crazed crickets. If from an aesthetic point of view we have well-made polygonal models, with rather well-built environments and players and covered with convincing textures, from the purely simulation one the Sony title leaves something to be desired. The gameplay, in fact, has remained almost unchanged compared to the counterpart seen on Ps2, focused as it is on the immediacy and pure and simple fun without the frills typical of an arcade product. Proof of this is that building realistic actions in WTS turns out to be pure utopia, and every action is reduced to a sort of pinball machine on the field burdened by an AI of the CPU of teammates and opponents that is certainly not credible and by a physics of the ball that is anything but realistic . On the other hand, on the opposite level, the control system that allows players to perform a good number of actions and movements, almost literally taking up the system introduced by Konami. It is a pity that the certainly not well-kept animations end up compromising in part the good things just described and, consequently, those rare actions built with a certain logical connection. Graphics and Audio Graphically, as we mentioned at the beginning, WTF defends itself quite well. The footballers are quite similar to their real counterparts and have a fair number of well-made textures. The stadiums and turf are beautiful, overall the Sony title looks better, aesthetically, than the various TIFs seen on the Ps2. Too bad that the animations are always the same, although more numerous than in the recent past, they are badly done. As for the audio sector, not much to say. Localized in Italian, with the commentary entrusted to the old Bruno Pizzul, World Tour Soccer offers very little from this point of view, with the aforementioned journalist who limits himself to some repetitive interventions at the beginning and end of the game, or to name the players in possession of the ball on the field, and a ~stadium effect~ (read: chants, buzz, general atmosphere) that is discreet but adds nothing to a product that falls short of expectations. Conclusions World Tour Soccer is one of those titles intended for a mass audience, the one that, to be clear, pays little attention to certain technical aspects such as ~playability & realism~. The Sony title aims at a game system that makes fun and immediacy its motto, but does it in a careless way, which does not justify too old and not very engaging gameplay. FIFA also focuses heavily on an arcade style, given the recent failures in the attempt to ape Winning Eleven, yet the EA Sports game at least manages to entertain and offer a much better product than this. Too bad, because some ~finds~ and the many modes available could have been better exploited by the development team. Only for those who, waiting for Pes 5, are abstinent from ~portable football~. Pros: Well-maintained graphics. Very fun ~Challenge~ mode. Multiplayer support via Wi-Fi. Cons: Not enough gameplay and AI. Animations to review. Unbelievable general physics. The game most loved by Italians can never be missing from any self-respecting console and this is Sony, which has built part of its fortunes in the videogame field by exploiting the brand name of a football saga that needs no introduction, Winning Eleven (Pes ) knows it well. So much so, it is now established that a football title is essential to have it at the launch of a console, even if only to calm the ever-constant hunger for football that grips more and more millions of fans, perhaps waiting, almost as if it were just an appetizer, of better products (someone said Konami?)... World Tour Soccer seems to be starting off on the right foot, offering the user everything that every football and video game fan expects to find in a similar title: various options to customize the own team, various competitions to try your hand at, eye-catching menu graphics and lots of teams to select. In this regard, it should be noted that initially the Sony title does not allow the use of clubs to play competitions. They will be unlockable only after having obtained victories in tournaments for the national teams (World Cup, European Championships, etc.) or in other ~modes~. The modes available, as mentioned, are several, but among the usual ones we would like to point out one in particular, which is very interesting: the one called ~Challenge~. This modality consists in completing the objectives that the CPU gives to the gamer and which must be completed in the best possible way to collect a definished score. In practice it works like this: the game system assigns tasks, for example it ~asks~ us not to concede goals from the opponents or to make a certain number of consecutive passes without making mistakes, things that we will have to do on the pitch, and it will evaluate the behavior of our men by attributing positive or negative points depending on the progress of the match. Each goal or pass scored, just to give another example, will give rise to a positive score which will however decrease every time one of our opponents recovers a ball or forces us to make some mistakes.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
