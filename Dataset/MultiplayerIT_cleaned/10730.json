After causing havoc, she is captured by the US Army and locked up in a top secret facility, built specifically for ~monsters~. Renamed ~Ginormica~ because of her obvious abilities, she meets the brilliant Doctor Professor Beetle (a scientist with an insect body), the bizarre Missing Link (a hybrid between fish and primate), the gelatinous B.O.B. (a real smart ~blob~) and of the enormous Insectosaurus (a larva more than one hundred meters high). When an alien invasion threatens the Earth and conventional weapons prove ineffective to repel it, General Monger decides to free the ~monsters~ and form an extraordinary team with them, the only one able to protect the planet from the looming threat. .. An always different game In its Nintendo DS version, Monsters vs. Aliens tells the story of the film through a certain number of levels, within which we take control of all the characters. The stages in which we wear the (large) clothes of Ginormica are mainly based on platforms: our goal is to reach a certain area of the city after having avoided all the dangers present (for example the railway line) and after eliminating all the aliens encountered along the way. The giant girl certainly knows how to defend herself, as she can deliver powerful blows and use her momentum to make truly spectacular jumps, capable of covering long distances. The stages in which we control the Missing Link are similar in structure, even if they take place indoors (the character plays the role of ~spy~, sneaking into alien structures). In addition to a strong fighting ability, the fish-monkey hybrid boasts a certain aptitude for climbing and can hit enemies with its spit, which can be operated both via buttons and through the DS microphone (better to blow and not spit, however... ). When we find ourselves controlling B.O.B., we can instead use his peculiarities to change shape (through a nice minigame involving the stylus and the touch screen) and to cross grids, adhering to any surface without the slightest problem. The technical aspect If you've seen Monsters vs. Aliens at the cinema, you'll be happy to find all the characters, drawn really well, in this videogame for Nintendo DS. The graphics are full of colors, very lively, with rather fluid and convincing animations in the platform sections, while in the three-dimensional phases under the command of the Insectosaurus things appear a bit too repetitive and devoid of particular charm: the collapsing buildings do their figure, but they are always the same. As for the sound part, music and effects are average. The use of the touch screen is limited to a few moments, with the action taking place on the upper screen of the console, and the control system in general appears simple and straightforward. Big and little things If the structure of the levels is more or less the same when we control Ginormica, the Missing Link and B.O.B, things change drastically when we switch to the command of the huge Insectosaurus: the view varies from the classic side view of platformers to a third person from the high, while our character makes his way through the city, disintegrating the buildings under his mass. Buildings collapse and shatter like paper, revealing items to collect or enemies to fight. Given its size and strength, the Insectosaurus is clearly the monster team member that takes care of bigger opponents, thanks to its devastating blows and ranged attack. These action-packed stages are contrasted by the Doctor Professor Beetle puzzles, mini-games in which you have to move elements on a board in such a way that a ray of light can pass through all the green switches. In both cases, we are faced with solutions placed at the antipodes: on the one hand the action as an end in itself and a little boring of the fights between the titans, on the other hand the puzzles not always within the reach of the young audience to whom the game is aimed.", "date": "2009-05-06", "grade": null}
