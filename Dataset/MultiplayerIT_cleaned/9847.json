Look at Kane and Lynch: the first, an unscrupulous mercenary, was waiting in prison to be executed, resigning himself to never being able to know his daughter; the second, a psychopath in the throes of frequent homicidal fits, had been hired to get Kane out of jail and get valuable information from him for his bosses. When fate turned its back on both of them, the two learned despite themselves to cover each other, to help each other, to survive while everyone around them fell. Together they faced hell and survived; but they've remained the same: mercenaries, minions, criminals call them what you like. It's been a while since their first ~adventure~, Lynch has settled in Shanghai and works for an English arms smuggler who is about to close a big deal. It takes good people to make sure everything goes smoothly, and Lynch is in no doubt who to call. For his part, Kane just wants one last chance, a ~clean~ and lucrative job that will allow him to retire from the business and take care of his daughter for years to come. When she meets Lynch, she still has her trolley in tow. Before taking him to the hotel, however, he has to deal with a very simple matter, which is to scare a guy who has been talking a bit too much lately. But things don't go the right way and during a shooting Kane kills the wrong person. In the following forty-eight hours, while the whole city will hunt him down, he will have the opportunity to regret his mistake... Two like us Sequel to a controversial but very successful title, Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days hits like a punch in the stomach right from the first sequences, and for this reason we will try not to anticipate anything of what is told during the eleven stages that make up the story fashions. Unlike the first episode of the series, this time the scenario remains the same all the time, but it is a choice that in no way affects the goodness of the experience. In fact, Shanghai is represented in an extraordinary way, both in the urban cross-sections of the streets and crossroads, as well as in the suburbs, in the abandoned areas, in its endless alleys, often without exit. The action takes place both indoors and outdoors, with an excellent degree of involvement that is further amplified by one of the novelties introduced by this sequel, namely the camera that follows the character we control (this time Lynch) as if brought to shoulder from a sort of virtual cameraman, complete with jolts and loss of focus. The effect, already seen in recent times in some films and TV series, is exhilarating and contributes greatly to creating a sense of tension and realism that accompanies all our movements, especially chases. During the actual shootings, the view returns to a relative calm and allows us to try our hand at the classic practice of stalking behind a shelter, an element that is handled quite well in the game. It is possible to lean in and shoot, with the reticle memorizing the position when we then take cover, or just pull out the weapon and shoot blindly, with rather satisfactory results in this case. One of the limitations of the first Kane & Lynch concerned the aiming system, judged by many to be inaccurate, and for this sequel the developers have tried to change something. The number of weapons at our disposal is really vast (pistols of various calibers and types, light machine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, etc.) and we can carry two of them with us at the same time, but it is necessary (when possible) to pay attention to what we choose to use based on the situation: light machine guns are fine at close range, but prove utterly inaccurate at range; as well as shotguns, which offer enormous power but only in close quarters. Assault rifles, especially single-shot ones (not to mention sniper rifles), on the other hand, are the ideal solution for all-round shooting. In any case, getting a headshot right is far from simple and unfortunately some doubts remain about the precision of the aim, but it should be understood whether it is a deliberate solution to increase the degree of realism or a real defect. Otherwise we get angry Another element on which IO Interactive has definitely worked is artificial intelligence. Not so much that of our comrade, who for better or worse continues to launch himself like a madman and generally shoots empty (which is also right: may it ever take away the satisfaction of eliminating our enemies from us), but rather that of theour adversaries. Both the very numerous gang members and the policemen, in fact, will never stand still behind a shelter waiting to be hit by a bullet, but will move from one point to another, lean out from a different position to open fire and in many cases they will try to gain an elevated position to be able to hit us even while we are behind a car or a low wall. In many cases they will even decide to abandon their shelter and fight head on, quickly approaching our character: this situation does not appear to be developed in the best possible way, as the management of the default view is not very fast (indeed) and therefore it is necessary to shoot a bit blindly to get rid of the threat. The hand-to-hand combat has also been reduced to a minimum, with Kane who can possibly catch a nearby enemy and use it as a human shield, but it is a solution that leaves the time it finds and that after the first few times we will tend not to use more. The situation regarding flammable objects is different: in the vicinity of some shelters, we will in fact find petrol cans or fire extinguishers that we can grab, throw in the middle of the enemy ranks and explode on the fly to defeat them. The effect is truly spectacular, even if it is sometimes less effective than one would expect. Speaking of spectacular sequences, towards the end of the game you find yourself in a truly exciting and adrenaline-pumping situation despite its basic simplicity: the worthy crowning of a story mode that is certainly short (five hours are enough to complete it) but really intense, raw and engaging. Moreover, this is the only section of the game that created some headaches for our test configuration: playing at a resolution of 1680 x 1050 pixels, with all effects at their maximum, the frame rate remained at 40-50 frames per second. Moving on to a purely technical discussion, it must be said that compared to the first Kane & Lynch the developers have done an extraordinary job, making substantial improvements to the polygonal models, now extremely more realistic and better animated, and offering us realistic and detailed scenarios. Furthermore, the sound sector boasts a superlative direction both as regards the dialogues (in English they are of exceptional intensity) and the management of the sounds, with meticulous attention to the acoustic environment depending on the place where we are. The Italian localization, of good quality as regards the voices, will irreparably lose something in the regulation of the levels and therefore in the integration between dialogues and audio in general. Single and multiple The single mode of Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days can be played in full, selecting the individual chapters or in online cooperative multiplayer - on consoles also locally via split screen. Tackling the story mode in two, perhaps at the extreme level of difficulty, certainly arises as a complex and compelling experience, with the classic ~Winnie the pooh against the terminator army~ type situation, given that our alter ego will tend to collapse after a couple of shots taken, while the enemies will also resist entire bursts of machine guns. The arcade mode is based on the ~fragile alliance~ already seen in the first episode, with six scenarios (subway, bridge, airport, fish market, port, financial district) plus three unlockable via DLC. You find yourself playing the role of a member of a gang of criminals who has to steal money from time to time and then try to escape towards a vehicle placed at the end of the stage, overcoming the police barrier and standing up to any traitors inherent in the group. ~Alleanza fragile~ precisely for this reason: after having collected the money, it is possible to kill one's companions and also steal their loot, or to reach the escape vehicle first, do half with the pilot and leave leaving the others behind. Each scenario presents a different situation, even if the underlying objective is always the same. Between one ~round~ and the next it is possible to spend part of the loot collected to buy more powerful and/or more suitable weapons for the situation, and at the end of the game whoever manages to bring home the greatest amount of money wins. Although interesting and full of strategic ideas, we found this mode a bit weak in some respects: first of all the basic repetitiveness, amplified by the small size of the locations; secondly, the epilogue of each expedition, with the escape vehicle which should be targeted by the police (thus creating the conditions for an early escape) but which instead stands there without problems, given that it generally reachese only after we've made a clean sweep. ~Fragile Alliance~ also features among the three multiplayer modes available for up to eight players, along with the ~undercover cop~ variant and the ~cops and robbers~ mode (playable by up to twelve people instead). The latter undoubtedly constitutes the fulcrum of the multiplayer of Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days, proposing classic deathmatches which, however, are enriched by the inevitable economic component, essential not only to decree a winner but also and above all for the purchase of weapons between sessions. We were able to try all the online modes in a long dedicated session, measuring ourselves against some IO Interactive employees as well as with editors of international magazines. What came out of the experience is a fairly comforting picture, with minimal lag problems and a fast-paced action, even if in many ways confusing. We find it difficult to define Dog Days as a title based on competitive multiplayer; let's say more than anything else that the online modes act as an effective integration to a story mode which, as already mentioned, despite its brevity, can be played very well.", "date": "2010-08-18", "grade": "8.0"}
