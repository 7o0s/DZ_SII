It is not easy to place the Panic Barn game in a precise genre, since it mixes elements of adventure and puzzle game within a narrative frame that aims to characterize every aspect of the game world, but ~simulation of bouncers in an England post-Brexit~ is probably the most accurate definition. The story starts from the sensational anti-Euro vote expressed by the United Kingdom in the summer of 2016 and builds a dystopia with overly accentuated tones on it, but it is clear that the basic idea of the developers is to provoke in a pungent way , through a satire that involves the player even with sharp dramatic turns. After Brexit, a far-right party called Albion First quickly rose to power in England, which appears to be a sort of particularly totalitarian evolution of UKIP and which in a short time reorganized the country in order to isolate it from the rest of the world and create a rigid social subdivision between DOC British and ~Euro~, as the anonymous protagonist of the story is also contemptuously defined, or people who do not have purely local origins. The latter are ghettoized in specific special neighborhoods and forced to follow strict rules in order to remain in the area, demonstrating that they work regularly and earn enough not to be a burden on society. It is a social critique that turns out to be a bit big-grained but it is tremendously effective in immersing us in that cruel and paradoxical situation in which many people can really find themselves because of laws that are unable to guarantee acceptance and equal opportunities for who comes from families of different origins, even though they may still have been born and always lived in that country, as happens to the protagonist of Not Tonight. Bouncer by imposition The background of the main character can be selected from several possibilities which nonetheless share a main feature: born in the United Kingdom and always lived as a British, the protagonist suddenly finds himself a stranger due to a pure bureaucratic technicality established by the insane far-right government in power after Brexit and forced to fight to stay in what is effectively his country. The dreary apartment in Relocation Block B is the starting point for the daily struggle that has become life in the UK, for those considered outsiders to British purity: it's an obstacle course, with the need to reach milestones on a weekly basis and monthly. As ~Person of European Heritage #112~, we are called upon to maintain a certain social score by following the strict rules and earn enough to fall within the limits set, but without being able to access prestigious jobs, under penalty of deportation. The job assigned to us by the Euro placement agent is the bouncer and we have to live with this imposed fate, day after day. In the heart of the action, the mechanics of the game are clearly drawn from Papers, Please: we find ourselves having to manage queues at the entrance to various venues, checking identity documents and being careful to meet the requirements (age minimum, document validity, whether or not to be part of a guest list). The work has a limited duration in time and we have to reach a minimum quota of selected people, so you find yourself having a few seconds to check each document and this is where the element of challenge emerges. The amount of data to keep an eye on increases progressively, as do the specific requests to complete the objectives, with the need to manage multiple queues simultaneously and ensure that people do not wait too long for their turn, which can lead them to leave. In a mechanic of this type and with the time pressing oppressively, further problems can emerge: the (presumably) random nature of the characters queuing with their identity cards can impose forced slowdowns in the event that too many cases occur critics in sequence and a certain cumbersomeness of the interface does not facilitate the quick management of problems when they occur in close proximity, this sometimes suggests that the difficulty level is pushed up in an artificial way. On Nintendo Switch, however, everything this is further complicated if you play in portable mode, because the elements on the screen become e.gterribly small and the most difficult glance. By progressing from job to job, new settings and increasingly demanding occupations with greater responsibility are unlocked, with the possibility of acquiring further tools that facilitate the management of the amount of data to be controlled. Dystopian simulation Outside of the work phases, Not Tonight takes on the appearance of a sort of all-round life simulation, although it remains hinted at and largely confined to the protagonist's apartment, given his status of special surveillance. The passage of time is marked by business appointments but also meetings with various people who contribute to building a rather complex world, with parallel stories that outline interesting personalities and enrich the narrative. You never get too deep into social and political issues, but the atmospheres and dialogues still build a convincing setting, always halfway between the thrusting irony and the oppressive anguish of the totalitarian regime. In the background there is always the need to maintain a good level in the ~social score~, so it also becomes necessary to take care of the character in terms of appearance and health, through purchases, a lifestyle that is not too destructive and being careful not to overdo it with the ~extra work~ (it is possible to round off by carrying out actions that are not strictly legal). In all of this there is also room for satire on various aspects of modern society: beyond the political question, there is the fierce criticism of the gig economy, or the economic system based on precariousness and the need to work piecework for the bidder of the day without ever finding satisfaction beyond repaying expenses. The main tool with which to organize life is a sort of smartphone which is an indispensable tool of communication and knowledge, from which we can receive news about the world, messages from other characters and get jobs through an app called BouncR. If desired, we can invest the money spent in purchases on ShopR, where we can give free rein to consumerist instincts, which can help raise our social status with some new clothes or household items. It is precisely in all these collateral aspects that Not Tonight is best able to outline its world and send its political message more clearly, beyond the actual work phase which is all too mechanical and light. The aesthetics of the game are remarkable, despite using the now standard pixel art in this kind of production. Perhaps it is not the height of originality, but the quality of the drawing, the chromatic choices, the settings and the audio accompaniment combine to paint a particularly vivid and convincing world, alternating melancholy tones with brighter ones or the squalor of the poorest settings .", "date": "2020-01-29", "grade": "7.5"}
