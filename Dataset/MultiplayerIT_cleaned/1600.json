{"name": "Red Faction 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/red-faction-6.html", "text": "Five years later... Red Facion 2 (RF2 from now on) is a classic first-person shooter, whose plot unfolds in a nation ruled by a dictator, Victor Sopot, who, as in any good self-respecting dictatorship, keeps the country thanks to an armed wing represented by its army. The story is set in 2161, five years after the events narrated in the first episode of the game and is only ideally connected to the latter. In fact, in the first chapter we were called to rebel against the condition of slavery experienced in the mines on Mars, a sort of workers' revolt which five years later, and we are in RF2, becomes a popular revolt, thanks to a revolting phalanx, the Red Faction, who wants to stop the oppressive and bloody dictatorship that lives in Sopot City and throughout the Commonwealth. The goal is to go and hit targets that, once destroyed, can somehow destabilize the power of Sopot and to do this we will be able to count on a team of six units, each of which with different characteristics: demolisher, explosives expert, sniper , etc. The prominent element of the team is also our virtual alter ego, Alias, with an arsenal made up of fourteen different weapons, complete with two-handed combinations and the use of various vehicles, ranging from tanks to flying vehicles rather than underwater vehicles. Among the weapons supplied, we point out two in particular: one that will allow us to clear an entire area with a single shot and another capable of identifying and hitting a target even if it is behind a wall. Hasta la victoria! RF2 begins with some relatively easy missions that allow us to get to know our character and the five companions who will accompany us throughout the adventure, helping us according to the needs of the mission and based on their specific characteristics; for example, from the early stages of the game we will advance using two characters, and at a certain point a sniper will intervene to open the way for us, helping us to clear the path of enemies, always very numerous throughout the length of the game. Interesting is the use of the Geo-Mod engine which allows almost total interaction with the seabed. In fact, each object or building can suffer evident damage, to the point that to continue in the game it will often be necessary to open passages through the walls or reach apparently inaccessible areas by collapsing structures to be used later as bridges or stairs. The controls, set in a classic way with the two analog levers used for the movements of the character, are comfortable and decidedly reactive. All this, combined with the good arsenal available and the use of vehicles, can only enhance a gaming experience which, however, remains anchored to a style that is perhaps a little too classic. In this sense, a certain monotony of settings and game situations certainly does not help to make the game more satisfying. Red Faction 2 seems to be decidedly aimed at lovers of purely action-based FPS, with endless firefights and adrenaline-pumping sequences, but little else. Technically speaking... We have already mentioned the Geo-Mod engine and we repeat that it is certainly one of the most interesting features of the game. As for the rest of the graphics sector, we are facing a conversion from PS2 without major improvements, which by Xbox standards can only make us think of Red Faction 2 as a more than sufficient title, which does not exploit the capabilities of the machine . The light effects seem a little chilly, while the Artificial Intelligence of the enemies, while not enjoying great refinements, proves to be effective, especially by setting a high difficulty level. The sound sector enjoys a fair amount of care with regard to ambient sounds and a good effort in reproducing the shots of the various firearms. The music is pleasant but not very inspired, while the dubbing is excellent, which in this sequel is enriched by intense dialogues via radio, although unfortunately completely in English. Last mention for the multiplayer mode that allows us to challenge up to four players in arenas very similar to the levels faced in the game and decidedly not very varied. While enjoyable, the multiplayer mode is certainly not one of RF2's strengths. Conclusions Red Faction 2 is a good FPS that perhaps lacks in personality due to an excessive, but understandable, Halo syndrome, which seems to afflict many of the development teams that have ventured into this genre of games in recent times. The THQ title is in any case a good action game, enriched by interesting ideas, even if not always well exploited, and above all not very incisive in the context ofa game structure which, precisely for this reason, is a bit too linear. However, we would like to recommend this game to all the avid lovers of the genre and, even if we are not dealing with a sacred monster of technique and innovation, there is certainly no shortage of winks to the masterpieces of the genre capable of pleasantly entertaining first-person shooter lovers. Pros: Frantic and fast Comfortable and quite intuitive controls. The dynamic destruction of game environments is fun. Cons: Little innovation Average technical realization Completely in English It is undeniable that the number of first person shooters available on consoles has grown considerably in recent years, probably also in relation to the increase in popularity that this genre encounters among next gen console users. If Halo is undoubtedly the best exponent of the category, each console still has its workhorse, and even Ps2 in recent years has greatly improved the offer in this genre, counting among its ranks some noteworthy multiplatform titles, Time Splitters 2 above all. Among these, even Red Faction already in its first appearance had aroused a lot of interest. Red Faction by Volition, released only on PS2 in 2001, had all the potential to become a very successful series and the arrival of the second chapter, while not convincing everyone, still met with good public and critics approval. The Xbox version is now out and we went to find out if any improvements have been made, which make this title attractive for Microsoft users.", "date": "2003-07-03", "grade": null}
