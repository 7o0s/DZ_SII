However, this is not the case with Deer Hunter 2016, which returns exactly after two years (Deer Hunter 2014 was released in September 2013) but without making any changes to the structure that we know well by now, and which alternates between different hunting activities of a progression that will lead us to visit three locations (Alaska, Texas and Colorado) in search of the most coveted trophies, splendid animals that once again we will have the task of aiming at the sights of our sniper rifle and killing them with a single blow. The nature of Glu production remains linked to the freemium model, with an action energy bar that regulates the number of strokes we can perform in a given period of time, and which recharges as the minutes go by. The second aspect of this setting is instead linked to the inevitable ~paywall~ which is revealed about halfway through the campaign, when making the mandatory weapon upgrades becomes complicated and it becomes necessary to do some grinding or spend real money for the buying packs of coins. The funny thing (let's say) is that the only structural novelty of the game, the assault rifle missions, can only be unlocked using hard currency. Deer Hunter 2016 is a simple and straightforward hunting game, but all too similar to the previous episode Dangerous animals grazing The formula adopted by Deer Hunter 2016, as mentioned, does not deviate one iota from what was seen in the previous edition, proposing very short missions (we are also talking about a few seconds) in which we are asked to identify and eliminate one or more prey, possibly with a shot aimed at a specific internal organ, be it the heart, lungs or brain. To identify these areas it is possible to activate an infrared vision that lasts a few moments, it can also be upgraded together with all the other characteristics of the equipped weapon: scope magnification, stability, power and magazine capacity. In most cases the preys are completely harmless animals, to be hit in a moment of stillness, but it also happens that our target is a wolf or a bear, in which case it may happen that it manages to identify who is attacking it and to tear us apart, producing a bullet time at close range that will determine the game over or a victory in extremis. Nothing has changed even in terms of the interface and touch controls, which are very simple and precise: touching the ends of the screen allows you to change position in the scenario (we are talking about moving a few meters, however useful for being able to frame the prey from the direction we wish), while the management of the viewfinder and the focus are activated by moving the thumbs on the display, in concert with the keys to zoom and operate the infrared. Finally, the graphics are practically identical: the polygonal models of the animals are those already seen in Deer Hunter 2014, although in some situations it seems that extra animations have been added, while the scenarios are beautiful and detailed but rather repetitive from the point of view of the individual areas. Certainly a better finishing has been carried out: no evident interpenetrations are noticed.", "date": "2015-09-26", "grade": "6.8"}
