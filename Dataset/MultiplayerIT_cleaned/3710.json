It is an extraordinarily rich package, this: the compilation includes not one, but two titles, namely Final Fantasy X, originally released on PlayStation 2 back in 2001, and Final Fantasy X-2, one of the first sequels developed by Square Enix to break the tradition of anthological Final Fantasy. We are already talking about two extremely long-lived Japanese role-playing games, enriched by numerous extras and a substantial aesthetic improvement that makes them more in step with the times. In our review we will briefly explain what you can expect from this Switch conversion. The contents Final Fantasy X is the absolute protagonist of this compilation: it was one of the last traditional Final Fantasy, before Square Enix began a long and tortuous path of experimentation that led us up to Final Fantasy XV. Respecting the canons established up to that moment by the series, Final Fantasy X offers random fights - a little too frequent, to tell the truth - of a classic nature which take place in turns in the Conditional Time Battle style: this means that the enemies, in their turn, they cannot attack you while you are still choosing your next action. A novelty, in the fights of Final Fantasy X, is represented by a scheme that indicates the order of turns during the fight: it makes the fights more reasoned and strategic, allowing the player to predict the progress of the battle, and not by chance it is even possible to replace fighters on the field - up to a maximum of three - with those in the rear on the fly. The development of the characters occurs through the Spherography, a sort of table in which the player moves by spending the points earned in battle and the resources necessary to unlock the various spheres, which give each character specific bonuses, skills or spells. In this way, it is possible to customize each member of the party, controlling their growth. At the beginning of the game, it is even possible to choose between a classic Spherography, i.e. the original one that dates back to the first release of the game, and a Master-type Spherography, implemented in the International version of the title and, therefore, in the PAL counterpart at the time of publication European. The exploration is rather linear, so much so that there is no real map of the world, but some locations can be decidedly intricate and there are puzzles and mini-games - starting with the sport called Blitzball - which help to extend the longevity of a title full of secrets. For the uninitiated, the story puts us in the shoes of Tidus, a young blitzball star who finds himself catapulted into the future, in a world that lives in fear of a gigantic and lethal creature called Sin. Tidus will find himself following the pilgrimage of Yuna, a summoner in charge of reuniting all the Aeons to defeat Sin and save the world of Spira: the journey will become more complicated than expected, of course, and will bring to light terrible secrets about Sin, the Aeons and the fate of the colorful - but not exactly heterogeneous - cast of heroes. Yuna slowly becomes the central character of the whole story, as well as one of the most loved protagonists of Final Fantasy as a franchise, so much so that Square Enix decided to focus the first official sequel of the series on her. Final Fantasy X-2 was a somewhat particular experiment: appearances, and the first hours of the game, can deceive about its qualities, but in reality it is an excellent JRPG which, in some respects, even surpasses the prequel. In Final Fantasy X-2 we find a much more brazen and determined Yuna who, together with her battlemates Rikku and Paine, travels the world in search of spheres: we cannot tell you more because we would spoil the surprise if you didn't have still played Final Fantasy X. The narrative dynamics and the structure of the gameplay change significantly in Final Fantasy X-2, adding a whole series of functions and mechanics that make the experience even more layered. The most important change undoubtedly concerns the combat system, which returns to the historic Active Time Battle - although it is possible to set a less sustained pace from the options menu - based only on the three protagonists and their ability to change ~class~ at any time via the so-called Looksphere: ogni class gives different skills and stats, so a certain level of strategy takes over that pushes players to choose the best combinations and synergies when facing bosses especially. Final Fantasy X-2 is an equally long-lived title full of content, which includes multiple endings and numerous secret bosses to find and defeat, but that's not the end of the story. The Final Fantasy X Pack | In fact, X-2 HD Remaster also includes Final Fantasy X: Eternal Calm, a non-interactive cinematic that acts as an interlude between the two episodes, and Final Fantasy X-2: Last Mission, a sort of playable epilogue that further extends the duration of the game. whole experience. The Switch version The transition to the Nintendo hybrid console was absolutely painless, net of a considerable but understandable weight of the download (a good 27 GB) in the digital version, although it is only necessary to download Final Fantasy X-2 if you buy the compilation on cartridge. The contents are almost identical to those played, for example, on PlayStation 4, and in addition it is possible to take advantage of a couple of touch shortcuts, already present in the PlayStation Vita version, when playing in portable mode to quickly heal characters out of fights. The game is also a crystal clear photocopy of the edition published a few years ago: it is clear that it is a title dating back to the early 2000s, but it looks very good thanks to the tweaks made during the remastering phase. We're not talking about a title that has only changed resolution, but a real reconstruction work that has affected the textures and certain polygonal models that now appear softer and more detailed. The excellent soundtrack has also been rearranged by the excellent Masashi Hamauzu, however it is possible to select the original tracks at any time. In short, Switch owners who have recently gotten their hands on the conversions of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy IX can rest assured, because Final Fantasy X | X-2 HD Remaster completely avoids the ~eyesore~ effect of grainy pre-rendered backdrops: on the contrary, the game returns a sharp and clean image, nailed to 30 frames per second without noteworthy slowdowns, which does not miss a beat not even in portable mode. The latter is almost indistinguishable from the TV mode and performs excellently on the Switch screen, guaranteeing the best way to enjoy the game in portability, thanks also to the moderate consumption of the battery: needless to say, lovers of grinding who intend to dissect the two titles up to basically they will be able to take advantage of the handheld mode, aware that they are playing one of the best conversions that we have ever seen on the Nintendo console.", "date": "2019-04-19", "grade": "8.7"}
