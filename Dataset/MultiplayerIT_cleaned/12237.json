{"name": "Spectrobes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spectrobes.html", "text": "The best video games are usually the ones that make the smartest use of the machines they run on. On the Nintendo DS, Spectrobes not only used the dual screen in a functional way, but also required the combined use of the stylus and the microphone, interpreting Nintendo's philosophy regarding gameplay in the best possible way. On mobile, the developers didn't have the same technical possibilities available, and so they tried to build the game's appeal on a very particular and multifaceted structure. We find ourselves in a sort of story mode in which the characters travel in space (literally: we have control of their ship) and stop on one planet rather than another following the events of the plot, told through dialogues. At each stop, we must select one of the Spectrobes available to us and use it in combat with another creature. But there will be no real hits or attack turns: everything will take place through a puzzle game where you move and match colored blocks. Oversimplification? Far from it. In fact, one game is enough to realize that putting together colorful blocks and making them disappear when at least three identical ones are put together is an operation that hides something else. In the lower part of the screen, in fact, we can see the two Spectrobes engaged in the ~duel~ and a series of bars: the energy one (green) and two, concentric, relating to the physical attack and the energy one. When the health bar runs out, the creature dies. And energy drops when you take hits, which are triggered once your physical or energy attack bars are filled. Well, how do these bars fill up? Bringing together and making the blocks of their respective colors disappear: the green ones add energy to our life bar, the red ones represent the physical attack, the yellow ones the energy attack. And then there are blocks of other colors, which in some cases represent a combination of attacks, in others special weapons. It is clear, therefore, that to win a fight you must not simply make all the blocks disappear, but concentrate on particular colors at the right time, making extensive use of your ingenuity and a pinch of strategy. The dynamic is slightly modified when there is not a fight but an upgrade phase: in that case you still have to fill the colored bars, but there is no enemy to press us. With four game modes available (in addition to the Campaign, we will have the opportunity to try our hand at single duels, quick matches or a sort of survival) and even a level editor, Spectrobes on mobile seems really determined to exploit the territorial advantage that sees the lack of pokemon games. As far as the technical implementation is concerned, the operation is largely successful: the design of the characters is very good and the graphics, in general, scroll in an agile and convincing way. There are some defects, however: the low resolution makes you lose much of the appeal of the various creatures, the dialogues are really written in tiny characters and the sound commentary is repetitive and not very incisive. The playability and longevity values of the product, however, are such as to obscure these shortcomings... PRO Addictive and fun game mechanics Rich in depth and characters Quite long-lived AGAINST Boring and repetitive sound The creature design loses a lot to the low resolution Dialogue written very small", "date": "2007-05-30", "grade": "S.V."}
