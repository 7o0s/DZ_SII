Among the many variations applied to the immortal formula of Tetris, this one by N3twork is particularly interesting, because it extends the gaming experience in sensory terms, creating that synaesthesia between music, controls and coordination that we have seen in the past in the productions of Tetsuya Mizuguchi and a few others. The mechanics of the game obviously aren't upset too much, but the sensations you feel by fitting the tetrominoes together are amplified by this musical digression of Tetris, which requires a minimum period of adaptation to get out of the classical reflexive logic and embrace the movement time. In the last decade we have witnessed a wide range of attempts to modify Tetris through numerous digressions in various areas, always with marginal and not always exactly functional, but often significant additions. In most cases, the best option is still the classic one, also present in this case with the Marathon mode, but if nothing else, Tetris Beat represents a rather valid alternative to the usual tumble of interlocking tetrominoes. We are not at the levels of completeness and care seen in Tetris Effect, nor of the multiplayer impetus given by Tetris 99, but Beat is undoubtedly one of the most interesting experiments we have seen in recent years on the same base created by Paitnov almost 40 years ago. As happens in real rhtyhm games, the music is not just a simple accompaniment, but becomes an integral part of the gameplay, forcing you to follow the rhythm and act accordingly, with an effect that, although it is rather unsettling at first, it progressively enters instinctively, just like it happens with music. Gameplay between puzzle and rhythm game Tetris Beat takes up the abstract and almost ~lysergic~ style of Effect and other interpretations The gameplay is always the same: it's about fitting the geometric figures that descend from above in order to fill the lines and make them disappear, thus preventing the screen from filling up to the top. It is practically useless to discuss the functioning of this mechanism and its habit-forming capacity, given that Tetris' almost forty-year history speaks for itself, but it is interesting to note some variations present within Tetris Beat. First of all, there are three game modes, among which Marathon simply represents the classic gameplay with the endless challenge to reach the highest score. The most original gameplay therefore emerges from the other two modes: Drop and Tap, both focused on short games related to the duration of the music chosen as an accompaniment. In Tetris Beat, each level has its own backing song Drop resumes the classic style of the game, but with the fundamental addition of rhythm: every single movement made, whether it concerns the rotation of the tetrominoes, their movement on the horizontal axis, the immediate drop or even the option to ~send ~ a figure in order to make it fall later must be done to the rhythm of the music in order to get bonuses. By stringing together rhythmic movements with excellent timing, a multiplier is kicked off that chains bonuses by increasing the score through rhythmic action. Used to entering the classic dynamic of Tetris, this new setting can easily disorientate at first, but if you get caught up in the music it's easy to quickly get into the flow of movements.Even more ~extreme~ is the Tap mode, which presents the player with from time to time two preset positions to choose from with a simple touch on the screen for the same tetromino, removing the freedom of movement and rotation and imposing, in this way, to get caught up in the rhythm trying to speed up the action and make the best choice in the shortest possible time. Either way, the new modes feature the new Fever dynamic, which kicks in as the multiplier reaches higher levels, allowing you to rack up even more points. Graphics, but above all music The style of Tetris Beat With an approach of this kind it is obvious that the soundtrack occupies an important place in the economy of the game and the choices are decidedly functional to the context: in general, these are synth pop pieces that associate well with the action, but the lineup is quite eclectic and includes 18 songs taken from various artists such as Alison Wonderland, GARZA, Hannah Diamond, Octo Octa, Dauwd, CINTHIE and more. There are ups and downs and the type of music may not meet everyone's tastes, but in general there is a good variety and above all the choices are well centered on the rhythm of the game, in some cases very effective. In the same way, even the graphic style adopted is part of the clean and linear characterization that permeates the entire production, including lasers, neon lights, geometric figures and various abstractions, in this sense getting quite close to the excellent precedent constituted by Tetris Effect . In ~landscape~ mode, which is currently only visible when playing from a Mac, the game window is far too small, but it is a problem that obviously does not affect the use on iPhone and iPad, where the screen is arranged vertically.", "date": "2021-08-26", "grade": "8.2"}
