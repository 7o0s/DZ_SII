{"name": "Silent Hill 4: The Room", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silent-hill-4-the-room-2.html", "text": "The theory of dimensional tunnels Far be it from me, as mentioned, to spoil the pleasure of discovering all the most hidden aspects of the plot for you, however it seems appropriate to me to make a premise at least on what concerns the philosophical aspect, something by now known, which has always permeated this Konami production . If the mystical component has repeatedly peeked out in the folds of the plot of the previous episodes of the saga, especially in the third chapter, in SH4 this aspect perhaps reaches its maximum expository and conceptual expression. The idea of the apartment, of our house, ~happy island in which to find refuge from external evils~ are concepts almost as old as the world, philosophically speaking. But here we wanted to amplify the concept. The diversity with the outside, corrupted world is already given by the subjective view present only inside Henry's home, a view that is different from the one used there, in the outside world, outside the ~island~. Probably inspired by the Romanian metaphysical philosopher Emil M. Cioran, moreover already widely ~exploited~ on the occasion of the drafting of the subject of Silent Hill 3, the Konami guys indulged in transforming his ~thoughts~ into videogame elements. A difficult and angular author, Cioran places the problem of transcendence at the center of his thought, a fundamental theme that runs through his entire work, and which leads him to develop what is defined as the Metaphysics of extraneousness. According to the Romanian philosopher, the concept of the divine needs to be reworked, and therefore it is seen by him as an absence, as a privation of God. In his view, man is constantly confronted with a Superior Being, ~in front of God as the one who is , man presents himself as someone who is not~. And to know the divine one must first know the stranger within himself. Man is indeed a self-awareness, but dirty, in some ways negative, destined to wander without a a precise destination in the world that surrounds it. externally, the world, internally we are nothing, and in the most absolute nothingness the identity cancels and disappears, isolates itself, as if closed in a room Another element taken into consideration by the geniuses Konami, who evidently must be great readers for stuffing a game with many philosophical quotations as key elements of the story, is undoubtedly that of the planetary tradition of the so-called Galleries. According to some legends widespread in many peoples of the earth, in fact, in our world there is a dense network of tunnels that connects the most remote places of the globe, across seas and mountains. A sort of underground network that crosses Europe to South America, uniting places lost in time and space. There would also exist eighteen immense main galleries and infinite secondary galleries, and in this sense the earth should be seen as a human organism crossed by veins and capillaries. Tunnels that also reach metaphysical floors, as mentioned, connecting heaven and earth, or opening wide the gates of Hell. It seems that even the Dalai Lama would use these tunnels to move quickly from one continent to another and that the cases of planes disappearing into thin air, for example in the Bermuda Triangle, are to be attributed precisely to one of these passages which would inexplicably open up there swallowing everything. A new gameplay ? If in terms of gameplay, Silent Hill 4 shows a style rather similar to the previous episodes, from a structural point of view it gives a clean break with the past. In fact, this fourth chapter marks a total change in the very way of conceiving adventure. In some ways it almost feels like a kind of mission game. First the levels: most of them are set in spacious and illuminated areas. No narrow, dark corridors, no radio signals for monsters or flashlight. Here the sense of claustrophobia of the previous titles gives way to a sense of oppression determined by large and deserted environments. If in SH2 the whole atmosphere was centered on gloomy, dark environments where a noise, any hiss or a shadow sneaking up in the dark made the user's heart jump in his throat, in this Silent Hill it seems it was decided to focus more on the protagonist's sense of abandonment and loneliness, on the anguish of finding himself a stranger in a foreign, hostile world. The exploratory component is therefore a little amplified compared to the other episodes, while the puzzles have been reduced and simplified to the maximum, limiting themselves to actions to be performed to activate mechanisms and the like that will make one distortn a little nose to fans of the saga. Once you have completed a level and witnessed a certain event, you ~automatically~ return (you will wake up in your bed) to the apartment, the true trait d'union of the various locations explored. As can be guessed from what has just been said, in this SH4 there are no ~Bosses~ to defeat or in any case to face at the end of an area. Furthermore, every time a scenario is completed, the shape of the hole in the bathroom changes, a sign that a new dimensional channel has probably opened. Another of SH4's most interesting new features is the on-screen inventory. It consists of a sort of pop-up at the bottom of the screen, which can be activated by pressing the square button, which allows the gamer to see all the Items in the archive in real time and select one simply by highlighting it with the cross on the pad. This novelty, if on the one hand it increases the level of difficulty during the clashes (the enemies in the meantime that you are about to make choices will continue to attack you), on the other hand it proves to be convenient for many other things to do, and paradoxically it can return useful when facing several opponents at the same time and want to change weapons on the run: imagine shooting down some enemies who have cornered you. At that point, while they gasp on the ground, you can decide to finish them off with a bar without wasting time opening Menus and the like, as happened for example in SH3. However, it is not immense, so you will have to limit yourself to bringing with you only what is strictly necessary to face a certain level. Speaking of weapons, in this sense I would like to point out some of the trinkets with which you can indulge yourself in facing the creatures that will appear in front of poor Henry: the iron pipe in the shape of a pipe (inevitable), golf clubs, bottles glass, strange daggers (called swords) with dark powers, as well as the usual pistols and rifles. While to return to the enemies, a further increase in their AI level should be noted: in fact, they are now more skilled in avoiding your blows and counterattacking. The absolute novelty of the series is undoubtedly the addition of some ghosts among the enemies, truly terrifying and annoying since they pass through walls and cannot be killed, forcing you from time to time to hasty escapes, at least until you recover a certain object ... I seemed to notice a certain freedom of control over the camera movement by users and an improved character control system, more ~total~ than in previous episodes, with Henry able to move weapons in hand where he wants and to avoid opponents' blows by jumping backwards (just press the X key). By pressing the R2 key you can move sideways or forward, always being ready to hit the opponent with the pistol or with the proverbial iron pipe. Here the Konami programmers have implemented an energy bar which, once filled, lets you deliver a very strong blow to the enemy, like a baseball. One last observation. In addition to the classic game situations, the programmers have inserted new artfully created elements to offer us some interesting variants capable of immersing ourselves better in the context of the game. For example, there is the possibility of looking through the peephole of the door or from the windows to see what is happening in the outside world, or that of turning on the radio to listen to audio cassettes collected around, etc. Graphics and sound While not detaching much from the quality levels of the third, this SH4 appears graphically more refined and with greater image sharpness. As mentioned, the fourth episode of the ~silent hill~ abandons the dark and suffocating places in favor of large and illuminated places. The result is a graphic restyling that has led to a different and more articulated use of the graphic engine. The polygonal models of the characters are very detailed, and by eliminating the noise effect from the beginning (you can do it at the beginning in the options menu) you can notice it more. Henry's model seems better defined and complete than Heather's already good 3D Model, showing greater care given by Konami graphics to her face and facial expressions even during the actual game, and not only in the interlude phases, as well as in the clothes worn by our protagonist such as the fabric shirt that is so detailed that it almost seems to be able to really touch it. The same excellent treatment has been adopted for the backdrops, the scenic elements, the objects. The textures that cover the surfaces of the game (characters, backdrops, etc.) are excellent, in high resolution, with cold and realistic colors, and a remarkable attention to detail, just note the town, very well done even in the smallest detailsas the cars whizzing past the Townsend house or the trees in the forest or the rough stone walls of certain buildings. The lighting system of the environments is good, obviously managed in real time, which helps to make the visual impact of the game superior, and the nice thing in my opinion is that this gives a greater feeling of ~true~ and identification on the part of the player. The animations then, already in clear improvement in SH3 compared to the wooden movements of the old James of SH2, have perhaps reached their peak here, even if Henry has a rather particular walk... The bestiary is not very convincing: this time the creatures are more numerous than usual, but they are probably less terrifying than the other episodes and a little monotonous, with little variety in characterization, except for the ghosts. The sound effects for their part are once again perfect for the role they have to fulfill, while in general I was not very convinced by the soundtrack, the tracks of which however, while not reaching the insurmountable heights of the SH2 songs, still manage to make more than discreetly gloomy atmosphere and to keep you in the right state of tension waiting for something to happen. Different. This would be, from my point of view, the exact term to describe Silent Hill 4 in one word. With a greater propensity for action and exploration of spacious and desolate environments, the abandonment of dark and gloomy places and twisted puzzles of the previous episodes, the latest KCET effort is destined to totally or almost completely change the backbone of one of the longest-lived and most loved videogame sagas. After the first unsettling impact due to the changes mentioned above, this fourth chapter manages to capture the player and fascinate him, once again confirming Konami's ability to know how to amaze, renew, create products of always high quality. If SH2 is perhaps the most distressing, terrifying, engaging of the series, Silent Hill 4 is the most ~reflective~, conceptual, innovative. A sign that even video games, despite some still insisting on criticizing them, have the ability to entertain but also to make those who play them reflect. Behind the horror, the deformed monsters, the ghosts, there are other monsters, far more real and terrible. Why, ~Silent Hill is in all of us.~ Pros: Very reflective Distressing It has the advantage of being different from the other episodes Cons: Not for everyone Graphic engine a bit old The solution! Having trouble completing the game? We'll take care of it, with the Complete Walkthrough of Silent Hill 4: The Room! Henry Townsend is an ordinary person, like so many others, who one fine day finds himself involved in something uncommon, out of the ordinary. For five days ours has moved into his new apartment in Ashfield, a charming American town a few km from Silent Hill. But from that moment, he doesn't know how, he finds himself catapulted into an endless nightmare, of a pure Kafkaesque kind. One morning, in fact, the man wakes up with a start following a terrible nightmare. A little dazed and still shocked by the thing, he gets up and heads towards the living room. Arriving near the adjacent kitchen, his gaze rests on the entrance door and only then does he gasp, remembering: for five days he has been blocked, closed, a prisoner in his own home. Someone has sealed the front door of his apartment from the inside with large chains and hooks that prevent anyone from entering or leaving. On the door an inscription made with what looks like blood: Do not go out - Walter. Who or what locked Henry inside his apartment? What's a picture of Silent Hill Church doing hanging on the walls in the bedroom? Why does Henry feel drawn to that place? Questions, unanswered questions. Our unfortunate friend is locked up in this apartment, therefore, with the telephone, TV and radio not working (except in rare exceptions, when they decide to do it... by themselves), the windows don't open and the neighbors don't notice the his presence, his cries of despair. Outside the world goes on with its life. From the windows you can see the neighbors in the opposite buildings watching TV or talking, people entering the nearby underground passage or entering the Ashfield Hotel located just across the main road. From the peephole we can see the doorman or other neighbors go by, clean the floor, live their lives, perhaps take an interest in our apartment from which, however, no sound reaches them. As mentioned, we can yell, bang on the door: they won't hear us. An agonizing nightmare. Just try for a moment to identify yourself in this situation terrible.
