Red Faction Guerrilla was the third installment of the franchise: it still happens to find cases in the used department of a certain well-known video game chain, abandoned in a corner and usually cheap. However, some still remember it, and it is to the latter and to the many who at the time were too busy with GTA IV that THQ addresses with Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered. A nostalgia operation probably at low cost in development, an almost incomprehensible strategy if we think that the series was shelved in 2011 due to unsatisfactory sales: perhaps THQ intends to give it one last chance in the near future? Meanwhile, there's plenty of time to take a look at what is probably the most successful chapter of the whole family. A plot based on martial law, indeed Martian It is 2075, man has arrived on Mars and has discovered that he can exploit even a second planet in the Solar System after Earth to exhaustion: there do not seem to be any forms of intelligent life on Mars, but the subsoil is very rich in raw materials, and they are particularly useful since everything on Earth is practically finished. But as history has always taught, where there is a precious supply source, someone also arrives who wants to control it: this is the case of the EDF, a real military dictatorship organized on a global basis, which in the space of a few years martial (indeed, Martian) law. Suspected traitors are shot on the spot, their homes confiscated along with personal property, the freedom of the planet is just a distant memory. We impersonate Alec Mason, a member of the revolutionary guerrilla who will try to reason with the good old EDF based on explosives, work hammers, pistols, and then explosives again, but bigger than before. Alec is neither a warrior nor a revolutionary, but life goes on its own: after the death of his brother Dan, a true insurgent of the Red Faction, Alec enters the clandestine organization in turn, slowly becoming a member more and more important. In short, we will give him a hand in reconquering Mars by subtracting the planet from the control exercised by the EDF dictatorship, within a fairly vast open-world, but which feels, like the game mechanics proposed, the full weight of its nine very long years. Because Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered isn't a bad game after all: it's a modest title, which in its time greatly innovated the franchise (for example, going from first to third person), but always remaining a step below the fierce competition from the open-world action industry. Imagine the situation almost a decade later, when the genre has now reached very high levels and Alec's adventures can only count on a bland sprinkling on a technical and graphic level, without changing anything within a game formula that on balance it really fails to entertain for more than a handful of hours. Playstation 4 trophies The Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered Platinum Trophy doesn't seem like anything too complex to obtain, provided you want to spend really, really long time in the company of the THQ title. In fact, it will not be enough to complete Alec's story on Mars, we will also have to deal with all the secondary missions, the Demolitions, the challenges, as well as the online multiplayer mode by playing at least one game in each of them, using all the weapons, and also obtaining a certain number of victories. With a little patience (more than skill) we'll make it! I blow you up the gameplay too Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered doesn't go very subtle: the player's goal is to destroy everything in sight, sparing only the civilian population (and not even always). Demolitions, explosions and dynamite charges represent the soul of the THQ title, as well as the main offer from a gameplay point of view, thanks to the use of the GeoMod 2.0 physics engine which already nine years ago allowed the presence of many destructible buildings on the screen . Unfortunately, apart from the interest you might have for the plot (in any case linear and devoid of huge surprises), Red Faction's offer is all here: a vast game map divided into six different freely explorable (and destructible) sectors, main and side missions to complete (based on explosives), and weapons and power-ups to collect to expand Alec's arsenal (so he destroys everything in a more artistic way). Just the rich offer of weapons of destruction represents one of the valid points of the production, unfortunately all the rest is easily forgettable, already seen or extremely subdued, and the pbarge and sandy red planet setting definitely doesn't help. From a technical point of view, the re-release for current generation consoles has certainly been made with effort, but the levels achieved are not exceptional: the frame rate is stable and the action smooth, the cutscenes have been significantly cleaned up, the textures improved and enhanced levels of detail and lighting, uploads are never intrusive; yet it is evident from the first glance that we are faced with a visibly aged product, and unfortunately not too well, regardless of the point of view we decide to take into consideration. Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered is no longer as innovative as it was at the time of its first arrival on the market, but it remains an enjoyable title, which must be taken for what it offers without expecting the levels reached by current open-worlds. Finally, in multiplayer mode it always offers a few hours of carefree fun.", "date": "2018-07-06", "grade": "7.0"}
