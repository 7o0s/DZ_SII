It has always happened and always will. Video games make no difference and, indeed, have normalized this trend, deprecated in other arts, perhaps because it is not concepts that are copied, but mechanics, much less bound by copyright. Immortal Planet is an isometric action RPG that mimics From Software's Souls without much mystery. Indeed, it shamelessly copies them, even mentioning them in promotional material. This is Tomasz Wacawek's second work, now teedoubleuGAMES, who had already shown his great talent with Ronin. It tells the story of the Awakewalker, the only one of a society of immortals who can end the eternal cycle of death and rebirth in which she is imprisoned. When we take control of it, after selecting one of three weapons, we know nothing about its past or even where we are. After a few steps we arrive at the first enemies who, despite going down quite quickly, prove to be tough. Our big man can attack, dodge or parry the blows of his opponents and, by finding the right objects, use special powers related to his characteristics. For example, he can wield firearms, or cast real spells. Around there are also healing items, essential to continue the adventure. The sad truth is that we die quite early, when we still haven't read all the tutorial boxes that explain the basics of the game mechanics. We had imagined that Immortal Planet would be difficult to tame, but we had no idea how much. Especially the initial part is really brutal. Soul Souls We soon discover that the combat system, while very agile, offers more complications than we assumed. For example, you have to pay attention to the stamina bar, which when depleted does not allow you to attack or defend yourself. This applies to both us and our opponents. This is a feature that can cause big problems, but that can be exploited to our advantage, for example to push weakened enemies into the many abysses that make up the game world with a shoulder, or to slow down their attacks, forcing them to 'use of less expensive techniques (to do this you need to be really good at it). Everything works so well that, when you have practiced enough, the fights become real ballets: between dodges, parries, counterattacks and special techniques. The bosses in particular can cause great difficulty due to their enormous power and the amount of techniques they have. Let's also assume that at the beginning you have a very small number of healing items and you will understand how tiring it is to enter the game. In short, to overcome certain situations you need to develop an enviable skill so as to be able to anticipate the moves of your opponents and respond at the right time. For example, many enemies throw mines that can be turned against them, causing them to explode when they are nearby, after sprinting into a safe area so as not to be hit by shrapnel. For each enemy killed we get points that can be spent to improve the Awakewalker's characteristics by reaching bonfires... sorry, hubs, where it is also possible to rest to recover all the energy and recharge the objects in our possession. Spending points whenever possible is essential, because in the event of death they are all lost. In reality, you can try to recover them by returning to where you were killed, but if you die a second time without having them recovered, they will be deleted forever. Also, what does this remind you of? Deadly problems How many of you have had a strong sense of dj vu when reading the description of Immortal Planet? We see that many have raised their hands. Well, perhaps the main problem with the title of teedoubleuGAMES is that it doesn't even try to take a step forward. In short, he is satisfied with being a good Souls clone, which he actually is, but without risking anything of his own. The narration itself is conducted in the exact same way, with the discovery of details of the story entrusted to dialogues with strange characters, cryptic writings and so on. What does it remind you of? This is the question we keep repeating throughout the review. The story itself is not very clear and the ending does not reveal much, even if it seems that the New Game + must be completed to see the real one, which should provide more details. However, not having clear ideas is not a drama, given the genre, and replaying is almost aa must if you are passionate about it. Another problem, in this case more related to the design, concerns the progression. As already mentioned, the first steps of the Awakewalker are dramatic, but this is not the case throughout the game: the final stages are much easier to overcome. The reason is obvious: greater number of healing items available and a certain repetitiveness of the enemies. The latter, while varying attacking techniques, after a while become predictable, by virtue of the experience gained while playing. Even the bosses suffer from the same problem. To say, we have been killed more times by the initial one than by the final one. With this we do not want to say that Immortal Planet becomes a walk, but only that as the adventure progresses it becomes a lot less hostile towards the player. For the rest, we point out the good music, which accompanies well in the exploration of a minimalist world made up of suspended platforms and evocative and conceptually almost abstract places.
