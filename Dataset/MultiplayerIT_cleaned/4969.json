{"name": "Persona 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/181097-persona-5-i-due-volti-della-giustizia.html", "text": "Do you like Japanese RPGs? Do you like reading? Do you like spending even an hour watching cinematics, strictly in English, without fighting a single enemy? Do you like Japan and Japanese culture? If the answer to even just one of these questions is no, we suggest you don't waste any more time: stop reading, close this page and do something else. There is surely another game for you out there. Persona 5 is an absolutely niche title, just like its illustrious predecessors were. Which doesn't mean he can't kidnap you: he probably would, if you gave him a chance. Despite the hype and word of mouth, aimed at exposing Persona to a wider audience than in the past, Atlus has not attempted a revolution in the hope of winning new fans, has not ridden the easy wake of the open world and photorealistic graphics. The Japanese developer has stubbornly clung to tradition, working on the formula that made Persona 3 and then Persona 4 famous ten years ago, at home and later abroad, to do what it does best: tell a story. And build upon it an absolutely extraordinary Japanese RPG. Persona 5 is one of the best Japanese RPGs ever developed - full stop! criminal minds We really want to repeat and remind you that if you don't like reading, and if you don't know English, Persona 5 could seriously jeopardize your nerves. This is not a defect, which in fact we have not considered as such, but a pure and simple observation: in the Atlus JRPG the story is predominant and the characters chat a lot, indeed a lot, discussing the developments of the plot in a realistic way and not only . A dinner at a restaurant can become a ten-minute cutscene, a chat conversation can go into a long question and answer on the mobile screen. You can press a key to speed up the scrolling of the dialogues or skip the cinematics altogether, yes... but what's the point? Director Katsura Hashino is trying to tell you an important story. If you don't care, there's always yet another sci-fi shooter on the next shelf. Play that. Also, we are sorry to tell you, but if you fall into that category of people who consider Japan as a kind of Wonderland and the Japanese as angelic figures who are always selfless and helpful, Persona 5 will give you a loud wake up call. For the power of friendship there is room up to a certain point in cold and austere Tokyo. Despite appearances - and above all the bright colors and the phenomenal character design by Shigenori Soejima - Persona 5 greatly detaches itself from the clichs of Japanese cartoons and also from the atmospheres experienced in the previous Persona 4, approaching more than anything else Persona 2 and Persona 3 as topics and situations. The incipit alone is not exactly among the most optimistic: our protagonist is entrusted to the owner of a Tokyo bar because he is on probation. His crime? Intervening in a girl's defense on her way home from school. The attacker was a powerful man and he bought the victim's silence by getting our alter ego arrested. A stain that embarrassed his parents, in a contradictory society where family is everything but social status matters more than blood ties. Stories of ordinary administration, in short, that we hear practically every day in Italy too. And so our protagonist ends up attending a small suburban school where practically everyone treats him like a hooligan: he has a criminal record, the rest doesn't matter. The days would seem destined to follow each other all the same, but at a certain point our discovers that he possesses a strange power: thanks to a mysterious app on his smartphone he can enter the Metaverse, a parallel dimension made up of the perceptions of ordinary people. In this reality, some particularly evil individuals have erected ~Palaces~ that represent the way they see the world with their eyes. In the Metaverse, the protagonist will meet Morgana, a kind of talking cat who will reveal a great secret to him: by stealing the ~treasure~ kept in a Palace it is possible to trigger a second thought, forcing the bad guy to repent and confess his crimes. The protagonist, together with some fellow students who, like him, can fight by evoking the psychic power of the Personas, thus founds the band of Phantom Thieves, the ~ghost thieves~ capable of changing society from within. But this is only the beginning of an incredibly long, complex and articulated story, at times a real ~crime drama~ that involved usted for more than ninety hours and which touches on very delicate and absolutely current issues such as child abuse, sexual violence, prostitution, corruption of the forces of order and politics which we should cling to in a modern and civilized society. Persona 5 is above all the story of the redemption of a generation, that of young people, who should be encouraged to express themselves and look to the future but who are instead forced, almost as if in chains, to follow the rules of a deeply mechanical and apathetic society like 'is today's Japanese. The cast of Persona 5 is absolutely incredible, thanks also and above all to the fact that the problems of the various characters immediately appear concrete and understandable, as well as faced in a mature and realistic way. And this is not only true for the Phantom Thieves, the protagonists in all respects, but also for their supporting actors and antagonists: above all the Confidants are included in this set, the secondary characters who play the role of the Social Links who appeared in the previous two Personas. Person of Interest The protagonist of Persona 5 - you can choose the name at the beginning of the game, although officially it should be Akira Kurusu - will come across numerous characters who live in Tokyo and face more or less common problems. They range from a politician full of good intentions who, years after a scandal, decides to get back into the electoral campaign, to a former smuggler who wants to get out of the Yakuza circle, passing through a little video game wizard with an overly apprehensive mother and so on. saying. Akira's relationship with the various Confidants develops mainly through more or less brief conversations in which, occasionally, we will have to choose between two or more answers to their questions: by selecting the one they like - and it is not always obvious - we will accelerate the ~growth~ of our relationship. Each level, up to ten maximum for Confidant, unlocks bonuses, services, combat skills and much more: it is therefore up to the player to choose which Confidant to ~grow~ first and at what time, always bearing in mind that Confidants are only available in certain days and at certain times. The mechanics of free time management returns with arrogance in Persona 5 with an even larger, more intricate and full of possibilities version. It is in all respects the backbone of the game, the beating heart of Persona 5 gameplay: strategically choosing what to do is essential since each activity can improve our five social statistics which will determine our ability to interact with the rest of the world. A certain level of Knowledge (knowledge) will allow us to develop the Confidant of Hifumi Togo, a famous shogi player who unlocks the ability to replace party members during fights. So we could spend an evening reading a book, but maybe it would be better to take on the Bing Bang Burger fast food challenge and increase our level of Guts (courage)? When it is high enough, after all, we could continue to develop Tae Takemi's Confidant, the lonely doctor who will expand her inventory at each rank, selling us new healing items. As you may have guessed, Persona 5's ~social simulator~ component beautifully intertwines each activity with the combat system and narrative, developing a believable and compelling world around the protagonist. We must not forget, however, that each narrative interlude is heavily scripted: our answers will never change the outcome of the story, simply limiting themselves to accelerating or decelerating the growth of the Confidants. Persona 5 isn't an ~RPG~ in the purest sense of the word, it's not The Witcher 3 or The Elder Scrolls: our decisions affect how we spend our free time, but they don't alter the script. You can finish the game without completing the Confidants and see a few less interludes in the decisive moments: unlike what happened in the previous two Personas, the ~true ending~ is not precluded to those who do something wrong and cannot perfectly manage the calendar within the end of the adventure. After all, you can always start a second game by importing your save and choosing different activities and answers. Playstation 4 trophies To unlock the platinum trophy, you'll need to conquer forty-eight more first: three gold, five silver, and forty bronze. This is not a particularly difficult undertaking, but you will have to play the very long Atlus RPG at least twice and max out each Confidant, complete the Compendium, read each book, perfect each social statistic and so on. The Closer The ~world~ of Persona 5 consists of Tokyo and its surroundings: a mappa in which it is possible to move quickly from one neighborhood or from one place to another, net of very fast loading. We cannot explore the Japanese capital as freely as we were in Grand Theft Auto: the main districts of Tokyo such as Shibuya or Akihabara are microzones made up of a handful of screens in which we can move around, interacting with some passers-by or entering the premises. In the latter case, most of the time we will find ourselves in front of a fixed screen in which to select the items of the menu on duty. It may seem a restrictive solution, and in a sense it is, but it fits perfectly with the structure of the game in which exploration is a secondary element and the discovery of new areas is associated with the development of the story or reading the tourist guides which add new points of interest on the map. If we want to work part-time at the florist's under the subway on a busy evening, we don't have to cross half the city to reach it: just press a button to teleport in front of the venue, provided you've visited it at least once. Persona 5's interface is fast, smooth, intuitive. It's a game with a cartoonish look that betrays its ~old-gen~ nature (development started on PlayStation 3) only through the low-resolution textures that occasionally stand out in a triumph of detail and color. Atlus has reconstructed the districts of Tokyo with impressive attention to detail, even tracing the position of some clubs and the appearance of certain streets. The average polygon count and the aforementioned washed-out textures take a back seat to a game that oozes style from every pixel. Just open the main menu to realize it: the position of each item, the animation of each window, the font of each text... everything has been chosen with great care. The cartoon interlude kinematics are numerous and well done, even if those that exploit the game's graphics engine are much more frequent, but equally cared for thanks to the use of excellent cel shading. This is especially noticeable when exploring the Palaces, the ~dungeons~ which basically mark the story and which represent a fixed stage, a content to be completed by a set date: otherwise, it's game over. Each Palace revolves around the theme that characterizes the Phantom Thieves' mission on duty, materializing real metaphors in the form of gameplay. Here is that the Palace of the professor who believes he has the school and his students in his grip is a castle in which he, of course, is the king. A failed artist who passes off the works of his pupils as his own has locked himself up in a palace in the form of a museum, where each painting is a nuanced portrait, as if to say that he no longer even remembers what the painters from whom he robbed the ideas looked like . And each Palace offers a series of environmental puzzles and puzzles that require wit, attention and a pinch of patience: they are long and structured mazes that make you forget the randomly generated areas in the old Personas, where it is even possible to move stealthily from one shelter to another. more to take enemies from behind. Exploring the Palaces also fits into free time, given that they are usually so long and articulated that they also represent a kind of survival challenge: Persona 5 offers four levels of difficulty, but already the second can be quite challenging, so one must learn to recognize the right moment to withdraw, refuel and then return another day. And it's important because the Palaces, which as we said have a sort of deadline, once completed they disappear completely and you can never go back to them. If you want to level up in the quiet moments of the story, there is always the Mementos: it is effectively the ~random~ labyrinth in which you can go to fight between one Palace and another. Floors are unlocked as you progress through the game's story, but the Mementos is also a source of items, equipment, and rewards. With the exception of secondary activities that occupy free time, Persona 5's optional missions all take place in the Mementos and usually require the defeat of a specific target hidden in the depths of this eerie labyrinth. The Mementos is probably the weakest content of the package, perhaps because it was designed specifically for those who prefer to beat their hands whenever they get the chance, as long as they can bear the repetitive little music that accompanies our raids in its tunnels. Fortunately it is the only flaw in the amazing soundtrack of the always excellent Shoji Meguro: a succession of jazz songs that perfectly accompanies every moment.", "date": "2017-03-29", "grade": "9.6"}
