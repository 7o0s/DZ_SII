{"name": "MMO non per tutti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71622-fallen-earth-mmo-non-per-tutti.html", "text": "The Icarus Studios development team must be made up of people who absolutely deserve to be known: they have been developing an MMO for more than six years, embarking on the usual enterprise in 2002 made up of a thousand revolutionary proclamations and promises, only to then disappear from the scene and reappear between Champions Online and Aion, after months and months of almost total absence on the front of online mass releases and straddling two shredders supported by as many huge publishers. Those guys should be known but not because they are crazy, given that the catastrophic premises have been miraculously denied, the user despite the alternatives has been interested and, perhaps, Fallen Earth can be considered at least a partial success. In short, an indie story like many others with a different ending - no Dark & Light - which in the practical act of the gaming experience translates into a ridiculously unbalanced product, made up of excellent and other bad things, of results obtained where it was most difficult and absurd mistakes where you really could not go wrong. Curiosity Icarus Studios does not only have Fallen Earth under its belt. In addition to the iPhone game dedicated to the Dexter television series, it has other unannounced licensed MMOs in development and is dedicated to the creation of 3D virtual tours. AD 2156 The setting is post apocalyptic: the American Grand Canyon wants to be a morphologically correct reproduction of the real one, only after the passage on Earth of a lethal virus and a series of atomic explosions, all with a mega corporation behind it, called with GlobalTech originality, and a consequent drastic reduction in the number of people on the planet. The player is introduced to the experience through a first instanced tutorial aimed at explanation of the hybrid system, between the role-playing game and the shooter, and therefore thrown into the fray, for a few days with a series of first missions aimed at illustrating the main developed mechanics. Even with this latest addition, tested at the end of the review, the impact is destabilizing due to an enormous amount of possibilities in the face of a small amount of explanations: the playing area is almost a thousand square kilometers, divided into three zones totally persistent and therefore without the use of instances with the exception of the one mentioned above, with the alter ego of the player free to grow without being tied to any class but increasing his skills with experience points, committing himself to following a too thin line main narrative and the many secondary ones. In spite of what many have said, the initial feeling of bewilderment is consistent with the context - this does not mean that it is intentional, mind you - with the character lost in a hostile landscape and without the possibility of dominating the surrounding environment. Matter of experience The experience alternates the missions that can be activated once a given level is reached with free exploration, particularly apt both for the constant and successful feeling of not knowing what can await us behind a brow, and because it is linked to the collection of raw materials useful for crafting . This invests more than 90% of the objects present in Fallen Earth and requires, in addition to the recovery of the objects to be merged, also the plans for the construction and an adequate level of the statistics responsible for this purpose; from weapons to armor, from ammunition to means of transport, whether motorcycles, ATVs or horses, The day-night cycle is done properly everything can be built, used and sold, for a successful complex from the point of view of the single player even if it is not very predictable to want to look ahead, thinking about the global economic complex of the persistent world. The combat system involves the use of both white weapons for close combat and firearms for those who prefer to strike from a distance, and is partially penalized by the choice of implementing a dual mode, for moving and interacting or fighting, which requires alternating between the two and could have been avoided with a better study of the controls. Although there are a series of tools for the social aspects and it is possible to create groups, that of Fallen Earth, to this day, remains an adventure to be undertaken alone, without ever being asked to join others except for one's own convenience and leaving that the common thread between users is the six different factions that you can join; it remains a matter of taste, as always, but all in all given the premises and to see the writer, it is a design choice that pays off. All in becoming the player versus player, relegated to some areas where you will have to fight for the conquest of different cities, and the end game, which have not yet been almost touched. We'll have to go backin the future. The weight of the years Without reaching the heights proposed by Cryptic, Icarus Studios has invented a rather vast and complex character creation system capable of leaving you free to play on normal facial features and add tattoos and hair in full post-apocalyptic punk style. The speech can be expanded to objects, weapons and armor, with a quantity of models and textures capable of giving an enormous sense of customization and variety. There is no shortage of variety. Except for buildings, the problem is often the realization That said, technically Fallen Earth is a rather old product, with a still decent poly count but a chronic deficit of resolution on textures, effects that leave something to be desired and a very annoying pop up. Optimization is abysmal with fluidity dropping from almost two hundred images per second in open spaces to less than thirty in cities, at 1680x1050, despite not playing a beautiful symphony of images on screen. As a further demonstration of a lack of attention to the engine, the system requirements, in the box below, are decidedly exorbitant. The game interface is not helped by the amount of actions that can be performed and the aforementioned difficulties in the commands also weigh in this sense, but all in all, after a few hours, you get the hang of it. At the moment the initial lag problems seem to have reduced a bit, even if using firearms you still experience unpleasant situations, probably also due to a non-record prediction system.", "date": "2009-10-28", "grade": "7.0"}
