{"name": "Tomb Raider Anniversary - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tomb-raider-anniversary-recensione_a.html", "text": "There are characters, real ~icons~ of a certain moment or way of living and thinking, destined to live forever in people's hearts and minds, to leave an indelible mark on history, be it the one with the ~S~ uppercase than the other, the specific one and inherent to a specific event or ~universe~. In that of videogames there are now many ~image~ characters, and each of them tends, in the eyes of enthusiasts and insiders, to represent not only a particular ~videogame era~, but also a specific personal period of their own existence, unleashing in the most beautiful memories and a certain sense of nostalgia for unrepeatable, past moments. Just as Pacman (Asteroids had no protagonist except a small triangle like a spaceship) is the symbol of a first generation of video games, the ~Bar~ ones, Mario, Sonic and Zelda are for the second, the ~home~ one , Lara Croft is from the third, is the emblem of a change of era in the world of video games, since in addition to almost, in some ways, marking the transition from 16 to 32 bit, from a certain way of making games, perhaps more ~romantic~, simple and therefore often effective, appreciated, to another more professional, more technical, with his image that earns even the covers of fashion or current affairs magazines around the world, ~clears~ the universe of which above making it closer and known even to non-enthusiasts. To worthily celebrate the tenth anniversary of the creation of this authentic ~myth~ of video games, Eidos has decided to make a remake of the first chapter of the saga, originally born on Playstation, with the very clear title of Tomb Raider Anniversary. Back to the past In the Los Alamos of 1945 a violent explosion brings to light a huge crystal containing an immortal creature imprisoned inside. A few decades later the mysterious owner of a multinational company, Jacqueline Natla, hires the famous English archaeologist and adventurer Lara Croft to recover the three pieces of a legendary artifact called Scion, which belonged to the ancient civilization of Atlantis. An object already sought after in the past by the father of our heroine. After that we leave and find ourselves in the lost city of Vilcamamba. Once you get into the action and start playing, you immediately feel a certain feeling with the gameplay, which is broadly the same, albeit improved, as always. Leaps to the millimeter, traps to avoid perhaps with a last-minute stunt, levers to lower or crates to be moved to reach a shelf are always there, as in the past. And they objectively like it. Then, after a few minutes you realize that there is actually something different. They are changes that are imperceptible at first glance, those made to be artfully integrated into a certain technical context to improve it, without however distorting its structure. Starting from the very famous jumps of Lara: these have been weakened, so no more leaps worthy of the ~bionic man~ of the 70s TV series of the same name, and made more credible, as far as possible given the context. Now to reach otherwise inaccessible places, the beautiful archaeologist must use her grappling hook, perhaps hooking it to a rock spike or a protruding branch to hoist herself up or to use it as a ~Tarzan liana~ and swing towards the part to be reached. Not just a remake This accessory also becomes very useful for recovering objects placed in difficult locations by simply grabbing them and pulling them towards you, or for opening certain passages. Another novelty during these platform phases is the fact that Lara Croft can lose her balance. After having performed one of her proverbial acrobatics and landed on some perhaps not very large ledge, the stern heroine can have moments of ~skidding~ with the risk of ending up down. To overcome this risky ~inconvenience~, the player is called to repeatedly press the triangle button once the Pg has arrived at his destination and to constantly keep his eyes wide open, in case of premature death or serious injury. Interestingly, Anniversary fortunately offers a sort of quick menu accessible via the arrow keys to use a medikit or quickly change equipped weapon, and the return of the very useful and comfortable ring inventory in the more intricate phases, just like those following a non-fatal but still serious fall, which can put a very frail Lara in front of fierce enemies. Tomb Raider Anniversary therefore combines, as seen so far, old and new in a uniform way. Perhaps the only, small exception is if anything in the physical structure of some areas or situations, such as levels adapted to myimproved gameplay, eliminated or reworked puzzles and locations simplified in size and obstacles. A title to love Faithful to the original on the Playstation, Anniversary does not provide excessive difficulty during the battle phases with the few enemies, both because these are in principle mostly animals, so they attack without weapons and in predictable ways, and because it is obvious that we wanted to keep that feeling of the game more focused on exploration itself and the end of it, rather than anything else. However, a couple of additions by the programmers are here too and serve to make these phases much more stimulating. For example, by moving the analog stick quickly, Lara is able to shake off an enemy, or in certain specific cases she can perform a special attack by repeatedly shooting at an opponent, thus ~starting~ a ~Matrix~-style sequence in which the user can finish off the opponent by firing at the right moment. This last feature often proves decisive especially against certain bosses, otherwise too difficult to eliminate. Among the novelties, the Shenmue-like quicktime events should not be forgotten, even if few and inserted within the interlude or introductory films of some elements of the plot. The collection and consequent collection of relics and artifacts does not have a purely ~fetishistic~ function, but becomes a necessary element for the user who wants to enjoy every little extra content (films, image galleries, new costumes, tricks, etc). To unlock them at the end of each level it will therefore be necessary to find them within the various areas explored, and it will not always be easy to notice them. Lara's roundness As far as the technical part is concerned, Tomb Raider proves to be up to the potential of the PSP. Very accurate and detailed graphics in relation to the hardware available to the graphics, with a decidedly very sexy and ~rounded~ Lara, not ~angular~ thanks to the high number of polygons that compose her, fluid and credible animations that have nothing to do with see of course with the original on PSX. In short, the complete restyling seen on PS2 is also present in this version. Vast settings, well characterized even if not very detailed (however take a look, for example, at the areas set among the ruins of Greek or Egyptian civilizations and you will be positively impressed), populated by animals of all kinds and very colorful. All without having to put up with annoying loading (these only happen at the beginning of each ~level~) or slowdowns of any kind. The audio part is also beautiful: a well-made soundtrack, but rightly limited in number of songs and occasions in which it pops up, a very perfect choice in our opinion given that this is a title that bases all its appeal on the exploration and discovery of objects, and therefore requires to be played only with background noise for greater identification. And in this sense we must add that an excellent job has been done: gurgling, animal moans, various rustlings, everything is recreated almost to perfection, helping to give our beautiful adventuress the air of someone who is really in a remote and lonely corner of the world. Comment Tomb Raider Anniversary on PSP is a worthy conversion of the remake of the same name for home platforms. A title that on balance fully succeeds in its intent to be a re-proposition in a modern sauce of a ~classic~ of the world videogame panorama, with that extra ~quid~ capable of improving it where needed. We are faced with the ~Tomb Raider~ par excellence, with all the strengths and weaknesses of the case, from frustrating falls due to an ill-calculated jump or large, sometimes distracting levels. But beautiful for this very reason, because it maintains the spirit of a series that is still able to fascinate and amuse both Lara fans and newcomers to this saga equally today. Pro: There is Lara in full form. Difficult but fun missions. Successful technical restyling. Cons: A bit repetitive for some. Sometimes frustrating.
