Sports video games lend themselves particularly well to this purpose, as the discreet Let's Golf has already demonstrated! 3D by Gameloft: it's now time to get back on the green, but this time it's Shin'en Multimedia, best known for the Nanostray series, who takes us to minigolf courses with a port of the original Fun! Fun! Minigolf proposed a few years ago on the WiiWare channel. Compared to the Wii version, of course, there is an extra dimension and a tactile control system Fun! The title of Shin'en Multimedia's minigolf is a bit queer but it gets straight to the point, since what Fun! Fun! Minigolf TOUCH! tries to offer is a healthy dose of fun without too many pretensions. We're talking about a purely arcade game, based on a rather particular ~sport~, in which the objective is extremely simple: hit a ball and hit the hole at the end of the ~track~. Easier said than done, however, when the ground that the ball has to cover is chock full of obstacles of various kinds: gradients, slides, ducts and other amenities with the precise task of deflecting our ball and preventing it from reaching the half. From this point of view, Fun! Fun! Minigolf TOUCH! it is also quite severe, given that the small plastic ball must necessarily reach the area immediately surrounding the hole for the shot to be considered valid. This ~rule~ is the main source of frustration in an otherwise carefree game, in fact every shot requires great precision and careful evaluation of the trajectory, obstacles and physics involved in any collisions. Put like this, it almost seems that Fun! Fun! Minigolf TOUCH! is a real golf simulator; in reality, playing is very simple and it is possible to control the shots in two ways: the traditional method obviously allows you to use the Nintendo 3DS buttons to direct the shot and hit the ball, while a new option allows you to touch the touch-screen to perform the same actions. This method actually leaves a lot to be desired, the impression is that the game does not interpret the player's input precisely enough, making the operation more awkward than intuitive and the shots, of course, much less effective; given the difficulty of some challenges and the reduced margin of error granted to many shots, when the slightest imperfection or the most imperceptible inclination can completely divert the ball's trajectory, it is much better to position yourself and shoot with the greatest possible precision. The 3D effect Predictably, Fun! Fun! Minigolf TOUCH! it does not feature a particularly important three-dimensional effect: by activating it, you will enjoy slightly more spectacular shots and a greater sense of depth at the time of shooting, however nothing that can decisively influence your performance. Accidental golfers From a technical point of view Fun! Fun! Minigolf TOUCH! does its duty adequately: remember that it is one of the cheapest games on the eShop, yet the settings appear colorful and quite varied, despite the discrete poverty of details or animated elements. The player is represented by his own Mii, in a somewhat crude version, especially in terms of animations that characterize victory shots and dances: they are supposed to be funny and witty, but in reality they look a bit grotesque. Fortunately, Miis can be dressed up with a ton of clothes and trinkets that can be purchased in the appropriate menu: this virtual ~shop~ is the heart of the game and actually represents its real longevity. The approximately forty pitches and tracks in the game, set in Europe, Asia and America, in fact allow you to earn the appropriate money necessary to buy not only the clothing of your Wii alter-ego, but also further useful accessories such as clubs and special balls that can affect shots, improving player performance. Furthermore, it is possible to unlock new races, in particular a series of very particular challenges in which it will not be necessary to hit the hole, but rather to bounce the ball so that it hits the coins scattered along the course, taking advantage of any obstacles on purpose. Unfortunately, this discrete variety of content forces the player to continuously repeat the already completed races, since the coins necessary for shopping are given with a dropper. Fun! Fun! Minigolf TOUCH! then becomes repetitive very quickly and many of the available contents can only be unlocked after repeating those already unlocked to the bitter end, in a vicious circle that makes the Shin'en Multimedia product less long-lived than it tries to be.", "date": "2012-03-16", "grade": "6.8"}
