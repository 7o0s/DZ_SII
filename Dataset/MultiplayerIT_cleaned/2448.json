{"name": "A Painters Tale: Curon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/a-painters-tale-curon-1950-recensione.html", "text": "Among the (many) merits of Netflix is that of having brought to light some episodes of post-war Italy that the economic boom had unjustly overshadowed. It was the case of the Isola delle Rose and it is the case of the village of Curon, sacrificed both by metonymy, which preferred Resia (which is a fraction of Curon), and above all by Montecatini, the historic edilchemical colossus to which the contract for the creation of an artificial basin, uniting the small natural lakes that were located in the South Tyrolean area. Who knows if the three boys from Bologna who make up Monkeys Tales Studio were inspired by the recent TV series by Ezio Abbate or by the documentary The submerged country for their first work. Be that as it may, the review of A Painter's Tale: Curon, 1950 speaks of a title that can be categorized in the ~walking simulator~ genre, where there is little else to do other than discover the delightful mountain village and the absurd adventure that Tommaso, a young painter catapulted into the days immediately preceding the planned destruction of the village, is experiencing. The plot It may seem strange, but much of this wonder is man-made Tommaso, a young painter in an identity crisis, is enraptured by the beauty of the Venoste Alps while portraying the famous submerged bell tower. He awakens in 1949, that is to say in the final stages of the old Curon, reliving firsthand the pain of the days that preceded the flooding of the village. Here he meets Ida, a young war widow; of Father Alfred; of the hotelier Heinrich and his voluptuous daughter Ludovica who seems to have lost her head for the faithless ing. Golini, head of the Montecatini project. The story is a successful mix between fiction and reality, where the first is only slightly sketched out to leave room for the effectiveness of the story of the life of those years, traveling to places and events that really happened, such as the parish priest's (vain) attempt at intercession at the Holy See or the difficult coexistence between Italians and Germans. Along the lines of what happens in Valiant Hearts: The Great War, the work also has an intrinsic cultural value: as we proceed, the diary is populated with entries that tell interesting anecdotes of the time and of South Tyrolean culture. The common thread that links the three acts that make up A Painter's Tale is precisely painting: the art that allows Tommaso to bring the historical memory of Curon back to life. As initially written, it is a real walking simulator and as such the game structure is reduced to the bone: sometimes it seems that there are alternative paths to take depending on the answer, but in practice every choice is converged on the only ending foreseen by the developers. There are a couple of elementary mini-games that would have deserved to be explored further to give more depth to the gaming experience, which ends in less than two hours. Part story, part documentary The project of Lake Resia, obtained by unifying three small natural lakes (the one of the same name, that of Curon and that of San Valentino alla Muta), is the result of the twenty years and was born towards the end of the Thirties to favor the electricity supply of nearby Bolzano ; frozen by the Great War, whose bombings also touched those areas, it was resumed only at the end of the 1940s. Initially, a rise in the waters of only five meters was envisaged: a limit that would have allowed the town to survive. Following the decision to increase the depth of the basin to twenty-two meters, the population was evacuated to cramped prefabricated buildings built a little further upstream and the town, made up of 163 houses, razed to the ground, with the exception of only the bell tower, whose top was spared from the waters and which today represents the most famous tourist attraction before the border with Austria. Technique The places represented were actually existing For the technical realization, the guys from Monkeys Tales relied on the Voxel technique, thanks to which they were able to reproduce the alpine village in great detail, starting from the model present in the Curon museum. The choice to adopt the super-deformed style for the characters clashes, as it makes them expressionless even in particularly dramatic moments, where greater characterization would have allowed a higher level of pathos. A first-rate role is entrusted to the perfect soundtrack created by Marta Ascari, historical collaborator of Monkeys Tales and freely usable from this site.", "date": "2021-02-24", "grade": "8.0"}
