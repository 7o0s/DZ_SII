The same care has unfortunately not been placed in the console versions, even those of the latest generation, limited from a technical point of view but above all poorly supported in terms of updates, so much so as to create a frankly embarrassing situation for the talented Swedish studio. The sad faces of the team members have been a characterizing feature of each new video message dedicated to owners of the game on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, after all. We therefore welcomed the announcement of the debut of Payday 2 on Switch with some surprise, for two fundamental reasons: the first is that the Nintendo platforms are only now opening up to a certain type of production, the second is that at the third strike of row you are usually eliminated. A matter of numbers For those who don't know it yet, Payday 2 is a cooperative-based shooter in which four players take on the role of four criminals, with the aim of pulling off bigger and bigger hits and raising enough money to lead a comfortable life in a remote tropical island. New characters have gradually been added to the starting team, and the Nintendo Switch version includes seventeen of them in all: in addition to the various Dallas, Wolf, Chains and Hoxton, we find for example the skin of John Wick and the new entry Joy, while the appeal Scarface, Hila, Ethan, Sangres and Duke. The missions are provided by various contractors, and here too the pot is quite rich, with eight unscrupulous organizers who will award us a total of fifty different shots. In short, the substance of the package is not in question, but it is also true that you will not find the same content available on the PC on the Nintendo console. Will they come later? At the moment it is not clear, it will probably depend on the reception that the public will reserve for this new edition of the game. In an absolute sense, however, there is little to complain about: the situations we will find ourselves facing are quite varied and articulated, with shots that develop over several days and require a certain degree of cooperation between the four members of the team . Therefore, the lack of a voice chat system on Switch does not help at all: if you have organized yourself with friends you will have no problems using alternative methods, but in games with perfect strangers you will find yourself having to make all the more effort the longer they are , intricate and complex missions. Basically The Payday 2 matchmaking system on Nintendo Switch works practically identically to what is seen on other platforms, unfortunately including the annoying waiting time that accompanies the entry of each new user once the game has started. Having said that, once in action we did not encounter any problems attributable to latency or some server disruption, although a scrupulous check in this sense with the game in the shops will need to be carried out. Having not grappled with the experience of the Overkill Software title for a while, we really appreciated the most recent contents of the package, which actually raise the bar compared to the initial shots, however important for understanding certain mechanisms and ~gaining experience~ also in terms of character growth, with the release of further equipment and new skills. For example, you will find yourself burglarizing shops and stealing from the safety deposit boxes of a small bank, but also carrying out punitive expeditions, identifying certain materials and transporting them (the mission of delivering the... nuclear warheads is very amusing), discovering more on mysterious structures where experiments on humans are conducted, or to storm the armored cars of a train that contain military armaments that someone is interested in. In short, there is so much to do in Payday 2, but the fact that you can decide how to do it is even more interesting: take care of the reconnaissance phase before wearing the masks and pulling out your guns, deactivating any alarm systems and putting keep silent about the guards in key positions, get hold of magnetic cards that can speed up certain passages... or don't care, start shooting and resist when the SWAT arrives to attack us. Lots of thickness It is precisely the freedom of action, the consistency of the structure and the sense of progression that make Payday 2 a great shooter. Over time, the specializations for the for have multipliedsonaggi, which means that we will be able to spend the experience points earned to obtain skills that marry with our way of understanding the missions. Do we want to become expert burglars, capable of opening a safe in just a few minutes? Scary technicians, able to deactivate alarms and confuse the guards, preventing them from calling the police? Or tanks, with thick flak armor and heavy armament that allows us to hold off entire squads of law enforcement officers in combat gear? These are considerations that acquire a precise meaning when we have the opportunity to organize a real team with friends, so that everyone can offer something concrete so that the group is complete and balanced. Even this is not easy to do on Switch, it takes a little effort but it's worth it. From this point of view the presence of a local multiplayer mode helps, after all we talk to each other verbally, but the peculiarities of the machine don't seem to have been exploited that much: you can control the main menu with the touch screen, but currently missing an option to aim with the gyroscope. Then there is the technical question to deal with, and in this sense it is sad to say that an excellent job has not been done, on the contrary: on the Nintendo console, Payday 2 feels the full weight of its years and uses low quality assets, which make so much ~old gen~: the surfaces are flat, the textures are poorly defined, the animations are poor, there are plenty of visual glitches and even the effects are ugly. The problem is that not even the frame rate is saved, and here we need to open a necessary parenthesis: the Overkill Software title absolutely does not give its best at just thirty frames per second, because evidently the authors were unable to regulate the gunplay on these values, saving himself in a corner on the console only thanks to the presence of the assisted aim. So let alone what happens when there are also declines: the experience becomes chaotic and imprecise precisely in the most critical moments. At this point we would have preferred a lower resolution and perfect frame pacing, like that offered by DOOM.", "date": "2018-02-23", "grade": "7.0"}
