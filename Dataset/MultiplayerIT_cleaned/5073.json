Well, what happens if strategic elements are added to this already well-tested system, perhaps with a view to a one-on-one online multiplayer in real time? WarFriends, the new About Fun project for iOS and Android terminals, starts from this concept, offering us a gameplay capable of combining the simplicity of this type of shooter and the tactical mechanisms that characterize some of the most famous productions available on the App Store and Google Play. After completing a short tutorial, selecting our character's skin and his initial equipment (consisting of a primary weapon, a special weapon, a grenade and a pistol, all of which can be upgraded), we will immediately be able to challenge other users within four different maps which are unlocked as we level up: Desert Base, Snowfall, City and Jungle. Once we have reached the fifth degree of experience we will also be able to access the Warpath mode, with a series of single player missions (but which can also be played cooperatively with another person) characterized by specific objectives, for example the elimination of a certain number of enemies or survival for a certain amount of time; all, however, without being able to resort to support troops: in that case we will be alone on the battlefield. WarFriends is a very fun and multifaceted ~tactical~ cover shooter, both in multiplayer and solo Fire strategy WarFriends' online multiplayer mode is at the heart of the About Fun experience, but how exactly does it work? It is no coincidence that we talked about cover shooters: our character will have to go from one position to another to avoid enemy fire and any grenades thrown to destroy the cover, leaning out to score a few shots towards the opponent, who is at the opposite end of the map and draws on the same resources. Of course, whoever manages to eliminate the enemy wins, but you can also do it indirectly, and this is where the strategic mechanics of the game come into play. After having setup our team between one mission and another, in fact, we will be able to deploy on the field (or let the system do it automatically) troops of various kinds, each characterized by different attack patterns and effectiveness: from infantry units to machine gunners, from snipers to grenadiers, passing through anti-riot units that do not remain stationary behind cover but rather advance towards the enemy to force him to expose himself. It goes without saying that we will be able to successfully conclude the match both by scoring the decisive blow in the first person, and by entrusting this task to the support troops, who immediately prove to be very good at flushing out our opponent and inflicting damage on him. However, don't think that WarFriends' gameplay pushes towards a passive use of the experience, because the fire mechanisms are well implemented and allow you to make single shots by touching the target on the screen or bursts or precision shots by holding down to activate a magnifying viewfinder . In short, the facets are many and are assisted by mobile elements of the scenario, by the inevitable explosive barrels (which, blown up, allow you to eliminate large groups of hostile units in one fell swoop) and by a well-made technical sector, in able to offer a pleasant and functional ~deformed~ style, although the musical accompaniment never takes off. The only big drawback: the freemium model adopted inevitably implies a superiority of the users who pay compared to those who enjoy the experience for free, undermining the quality of a balance that at first appears irreproachable.", "date": "2017-01-30", "grade": "8.0"}
