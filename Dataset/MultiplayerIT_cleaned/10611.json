In his short life, Kimetsu no Yaiba has nevertheless been able to create a large and passionate fanbase, and it is certainly to this that the new title for PC and console developed by CyberConnect2, the authors of the tie-ins dedicated to Naruto, is aimed. Will this also be a great success? We talk about it in the review of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles. History Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, here is Tanjir while performing one of his water-based techniques The story of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles follows quite faithfully the events narrated during the first season of the anime and the film Mugen Train, accompanying us over the course of eight chapters (nine, considering the prologue) in which we will the knowledge of Tanjiro Kamado, a mountain boy who one day finds his family massacred after the attack of a mysterious demon. The only survivor of the massacre is his younger sister Nezuko, who however was transformed into a demon herself : only the providential intervention of Giyu Tomioka prevents her from killing Tanjiro, who decides to undergo a very hard training to join the legendary Demon Slayer Squad and find a way to make her human again. These episodes are shown in the game only in the form of flashback sequences based on the materials of the animated series, given that the campaign begins right from the training of the protagonist, entrusted to the old master Sakonji Urokodaki, and the final test that he will have to pass before undergoing the exam to become a Demon Slayer. Hardened in body and spirit and equipped with a sword of the sun, the only weapon capable of cutting off the heads of demons, Tanjiro therefore begins to grapple with a series of tasks always carrying his sister Nezuko with him, capable of shrinking and entering a wooden box that her brother easily carries on his shoulder, thus preventing the daylight from killing her. Structure Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, one of the most powerful demons in the campaign The main screen of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles allows you to access the story mode and the Clash mode, as well as unlock rewards using the Kimetsu points earned up to that point, undergo training, check the archive of collectibles obtained and try your hand at the tutorial. The campaign, as already mentioned, consists of eight chapters and a prologue, each divided into a series of stages accompanied by cutscenes that can be viewed later to get a complete picture of the plot. There are also special challenges that are unlocked upon completion of each act, and which try to add substance to a single player sector that is frankly poor in content. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, Nezuko in action The duration of the story mode is in fact just four hours: too little, especially considering that chapters 6 and 7 are characterized respectively by a handful of cutscenes and a couple of rhythm game-style mini-games that revolve around the new training to which Tanjiro decides to undergo it to improve their skills and learn a powerful breathing technique. However, the very quality of the campaign appears questionable, with a formula that incorporates the various Naruto tie-ins but focuses on an exploratory phase that is extremely basic in terms of mechanics and interactions, in which we are simply asked to travel a route, possibly follow the traces of demons and reach the objective of the turn from time to time to finally give life to a fight. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, the clash between Nezuko and Inosuke Completing the story and its special challenges is required to unlock the full roster of characters available in Clash Mode, which includes three different versions of Tanjiro, two versions of Nezuko, Zenitsu Agatsuma, Shinobu Kocho, Inosuke, Hashibara and Giyu Tomioka, as well as the various Sabito, Makomo, Kyojuror Rengoku, Murata and Sakonji Urokodaki. Unfortunately the demons are completely missing, both the basic ones and the very powerful lieutenants of Muzan ~Jacko~ Kibutsuji. Speaking of versus, it is possible to face another player locally, a character controlled by the CPU or an opponent online via ranked match or personalized, the latter with adjustable matchmaking by geographical area and the possibility of directly challenging the best players, listed in a ranking. Gameplay Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, one of the moves of the funny but very strong Zenitsu On the gameplay front, the references of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles to the Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm series are very evident, a sign that the guys at CyberConnect2 were simply asked to replicate a formula that they have been able to refine over the years and enrich, adding depth to the clashes and inventing something for the outline. The fights are therefore those of a classic three-dimensional brawler, with our character (Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, Inosuke and someone else, depending on the situation) who has to face demons gradually getting stronger, observing their attack routines and taking advantage of the right moment to sink their blows through basic combinations and special moves regulated by the inevitable spiritual energy bar. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, the very strong Kyojuro Rengoku is preparing to strike It is possible to perform parries and dodges with very few limitations, move within the scenario (restricted, in the case of fights, compared to the starting setting) to avoid maneuvers from a distance and then shorten in an instant by sprinting, starting to bombard the enemy with slashes and specials until activating a simple quick time event to decapitate him and put an end to the fight. The opponents' repertoire also changes a lot during the campaign, with the strongest demons taking on different forms, but the pattern rule the fights remains basically the same, showing the side to a bit of repetitiveness and a trivial degree of challenge after all. Enemies don't drift away and become frustratingly elusive like they did in the Naruto games, but that's cold consolation. The big problem is in fact represented by what is around these fights. We cannot speak of an adventure mode, because the exploratory phase of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles only asks you to turn within the settings, sometimes reduced to a single straight road, sometimes more intricate but easily solved, until you reach a point of interest that starts the classic cutscene and then a new clash. Within the scenarios the things to do are really reduced to the bone, daughters of an absolutely superficial and filling interaction: you can collect points and items here and there and talking to NPCs, sometimes having unexpected duels that, in hindsight, we would have been happy to see in more quantity, perhaps in combination with some progression system. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, two fighters face off in Clash mode In Clash mode, the combat system certainly becomes more interesting, thanks to the traditional team system (in this case limited to only two characters, one main and one support) which opens up to the use of evasive maneuvers and assists, as well as above all to the possibility of resorting to the spectacular Ultimates, different for each character, which used with the right timing can turn the tide of a clash. Just online multiplayer, albeit with the aforementioned limitations in terms of roster and fighters who look like a almost everyone, in the medium term it could represent the lifeline of a production that is too skimpy in its contents, which unfortunately we are unable to perceive as something other than an attempt to monetize the passion of Demon Slayer fans. Graphics and sound Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, Nezuko trapped by cobwebs Undoubtedly the most refined aspect of the game, the technical realization of the new Cyberconnect2 title can count on an excellent use of cel shading, a technique that the Japanese studio has learned to master over the years and which always returns excellent results when it has to do with the videogame transposition of an anime. The polygonal models of the characters are therefore excellent and extremely faithful to the originals. The scenarios move between ups and downs, and as mentioned areor often limited in design, but the one in Asakusa undoubtedly stands out for its colors and visual richness. Of course, some animations betray a production level that is not exactly at the top during the interlude sequences and some expedients have been used to avoid representing specific scenes, but in general the level is high and fans of the series will not be disappointed, on the contrary. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, Zenitsu grappling with hordes of spiders In terms of the spectacularity of the cutscenes, the speech is different and clearly depends on the original material, which in the case of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba does not reach the peaks of large-scale devastation that we have been able to admire in some Naruto sequences, and that the team directed by Hiroshi Matsuyama has been able to exploit so well in the tie-ins made for Bandai Namco. The PS4 version of the game, which we were able to try on PS5, is limited to 30 fps and suffers from some uncertainty here and there, but SEGA has guaranteed a free upgrade for next-gen platforms that will allow you to double this value and enjoy a substantially smoother experience. Finally, the sound can count on good music and dubbing in Japanese or English, in all cases with Italian subtitles.", "date": "2021-10-13", "grade": "6.5"}
