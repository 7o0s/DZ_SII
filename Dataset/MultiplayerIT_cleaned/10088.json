De Blob made its first appearance on Nintendo Wii and DS, and then also arrived on mobile phones and iPhone itself with some versions very similar to the original title, and focused on the ability of the main protagonist, able to restore color to a world dominated by scales of grey. However, THQ has also decided to develop a sort of spin-off on the Apple device, subtitled Revolution, which simplifies the mechanics a bit but which is more suited to an immediate type of game and to be appreciated when you have little time available to get distracted between one commitment and another. Once again the evil I.N.K.T. Corporation has captured the Grayadians, trapping them in some buildings in Prisma City. Our aim is to free them on every floor where they are present, accumulating color points to unlock increasingly difficult levels of difficulty and access all three game modes. Gotta Catch'em all! The gameplay scheme is quite simple, each floor is represented by a two-dimensional labyrinth, within which several Grayadians are located and where there is a hole that represents the exit. The aim is to move De Blob on straight lines, saving your friends and without crossing the trajectory already drawn (represented by a colored stripe that is always visible) or blocking your way out, under penalty of Game Over. As mentioned, for each completed building, consisting of several floors, color points are obtained which unlock advanced difficulty levels or the next two modes, where in the first there is also a time bar, which leads to completing the floor faster to increase your bonus more, and in the second you are chased by employees of the I.N.K.T. Corporation, who try to reach and block the main protagonist before the level is completed. The structure of this gameplay works perfectly, the game is always immediate and fun and in the advanced modes it pushes you to think quickly about the next move, in order to increase the number of color points accumulated and raise your score. The graphic style is essential but pleasant while the interface provides for moving by dragging or pressing on the point to reach. In the second case, the answer is precise to the millimeter, and helps the concept of simplicity and immediacy of the game produced by THQ Wireless. The defects are felt when De Blob: Revolution, even at the highest difficulty level, does not represent a particularly demanding challenge and the accumulation of color points to unlock the other modes and major challenges runs out quickly enough, without any multiplayer component or more robust single player progression. The tested version is 1.0.16 Apple Store Links", "date": "2010-04-08", "grade": "7.0"}
