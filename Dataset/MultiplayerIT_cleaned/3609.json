{"name": "HELI 100", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/heli-100-recensione.html", "text": "HELI 100 was born with the idea of providing arcade shooter enthusiasts with a fun, quite demanding but above all fast experience: you can launch the game and complete some missions in just a few minutes, perhaps while you are stopped in a parking lot at waiting or relaxing on the sofa. The formula behind the game is very simple: in command of one of the various aircraft that can be unlocked as you progress through the campaign, which include different types of helicopters and even a mech, you must destroy waves of increasingly resistant and insidious enemies while a barrier electrified flying constricts around us, making things always difficult for us. The low poly graphic style is the same as seen in the very successful PAKO 2, but in combination with the excellent rendering of impacts (every hit you can ~feel~, in short) immediately brings to mind the gameplay of the Pixeljunk Shooter series. After all, we will be able to defend ourselves by shooting swarms of missiles, another similarity with the Q-Games shoot'em-up, but using a control system that is part of the challenge: instead of piloting our vehicle through a virtual double analog stick, we will have to tap the screen left or right to veer in each direction, press both to stop and let the semi-auto aim do the rest. There is only one problem: we will be able to hit an enemy only if he is in front of or next to us. Structure and gameplay The HELI 100 campaign is made up of one hundred levels, in fact, which offer a progressively higher degree of challenge and are seasoned with a boss fight every ten missions. From the point of view of variety, the game does not miss anything: the opponents we will have to face, ruthless aliens determined to eliminate us, move aboard small pods but also saber-ships and other shapes capable of putting us in difficulty, perhaps because they move faster or have a tough arsenal to neutralize. From ours we will have the aforementioned possibility of unlocking new vehicles, perhaps more agile and resistant, as well as special weapons that can be activated by touching the relative icon in the lower part of the touch screen: energy shields, forward shots, homing missiles, smart bombs, mode ~ comet~ and many other options that certainly succeed in keeping the interest alive. +1 All this despite the intrinsic repetitiveness of an action that takes place in a very short time and cannot go beyond the confines of the small ~fence~ mentioned above, lethal when it is crossed for more than a few moments. At least the fact of having to move in confined spaces has been managed well, with very generous collision detection, which allows you to dodge enemy bullets with relative tranquility and avoids any game over that is not actually deserved. The game can be downloaded for free from the App Store or Google Play, and is equipped with very permissive freemium mechanisms: only after a certain amount of ~try again~ does a short advertising trailer come out, while it is possible to use ~continue~ if you agree to assist to a full promotional video. In short, you proceed for free without any problems, accompanied by a very pleasant electronic soundtrack and graphics capable of exploiting their peculiarities well, offering soft tones, excellent visual effects and excellent fluidity.", "date": "2019-06-28", "grade": "7.8"}
