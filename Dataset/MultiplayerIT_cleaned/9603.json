Instead of the space ships or the mighty demons of Dodonpachi Resurrection and Espgaluda II, in this new shooter the player has to face hordes of gigantic cockroaches, disgusting monsters and bugs of all kinds. But, above all, the developers have set aside the classic mechanics of vertical scrolling shooters, creating something much more atypical and which mixes twin-stick shooter elements with a different combat system than usual. From the two previous games Bug Panic inherits only one thing: the immense amount of bullets to avoid with millimeter precision, while the difficulty progressively increases and the poorest players are kicked heavily in the back. Thought butterflies and ladybugs pose no threat? Then be ready to change your mind. Every roach... The protagonist of the game is Reco, princess of the peaceful Shinju forest and lady of all the insects that inhabit it. For a few moments one wonders why a human-like and good-looking girl should be the housekeeper of cockroaches and disgusting creatures, but like all Japanese works, even Bug Panic is full of strangeness. The fact is that, all of a sudden, the insects begin to behave in a bizarre way, they become aggressive and flee from the forest, forcing Reco to chase them for over twenty levels in the most disparate settings: from a desolate desert to frozen mountains, from a small town to a magma inferno, each new scenario is inhabited by unique and equally dangerous creatures, while with quicksand, eruptions and frozen paths, even nature will do everything to put a spoke in the works. It is immediately clear how trivial the plot is, although the interlude scenes between one world and another make the narration pleasant. Not thanks to interesting dialogues or unexpected twists, but rather to splendid colorful and manga-style illustrations. The real novelty introduced by Bug Panic, however, is the control system: in a very similar way to the classic twin-stick shooter, the player can move Reco thanks to the left virtual stick and attack enemies with the right one. However, while in the other titles of the genre you shoot directly in the direction in which you aim, this time the right stick allows you to move a crosshair on the scenario, lock onto enemies by passing over it and throw bombs at them. The explosive seeds are the only weapon available to the player, but depending on how long the stick is held down they can be more or less powerful, up to a huge gas cloud capable of eliminating all bullets and enemies at a time. inside it. It is possible to deactivate the auto-aim but, also since you can lock on to up to three enemies at a time, using it becomes not only easier, but also more rewarding. Each level is divided into more or less large areas, and to unlock the passage that leads to the next one it is necessary to eliminate all the enemies within the one in which you are; this makes Bug Panic feel more like an elaborate arena shooter rather than a full-fledged exploration adventure. Cave's experience with the genre of the so-called danmaku shooters, those scrolling shooters in which you are overwhelmed by storms of bullets, is clearly found again this time: especially in the more advanced levels, with a large number of opponents to face simultaneously, the player must avoid attacks by moving quickly but with great precision. In the clashes with the gigantic bosses, then, learning the attack patterns by heart and always looking for an escape route becomes an absolute priority, despite the fact that the control system and the tactile interface often complicate things. Fortunately, the developers have introduced an interesting difficulty recalibration system which, based on the amount of defeats by the player, expands the limit of lives available for each level. Surprisingly, some collectibles and achievements to unlock make the levels of the main adventure very replayable, while the experience expands considerably thanks to a full-bodied points mode. It is not, as one might mistakenly think, a minor or secondary option, but it is possible to spend hours and hours trying to survive and climb the online rankings: to please everyone there is both a very fun timed mode, in which to search to eliminate as many bugs and get additional seconds, both an option inwhose limit is given by the lives at one's disposal.
