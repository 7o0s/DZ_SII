The complete series consists of five English-language episodes. The text is reasonably lacking in advances. If you enjoyed Mad Max: Fury Road, you will probably feel at home in front of the long sequences of hyperbolic action that promptly overwhelm the protagonists of Tales from the Borderlands. However, while in the first episode of the series these sequences were perfectly filmed, in Catch a Ride they are confused to say the least. A few bored transitions from director to player awaken the attention, but do not add adrenaline to the somersaults of Rhys and Fiona. Come to think of it, the best parts are the interludes set in the present, when the duo tells their story to the mysterious bounty hunter in the farmer-samurai hat. This got us thinking. By the time we've come to the central turning point of the series, it may be that the story has run out of steam. The two introspective parentheses, which should lay the foundations for the evolution of Rhys and Fiona, are the sign that the authors too have realized they have to let go a bit; unfortunately they can't do it all the way. They still try very hard to make us laugh, even with already heard gags, while we feel the need for more sobriety. Tales from the Borderlands is a prisoner of its own clich, of the imperative of having to be carefree and crazy at all costs. Rhys and Fiona, on the other hand, want to throw off the mask, and perhaps they will in time to avoid completely destroying the series. Either way, this is not where it happens. Having said this premise, the question now is not so much where were we, but where are we going. The answer is boh. You don't understand it and it doesn't even seem that important. Having escaped the machinations of the ruthless Hugo Vasquez, the group ends up in the hands of his partner, the obese Vallory. However, even she fails to corner the group, who find themselves on the run again, guided this time by a small spherical robot that seems to be able to indicate the position of the Traveler's Vault (our translation). Where did they all come from? Why do they have to get to the Vault? The motivations of the various characters have been lost along the way, and the fact that you don't feel the need to remember them shows how much this story boils down to a frantic race forward. Some new companions are added, such as the icy Athena, a Minerva in an apocalyptic sauce complete with a shield, while someone else dies. But you know what, we don't give a damn, because Tales from the Borderlands goes out of its way to make every event look like a futile game. And in this it succeeds very well. Tales from the Borderlands: Episode 3 uses all its tricks, but the magic is not the same Ephemeral design There is enough time in Catch a Ride to show off all the design conceived by Telltale in recent years, namely: pressing the Q key, pressing the E key, chatting with the rest of the team appropriately distributed on the screen and choices multiple during the dialogues. The game system is now known to most, but Tales from the Borderlands adds a couple of elements to the basic menu which, potentially, would also be interesting, namely Rhys' cybernetic eye and Fiona's money. Unfortunately, when the game decides to use them, all the limits of a completely unbalanced production on the traditional narrative side emerge. In Catch a Ride, Rhys has to use his eye to scan plants. It may be argued that botanical analysis is optional, but that is precisely the problem. What enrichment does it bring us to examine overgrown pink mushrooms? Fortunately, a quick glance at the door that blocks our path allows us to obtain key information, namely that to open it you need a lever, which luckily is just a few meters away. It's probably all part of the zany humor of the game. Let's look at Fiona's money instead. At one point the girl finds a chest full of money. He puts some in his pocket, which makes sense. But coincidentally in the same room there is a clothes dispenser, in case we want to change the look of the characters by spending a few dollars. And all this because in Borderlands there is money, so it was necessary to insert it. Needless to mention the system that asks us to choose the type of bullet to shoot based on the color of the enemy plant, because it is on the same level of superficiality as the mechanics mentioned above. But if you think we hate Telltale or this series, you are wrong. We had a lot of laughs with the first two episodes of Tales from the Borderlands, but it's a far below standard production by the quThe authors of The Wolf Among Us and The Walking Dead have accustomed us to wings. Indeed, this series is not even up to Game of Thrones, and for a very simple reason: the choices have no emotional weight. Now, however you think about Telltale's approach to adventures, and it's certainly subjective, the fact remains that a game that offers the incentive to make choices should at the very least make those choices difficult. That's how it is in Game of Thrones. In previous Telltale series the same. With Tales from the Borderlands it does not happen, and it is the limit that prevents it from being little more than a nice entertainment. At least as long as he gets his jokes right.", "date": "2015-06-26", "grade": "6.0"}
