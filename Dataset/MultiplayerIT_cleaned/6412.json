Every now and then some of these ideas are taken and combined and often what is created is a marriage of creativity that stimulates players and spectators in a satisfactory way. There are, however, cases in which that pot-pourri is not perfectly blended, losing either consistency or flavour. This is the case of Cursed to Golf, a game that tries to put together the platform, golf and the roguelike genre, ending up diluting itself significantly, resulting at times not very decided in some choices and too much in others. and flaws of this golf roguelike in Cursed to Golf review. Welcome to the Eterni-Tee Cursed to Golf: the Eterni-Tee Cursed to Golf immediately takes the player by the hand, narratively and playfully accompanies him through the folds of his ideas in an effective way. The long tutorial, in our view, is well calibrated, it leads the player to understand both the narrative incipit and all the facets included in a simple (not so much) golf game. You will take on the role of a Cursed Golfer, struck by lightning during the final of the most important golf tournament in the world and now forced to use his skills to free the Purgatory of Golf from the oppression of the Demon of the Green. In doing so, he and the other spirits, including the Scotsman, will finally be able to obtain peace. The narrative incipit therefore, is not as trivial as it seems. Chuhai Labs proves that it knows how to play with words, settings, facts and characters, taking itself seriously when needed, but making irony its first arrowhead. Instead, what immediately catches the eye of the player is a tutorial that takes its times, but despite this, it fills those who approach the game with information. The impression is that you are trying to make the gameplay pill sweeter, a pill that could be complex in certain situations given the severity of a roguelike system that is rare to find nowadays. Par or you're out Cursed to Golf: You can't go wrong ~You can not pass!~. Several times while playing Cursed to Golf, we were reminded of Gandalf intent on stopping the Balrog in Moria. Stuck like Durin's Scourge by the complexity of a surprisingly less forgiving game than one might have expected. Cursed to Golf allows no mistakes, gives you a maximum number of strokes and offers you a limited number of extra benefits. In fact, in addition to the basic shots, what you will have at your disposal to face the pitfalls of the playing fields you will face will be a limited number of Ace Cards and the possibility of ~seeing~ in more detail what surrounds you. Starting from the second possibility offered, it is clear how planning the move and the actions to be performed has an extremely more important value here than in any other choice of path that can be found in any roguelike. As we said, however, it is not only the iron or wood to be used that makes the blow more or less effective, but it is also how wisely you use the Ace Cards that makes the difference. These cards are basically extra powers that can be obtained both on the playing field and in the Scot's shop. From bomb balls to second chances, from slowing down time to ~testing~ shots, you're in for a treat. But what is incredibly unbalanced is the risk of failure. In Cursed to Golf you never have the feeling of having everything under control, the risk of making a mistake is uncontrollable and the subtle difference between failure and success often lurks in a single wrong shot. If on the one hand, the clearance of the upward difficulty now seems to have arrived among gamers, on the other hand perhaps we should now be more careful not to exclude those who may experience this excessive difficulty as frustration. Cursed to Golf does not allow failure and takes the player who loses back to the first hole, forcing him to retry the loop as in the most difficult and pure roguelike ever. Is there a possibility to have a checkpoint? Yes, in the advanced stages it will be possible, but even in this case the non-permissive nature of the title will relegate this possibility to only once per game. The dress does not make the priest Cursed to Golf: its pixel art What clashes with this almost sadistic nature of Cursed to Golf is a decidedly welcoming aspect. The pixel art is minimally invasive, rich in warm colors and attentive to detail, with well-finished backdrops that reminded us of the magnificent ones of Astral Ascent. The coherence and the struThe artistic ture of the settings is then decidedly of a good standard. Obstacles and difficulties are well thought out, often implemented with increasing difficulty of obstacles as you get closer to the hole. And it is precisely this that clashes with the nature of the game, the attention to detail on an artistic level, of ideas and also of putting into practice meticulous decisions that in other cases would have been considered secondary and perhaps not very worthy of attention. When Cursed to Golf doesn't think about the details, it builds a wall between itself and the players, a wall that is difficult to climb for those who use games simply for recreation. Cursed to Golf is the antithesis of musou, games designed for those who, after an exhausting day's work, want to switch off, press some keys to feel omnipotent and annihilate the CPU.", "date": "2022-08-19", "grade": "6.5"}
