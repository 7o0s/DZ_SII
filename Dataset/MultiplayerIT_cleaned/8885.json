Nowadays it is a genre that is hardly taken into consideration by the big houses, but in ancient times, when videogame-loving kids still spent rivers of coins in arcade cabinets, the genre was beloved and full of unforgettable exponents. With the evolution of the industry, shooters of this type have become almost exclusive to independent software houses, mainly because they are rather easy to program even for not very numerous teams. These developers went all out and caused the genre to divide neatly into two main categories: the classic scrolling Ikaruga-style, with myriads of enemies on the screen and levels to complete, and the twin stick shooters, in which you usually find yourself in fixed levels, with the ability to move anywhere and direct the fire at 360 degrees. The latter in particular are flocked like mushrooms, which does not surprise us at all: on balance if you take Asteroids, update the graphics, and insert the possibility of directing the shot and some additional mechanics, you will get a nice shooter ready to play play. Ok, said this is too simplistic, but at least conceptually it is not difficult to create a title of this type. What we will review today is Waves, by Squid in a Box (actually made up of only one very talented member named Rob Hale) a twin stick shooter that follows the fashion of the moment, and focuses on simple but original gameplay and a graphic style psychedelic. Could a single man have managed to program a game capable of making the famous Beat Hazards and Geometry Wars pale? And will the graphic style stand up to the terrifying epileptic warriors? We'll tell you as soon as we recover from the spasms. I play with a ball, but the game is not a ball In Waves you won't take control of spaceships or fighter planes, not even a triangle to tell the truth. Your alter ego will be a simple sphere, capable of firing energy bullets in bursts. The setting where the magical ball will move is a simple circular arena, in which energy constructs of variable shapes will periodically appear that you will have to destroy to earn points. It seems like the most obvious so far, but this shoot 'em up has a few tricks up its sleeve. Firstly, your orb will level up depending on the score you get. At each level you will have to collect a multiplier and survive increasingly numerous and insistent enemies. The points earned will not only increase with the upgrade of your sphere: you can in fact multiply them by killing hostiles in rapid succession and thus obtaining combos. That wasn't enough, the gameplay allows you to briefly slow down time, using a bullet time bar that recharges quite quickly. The bullet time will make it easier for you to dodge dangers and double the points obtained with kills, but it will also slow down your shots, making it difficult to hit. Luckily, every time you get ten points on the combo counter, you'll have the chance to use an area bomb, which can easily destroy the clutter of constructs that clog the screen at higher levels. These bombs are not permanent and must be used on the fly, a mechanic that makes everything monstrously frenetic. The double count of ~point-blank~ kills also takes care of increasing the adrenaline. Five modes available. Crunchtime asks you to score as many points as possible in a relatively short amount of time. The classic Survival will see you survive infinite hazards, with a limited amount of lives available. Rush Mode is similar to Crunchtime, but allows you to extend time by leveling up and destroying special high-strength cubes. Bombing Run is the most original mode, as it eliminates fire altogether and forces you to destroy pursuing enemies with the help of special explosive platforms. Finally, the Challenge Mode is structured in challenges, linked to specific scores to beat. All modes are single player, but allow you to enter scores in an inevitable online ranking. If I was a mosquito, I would have crashed on the screen Waves is a good game. We are not talking about gameplay in this case, but just about the aesthetic aspect. Rob Hale has created a little gem using the Unreal Engine. Everything moves very smoothly and has a bright, colorful look that feels like a cross between Tron and Geometry Wars. The soundtrack is also fantastic, made even more enjoyable by the fact that the enemies move and appear in time with the music. Interesting even theand typologies of opposing ~geometric shapes~, which gradually change and become more and more varied and unpredictable. No online co-op, but that's not a big deal. This game (and its genre in general) pushes users to improve their score beyond belief, not to collaborate with others. Longevity comes from how far you can climb the leaderboards, and not from the actual modes, even if five should be more than enough specialties to dedicate yourself to. For a one-man video game, the overall presentation is remarkable. The comments in the tutorial and at the end of each game are also very funny, which with their humor frame the package perfectly. If we consider the very limited price of the game, we are faced with an excellent offer.", "date": "2011-12-06", "grade": "8.0"}
