{"name": "Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/atelier-iris-3-grand-phantasm-recensione.html", "text": "Iris has a picture of Edward Elric on her bedside table The plot of Atelier Iris is extremely simple, and even if it reserves some twists, especially in the second half of the game, it is rather trivial and almost represents a pretext for staging the many quests that will be proposed by the Guild to which the main character, the funny Iris and the intrepid Edge (whom the beautiful Nell will join, completing the party of playable characters and a bizarre sentimental triangle): by completing the various quests new ones will become available, including some missions that will allow us to advance in the main plot of Atelier Iris 3, which sees our protagonist grappling with an incomplete mystical artifact, which once ~repaired~ with some magical gems scattered throughout the various dimensions of the Alterworld will grant a wish of its owner (Akira Toriyama thanks for plagiarism). Of course, things will get more complicated as new characters appear interested in the same goal as Iris and her artifact, including the inevitable enemies with delusions of grandeur and omnipotence. The repetitiveness of the quests, which we will be forced to undertake to proceed in the plot, is certainly the worst flaw of Atelier Iris 3: not only do the objectives tend to resemble each other, but the locations in which our businesses will take place are very few, ending resulting in us repeating the same dungeons over and over again. Even worse, some of these missions will have a time limit to complete, after which we will find ourselves catapulted out of the dungeon on duty, which we will have to repeat all over again. The difficulty level is medium-low, so it's not a particularly frustrating activity, but simply boring and monotonous: the rewards translate into money, materials for our alchemical syntheses and new recipes. Naturally our raids can only be repeatedly interrupted by the canonical random fights: by adopting a visually very similar system to that of the excellent Ar Tonelico, Atelier Iris offers a traditional turn-based system in which our heroes exchange spells and special attacks increasingly bizarre and powerful with their enemies. The peculiarity of the battle-system, indeed rather dull, is the Burst Gauge which increases as you fight, and which once full guarantees a temporary bonus to the damage inflicted and to the attack speed. Naturally, the fulcrum of the game remains the object creation system, definitely improved compared to the previous chapters: in this episode, Iris will increase her alchemist talent with each craft, literally creating new recipes and combinations. More specifically, Iris will have an idea about an object, and we will have to complete the recipe with the necessary objects, which we will be able to identify using a special icon. The mechanism is extremely intuitive and functional, and allows a great variety of combinations and customizations of the various synthesizable items, from healing potions to actual equipment. Iris with meat sauce and cheese Technically Atelier Iris 3 is decidedly mediocre: Gust didn't squeeze too much, offering the usual combination of isometric locations and two-dimensional sprites. The quality of the various settings varies, but in general the various dungeons are quite colorful and pleasant. The sprites of the various characters enjoy a very limited amount of animations during explorations or interaction with the various non-player characters, but the situation changes drastically during fights: in this situation the various characters and hostile creatures enjoy large sprites dimensions, practically in high resolution, and rich in animations and details. The clashes are practically an explosion of colors and light effects, in which 2D and polygons merge above all for the visual rendering of the most devastating spells. As per tradition, however, there is no shortage of splendid artwork to view the various characters during the dialogues, which change slightly to highlight the mood of the interlocutors. In most cases, the dialogues are spoken: the dubbing, in English, is very good. The game is accompanied by a really pleasant and spot-on soundtrack, with a series of remarkable and atmospheric songs, especially during the battles or the most important narrative sequences. It is certainly not a masterpiece, indeed the ~old-gen~ feeling is felt a little too much which, however, for some games is still the best possible solution. Comment This third episode of Atelier Iris seems to come out of a time machine: in terms of concept and technical rendering it is almost certainly a period game, but it could not be unpleasant for this,mind you. Unfortunately, however, the repetitiveness of the gameplay is excessive right from the start, and the player is forced to retrace the same places defeating the same enemies for several hours, before proceeding in the main story of the game which, to be honest, is rather trivial, lacking among other things, the sparkling humor that distinguishes other similar productions (Ar Tonelico and the various Disgaea give the idea). However, the crafting system at the heart of the adventure is well done and fun, and the audiovisual accompaniment is suitable for the title, even if a greater effort in the graphic design outside the fights would have benefited a product that was perhaps a little too old-fashioned , suitable for those who have been fasting on JRPG for a long time. Pros Pleasant crafting system Simple and pleasant Cons Repetitive Technically too retro Trivial plot Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm is available for PlayStation 2. The ~Atelier~ series has been around for a long time: think that the first episode, Atelier Marie, was produced by Gust for PlayStation in 1998. In practice, the ~saga~ is ten years old now, and is fairly well known among fans of Japanese Role Playing Game. It has never been a series able to shine for its quality, but it has maintained over time those elements (pretty original in the past, but now abused) which have made it appreciated by a certain type of players, and which have influenced a a large part of the current RPG-istic landscape. The main feature of each Atelier has always been an internal ~crafting~ system, i.e. an option or a mini-game that allows you to produce potions, forge weapons and armor, and so on: the creation of the various objects is the fulcrum of the game, in fact allows us to customize our alter-egos and is an integral part of the narrative. In this sequel that's truer than ever, and after so many prequels Gust seems to have perfected the core of his series even further.", "date": "2007-12-19", "grade": null}
