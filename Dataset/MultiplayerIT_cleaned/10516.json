{"name": "Like a rolling Katamari", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/70594-katamari-forever-like-a-rolling-katamari.html", "text": "Released for the first time in 2004 on PlayStation 2, the Katamari series immediately amazed for a very original concept, for a very pleasant (at the time) technical sector, but above all for artistic choices, and consequently such a particular style and freak out that was rarely ever seen before. A five-year period has passed, the title has passed through mobile phones, PSP and Xbox 360 always with excellent results, but always evolving little, remaining too much the same. This time Namco Bandai with Katamari Forever returns to where it all began with a version that, despite suffering from chronic laziness in the technical sector, tries the nostalgia card with worlds that draw from previous releases and other unpublished ones thanks to the introduction of a new character. The forgetful monarch For those unfamiliar with the series, the game revolves, more correctly than ever, around the Prince who, due to a meteorite, has to rescue the King, helping him recover his memory. The memories of the monarch must be collected in his universe by exploring the many levels present by rolling a sort of ball that gradually gets bigger and bigger. Once the level is finished, if large enough or if specific objects have been collected, a star will be created, also making the King regain part of his memories. The game worlds have purely real settings, houses, squares, stations, shops, woods, zoos and much more. Everything you see on the screen can be collected, we start with small objects and as our Katamari gets bigger, anything, people, objects or animals can remain attached to our ball. The control method has remained unchanged, the two sticks make the protagonist move in all directions, while the jump, a novelty of this episode, very useful in the timed stages to reach the upper areas, can be performed by means of the non-reactive jolt of the pad or with the more comfortable L2 key. To expand the game offer, the Roboking character was introduced, a robotic version of the King designed in the wake of Go Nagai: the new levels, created for this episode, are found in this universe. Among the many available there is also one in which you have to give life to a parched planet, through the Katamari waterer instead of simply collecting things around. Both the two game plans, that of the King and that of the Robot, offer us diversified challenges, it is not enough only to reach a predefined quota of size of the Katamari, but we must also collect some objects rather than others, exploring in some cases meticulously the area of game to find some things hidden all too well. Another difference between the King's levels and those of Roboking lies in the fact that the former are inherited from the previous releases of the game, but for the occasion they are in black and white and only with rolling will they return to color, while those of the Robot are entirely new. The game is all here, but since there is no trace of an online mode apart from the online rankings, it is possible to play with a friend locally or cooperatively, managing a Katamari in pairs, an experience that requires a certain degree of harmony and in the funniest and most frantic challenge mode via vertical split screen. The aim is to accumulate more objects and at the same time drop those stuck on the opponent using the shot, aiming him using the L1 and R1 keys. In total there are about thirty levels to roam freely, and without a doubt it all works and the inclusion of some specific objectives only adds to the higher and more engaging challenge rate. Unfortunately, however, despite the fact that the game is very fun thanks to simple mechanics that become irresistible as the levels go by, it is impossible not to defer in the face of a technical sector that, although artistically sublime, cares about being current and in step with the times. Playstation 3 trophies Katamari Forever rewards the player with 33 trophies, 20 bronze, 12 between silver and gold and one platinum. Bronze trophies are unlocked rather easily as the game progresses, creating new planets or reaching a certain weight and size quota of the Katamari, unlocking all the levels of the universes, taking pictures, and so on. The more difficult ones are obtained, for example, by finding all the missing gifts and cousins around the levels, while the coveted platinum cup is awarded for having won all the previous trophies. Katamari in the sky with diamonds The style is what everyone knows, halfway between the insane and the lysergically exuberant, colorful and ramshackle, with an absolutely original and crazy character design that fits perfectly. Even the King's comments are no different,on the one hand flatters the player appreciating his progress, but at the same time tells him all the colors for the bad choice of objects and the size of the Katamari. Unfortunately, all this does not correspond to a worthy technical achievement. First of all, the pop up of the objects, scattered to be honest by the hundreds throughout the levels, is always present and the frame rate is not too stable despite a polygonal mass that is certainly not insurmountable, but above all the problem of camera management has not been solved . In fact, our Katamari disappears behind too large objects, making it impossible to control. It would have been enough to make the game world transparent when he is in a position to ~smash~ the protagonist, but this, except in rare cases in which a sort of porthole is formed that allows us to see, has not been done. In short, we are faced with a visually old game, which hides flaws and a certain poverty in terms of textures behind excellent and high-impact stylistic choices, but which unfortunately cannot fail to be noted in the review. Thumbs up for the inclusion of 1080p and for the various filters applicable to the images, such as the one to render everything in cel shading or similar to pencil coloring, a small plus which, if it does not completely refresh the cosmetics of the title, makes it certainly more enjoyable. The soundtrack then goes hand in hand with the inventive visual style: between new pieces and others from the previous chapters rearranged for the occasion, the sublime is touched thanks to an incredible mix of genres, with tracks that are all catchy and of great quality.", "date": "2009-09-18", "grade": "7.5"}
