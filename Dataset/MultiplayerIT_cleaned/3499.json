{"name": "eFootball PES 2020: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/efootball-pes-2020-recensione.html", "text": "Let's start the review of eFootball PES 2020 by recalling the admission of guilt we made a year ago: when Konami lost its Champions League license at the time, we were among those who gave the Japanese factory football game almost a goner under the hard blow inflicted by the competition. However, if the experience of twelve months ago has proved us wrong, the tones with which we are here today to talk about eFootball PES 2020 tell us that the Japanese company has confirmed that one of the unwritten rules of the world of football is that of not never for losers until the ninetieth (unless an own goal from Koulibaly arrives). Losing the important UEFA licenses represented for Konami the decisive push to be able to throw the heart over the obstacle, continuing to work on the evolution of the qualities expressed in recent years by PES, investing in parallel on other types of content for the historical simulation of soccer. The renewed impetus of the Pro Evolution Soccer series this year also passes from the word eFootball which makes up the full name of PES 2020, enhancing the intention of the Japanese team to (re) launch its effort even in the competitive world. Above all, however, for eFootball PES 2020 the time seems to have definitely come to take back the home environment and the games for two on the sofa or, given the times that are running, those played online with the same friends or other people scattered all over the world . Will it really be like this? Let's go find out together. All modes: from Matchday to Master League As per tradition, our critical analysis of eFootball PES 2020 starts from the amount of content made available by Konami this year. From this point of view, the only real novelty is represented by the Matchday mode, an online tournament linked to the real week cartel matches in which we will find ourselves during the 2019/2020 season. The Matchday structure provides for the choice of a team to support for the entire duration of the tournament with its victories, up to possibly playing the grand final broadcast in streaming within the same eFootball PES 2020. The rewards that we can get are they go to connect to the MyClub mode, thus also winking a little at Konami's response to the FIFA Ultimate Team. Matchday therefore represents a nice addition but certainly not a revolutionary modality, limited more than anything else to the interval defined by the restricted hours in which Konami has decided to open the doors of the competition: the evening hours are in fact excluded, thus bringing those who during the day is engaged in other activities to stay out at least for now. A choice of which we struggle to find the meaning, on which we hope that Konami will soon be able to review something. As for MyClub, in PES 2020 the basic structure remains almost identical to that of last year, thus making us start from the choice of a coach to whom to tie the module and the fate of our team initially composed of perfect strangers. In practice, there is only the addition of a summary screen of the individual players, which leaves the rest perfectly in line with what we already knew. On the other hand, the Master League brings with it a few more elements of novelty, within which Konami has tried to insert a bit of a narrative component in this edition, then smoothing out some historical defects linked to the negotiations and the evaluation of the players also through new configuration parameters. After the classic choice between a real team and a team with Master League players, in eFootball PES 2020 we are also called to choose the features of our coach, selectable from some models linked to legends of the past such as Diego Armando Maradona, Johan Cruijff, Ruud Gullit, Roberto Carlos and more. Starting from the very beginning, from time to time the coach is involved in some interlude scenes related to the definition of objectives or to particular questions in the press conference, thus trying to give a touch of personalization to the conduct of each single match in the Master League. After having aroused a natural interest at the beginning, these interlude phases gradually lose their charm, appearing rather embryonic even in the realization and raising doubts about their real effect within the locker room and society. The hope is that what now appears to us as something more disconnected from the rest can become a deeper component of the Master League in the future, which in any case confirms itself as one of the historical strengths of the Pro Evolution Soccer series. Excluding friendlies and various competitions, the only mode remaining in the list is Become a Legend, anthat she is an old acquaintance of fans of the series. In this case there's really nothing new to report, apart from a redesign in the interface that also affects the Master League itself and the entire game. But we'll talk about this calmly later, because the time has come to take the field. Gameplay: the essence of football After playing a few games of eFootball PES 2020, one cannot help but consider Konami's use of the claim ~the pitch is ours~. The impact with the match is quite remarkable right from the start, from which eFootball PES 2020 football appears as a reasoned activity, therefore similar to that of its predecessors, but enriched by a series of changes that improve what good seen previously and to fix the defects found up to the recent demo. Just to give an example, the feared excessive severity of the referees is just a memory: now the referees think once more before pulling out the cards, while their calls appear in 99.9% of the cases on time. However, what amazes most in the game dynamics of eFootball PES 2020 is the fluidity with which the action takes place, the result of the insertion of a series of connecting animations that give not only a renewed impact in aesthetic terms, but also practical ones. Of course, from time to time it still happens to see players impaled in their position without knowing what to do, especially when the ball is arriving unexpectedly in their area, but these are small moments of uncertainty that don't affect the quality of an impressive game system, strong in an almost perfect rhythm that encourages a reasoned football according to the dictates imposed by the real one. In fact, when kicking the ball it is necessary to keep in mind the position of the player with respect to it, especially if you want to attempt a pass or volley. In the absence of good coordination or a certain freedom of movement, in fact, there is the risk of sending the ball to the winds or worse still to the opponent, who is always attentive when controlled by the CPU (provided you select the highest levels of difficulty ). Even a stop can cause problems if the pass wasn't clean enough or the player receiving it was already in a less than optimal position. Speaking of artificial intelligence, the opposing teams try to attack in a fairly varied way without abusing particular patterns, while on a single level we can see the tendency of the most famous players to make their favorite movements. In eFootball PES 2020 the dynamics of the ball has been further perfected by the developers, who have been able to bring into the virtual game that quantity of unpredictability that distinguishes the real one: dirty touches, rebounds and other less clean plays lead the ball to make leaps and take strange effects, with everything that can be done achieve in terms of game situations. The ping-pong effect encountered in some cases in the past seems to be somewhat reduced, although not completely removed as some phases of prolonged confusion still continue to appear.Among the novelties of this 2020 edition of PES we also find the Finesse Dribbling, for which, as you know, Andrs Iniesta provided his advice. It is a precision control system linked to the use of both analog sticks, which can be used to perform special moves of various types with which to try to leave the opponent in place. The decision to link the two levers to Finesse Dribbling makes this dynamic a bit difficult to learn, considering that often you have to alternate the use of the right and left sometimes in opposite directions, executing everything with the right timing to complete the move wanted. Once you have learned a basic set of dribbling, you can still start making use of this dynamic, thus seeing the efforts made to learn how to jump the opponent with it rewarded. Finally, let's analyze the goalkeepers, who have also been one of the hottest topics in the series for a long time. The extreme defenders of eFootball PES 2020 perform their task very well, limiting uncertainties to a minimum, especially when they are between the posts. Feline leaps and seemingly impossible saves by the most skilled full backs are to be taken into account to avoid ending up with the scream of the goal stifled in the throat. On the other hand, less conviction as regards the outings, where the goalkeepers proved to be a bit too indecisive and slow, thus revealing themselves to the attacker's use of the lob. Playstation 4 trophies eFootball PES 2020 has a total of fifty PS4 Trophies, divided between the usual type Platinum, three Gold, therenfive Silver and forty-one Bronze. To conquer them all you have to work hard in all of the game modes, going in some cases instead to obtain particular results in the space of a single game. There is, for example, the goal which involves maintaining possession of the ball for 65% of the time of a match, or another linked to a comeback victory after going down by at least two goals. Graphics and sound: here is Juventus! The licenses of eFootball PES 2020 have now been talked about far and wide even within a special that we have dedicated to the teams and leagues present in it, so in this review we will avoid redoing the list from scratch. The point from which we want to start, however, concerns the introduction of Juventus exclusively within this title, relegating the competition to the use of the fictitious name Piemonte Calcio. As if that weren't enough, even the prestigious setting of the Allianz Stadium has become exclusive to Konami football. All this gives us an opportunity to detect the way in which eFootball PES 2020 has taken decisive steps forward also in terms of presentation and side dish of each game, squeezing the Fox Engine to the max to best represent everything before retiring it with the next generation. The price to pay for all this beauty consists in the loss in some cases (fortunately rare) in the number of frames per second, even on PlayStation 4 Pro (whose fans are very busy) where it had already been included since PES 2019 support for HDR technology on 4K resolution. Taking Juventus as an example, playing a match inside the Allianz Stadium cannot leave you indifferent: the attention paid to detail is in fact maximum both for the environment and for the players of the Old Lady, naturally taking advantage of the close agreement with the club . With the partnerships put in place with individual clubs, Konami was able to take Cristiano Ronaldo and literally bring him into the game, doing the same thing with Leo Messi and Barcelona. In fact, the agreements made by the Japanese company also concern other teams scattered around Europe, such as the Catalan team and Bayern Munich. However, we must not believe that the developers have limited themselves to the most famous footballers: by scrolling through the teams present in the game, in fact, it is possible to appreciate the presence of features similar to the real ones even for the lesser-known players, even within our Serie A. these are cases in which the faces may appear more inexpressive than others, but waiting to see what the competition will do from this point of view, there seems to be some more effort in eFootball PES 2020. We had previously mentioned the design of the menus, finally revised by Konami in eFootball PES 2020 after being loudly requested for years. The main screen is now divided into a few icons from which to select the various modes and options, on a predominantly purple background that could initially be annoying, but to which you get used to soon. In practical terms, navigability certainly gains in all areas, including the Master League where it is possible to have all the main information under control in a more effective way. We would have hoped to see a new design also for the match preparation screen, which however did not find space in this edition. We conclude the analysis of the technical sector with the part dedicated to the sound, characterized as usual by a soundtrack which pleasantly accompanies the permanence in the menus. The commentary in Italian is once again edited by Fabio Caressa and Luca Marchegiani. Same voices and same defects, for a situation that struggles to take off year after year: the sampled sentences are few and often out of the context of the game, thus resulting in these cases invented compared to what happens on the field. Shouts and introductions from Caressa continue to elicit the occasional smile, even if the way he sometimes dwells in his commentary inevitably ends up sounding fake when used for studio recording for a video game. A part that absolutely needs to be rejuvenated, at least by making it more attentive in reacting to what happens during the match. Rose update Before publishing this review, we reserved ourselves to verify the actual update of the eFootball PES 2020 squads by Konami. The package published this morning brings the teams present in the game in line with the conclusion of the transfer market, including the most important purchases and those of the last moment or almost such as Llorente (Napoli) and Mkhitaryan (Roma). Looking around the internet, however, there are reports of unreported transfers,", "date": "2019-09-12", "grade": "9.0"}
