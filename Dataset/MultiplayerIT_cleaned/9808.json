{"name": "The Incident", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/80473-the-incident-una-pioggia-di-sfiga.html", "text": "An anonymous little man dressed in a white shirt and a red tie is sitting quietly on the sidewalk, when a vase of flowers crashes to the ground, touching him by a few centimetres: shortly thereafter all kinds of objects begin to fall on him, and the unfortunate passer-by he is forced to dodge the dangers and climb the pile of debris that is forming to save his life. This is the curious premise of The Incident, title of the Big Bucket software house, at its first experience with gaming on the iPhone. Everybody on the ground The simplicity of The Incident's gameplay is nothing short of disarming: the user must avoid the pitfalls that come from above, heralded by a flash on the top of the screen which indicates the trajectory of falling objects. As these accumulate, the protagonist is forced to climb this mountain of stuff until he reaches a certain altitude, which is effectively the end of the stage. The playful quid of the game is so intuitive, that even the instructions about the control system are limited to a couple of icons that appear in the very first bars: it is therefore sufficient to tilt the iPhone to move left or right, while touching the screen it is possible to jump . That's all: The Incident is the most pick and play imaginable on the Apple platform, with all the pros and cons of the case. So let's not talk about a product rich in content, given that the package has exclusively 7 levels with progressive difficulty and duration, a trophy cabinet and that's it, all at the service of a gameplay that -as mentioned- is truly a bulwark of simplicity. It is therefore difficult to imagine that the Big Bucket title could remain in the playlist of iPhone owners for a long time, even considering the monotony that afflicts the gaming experience in the long run: however, The Incident undoubtedly has a particular charm and, taken in small doses, is able to give moments of genuine fun. Beyond the absurd variety of different objects falling from the sky (whose intentional inconsistency with the scenery reminded us of the exceptional Katamari Damacy), there are some interesting elements that make the protagonist's dramatic climb captivating: some balloons appear in randomly during the climb, bringing with it coins useful for gaining extra lives, helmets capable of guaranteeing momentary invulnerability and bonuses and maluses capable respectively of restoring or subtracting a unit from the on-screen character's energy indicator. Again, in the midst of the fall of potentially deadly things, diamonds are inserted from time to time to immediately earn a coveted 1-Up, the accumulation of which proves to be essential to face the more advanced stages. In fact, if the first levels are quite simple and can be completed in sessions of a few minutes, the more advanced ones constitute a truly remarkable challenge, both for the altitude at which the finish line is positioned and for the speed at which the objects fall one after another. the other. However, a great contribution to the appeal of The Incident is given by a deliberately stylized and pixelated graphic design which, together with a convincing chiptune soundtrack, gives the title a truly irresistible 8-bit look. The tasty sense of humor that permeates the Big Bucket production also involves the settings of the various stages: it starts from the sidewalk of a city and passes through skyscrapers, mountains and various layers of the atmosphere, to finally reach deep space where -obviously - objects keep falling...
