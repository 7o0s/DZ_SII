{"name": "Police 24/7", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/police-247.html", "text": "Established genre, interesting innovations Drawing inspiration from classics such as Virtua Cop and Time Crisis, Police 24/7 casts you into a Los Angeles where the police lead a bloody raid against the Chinese mafia, engaged in arms trafficking and responsible for the civil decay of the city. In the role of a talented policeman of oriental origins you will have to make your way through the mission in a classic subjective shooter, made up of reloads, sights and bad guys to be killed with a certain precision and within a certain time: defeat the enemies without getting hit and with precision and you will advance through the ranks by obtaining precious bonus time to complete the level by arresting the boss on duty; prevaricate, fall too many times or hit a civilian or a colleague and you will waste time risking it expiring before the end of the mission, forcing you to use one of the limited continuous available (or, in the room, another token). The peculiarity of Police 24/7, despite the classic nature of the game system, lies in the interface with the player, who can adjust the perspective and position of the game character with his real movement. Established genre, interesting innovations While in Time Crisis or in Virtua Cop the only alternative to getting a bullet in the head is to press and release a pedal that causes your videogame alter ego to be sheltered, in fact, in Police 24/7 you are offered the possibility of moving in real time in front of the screen and hide or reveal your character through your movement thanks to a camera sensitive to your movements. This peculiarity, which made the game an interesting pastime in the room, has been maintained on PS2 thanks to the compatibility with a USB camera which, suitably calibrated, correlates your movements to the perspective of the game with a certain precision (Konami recommends Omnivision, but no camera the viewfinder and view controls are assigned to the two analog controls of the pad). The game is also control compatible with a PS2-friendly mouse and most PS2 ray guns, as well as running on a regular Dual Shock 2. Playing with the pad, however, feels much more cumbersome and ultimately not very fun: for the gaming experience promised by this title it is practically mandatory to have a light gun. To use it, however, it is necessary to reserve another hand to control the pad to vary the perspective or to use it in conjunction with the camera; moreover, while in the arcade the ~realistic~ movement was pleasant, at home it is terribly difficult to have fun moving in front of a small camera like idiots for more than half an hour (without being able to control one's character with sufficient precision). Because of this particularity, anyone who wanted to make the most of this title should juggle between: a fairly expensive arcade completionist hypothesis (gun + camera) and moreover replaceable with a good 30-cent token in your favorite arcade; a rather annoying compromise hypothesis but capable of making you fully enjoy the game (pistol + pad); a decidedly disappointing minimalist hypothesis (pad only) which makes the use of the game more frustrating than anything else. Audio/Video: the characterization is pleasant, technically more could have been done The official site of the English policemen will be able to tell you that the game boasts ~exceptional realism~, but don't trust us: in terms of audiovisual Police 24/7 does not particularly shine compared to its counterparts in the genre or to the average PS2 title - even here it risks becoming seriously repetitive - though still enjoyable. Graphically it is without infamy and without praise: a fairly faithful aesthetic characterization of the environments and characters corresponds to a decidedly low number of polygons used and poorly defined textures. More could have been done, on a technical level, to enhance the work of capable artists, who were able to provide the title with the detective setting it promises. Even the animations are in the low average and appear very unrealistic: not infrequently one comes across the polygonal models of civilians to avoid who, like crazy, turn around in front of the camera showing off the best of their cubist look and their low-resolution texture mapping resolution, while the majority of the villains wear sunglasses (does it seem irrelevant to you? it's an old trick for a few polygons used!) and show off the usual absolutely unrealistic animation-clichswhether killed or disarmed. As far as the sound is concerned, however, the effects are excellent and the voices of enemies and civilians quite well matched, while the commentary between colleagues on cell phones that acts as an interlude between sections is quite suggestive and discreetly recited. Too bad about the music, practically only two main motifs that become extremely repetitive also by virtue of the fact that they are quite stereotyped in the type of atmosphere they provide (one the typical b-movie shooting tension, the other a terrible sense of Captain America ). However, it is an acceptable proposal for a title which, conceived for arcades, is satisfied with the strictly necessary functional for a frenetic action. As always, the arcade at home falters under the blows of repetitiveness Once you have decided which type of control to use, Police 24/7 offers a decidedly arcade game structure: the Main Story is divided into six sections and, once finished, it unlocks a second section set in Japan, justified in the plot as an international collaboration between police squads, plus an added bonus: the Japanese version of the game. In this original version, which turns out to be a pleasant addition as it includes mother tongue speech and with much more pleasant women's screams, we realize how the order of the sections is not only reversed (from Japan we pass to Los Angeles) but also completely changed in subsections. It is also understandable why the protagonist is a Japanese policeman: the programmers have simply changed the color of the texture mapping of the uniform, but not the polygonal model of the protagonist. Among the available modes we also find: Training, a very useful infinite time training in view of the main game; Challenge, in which you will be challenged to complete certain sections with a limited number of lives or time; and finally Extra Games, sub-games that consist in avoiding clusters of crazed kamikazes, in the typical target shooting, shooting bottles and destroying a large number of balloons before they touch the ground (and inexplicably nuke everything!). The game offer is therefore quite wide and equipped with a large number of options and difficulty levels, but fails to make up for the main defects of the game itself: the control system is original but cumbersome even when using a gun and the bullets fired by enemies are absurdly huge and slow moving through the air, destroying any sense of realism and fun. The programmers, who probably feared making the game too difficult by programming realistically fast projectiles, should have made enemies have a fluctuating aim rate rather than providing them with slow-motion shooting even on the highest difficulty level, where they are limited to hide and shoot faster as if they were hares. To make matters worse there is a terribly repetitive action: once you have unlocked the second section and finished the Japanese version there will be nothing left to do but store the cd forever except to watch the bonus end added by the programmers, play around with subgames or progressively improve your records, which the program estimates based on variables such as accuracy, speed, ability to remain unscathed and so on. The last perspective, however, is only valid if you use a ray gun: controlling the game with Dual Shock on the highest difficulty levels is a very demanding experience, definitely beyond the reach and patience of a user average or a non-enthusiast of the genre. Ultimately, Police 24/7 is a decent shooter, a pure arcade game that can be enjoyed to the fullest and in the long term by a fan of the genre and that most would prefer to rent or try before making decisions about the purchase. The type of control chosen is crucial, and also in this case the game appears more suitable for an enthusiast already equipped with a ray gun or inclined to buy it in view of other similar titles rather than the average player equipped with a regular pad. For all fans, Police 27/7 could prove to be a discreet and original alternative to the various Time Crisis and Silent Scope or even a toy waiting for Virtua Cop Rebirth, a compilation of the two classic Sega shooters expected for PS2 by the end of the year. For all the other players it would be an interesting title but with an extremely low longevity and a control system that could prove impractical if not equipped with adequate peripherals.Pros: Original within a consolidated genre Compatible with USB camera, mouse and gun Cons: Difficult control system Lack of realism Repetitive gameplay Longevity at historic lows Compatible with: Mouse USB camera Ray gun (recommended) Dual Shock 2 This shooter signed by Konami arrives on PS2 as a conversion of a fairly famous arcade title - Police 24/7, in fact - developed on System 16 Board and that in Japan and America has already known a sequel. It is a frenetic title and in some ways original but not without defects, including a cumbersome control system and its strictly arcade conception, which risks making it extremely repetitive. The audiovisual system does not contribute to raising a game offer that is no more than discreet, capable in any case of reserving good doses of fun for fans of the genre who want to pay specific attention to it.", "date": "2002-08-05", "grade": null}
