{"name": "Occhio al demone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/130890-demon-gaze-occhio-al-demone.html", "text": "That of the dungeon crawlers descended from Wizardry is a very particular and difficult genre to evaluate: we don't often see it on the shelves, it is played by a small niche of fans and has the bad habit of appearing much more simplistic than it really is. Some would say that first-person dungeon crawlers exist outside of our time, in a kind of nostalgic limbo alongside older players, but some recent offerings - such as the various Etrian Odyssey for Nintendo 3DS - have taught us not to underestimate the 'appeal that they can also have on a more casual audience. Demon Gaze, then, intrigued us from the beginning for another reason: it stood out for having sold very many copies in Japan, therefore the decision of NIS to want to localize it for the West, albeit with a year delay, it didn't surprise us at all. Once we downloaded the modest software and launched the game, however, we understood why Demon Gaze was so successful at home Demon Gaze is a very Japanese dungeon crawler... maybe even too much! You have something in your eye You know that clich, indeed a bit racist, according to which the Japanese are a bit perverted by nature? Well, Demon Gaze does absolutely nothing to debunk it and, if anything, confirms it even a little, if not in the artwork then in the actual dialogues, between sexy maids who sniff their housekeeper's panties and sexual allusions that have made us feel smiled less often than they rolled our eyes at us. A decidedly B-series localization does not help, in perhaps even too scholastic English which, yes, will also allow non-English speakers to understand the dialogues of the characters but will leave a bad taste in the mouth of those who know the Albion language well and will find to read somewhat childish dialogues. On the other hand, the characters are all represented as teenagers and the story doesn't have that epic tone: the protagonist, Oz, wakes up in a dungeon without knowing why he ended up there and is immediately rescued by a gang of bizarre characters who define him as a Demon Gazer: Oz can in fact imprison demons with his gaze, subjecting them to his will. Why he succeeds at the beginning we are not given to know, given that Demon Gaze exploits the typical amnesia expedient to infuse a minimum of mystery into an almost non-existent plot; the story of Demon Gaze, in fact, is decidedly ~character driven~, in the sense that it is the dialogues between the various main characters that stimulate the curiosity of the player, who will be able to deepen his knowledge of the various supporting actors between an exploration and the another in the Dragon Princess Inn, the inn that serves as headquarters for the group. The supporting characters, however, are not very many, and most of Oz's adventure companions will be randomly generated or conceived by the player himself through a simple editor that allows you to choose their class, race and the artwork that will represent them in the game. As in any good self-respecting dungeon crawler, party building, the distribution of bonus points earned at each level up and the choice of equipment are all crucial elements to take into great consideration if you want to complete the various dungeons. PSVita trophies Demon Gaze is giving away 41 trophies, divided into three gold, thirteen silver and twenty-four bronze, to which is added the coveted platinum. Unlocking some of them will not be difficult, since it will be enough to follow the story, while for others it will be necessary to work hard and explore every corner of the various dungeons. The devil in the flesh Unfortunately, the difficulty of Demon Gaze is balanced in a way that betrays the real depth of its gameplay: the first two dungeons run smoothly and a pinch of caution is enough to be able to abuse the automatic combat system while ~grinding~ the monsters and equipment. Demon Gaze is repetitive like any self-respecting dungeon crawler and the game itself invites you not to squander the money in the shops but to take advantage of the summoning circles that allow you to recover excellent objects from the monsters we have made to appear and defeated. Then, all of a sudden and without any warning, the battles become incredibly difficult and frustrating, forcing a very careful planning of the party and its formation. The power of Oz, then, is a double-edged sword: imprisoned demons can be summoned during battles to offer support to the team with their passive and active abilities, however they cannot be controlled and act alone, attacking enemies and helping the party at their complete discretion. Extremely strong, further enhanced by equipOz's behavior and the stats that the player has improved for him, demons must be kept carefully under control because, after taking a certain amount of damage, they will transform and attack our heroes, forcing us into a battle from which it is rare to emerge victorious. And Demon Gaze doesn't even deign us a game over screen, retro as it is: defeat sends us back to the main screen without too many ceremonies, sending all the time elapsed since the last save to the nettles. It is clear that these ruthless choices serve to fuel a climate of tension and anxiety in the player, forcing him to progress slowly in exploration and to plan every move, especially when the dungeons become more intricate and labyrinthine, between myriads of secret passages and traps. In short, it is clear that the developer Experience Inc. has placed more emphasis on the gameplay, but the eye also wants its part and from this point of view Demon Gaze has left us quite dumbfounded: the quality of the colorful high-resolution artwork is flawless, but the dungeons are made up of a handful of polygons and textures that would have disfigured on a PlayStation 2, while the fights - faced in first person, as per tradition - show us only the static sprites of the enemies, with decidedly special effects undertones that suggest the casting of spells and abilities. On the other hand, the sound accompaniment is discreet: the music is catchy and spot on, but tends to repeat itself a bit too much.", "date": "2014-04-19", "grade": "6.5"}
