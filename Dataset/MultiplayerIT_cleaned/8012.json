{"name": "Taito Milestones", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/taito-milestones-recensione.html", "text": "For some years now, the problem of the historical preservation of video games has been making itself particularly felt. This is a topic that also re-emerges in this review of Taito Milestones because in fact it invests operations of this type with an additional value of considerable importance. Beyond the nostalgic re-enactment, entirely dedicated to those who were already gamers in the 80s, these collections increasingly assume a historical-documentary value that goes beyond the single games offered, representing important solutions from the point of view of preservation. On the other hand, the nostalgics of these games are less and less than the mass of the current public, while the fact of being able to provide an effective method to access the titles of the past becomes an increasingly pressing problem with the passage of time . The question is very interesting and we have already examined it on other occasions, but we would like to reiterate how paradoxical it is that a medium that can be easily stored and re-proposed digitally without any loss of quality cannot instead be enjoyed easily, due to vetoes between manufacturers and publishers and the fundamental characteristic of being tied to a specific piece of hardware positioned at a particular moment in history. These reasons make old games practically inaccessible and prevent the historical preservation of these products, which represents a loss for everyone. although these are very partial selections, being in fact the only ways that allow a completely legal recovery of the software of the past. As we also did for SNK 40th Anniversary Collection, Konami Arcade Classics Anniversary and Capcom Arcade Stadium, beyond the quality of the individual games, which is difficult to evaluate nowadays, what matters most is the way in which the collection is curated and is presented and, on this aspect, Taito Milestones is quite basic even compared to the previous examples. 10 historical but not all iconic games Elevator Action, an image of the old classic Published in the West by Strictly Limited Games and Inin Games, the catalog of ten games in Taito Milestones could be particularly unknown for many Western users, although they are undoubtedly historical games for the company. Founded in 1953 in Tokyo, the Taito Corporation is known in our parts above all for Space Invaders, Arkanoid, Rainbow Islands, Darius, Bubble Bobble and Puzzle Bubble; perhaps the most passionate will also remember well Rastan Saga and Kiki KaiKai (Pocky & Rocky). Well, none of these titles is present in the collection, which instead offers for most of the games little known in the West, at least for a large part of the public. We do not know exactly what criterion Inin Games followed in the selection, if it had to deal with some objective limitations or wanted to highlight titles that have meant particular turning points in the history of Taito, representing in all respects milestones in the path of company, as the title of this collection says. We start from 1981 with Quix, which inaugurated the fashion of puzzle games in which you have to move a cursor to reveal the background without running into the various enemies on the screen, even if most of us remember above all the Gals Panic series, directly derived from this progenitor, who added the particular note of color of the risqu images to appear, rather than this serious initial title, which undoubtedly has the value of having been the first. Space Seeker, a scrolling shooter-style section From the same year also arrives Space Seeker, a bizarre multi-event shooter that offers classic scrolling shooter phases and others in 3D-like with a perspective from inside the ship's cockpit. From the year 1982 some will remember Alpine Ski, or a ski race with a top view, trying to collect bonuses and cover the greatest distance in a given time limit without colliding with obstacles, in addition to the shooters From Line and Wild Western. From 1983 the best known titles begin to emerge: Chack'n Pop is a platform that acts as a prototype for Bubble Bobble, already containing some of the characters and mechanics that will become famous with the next game, while Elevator Action is an arcade with platform elements and shooters that someone might have seen in action several years ago. The games still enjoyable are the most recent ones: The FairyLand Story, from 1985, is another platformer with elements reminiscent of a little Bubble Bobble and a little Rod Land that is quite pleasant in terms of gameplay and graphics, as well as the vertical scrolling shooter Halley's Comet from 1986, although still rather crude technically. The most refined is certainly The Ninja Warriors, from 1987: a scrolling action game that recalls the tradition of Shinobi, still quite pleasant even if obviously very basic. Assortment and emulation FairyLand Story, an image of the action platformer The choices made for the catalog therefore leave some perplexity: the games are very dated, obviously, but other than that they don't even seem to represent the best of the Taito offer, even from a historical point of view. Some titles are really too archaic to be enjoyed nowadays and their value can be recognized above all by those who already know them and can therefore satisfy the nostalgic desire to go back to them. Of the entire list, those that still offer enjoyable gameplay now are above all The FairyLand Story, Halley's Comet and The Ninja Warriors, three games that well represent the genres in which Taito excelled, while the others have value above all as historical curiosity but without even count on a strong bond with the memory of most users, at least in the West. Whether these are elementary experiences, seen through the eyes of today's users, it is obvious, since these are games from the early 80s, but it is difficult to understand why several titles of the Japanese label that could still be perfectly played by everyone have been excluded: the aforementioned Bubble Bobble, Rastan Saga, but also Darius, Rainbow Islands or Space Invaders himself. The NinjaWarriors, a screenshot of the scrolling action From the point of view of emulation, all the games present are based on the work done by Arcade Archives, which, moreover, has already proposed several of these titles individually on the Nintendo eShop. These are excellent technical solutions, which perhaps do not reach the levels seen by the reworkings of the M2, but which still manage to restore the original experience without many compromises and with different display options. The filters and graphic settings are few but functional, among which there is also the possibility of rotating the screen by 90 in order to exploit it in length, a solution that is always very welcome for arcades set up vertically. As for other modern technological solutions, there is the usual possibility of saving within the game and also excellent support for online rankings, ideal for titles of this type. The documentary operation Chack'n Pop is sort of an ancestor of Bubble Bobble, with some of the characters in common The packaging of this collection is also extremely basic: a fundamental element in evaluating this type of operation is precisely the care with which the game collections are elaborated and offered to the public and, from this point of view, Taito Milestones really does the bare minimum. Beyond the technical solutions adopted by Arcade Archives to make the titles work on Nintendo Switch while remaining as faithful as possible to the originals but also with modern additions such as graphic filters and online rankings, which generally succeeded very well, the publisher has practically no added nothing else to the gaming experience. All we are faced with is an initial selection screen with the ten titles and practically nothing else, without any initiative on the ~documentary~ front. There are no encyclopedias to deepen the knowledge of the games in question, as seen in several other previous collections, nor extras of any kind such as sketches, design documents or anything else. Even the manuals of the individual games are limited to icy screenshots made from scratch to give some minimum information on the controls and little else, completely missing the objective of stimulating the curiosity of newbies or satisfying the nostalgic taste of more experienced (and older) players . It's a real shame because these collections make sense largely thanks to these precautions and also because the quantity of games present, in this case, is not such as to compensate for a lack of attention to the surrounding elements.", "date": "2022-04-10", "grade": "5.8"}
