{"name": "Titan Attacks!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/146928-titan-attacks-invasori-spaziali-moderni.html", "text": "Space Invaders, Taito's shoot 'em up which has now become one of the founding myths not only of videogames, but of the entire collective imagination of contemporary society, is thirty-seven years old. In short, he is older than the vast majority of those reading this article. Although, for better or worse, between the original, clones, reissues, more or less everyone has played it and the appreciation remains unanimous, its simplicity today as we are used to games of a monstrous complexity not only on a technical level, would LAUGH. Or rather, the idea of taking its basic structure and using it to make a new game could be funny; not a clone, mind you, but a tribute, a tribute. And that as a tribute Titan Attacks! both really felt is undeniable, it shows. But does it still make sense, as far as we are in an indie environment, in 2015, to play Space Invaders? Puppy Games' heartfelt homage to the classic Space Invaders also arrives on Nintendo 3DS! Invasion in waves Compared to the strange formula, Titan Attacks! by default it doesn't change a comma. In the palm of our hands we find a 2D shooter with static screens, in which we control a tank that can only move sideways and shoot upwards. In fact, the invading aliens arrive from above, in waves, and precisely twenty waves for each world (but the twentieth of each world is a large spaceship, a boss, in short): there are five worlds, from the Earth up to to the motherland of extraterrestrials, Titania, for a grand total of one hundred levels. And these evil invaders too move laterally as they gradually approach the poor little tank which, who knows why, has remained humanity's last hope; and they shoot downwards, so that the heroic protagonist, in addition to trying to hit them, must also avoid the bullets of his opponents. An element that perhaps the memories and almost four decades of videogame evolution tend to diminish the concept of Space Invaders, but which instead remains fundamental and that Titan Attacks! recovers perfectly is the timing: the shooter remains frenetic, but the need to reload between one shot and another combined with the patterns of the antagonists makes pressing the button like a madman useless and harmful, instead you have to press at the right time and think almost like if we were in a rhythm game, except be careful of a sudden change of direction of the opposing faction, and change ~rhythm~ when switching to a different type of alien invader. And yes, because you will not find yourself facing a single type of ship for all one hundred levels, there are indeed numerous different categories, each with its own movements, dimensions, speed, volume of fire. And if this also happened in the father of all shooters, it is here that this tribute begins to differentiate itself, not only in the introduction of different categories (for example, flying saucers which stand very tall, are basically harmless but which, if hit, return a large points bonus), but also with nice details, such as the hit spacecraft which instead of exploding begins to fall towards the ground, and if hit again it still gives a substantial bonus, or the alien who manages to jump with a parachute before the his aircraft goes to pieces: he too, if eliminated, gives a bonus, but if let go, he inflicts a penalty instead, to the score and to the purse. The 3D effect Completely non-existent, as we said in the body of the article. Of course, it would have added absolutely nothing to the gameplay, and not even that much to the aesthetic factor as in all two-dimensional Nintendo 3DS titles, but we can't find any justification for its absence, which does nothing but further testify to a very time-saving conversion. 'rose water. Space money That's right, score and purse. Already in the scoring system, which is obvious in a game of this kind, there is a nice variation, that is to say a multiplier which increases, up to a maximum of nine, from performance to performance, and which resets instead every time we get hit; this encourages, also given the presence of online leaderboards, the competitive player to do well both from the point of view of attack and defense. But the real novelty, which adds a considerable strategic element, is the possibility of earning, together with the points, also money each time an enemy is eliminated. This money can then be spent between one level and another to buy upgrades, new smart bombs (those bonuses that, if used, eliminate almost all the alien scum on the screen), different weapons or greater firepower for those already in to be. The strategic element is expressed in the fact that it will be practically impossible in the course of a single playthrough being able to buy everything there is to buy and therefore we will have to carefully consider which path to take in our advances, just like in an RPG. This by virtue of two characteristics: the first is that the upgrades are arranged on various levels, with each of these unlocking as soon as the previous one is purchased, which is obviously more expensive. But above all, and the gimmick seems as good as it is bastard, between one level and another it is also possible to buy ~shields~, which would practically be the lives of the game: you will thus find yourself having to choose, unless you are too good enough to never be hit, between the enormous increase in firepower and the security of being able to be taken maybe once more without compromising the advance in the various stages. In short, a very intelligent system, aimed not only at introducing the aforementioned strategic element, but also at making the game more difficult and at stimulating replayability. And the game, in fact, would be difficult, even if not too long (there are 100 stages, but all rather short), if it weren't for the possibility, especially in the more advanced levels, of managing the smart bombs with a certain discretion, then always being able to buy them at the end of the wave; a sort of ~trick~ to play dirty and which can be avoided if desired, but perhaps more attention should have been paid in the design phase. There is also a very comfortable rescue system, perhaps it clashes with the spirit of yesteryear video games but we are still in 2015, and a hardcore mode that is unlocked once even the last cursed alien has been eliminated. What ultimately turns out to be an excellent tribute to the inspirer and at least a good game finally falls on two rather important elements. The first is the quality of the conversion - Titan Attacks! it was originally released about 3 years ago on Steam, and today it appears not only on Nintendo 3DS, but also on PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4. Well, the version for the two-screen laptop is decidedly the worst from a graphic point of view: it is true that the Nintendo 3DS screen is what it is, but all the brilliance and vibrancy of the pixel graphics of the other versions has been completely lost. We have seen much more graphically complex games on the Nintendo handheld (all in 2D around here) that are much, much, much more alive and bright. Not only that, because those decorative elements such as moving parts of the backdrop and so on have also been lost, and above all there is a fair amount of slowdowns, which never make everything unplayable, but sometimes know how to make themselves felt. Stereoscopic 3D is also completely absent, as you can read in the appropriate box: the amount of work that the processor has to carry out does not justify these shortcomings, which therefore can be attributed to a somewhat lazy conversion work. From the sound point of view, however, the basic material wasn't much of its own already: very anonymous techno tunes, average effects but which at least know how to create a discreet shooter atmosphere. The other element that negatively affects the final evaluation is the price: 10 Euros on average in the eShop are not low, especially if they are used to digitally take home a product that offers a lot of fun and a fair amount of variety, but which remains niche, and with such a high price it risks adding itself a further obstacle towards its own success.", "date": "2015-03-18", "grade": "6.5"}
