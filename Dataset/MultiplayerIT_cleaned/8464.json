And Quantum Conundrum will let you breathe the same atmosphere, proposing sequences of rooms where you can rack your brains to reach the exit, playing with the laws of physics, while a voice from the intercom will guide you and tease you at the same time. The result is a title sold at a bargain price, not as perfect as Valve's offer but fun, challenging and rewarding. The size where the socks go! In Quantum Conundrum you take on the role of Professor Fitz Quadwrangle's very young nephew, and you have to try to save the scientist, who was trapped in an alternative dimension (the one where our mismatched socks end up!) during his experiments. Thus you find yourself in his bizarre mansion, made up of long corridors that lead to huge rooms where increasingly complex experiments await to be completed. The professor's voice keeps you company with nice comments about his life, about the strange things that are happening to him in the dimension where he is stuck and sometimes he even gives clues to guide you towards the solution. At the beginning of the game, a powerful tool called IDS is made available, a glove capable of activating and deactivating four different dimensions in an instant, thus bending the laws of physics. Introduced gradually, the powers of the glove modify the environment and the elements around the player who can only interact with objects by lifting and moving them, for example to activate a platform rather than to create a rise or a bridge. In the ~Fluffy~ dimension everything will become light with safes that will transform into cushions and sofas that will become very light, therefore easy to move. Opposite is the ~Heavy~ dimension, where a cardboard box will become covered in metal plates and cannot be lifted or moved, but will gain enough mass to activate the weight sensitive platforms. Later in the game you will come into contact with the time dimension, which allows time to be slowed down drastically, while the latter will reverse gravity so that objects in the scenery ~fall~ upwards. Good with the mind and quick with reflexes The title has proved to be able to propose interesting and not at all obvious ideas that also exploit all four dimensions in combination, which are activated in a very few moments but always and only one at a time. Initially thanks to very elementary puzzles, the player has plenty of time to become familiar with the game mechanics and a well-studied and accessible learning curve. A typical application example saw us make a safe lightweight, throw it into the void, slow down time and jump on it to cross a chasm. If this seems simple to you, think that things get complicated very soon and so maybe you will have to throw more objects into the void. And while they are suspended in the air thanks to slowed time, go back to the light dimension to catch a box, move it further, go back to the slowed time dimension, jump on it, reverse gravity to recover height and so on. The same powers are not all available immediately, but must be activated by finding the batteries to be inserted in the special device. This, just to complicate things further, sometimes does not have all four slots free, so as to require studying not only which dimension to activate, but also in what order. Quantum Conundrum requires not only mental effort, but also quick reflexes by focusing on a strong platform component. So, once you find the solution, you are often only halfway there, because then you also have to be able to put it into practice and this is an equivalent if not even more demanding challenge. On the one hand, this helps to make the experience more personal and interesting, but at the same time it somewhat ruins the satisfaction given by guessing the solution to the puzzle. Then a certain frustration arises due to a not particularly accurate calibration of the jump, often difficult to dose. The developers, choosing to also push on the platform side, in our opinion should have been concerned with making the movements more precise and rigorous. On the contrary, we often have the impression that we are not completely in control of our alter ego. Apart from this, the experience remains satisfying and for the approximately six to seven hours that it will keep you busy it manages to entertain, also thanks to the sympathy of the characters, including the curious and adorable little creature called IKE, a sort of green teddy bear with ears at puntta who seems to live between the various dimensions, fond of the professor, with whom he has lived for some time now. Don't call it Portal Although they belong to the same genre, i.e. first-person puzzle games, the use of the four dimensions and the strong emphasis placed on the platform component distances Quantum Conundrum from Portal. At the same time, however, playing the Airtight title we have sometimes felt the lack of the obsessive care that Valve places in its productions. In particular, Kim Swift's work would have benefited from greater attention in the testing phase to refine the jump phases, the reaction to the physical laws of the objects in the scenario and to remove some small marginal bugs. Furthermore, they would have noticed that it is not necessary for us to hear the same sentence from Professor Quadwrangle after each death; the tenth time the message has more than reached us! The same goes for the technical sector, which offers an Unreal Engine made unrecognizable by the cartoon-style look. Although functional and clean, it tires too soon due to a certain monotony, with corridors that all end up looking alike and identical objects repeated dozens and dozens of times. Being a product at a budget price and strongly focused on gameplay, it remains a rather marginal aspect, but we have seen indie titles present themselves as real small works of art; with a little more initiative, Quantum Conundrum could have stood out even at this juncture. Finally, we mention the absence of settings dedicated to the graphics sector, except for the resolution, only in a 16:9 ratio, and the native support for the 360 pad, complete with on-screen buttons that will change the icon at the same time. As for the sound sector, the interpretation of John de Lancie, famous for having played the role of Q in various Star Trek series, stands out mainly, while the music will remain in the distant background.", "date": "2012-06-29", "grade": "8.0"}
