{"name": "Grotto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grotto-recensione.html", "text": "Approaching a title like Grotto means letting yourself be transported to a distant time, where diviners and ancestral tribes shared a fertile and primeval land. Among stars, bones and trajectories of reason, we have completed the mystical journey and are ready to have our say in this review of Grotto. Focus everything on storytelling Grotto: divinatory processes capable of changing the fate of the narrative The events of Grotto place us in the role of a fortune teller who lives in a cave near a village. Our task is to advise the inhabitants of the latter, the Brutes, a primitive and warlike tribe. Through our choices, represented by the constellations that we think are best suited to the situation, we will influence the course of events that concern this people and its evolution over time. On paper, the possible ramifications are many, but the fact that the characters often implement a process of interpretation (since we limit ourselves to handing them a symbol, without uttering a word), often pushes them in specific and irreversible directions, giving the player minimal control over the course of events. It must also be said, however, that the intent of the developers (the small Brainwash Gang team) seems to be to tell a story of misunderstandings, full of induced and suggested decisions. Which does not lead to being too critical of excessively forced plot twists, while not totally justifying them. In general, the story told is interesting, even if it is difficult to empathize with the various characters presented, both for an overly conventional characterization and for the little space given to each one, insufficient for a convincing development. In fact, the game lasts just over four hours. We would like to be able to say that the level of replay value is high due to the different ramifications of the narrative. However, at least as far as we are concerned, having reached the end of one's game, there is not that push that justifies replaying the title several times to see how the story could have evolved differently. A crossroads of idioms Grotto: knowledge of the English language is essential to appreciate the experience We have to specify that the game is completely in English. So, since it's an adventure that focuses entirely on storytelling, we advise you to approach it only if you have a good command of the language. Also because the one used is not scholastic English, but rather a mixture of dialects and variants, ranging from the Shakespearean tradition to the South-East American descent. It is an interesting way to differentiate the origin of the characters, but it is often out of place, more more suitable for a game like The Wolf Among Us than for a title in fact devoid of precise temporal references, but still immersed in a decidedly primordial atmosphere, where contemporary American (but also British) jargon clashes. It seems a choice linked more to the potential appreciation of the title by a wider and more varied audience than an actual decision linked to the world that the team intended to bring to the screen. A contained gameplay Grotto: playing with the stars, forming constellations In terms of gameplay, Grotto offers little or nothing for those who approach it with the intention of finding particularly complex action or interactions. The game, in first person, is entirely set in the shaman's cave; it is not possible to go beyond the borders of the latter. Every day, some characters will come to visit us in search of answers of little importance at first, but then more and more demanding, linked to the territory of morality. Our task is to look at the stars from a large hole in the rock and build significant constellations (by joining the dots in full ~puzzle week~ style). As you progress in the adventure, you unlock other objects that can help us in our decisions which, however, are not absolutely essential for the completion of the adventure, but more of the cute ~embellishments~, but actually only side dishes. Grotto: the wall from which to quickly ~take~ a constellation Once we have chosen the constellation that we consider most suitable, we must ~deliver~ it to the interlocutor, who will deduce what he deems most appropriate. Once you have listened to all the characters, you have to lie down in the tent and wait for the next day, during which the same process will be repeated. This is what you can expect from Grotto on a purely playful level. To be a narrative adventure, it's not too sparse as a proposal either. However, the problem arises when a mechanic like that of discoveryof the constellations is too often given by chance. In fact, it is enough to unite all the stars and then eliminate their connections one by one to discover new combinations, which will be automatically saved on the wall behind us, from which we can draw quickly, without having to go again to consult the celestial body. So, ultimately, even the main mechanics of the title (just like the choices forced by the narrative) are an end in themselves, deprived of real importance and relegated to mechanical use only. The charm of the audiovisual Grotto: if you like the genre, stylistically the game is exceptional The true heart of Grotto undoubtedly lies in the audiovisual sector. With a careful and isolated use of color, which stands out against a completely black environment, the three-dimensional cel-shaded space and the two-dimensional characters with a cartoonish and decidedly inspired style create an extremely suggestive overall scene, capable of capturing much more than the story narrated. This is also thanks to a truly excellent soundtrack, punctuated by a hypnotic soundtrack and an ingenious use of percussions with a primordial flavor that replace the lines of dialogue. Precisely in these small details (like the clear reflections of the cave in the puddles at earth) Grotto finds its expressive strength. But we are well aware that a single element is not able to revive a lame project on several fronts, even if its objectives and related results are not excessively broad and ramified on several fronts.", "date": "2021-11-02", "grade": "6.5"}
