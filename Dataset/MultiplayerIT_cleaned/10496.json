The problem is landing on the ground that can turn even the most trained disco macho into meatballs, without however preventing him from putting on jelly during the flight because otherwise he won't be admitted to the Big Brother auditions. AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity (from now on Aaaaa because if we write two more times the full title ends the space of the article) fills a deep gap in the world of video games that blocked the respiratory tract with anger to fans of launching from skyscrapers (perhaps because they all die and have never managed to create a consistent market niche...). For example, Moioli, who continues to throw himself from the window of the Multiplayer.it warehouse, was waiting for nothing else (for the record, let's say that the warehouse is on the ground floor). The Aaaaa concept is very simple: you have to jump into the void and land on a platform by opening the parachute at the right time. Between saying and doing there is the danger of crashing into some building or some suspended platform. The challenge consists not only in being able to hit the landing point, but also in accumulating the highest number of points by skimming the buildings, collecting bonus tiles or coloring the buildings on the fly with a spray can. Don't be scared by the apparent simplicity of the whole, Aaaaa is a more intricate game than it seems, above all to get the maximum evaluation in all the levels (about eighty) unlockable from a three-dimensional grid, and also causes a certain addictive when you get used to the game mechanics, i.e. from about the second game onwards. AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAAA!!! One of the most successful elements of Aaaaa is the audiovisual one. Not having futuristic graphics engines and unlimited resources, Dejobaan Games, already responsible for the crazy The Wonderful End of the World, has chosen to bet everything on style and has created a series of levels characterized by simple and stylized shapes, suspended in a space void without horizon, and geometric effects that seem to come out of an abstract painting from the 60s-70s. There is no shortage of impromptu moments such as the relaxation levels, in which you don't have to do anything except relax by looking at lysergic images accompanied by a soundtrack made up of ambient sounds and voices that talk about topics that are totally out of context. The general impression is that of being in a digital world in the throes of orderly chaos in which he won anarchy, in controversy with the linearity of the development of the medium itself, and in which it is possible to find, in addition to the game, pieces of the life of the developers who create an inhomogeneous but compact amalgam. From all this derives the idea that whoever created it had a lot of fun doing it, trying to insert as many audiovisual ideas as possible, almost as if he were creating a video art work connected to a playful concept. The result is an exciting title in purely humorous terms, closer to what the videogames of the early days were, free from the chains of verisimilitude and, above all, a tool for exploring creative and original game mechanics designed in fantastic spaces far from the pretended current hyperrealism. In a certain sense Aaaaa is beautiful because it is liberating, a splendid escape with a liberating scream from the canons that dominate the gaming industry by imposing times and tastes on gamers.", "date": "2009-10-02", "grade": "8.0"}
