However, with Ninja Senki DX they perhaps went a little further: in reality the title was already released in 2010 but to celebrate the fifth anniversary and the arrival of the game on the fixed console and portable PlayStation, Jonathan Lavigne (creator of Ninka Senki and co-founder of Tribute Games), has taken back his purple ninja with a few tweaks here and there. Let's find out all of them in this review! On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the game, Ninja Senki arrives on consoles in a deluxe version On the previous episodes... For those who have not played the original title and do not really know what to expect from Ninja Senki DX, we can mention a slightly more famous game to make you understand better: Does Mega Man tell you anything? Ninja Senki DX is an old-school 2D jump-and-shoot platformer. The story revolves around the revenge of Hayate, the protagonist, in search of justice after the departure of the beloved princess Kinuhime, vaporized in the first three seconds of the game. This is where the adventure of the young ninja starts: on the game screen we will see the life bar, made up of three 5 balls (each hit is a lost ball of course), score, stopwatch with countdown, number of coins collected and enemies to defeat for each area. Within the levels, 16 in total, some checkpoints are located and every two stages you will meet a boss to beat. Hayate can leap higher than normal by holding down the jump key or get to a double jump with a double pressure, being a ninja then there is a shower of shurikens, the only weapon at our disposal; no upgrades, bonus weapons or costumes will be granted during the game, the game starts and ends in the exact same way. Small exception are the lives available to us: we start with two lives (three attempts in total) and additional ones can only be earned through the score, which will grow based on the coins collected and the enemies killed, provided that you have all the HP points full; otherwise the life points will be regenerated and you will lose the extra 1-up. The commands on PC are not very convincing: to move left and right in the scenarios, the use of A and D is foreseen but to shoot and jump, J and K are used respectively, a key solution that is too close and which can put the player in serious difficulty player during the most excited moments. In any case, the game also supports console pad commands, a solution we adopted for our test (in particular using an Xbox 360 pad). The feedback, on the other hand, is excellent, the game is fast, sometimes frenetic but never confused, Hayate is very fast in throwing shurikens but freezes completely for a few seconds after being hit by an enemy (even making a very small jump back ... and in case you're near a precipice... well, you get the idea). Old game, new ways The game therefore does not differ at all from a classic 8-bit for NES, with all the strengths and weaknesses that derive from a choice of this type: the artistic sector is obvious but not trivial, given that each level has a color palette capable to enhance the character of the stage and even the enemies, inspired by Japanese folklore, are extremely successful. The level scheme is solid and well studied, indeed in some cases too much since from the very first level it is possible to run into enemies hidden in blind corners of the screen or fall miserably from a ledge if the distances of the jumps are miscalculated. In this sense Ninja Senki DX is a very punitive game and absolutely not suitable for players with little patience; the additions made in the anniversary version, then, further raise the bar even if taking it very comfortably, the game is completed in just over an hour. If this was the base game, what has been added in this DX version? First of all a totally rearranged soundtrack for the occasion, which we particularly appreciated, as well as other and much more substantial innovations. In addition to three different endings, the classic and hardcore modes, in which there are no intermediate checkpoints in the levels and the possibility of continuing penalizes the player's score, there is an unprecedented Challenge mode, in which we will have to finish the sixteen levels of the game by facing new challenges but with less time available, and two secret modes. For the purpose of the review it is necessary to inform the readers of what it is about but if you don't want spoilers, jump directly to the comment! Two o'clockhe secret modes are called Boss Rush and Ronin: the first is a ~speed run~ of all the bosses in the game while the second will allow you to replay the main adventure but with a new character, a Ronin, equipped with a very fast katana.", "date": "2016-03-04", "grade": "7.5"}
