{"name": "Felici ma non troppo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155585-happy-wheels-felici-ma-non-troppo.html", "text": "Happy Wheels shares the fate of many browser games that land on the mobile market, rightly considered a land full of opportunities. Success stories in this sense abound, there are small development teams that have become rich thanks to a happy intuition and we don't see why the same shouldn't happen to Jim Bonacci and his fascinating, sadistic creature. It certainly isn't an easy task to bring a platform so full of gore to the App Store, in which one false step is enough for the protagonist to end up impaled on spikes, torn to pieces by rotating blades, crushed by mobile platforms or lose your feet following a hard landing, all underlined by large doses of blood. This is why the iOS version of the game currently includes only the first of many characters seen in the original, namely the ~Business Guy~, a white collar who tackles the levels aboard a Segway. The author wanted to understand if his title would pass Apple's strict restrictions before loading it with content, which on browsers see the presence of six protagonists and situations bordering on politically correct: an ~irresponsible father~ with a little son in tow, an old man in a wheelchair, a shopaholic, a motorized couple and a guy with a pogo stick; all inevitably destined to fall apart due to the ~trial & error~ nature of the game, which concedes very little to those who are not accustomed to the challenge. Happy Wheels is an ugly game to look at but solid and challenging, a pity for the few initial contents I'll break you! Happy Wheels, as mentioned, is a title in which our goal is to overcome a series of obstacles to reach the end of the levels. The initial offer, with the Business Guy, provides for a campaign made up of fifteen short internships, which will be followed by those of the other characters mentioned above. Each mission plays with platforming elements to have us calculate the times, make jumps, balance the weight on the Segway and avoid dangerous traps until the finish line is crossed. The design boasts a fair amount of variety, as you go from standard platforms to rebound mechanisms, to then transit over cyclically disappearing bridges and activate switches to open passages. A timer accompanies our performance from the point of view of a leaderboard, but it is the ~trial & error~ that rules it and it often happens that we have to restart the level because perhaps we have ended up in a ditch from which it is impossible to get out, even without the appearance of game over. The action is accompanied in some situations by small advertising banners and videos that can be deactivated via in-app purchase, but which do not represent a serious nuisance with respect to the use of the experience. The package even includes a simple editor for creating stages, but the possibility of sharing them in a structural way, complete with a browser, will also come with a future update. What is unlikely to change, however, is the graphics, particularly spartan, amateur-style, in some cases so much that they make your eyes bleed (to stay on topic), accompanied by extremely generic music. It is fortunate that the technical sector in a product like Happy Wheels counts for practically zero, but a greater commitment in this sense would have been appreciable in any case.", "date": "2015-09-05", "grade": "7.0"}
