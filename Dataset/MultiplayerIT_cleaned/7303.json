Worth the ulcer, it must be said that in the Inazuma Eleven universe football is tolerated much better, also because its characters venerate it to say the least and the matches are a metaphor for teamwork and the importance of friendship. In reality, already in our review of Inazuma Eleven 3 we had complained of a certain tiredness in the context of a franchise that has renewed very little, proceeding with lead feet as regards news and updates. That's why the choice to re-propose the very first Inazuma Eleven on the eShop seemed decidedly questionable to us: will this title from... 2008 have aged well or not? Nintendo offers the re-release of the very first Inazuma Eleven with really bad timing 1, 2, 3... star! Let's be clear for a moment, because at this point we too have begun to get confused. Inazuma Eleven comes out, yes, in 2008, but in Japan and on Nintendo DS. In Europe it was only released in 2011, again on the Nintendo DS. Since then, we Europeans have been able to appreciate almost all Inazuma Eleven following the chronological order, albeit with a lot of delay and some discrepancies: we played the second episode in its double version on Nintendo DS, but the third episode in three parallel versions we have played on Nintendo 3DS. In reality, the three Inazuma Eleven 3 that arrived on Nintendo 3DS were the ones that were offered in Japan in a single compilation for Nintendo 3DS entitled Inazuma Eleven 1-2-3: Endou Mamoru Densetsu and which included, see a while, the first three episodes of the series in a slightly improved version for the new Nintendo portable console with the addition of the stereoscopic effect and some graphic elements. In all of this, North America has been left dry for six years. Today Nintendo has finally decided to test the waters, proposing the first Inazuma Eleven in its version for Nintendo 3DS belonging to the Inazuma Eleven 1-2-3: Endou Mamoru Densetsu package on the American eShop; for good measure, Nintendo has also shot the same proposal in Europe, if only because the original Inazuma Eleven for Nintendo DS from 2011 is now almost unobtainable. This means that, excluding the sequels developed specifically for Nintendo 3DS, only Inazuma Eleven 2 in its version Inazuma Eleven 1-2-3: Endou Mamoru Densetsu is missing. All clear? Well! Because it is true that this Inazuma Eleven is a port for Nintendo 3DS, but it is important to specify that the additions, in terms of content, are practically non-existent. It is the same game from 2011, for which a practically invisible stereoscopic effect has been implemented and little else and which, therefore, suffers from the technical old age that characterizes a title with six years on its shoulders and which already at the time didn't exactly make people cry for a miracle . The 3D effect So light and sketchy that we highly recommend turning it off - you won't miss a thing and save on console battery. Old wine...? In Inazuma Eleven you will find the usual mix of two-dimensional sprites and polygonal locations with an isometric view during the exploration phases, which alternate with polygonal kinematics representing the ~clashes~ on the soccer field: the latter are certainly well done, even if a bit rough when compared to the more recent Inazuma Eleven 3, and they are a good counterpoint to the general visual poverty that characterizes the rest of the game. Other choices in the porting phase leave a bit perplexing, in truth, such as for example that of updating some portraits and others not, but they are details that only veterans of the series will notice. For them, the purchase of Inazuma Eleven is practically useless, especially if they have already played it or maybe still own the original cartridge. For all those who don't know the Level-5 series, however, the matter is different and more complicated. First of all, what must be considered is that the series has improved over time thanks to refinements and features that have made the experience more pleasant and rich: just think of the multiple versions of the second and third chapters and the hundreds of characters that we can recruit in both. Which means that Inazuma Eleven is the most basic iteration of the franchise, even antiquated in some respects, with choiceswhich at the time did not fully convince the players and which in fact were lightened or removed altogether, such as that of ~forced~ matches. For the rest, you always play the same way: when the ~fights~ take place, you check the members of our football team on the lower screen with a touch of the stylus and select the actions and skills as needed each time they interact with their opponents. In short, under the patina of a football title there is absolutely an RPG, and this is evident in the importance relegated to the narration, the dialogues and the characterization of the characters, starting with that of the protagonist Mark Evans. New fans may want to start from this Inazuma Eleven, or even just play it after Ogre Attack!, precisely because it delves into the main characters and tells how they met and how they became the team of professional players who faced aliens and time travelers . Those who prefer to concentrate on the gameplay and maybe googling character sheets, would do well to get the latest Inazuma Eleven 3 or wait for the sequels for Nintendo 3DS, when - and if! - they will also come to us.", "date": "2014-02-19", "grade": "6.8"}
