Most users still played on the 486 and the game came packaged on no less than two CDs that made the player whir around like a rolling airplane. It was the golden age of point-and-click adventures, when our screens were about to welcome the third Monkey Island and we had just finished playing the last chapter of Space Quest. Broken Sword fit naturally into this panorama, giving us graphics, created by Don Bluth's Studios, which were able to return truly unforgettable settings, one above all the famous exterior of the Parisian caf that begins the events narrated by the game. However, the iPhone version is the Director's Cut which was originally released for Wii and DS a few months ago and which inserts, compared to the original game, the possibility of managing Nico, the beautiful French journalist who acts as a supporting character for George Stobbart, as a playable character. In fact, the game begins with her, grappling with the events that will then lead to the explosion of the Bistro by the clown-terrorist. It is therefore made possible for us to explore some of the narrative backgrounds that had remained obscure before this version, thus making a certain added value for those who want to dive back into the enigmas of a title that, together with others, made school in its genre. He looked at me like I'd farted at a funeral One of the most noteworthy novelties of Broken Sword: The Secret of the Templars - Director's Cut is the translation of texts and dialogues completely into Italian. In addition to the addition of scenarios and narrative parts that enrich the gaming experience, it's really a pleasure to be able to listen to Nico's voice with his marked French accent, as well as that of the protagonists and supporting actors. The graphics have also undergone a review, thanks to the work of the comic book artist Dave Gibbons who has lent his work for the processing of the additional scenes, most of which see the aforementioned Nico as the protagonist. Of course, those who were fond of the features of the classic game could be a little taken aback at first, but we must admit that the fine work that has been done to the game makes it truly a sensation on the small and brilliant screen of the iPhone/iPod Touch of visual pleasantness that one cannot fail to appreciate. Thus we venture around the world, following in the footsteps of clowns and templars, between mimes and political intrigues, all in a sumptuous salad seasoned with humor and sarcasm that always know how to make us smile and increase the degree of involvement with the characters and their stories. Buy skewer, buy skewer! Very yummy! The game, on iPhone/iPod Touch, is completely manageable with the simple push of a finger. And if it is true that the Apple platforms lend themselves in an absolutely natural way to welcome the point and click genre, it must also be said that with this game in particular Revolution has managed to carry out its task very well. Just tap on the screen in the chosen points to easily move Nico or George and to make things even easier, just hold down your finger on the screen for a few moments so that all the points of interest with which we can initiate interactions. The system works quite well, even if with some uncertainty: sometimes it is in fact necessary to repeat the ~tap~ because the chosen interaction, whether it is observation or action (distinguished by an icon in the shape of an eye or gears) is actually implemented. In particular, it can happen that you have difficulties when there are several interactions available very close to each other, especially if you have fingertips that are not exactly those of a pianist. Some difficulties are also encountered in the event that an object has to be taken out of our inventory to use it with something on the screen: the operation is not always very simple and it may happen that we have to make more than one attempt. On the other hand, the dialogue system is very successful: the possible choices are represented by small icons at the top of the screen that represent the theme on which you want to question our interlocutor. The cross and delight of the game are the riddles and puzzles that we will find ourselves having to solve along the way. Some are really difficult and could even become a little frustrating, at least for the less accustomed to the genre. But an aid system, which can be consulted at any time, comes to the rescue both in the event that we find ourselves stuck withoutza know how to proceed, or in case you fail to solve one of the specific puzzles. It is therefore impossible to get stuck regretting not being able to go on until the end of the story. The tested version is 1.1 App Store links", "date": "2010-02-24", "grade": "8.4"}
