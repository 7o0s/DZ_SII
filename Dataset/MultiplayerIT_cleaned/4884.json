We work on the story mode, on the characters, there are more technical titles like Street Fighter and other more caciaroni like the upcoming Injustice 2, but trying to offer something really new never seems to be the developers' zenith. The most ~original~ thing seen in recent years is probably the work of Nintendo, with that Smash Bros which has put the clashes between multiple players under the magnifying glass. Yet it was always the same formula: beat your opponent until his energy is zero and then finish him off. Even the independent universe, known for flights of fancy, hasn't moved much from the heart of the genre and despite having packaged titles of absolute value, the push that made us take our hats off in the face of a brilliant idea has always been lacking. A few years ago Lethal League then arrived to make us renege on what has been said up to now with a revolutionary and surprisingly fun formula. However, the commercial success of the game was not amazing but the developers of the Reptile team did not give up and this year they try to bring their creature back to the new generation consoles. Obviously we didn't miss the chance to play it again and today we explain why, if you love fighting games, this title could tickle your palate. Lethal League: many beautiful ideas in a different fighting game than usual, but devoid of modalities and contents Welcome back mortal league! Lethal League is a niche product, born from an idea developed in flash and then evolved to reach the major digital distribution platforms. The original idea we mentioned earlier lies precisely in the gameplay and in the moves available to your characters, who will not now be limited to kicking, punching and throwing energy balls but will fight each other with baseballs. You got it right, to knock out your opponent the only thing you have to do is overcome his defenses and hit him with the ball. You can hit the ball with any weapon available to the extravagant heroes present: a skateboard for example, or a walking stick or even use the tail like Latch does, a huge humanoid crocodile. The aim of the game is to bounce the ball towards your opponent and the more rallies you manage to make, the more complex and faster things will become, with the ball going to even exceed 100 miles per hour, forcing you to an impressive speed of execution . Lethal League thus becomes a very strategic game, based on reflexes but also on intelligence, on correct positioning in restricted arenas and on the unpredictability of moves which, just as if you were in a modern Pong, will also allow you to direct the ball diagonal to exploit improbable rebounds and make it more complex to reject. We are faced with a successful mix of Arkanoid and Super Smash Bros, with that pinch of Jet Set Radio that never hurts. Bright colors and crazy characters outline a game that can excite anyone and that makes the simplicity of its basic mechanics its main strength. Lethal League is one of those games that you can easily pull off during an evening with friends and have fun for a few hours, so much so that even just being able to fend off the ball at the right time is gratifying and gives immense satisfaction. If you then think that up to four players will be able to compete simultaneously in a single match, even in teams in two-on-two battles, the picture of a game designed for shoulder-to-shoulder matches on the sofa emerges in a crystal clear way. Too bad, however, that the title created by the guys from the Reptile studio stops here, not presenting enough content to guarantee superlative solo longevity. A solid system of online ranked matches with seasonal rewards is missing, and the few online leaderboards present are mainly dedicated to a challenging but extremely short single-player challenge mode, far too little to keep you attached to the production for long. Move, shoot, act! Yet the game is valid and although it appears to be a very simple title to understand, before becoming really good and competing at high levels you will have to spit a lot of blood. The differences between the very few characters on the roster (we are talking about a handful of fighters) are to be found mainly in the various types of jumps and in the use of the ultra, a move that will most likely allow you to bring home the decisive point. Before I get to uploading it thoughyou will have to learn the art of dribbling, knowing when to dampen the incoming ball to lift it and then crush it in the opponent's face and when instead to decide to shoot it against the wall closest to you, ignoring it to take advantage of the rebound and accumulate more speed. At that point, interesting strategies and tactics come into play but it is not clear then why the Reptile team has decided not to expand the number of possible wrestlers with variants that were even only aesthetic. In fact, we are not talking about characters with complicated move sets, where every single frame must be studied at the table and where there is the risk of creating infinite or unbalanced combos. In Lethal League the only three keys needed to play lead all the characters to perform the same action in the same way, giving greater importance to the visual aspect when choosing the alter ego to use rather than for its real effectiveness in battle. Here then is that only six fighters are not justifiable in any way, especially for the release of the console versions which we sincerely expected a little more substantial than the PC one released three years ago. Instead, the whole artistic system is very pleasantly striking, from the sound to the solid frame rate which further underlines the wasted opportunity to reach the general public. In short, Lethal League will remain in its niche.", "date": "2017-05-12", "grade": "8.5"}
