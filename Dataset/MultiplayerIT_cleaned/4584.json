In recent years, alongside driving simulators and the rarest flight simulators, which still have a certain fascination for a not too small circle of enthusiasts, that of farming simulators has also consolidated. Being farmers engaged in plowing fields and rearing poultry perhaps represents an interesting experience, so much so that within five years the eponymous Farming Simulator has become the annual appointment within its genre, at the peer of FIFA. And here comes the competition: Soedesco has decided to carve out its market share in the sector, launching Real Farm on consoles and promising a new gaming experience. Ready to warm up the tractors? On the ~new~ farm Publishing a new title in a context in which the various editions of Giant Software already dominate the market, and differ from each other in very few details, may seem at least courageous. What can you innovate in a genre where you have to sow the fields, harvest the crops, sell, and then start over? Soedesco justified his move as a just and noble initiative: according to the development team, the other cultivation simulators would be not only limited in function, but above all technically dated. Hence the birth of Real Farm, precisely the ~true~ experience of managing your own farm, with a technical sector at the levels of the current gen consoles and an eye to the mid-gen ones. The initial menu of Real Farm, clean and intuitive, introduces the player to his estate in a few seconds. The modes offered are only two, and moreover identical: in ~free play~ you can go directly to managing your resources as you see fit, while the ~career mode~ presents itself as a series of missions more or less linked to each other. You will start by being the helpers of Matt Davis, the current owner of the farm, who will teach you all the tricks of the trade before retiring and leaving you, for no apparent reason, lands, tractors and cattle. Don't expect anything vaguely like a ~story~. The missions, then, are all similar, at times of a truly unthinkable monotony, especially the initial ones which should help newcomers become familiar with the game mechanics. In them we will always find ourselves performing the same tasks, always in the usual small patch of land, only varying the tools. All right, the job of farmers is not that of explorers, but in this way a title already in itself always threatened by monotony and repetitiveness manages to get bored within a few hours. The tutorial and the missions aren't even useful: the poor farmer is left to himself, with the few on-screen commands that force him to take one of the many similar vehicles, to guide him from one point to another on the game map, and to always start working the same land. If this is the ~Real Farm~, poor farmers... The hard life of the fields, now in 4K Real Farm is not designed as a title with an easy game over: failing the missions that will be assigned by the neighbors or by Davis simply means not being able to complete them in those abundant twenty minutes of time available. This has not prevented Soedesco from introducing three levels of difficulty: starting from an ~easy~ mode in which the prices of the products sold are very high and the initial capital to start up the farm is given as a gift, to get to the ~difficult~ one, designed for experts, with high interest rates and high purchase prices for resources. The real sore point of the production is that it adds practically nothing to the competition's series, which can also count on a considerable quantity of licenses barred to Real Farm. In this way, the title promises what any Farming Simulator is already able to give: cultivation and meticulous care of the fields, management of farm animals, organization of work machines and resources, sale of finished products. An experience certainly not for everyone, but one that even those few enthusiasts will find it hard to define as innovative or worthy of some special attention. Paradoxically, even the technical sector, which should represent Soedesco's workhorse, fails to convince. The game is proposed as the definitive simulator and in step with the times compared to the latest generation consoles, but the first session is enough to understand that the accounts do not add up. The general glance appreciates sharp and clean graphics (the vehicles are externally made with care)but as soon as you start moving around the playing area you realize that the environments and physics have been made in a completely crude way. The elements on the screen are few and not always credible in size, the interaction with them is non-existent, the collisions between the alter ego and the vehicles are simply unthinkable. For example, we drove a tractor over a small fence at full speed. Well, the fence not only withstood the blow, but also braked the tractor in an instantaneous, impossible collision. Add to all this a vegetation made up of four trees in an apparently boundless (and empty) territory, and a country music as a soundtrack, repetitive to the point of fainting. Here, this is Real Farm.", "date": "2017-10-30", "grade": "5.0"}
