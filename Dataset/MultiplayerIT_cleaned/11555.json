At the start of the game, our protagonists are nothing short of insufferable. Let's make that clear right away. The idea of having to control a ten-year-old boy who somehow can lift iron swords and slash against horrific and murderous creatures is not attractive, as well as trivial and rather ridiculous. Moreover, our ~hero~ is called Yuri and he is mellow beyond the limit of impatience, being a mix between Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece and the child Goku from Dragon Ball, the type of baby who jumps if he sees a monster with joy at how fun it must be to fight him. The little sister, over which the player has no direct control, is called Chelinka (poor thing) and is an incredible whiner. In short, after the exploration of the first two ~dungeons~ of the game, and reiterated for the umpteenth time the strong bond between the two children and the paternal love of the widowed carpenter who raised them and the affection of their neighbors , one feels like a narrative turn that makes sense of the excellent audiovisual sector and entire cutscenes spoken by voice. The turning point actually takes place in a sensational way, and a fairy tale for children suddenly becomes a gloomy story of death and wickedness, in which the terrible despot of the moment (actually hidden until the final stages of the adventure) wants to seize a power capable of manipulating reality itself. And Yuri and Chelinka will naturally have to oppose it, out of revenge and duty, since they possess the power to oppose it. In one of the most beautiful cutscenes ever created by Square Enix in its twenty years of production, we see Yuri grow up and become bigger, more captivating and more mature: and there begins the real adventure, in which the pirouettes of this swordsman become more plausible and the fantasy world of Crystal Chronicles definitively involves us in a narrative spiral which, although not excellent, has the merit of nailing it to the DS until its conclusion. Final Fantasy Hack'n'Slash In his adventure, Yuri will team up with three other heroes by chance: Alhanalem, a wizard Yuke who speaks strictly in rhyme; Meeth, a child-looking old woman able to use her urns in the most disparate ways; and Gnash, a wild archer who joins the group by chance and thanksgiving. This is the party that will assemble in the very early stages of the game: the player controls only one of the four protagonists, while the others are managed by an unfortunately mediocre artificial intelligence. By touching the touch screen it is possible to change character in an instant, thus being able to take advantage of its peculiar characteristics: while Yuri is the fighter of the situation, excellent for repeatedly striking enemies in close combat, Alhanalem has greater magical power, and above all can generate platforms through the Mage's Needles scattered throughout the various locations; at the same time, the Urns of Meeth will allow her to float or create fields that make her immune to poisonous gases, while Gnash in addition to being an excellent ranged fighter is also able to double jump. By combining the various abilities of Yuri and company, it is therefore possible to solve the frequent puzzles scattered in the various areas where the action takes place: each phase of the game is in fact linked to a huge location divided into rooms, to progress you have to open doors, deactivate barriers spells, open secret passages or flip switches. The player is never confused by the breadth of the various locations, and the resolution of each puzzle appears clear and intuitive in a short time. The real challenge, in addition to identifying the skill or the character to use in a given context, is naturally characterized by the numerous clashes with hostile creatures of various types: if at the beginning a few shots in sequence are enough to get rid of them, as you continue you must learn to avoid its spells, to identify the most propitious moments to attack and to survive by using offensive and healing spells in abundance. The final bosses of each stage offer a good challenge from this point of view, considering their offensive capacity and enormous tonnages: the player must learn their attack patterns in order to easily target their weak point. Final Fantasy Hack'n'Slash As in the original for Game Cube, magic in Ring of Fates is accomplished through the use of Magicite: these crystals, obtainable by defeating enemies or opening chests, are used by moving a circle around the screen that acts more or less as a viewfinder, once placed, a key is released and the spell is cast at its destination. Initially limited to basic spells, such as Fire or Blizzard, the system quickly allows you to produce more complex spells by combining the circles of one or more characters: here isthat two Fires produce a Fira spell, while Blizzard and Clear allow for the execution of Slow. Spells like Ultima and Holy require the combination of multiple circles, an operation that playing alone is really difficult to perform, while in Multiplayer mode it is certainly more accessible and fun, in its cooperative form. However, for the entire adventure you never feel the need to perform complex magic, and in general even the basic offensive magic is rather cumbersome to use in the most agitated phases of the game, making it decidedly unnecessary, except for healing yourself and the own companions. When crafting is a drug and Multiplayer is fun, or almost Of course, there is also a significant RPG component: in addition to learning new skills and ~skills~ by leveling up, the various characters can be equipped with various weapons, armor and accessories, by buying and forging them. These operations usually take place in the city of Rebena Te Ra during the narrative breaks that connect the various explorations of the small world of Yuri and Chelinka. The crafting system is simple and ingenious, and right from the start it constitutes the most important accessory element of the game, capable of involving the player and pushing him to restart the adventure from the beginning at new levels of difficulty to obtain new items and projects. The enemies and crates scattered in the various dungeons often contain materials and projects that the player keeps in the inventory: once in the city, it is possible to produce a new item if you have the necessary objects, sometimes obtainable from further combinations. In this way it is possible to build weapons, armor, helmets and accessories of various quality, which modify the appearance of our characters by blatantly quoting the most traditional iconologies of the Square Enix saga: in other words, the set consisting of helmet and dress that increases markedly the magical abilities of a character will transform him into the classic Black Mage, with his pointed yellow hat, darkened face and blue tunic. The player has the freedom to dress his characters as he pleases, creating small and colorful parties that recall the various episodes of Final Fantasy, armoring one of the protagonists like a purple Dragoon or a white and red White Mage. The variety of objects is enormous, and their visual rendering is increasingly elaborate and sophisticated, as one gains access to the rarest and most precious materials and projects. However, the forging of objects is not a mere aesthetic issue: these items created by the player have particular passive peculiarities that influence our characters, making them more effective and efficient during battles, increasing for example the possibility of performing critical hits, resistance to certain types of magic or the power of air and arcane attacks. The player can therefore combine the equipment at will, varying the abilities and offensive and defensive characteristics of the party with enormous freedom. When crafting is a drug and Multiplayer is fun, or almost This aspect of the game makes Multiplayer matches really fun. In fact, it is possible to wirelessly connect up to four Nintendo DS (and four game cartridges) to face the adventure in company, after having created a character by choosing his class/race. Once a location has been selected, it is explored as in a very normal game, but the enemies will be more difficult and the puzzles will change slightly, requiring the collaboration of the various players, who will have to push boulders and obstacles together or form small ladders by jumping from one to the other to reach ledges and platforms. It will be possible to obtain new quests designed specifically for the Multiplayer mode, which reward the player with unique and also unobtainable objects and materials, and which will often require a certain combination of classes / races to be solved. The idea is exciting, but actually impractical, given the difficulty of bringing together four people in the same place with their DS and copies of the game. We therefore feel the lack of an online Multiplayer mode, of the ability to connect to the Internet and find players willing to wander with us in the various locations, looking for exclusive objects. In short, a great idea, limited by its narrowness, but nevertheless able to give additional hours of play to those who have the opportunity to exploit it. Trial by fire Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates is probably the most elaborate Nintendo DS product out there. The benchmark for a long time was Final Fantasy III, then the more recent Phantom Hourglass: their three-dimensional engines showed the ability of Nintendo DS to manage environments and polygonal models naturally and flawlessly, while using the tricks of the case, in the form of shots or angles. Ring of Fates is certainly the new example of what the DS is capable of doing, proposing a respectable 3D engine, limited only by the impossibility of rotating the camera, which remains fixed: nevertheless, no element of the environment or model polygonal remains hidden or invisible, from this point of view the development of the game has been painstaking. The size of the locations and their complexity, often also extending vertically and on several levels, pay the price for the quality of the texturing, sometimes inconstant, more generally quite discreet. Some locations, like Sinners' Isle, are rather bland and monotonous, while others like Rebena Te Ra or Abyssus Forest display a high level of detail. The polygonal models of the enemies and, above all, of the characters, enjoy excellent animations, and of course there is no lack of elaborate lighting effects in the case of spells and special attacks. In general, Ring of Fates shows an excellent 3D engine, despite the slowdowns that occur especially in the most chaotic situations in which both the four main characters and the enemies fight in the same screen. Fortunately we are not faced with particularly striking drops in frame per second to compromise the excellent judgment on the technical sector. The audio component is certainly worthy of praise, above all due to the enormous amount of digitized speech inserted in the cartridge: almost all the non-interactive cutscenes are dubbed, moreover excellently, increasing the value of the narrative component. There is also an excellent accompanying soundtrack, by Kumi Tanioka, decidedly touching in the salient moments of the narrative, electrifying and frenetic enough during the numerous action phases, in general particularly cheerful and imaginative. Comment Ring of Fates captures all the best of the 2004 game and re-proposes it with the elements that were missing to make it an excellent product: an interesting plot, well-characterized characters, a varied and enjoyable level-design. The result is an RPG that is also a bit frenetic hack'n'slash, with puzzle-solving phases that leverage the numerous abilities of the characters and the player's ability to switch between them at the right time. The simple but addictive crafting system of the objects is the main stimulus for replayability: the difficulty is certainly not high and the duration of the adventure is rather small, in eight or ten hours it is possible to complete the main-quest without too many frills. The real strength that would have exponentially increased the value of Ring of Fates was its captivating Multiplayer mode: unfortunately, the limitation of local games and the lack of support for the large network make it a missed opportunity. Ephemeral but really fun, it can only be recommended to all lovers of the saga and to those looking for a different Final Fantasy that still maintains all the magic and atmosphere of the series. Pros Technically good Varied and fun gameplay Super enjoyable crafting system Cons Short and simple Multiplayer mode does not support internet connection Fluctuating textures Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates is available for Nintendo DS. Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles was produced in 2003 for the Nintendo Game Cube and represented a completely new approach by Square Enix to its most famous saga. Instead of offering Nintendo users a traditional JRPG, Square Enix opted for a formula that focused on the characteristics of the Cube, in particular the strong predisposition to multiplayer. Crystal Chronicles was in fact a purely ~action~ RPG to the point of being definable almost hack'n'slash, especially aimed at users who could enjoy it in the company of two or three friends. From this point of view, the original experiment worked wonders, but remained limited precisely by its experimental nature and by the numerous flaws that afflicted it, especially from the point of view of gameplay and plot, practically non-existent. Four years later, Square Enix offers us Ring of Fates: it is not a direct sequel, despite having the same characteristics as the previous Crystal Chronicles, both playful and structural. But in the time since that partially failed experiment, Square Enix has learned from its mistakes and ironed out a few shortcomings, ending up packaging a truly captivating product", "date": "2008-03-18", "grade": null}
