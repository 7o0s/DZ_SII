The immortal charm of the spotless knights, of the clashes with white weapons, of the valiant crusaders and of the mysterious Almohads, however, has created a collective imagination in which the Middle Ages was also an era that we still cannot help but look at today. with interest and respect... an era therefore also greatly exploited by video game producers, from which some notable products in several playful genres have been drawn. The flagship title as regards the dark ages is certainly Medieval: Total War 2. Captivating and precise strategic management, satisfactory tactical reconstruction and appreciable historical fidelity (especially with some mods created ad hoc by both video game and history enthusiasts). Why talk about Medieval 2? Because the title we are dealing with at first sight seems like a clone in all respects. Thirteenth Century: Death or Glory, in fact, presents a series of campaigns in which the player will face different historical battles in command of the greatest European nations of the period treated, and these battles are presented exactly like those of the last born of the Total War series : three-dimensional camera on a well-defined portion of territory with woods, rivers, bridges and anything else to also cover tactical and not just aesthetic roles. But we must never stop at appearances. Knights who in battle ignore fear tight is your armor well-tempered shirt The first thing that differentiates XIII Secolo from the aforementioned product is certainly the historical veracity: where in Medieval this was subject to the will of the player, and it was therefore possible to reconstruct improbable historical scenarios in which the Turks invaded Rome or the English subdued the Holy Roman Empire, the campaigns of the thirteenth century are not only, in their individual clashes, anticipated by a text on the screen and then by an introductory film that tells the genesis during the wars and the effects in their development, but they also all occurred historically and re-proposed exactly in the same ways in which they were faced by their protagonists. You will therefore find yourself guiding figures such as Barbarossa (Frederick II), Alexander Nevsky (who repulsed the Teutonic invasion in the Russian steppes), the courageous William Wallace and many others: a real shame it was decided to limit the theater of the conflicts, denying the possibility of facing (or leading) the ferocious Saladin or the crusaders of Guido di Lusignan in the Crusades. But it is not only the reconstruction of the frame that has been carefully studied: going beyond the similarity, even graphically, with the aforementioned Total War saga, we note how, for example, the initial deployments are those historically attested in documents of the time (and not it is possible to modify them before the battle, you can only order the units to reach certain positions and hope they succeed before the enemy reaches them) and how many different parameters have been taken into consideration: each regiment in fact has its own drop-down menu with about fifteen of statistics, including the value of assault, defense, morale, obedience, degree of experience, information on speed, armaments, fatigue, percentage of wounded... and we are talking about twenty regiments per army. And don't think that they were put for beauty: the intent of the developers was to perfectly recreate the mood of the warriors of the time, and we can say that they have succeeded: tired units are less effective than rested ones, a regiment that has suffered several wounded from shooting is less efficient than a healthy one, a unit that sees itself surrounded could flee or rather decide to resist to the last man, an infantry under fire from horse archers could break up the formation thus offering the side of the charges. There was something similar in Medieval as well, but it wasn't as carefully reproduced. Naturally, the battlefield also suffers from all this attention: a unit on a hill will shoot with more range than one on the ground, a cavalry climbing a steep slope may have difficulty controlling animals, a heavy infantry engaged in a ford may get bogged down (and under fire that's not an idea), a single regiment of pikemen can hold a bridge against waves of enemies and so on. If the objectives were historical veracity and realism in the fighting, it cannot be denied that they have been achieved. In the war of Valois, M. de Vly died... However,even in the face of the perfect graphic reconstruction (which will be discussed later) of the individual nations treated in the game, there are a couple of surprising lightnesses. The different types of units (crossbowmen, swordsmen...) are the same for each army. To understand each other, particular units such as longbow archers, the emperor's zweyhanders, gendarme knights do not appear; it simply changes the graphic rendering of the various archers, heavy cavalry, feudal sergeants and pikemen common to all armies (a bit like in Age of Empires 2, where more or less all factions had the same units). The second perplexity instead derives directly from a choice of gameplay: XIII century is a fast game and from the beginning of the battle there are very few minutes, if not seconds, to prepare for the arrival of the first enemy waves. You will understand that, having to take into account the amount of parameters mentioned in the previous paragraph, it will not be so easy during the frenetic battle phases to keep an eye on the level of fatigue or the number of wounded in the individual troops, especially considering that there it is often multiple flanks engaged or even several small engagements within the same battlefield. It is possible to pause the game to calmly observe the situation and decide what to do (the orders will be promptly executed as soon as the fight resumes), but often one is forced to make such an abuse of this possibility that one will end up totally ignoring the various parameters in favor of a full-army charge (on hard difficulty it's crazy, but it can work on ~easy~). Speaking of artificial intelligence, one cannot fail to praise the work of the developers: the enemy takes refuge in the hills, always sends scouts on horseback to test the strength of the defenses, performs combined charges of infantry and cavalry and tries to exploit the environment in his favor entrenching themselves on bridges or in front of fords, making it more difficult to reach it. It should be noted that the developers make the enemy general behave as the real one behaved in the clash that occurred centuries ago, including errors (for example the Teutons will attack a ford with only cavalry ... they had an incompetent general who made just that mistake and for which he lost his life and war). In the warm spring sun the armor of the sire vincitor flashes Let's complete the XIII Century analysis with the technical apparatus: the graphics, decidedly clean and satisfying when it comes to environments, hills and rivers, lose a few points in the representation of the individual units, especially infantry, which suffer a little ' of the clone war syndrome: the soldiers are practically all the same both in livery and in faces (moreover very poorly defined) and the details of the single model certainly do not make one cry for a miracle. Of course, considering that there are thousands of warriors on the field and that the animations are always fluid and realistic, this little mistake can be overlooked. History buffs will be thrilled when they recognize in the banners and heraldry the real ones of the sovereigns and officers engaged in the various battles. From the point of view of the sound we have the usual choice of men's responses to orders (definitely repetitive) and a good base of music to underline the most emphatic moments of the clashes through military marches or slower melodies as a prelude to the storm ... maybe just something more could really be done in this area. Regarding longevity, the different campaigns allow several hours of bloody clashes, a pity for the units that are all the same which could lead to boredom in the long run. In any case, once those are completed, it will be possible to engage in multiplayer battles both in LAN and on the internet, to see who the reincarnation of Charles V really is. Comment XIII Secolo is certainly a successful product. It may seem like a clone of other successful titles and one might wonder why the most hardened strategists should include it in their collection. Its strong point is precisely being a historical strategy game. The battles are historic. The characters as well. Even heraldry. The tactical reconstruction is there and it's also done well. The enemy is treacherous enough to be a problem. The graphics may have some smudges and the sound is nothing transcendental, but overall it can go. Multiplayer encounters promise epic battles between veteran desk generals. Definitely a nice surprise, this XIII Century: Death or Glory.
