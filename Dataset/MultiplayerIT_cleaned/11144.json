{"name": "MasterChef: Let's Cook!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/masterchef-lets-cook-recensione.html", "text": "MasterChef's review: Let's Cook! combines a relatively modern trend, that of cooking shows such as the television broadcast whose characteristics are reproduced under license, MasterChef in fact, and a real classic of simulation casual games, namely Cooking Mama. Born in 2006 on Nintendo DS, the series developed by the former Office Create, today Cooking Mama Limited, took advantage of the peculiarities of the Japanese company's portable console and its touch screen to offer a fun and original experience, in which we were called to prepare increasingly difficult recipes, receiving precise evaluations of our operated. This is exactly what happens in this new Tilting Point title, available free of charge to Apple Arcade platform subscribers. Gameplay MasterChef: Let's Cook!, the cutting of ingredients It is useless to get around it: if over ten years ago the Cooking Mama formula was able to exert a great charm also and above all because of the unprecedented mechanics of interaction with the touch screen, nowadays this type of solution is no longer a novelty and it is therefore clear that MasterChef: Let's Cook! finds itself competing in a less than ideal situation, risking appearing ~already seen~ right away. Unfortunately, the developers didn't do much to prevent this from happening: while taking their cue from the typical situations of the MasterChef programme, with three judges and a competitor, our character, who is selected to challenge other talented cooks from all over the world, the game takes exactly the gameplay of Cooking Mama and the variations on the theme are frankly few. In practice, for each multiplayer-based challenge, to be faced against five other users, you are asked to prepare a recipe that meets certain requirements, possibly ensuring more points where you succeed. Then the ingredients are selected from the pantry, they are positioned on the workbench and from there we can start... in the hope of not ~disappointing~ any of the judges. Using the touch screen we will therefore have to complete a sequence of simple, but sometimes mangy mini-games to get to the ready and finished dish: cut vegetables, garnish pasta sheets, position the garnishes with precision, boil the water without overcooking the pasta, manage cooking in the oven or in a pan respecting the right times, and so on Street. Structure and technique MasterChef: Let's Cook!, the management of the stove Doing everything right will allow us to obtain the necessary score to snatch victory and to grow within a progression system that unlocks not only new ingredients and related recipes, but also clothes and useful objects to aesthetically customize our young man cook. All to move from one episode of the show to another, but it is only a gimmick to push us to ring challenges after challenges. Unfortunately, a certain degree of repetitiveness is inevitable until you become familiar with the recipe and ingredient system, while in terms of technical implementation the developers have done a good job, packaging a simple but functional cartoon-style graphics, although without a sound accompaniment of character.", "date": "2021-09-14", "grade": "7.0"}
