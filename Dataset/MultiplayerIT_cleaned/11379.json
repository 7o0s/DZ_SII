{"name": "Race Driver: Grid", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/race-driver-grid.html", "text": "The various publishers are looking towards the mobile video game market with increasing interest: some have already created their own mobile division some time ago, others have relied on development teams with proven experience. This is the case of Codemasters, which for the conversion of its racing games seems to have placed itself completely in the hands of Glu, a company that has made a name for itself in the field of mobile gaming thanks above all to the technical quality achieved by its titles. The mobile version of Dirt arrived significantly late compared to the console release of the game, but the wait has paid off: it is a title with excellent graphics, very playable and full of substance. For the conversion of Race Driver: Dirt, it was decided to speed things up and prepare everything for a simultaneous launch on all formats: a wise decision or not? The start screen of the game allows us to choose between a free run and the career mode. In the first we will be able to practice with the cars and tracks initially available, while the second represents the core of the game: after creating a driver, we will be able to access a series of tournaments made up of several races, with the aim of win them all. The more races we win, the more events and cars we can unlock. As far as cars are concerned, this is particularly important: those available at the start are rather slow, and it will be really difficult not only to overtake your opponents, but also and above all to prevent them from regaining the position. It is precisely at this juncture, in the approach to racing, that this mobile version of Race Driver: Grid plays the diversity card: on mobile we have always been used to ~easy~ racing games, where overtaking comes naturally and you just have to keep a clean guide to bring home the victory. Things are different here: there are only five riders on the track besides ours, but gaining every position will be far from easy. Our car is only capable of overtaking the others on the straight, while it loses a lot of speed when cornering and almost always ends up being caught up. This happens whether a ~clear~ solution is adopted, i.e. steering as much as necessary to immediately regain a straight trajectory, or cornering little by little, at short intervals. The control system, in any case, comes to our aid: acceleration is automatic, while the joystick can be used to steer or brake, without the need for other buttons. The game is available in both 3D and 2D versions. In the first case, the graphics are completely polygonal except for the background image, which changes according to the circuit and ~pilots~ the colors chosen for the setting. In any case, there are so many moving elements and they do not escape a series of more or less serious problems: the pop-up effect is sometimes really too marked (even entire buildings appear suddenly, and all this distance but also from a medium distance) and the ~lines~ that flow away appear ~deformed~. The general impression is that the graphics engine is not well optimized, since it moves slowly on terminals that instead make Dirt splash at maximum speed. This may be due to the higher number of polygons on the screen, but the feeling is that much better could have been done to make the game usable even by those who don't own a high-end mobile phone. As for the 2D version, it literally goes from stars to rags, with essential and very bare graphics, well below average.
