Without the latter, there would probably be no interactive adventure in the true sense of the word. Whether it's shooting hordes of enemies, solving more or less diversified puzzles, or the supply of resources essential for one's livelihood within the virtual world, each game has its own form of repetitiveness. The skill lies in masking those elements that are cyclically fed to the player, proposing an experience that gives both the impression of a constant increase in the level of challenge, and the right degree of knowledge of the world that we find ourselves exploring. In essence, we need a balance between what can be controlled and what remains unknown until we find ourselves facing it face to face. This balance is often upset by a frantic search for longevity, especially within the stocks that crowd the market today. Sometimes, going off these tracks leads to unexpected results (consisting of a few discordant voices). Others, as in most cases, to burning disappointments. In this review of Wytchwood, the most recent work of AlienTrap Games (the studio behind that particular two-dimensional experiment that was Apotheon), let's see which of these two macro-sets the game belongs to. A fairy tale narrative Wytchwood: the narrative sector draws liberally from the European folk tradition Wytchwood catapults us directly into an imaginary world, inhabited by human beings and anthropomorphic-looking animal creatures, as well as by all the imaginative undergrowth that ~populates~ European folklore. We play the role of a witch, who a day he wakes up with no memory in his hut near a swamp. Here he finds a goat who, in addition to having eaten the pages of his grimoire, turns out to be able to speak. This reminds the sorceress that she has signed a binding contract according to which she owes him twelve souls in exchange for one, that of a mysterious sleeping maiden, lying on the altar of a crypt not too far from her dilapidated home. Our task is to go and redeem these twelve souls, belonging to bestial-looking characters, each with its dose of pettiness and malice. A special feature of these missions is the fact that they recall some of the most famous fairy tales and tales, as well as myths and legends (we have Little Red Riding Hood, The Little Mermaid, but also references to the alchemical philosopher's stone, just to name a few). Such an adaptation operation risks easily falling into the territory of ~lack of definite identity~. Yet, the work done by AlienTrap is very convincing and, above all, engaging. These short and light-hearted stories, completely disconnected from each other, if it weren't for our direct intervention, manage to create a mythology strongly linked to the game, starting (but never relying completely) on traditional tropes more than abused by the modern and contemporary media landscape. A result that is not easy to obtain and, for this reason, worthy of appreciation. The longevity that hurts the experience Wytchwood: our task is to claim the twelve souls of as many disreputable characters The Wytchwood structure is by no means something complex. To be able to obtain the necessary souls, you have to explore the eight strongly characterized territories that make up this world, unlockable as you collect the ~essences~ for the ovine entity with demonic traits. Through the use of our witchcraft skills, we must help liberate such regions from the oppressive yoke of these evil figures. This means that combat is practically absent, reduced to magic potions and alchemical solutions with which to confuse or transmute the threats that undermine our path. The gameplay revolves around the collection of resources and the creation of more or less lethal objects, with which directly face the ~enemies~ (if we can call them that) or to be exchanged with other characters or, again, to be mixed and blended in more elaborate compositions. And this is what you will find yourself doing throughout the adventure. The ~ritual~ is cyclical: explore the environment, discover new recipes by examining the elements that make up the areas, create what is necessary for the mission and continue the adventure. All this for twelve stories, please, as different and diversified as you like, but still structurally similar in their development and in their resolution. Which brings us back to the subject of repetitiveness. Wytchwood: Ingredients and spells are our weapons againstEvil In this case, the succession of very similar actions, which imply an uninterrupted use of the same commands, does not necessarily mean a lack of variety within the title. This is mainly due to its strongly narrative nature, which does not include other ~distractions~ or fillers in addition to the main story. However, it is also true that this method of approaching the gameplay cannot be maintained for too long, on pain of losing the involvement of even the player most emotionally attached to the adventure. Wytchwood's greatest criticality is precisely its excessive development, its exaggerated longevity, which leads to feeling the weight of the repetitiveness of game actions, as well as the constant return to territories that have now been beaten dozens and dozens of times to always recover the same ingredients. As far as we're concerned, we remained hooked on the game and its mechanics until the eighth soul, while the last four definitely diminished our interest, especially considering that the ending, as in many operations of this type, fails to match the expressive power of the journey that preceded it. The art of the derivative Wytchwood: the visual incisiveness goes hand in hand with the narrative one From the very first moments of the game, the strong impact that some works (both videogame and not) have had on the conceptualization and visual realization of the AlienTrap game is immediately evident. In its gameplay phases, it is impossible not to find similarities (both visual as well as playful) with a game like Don't Starve. During the dialogue sequences, however, the inspiration from the two-dimensional Disney style (especially from the recent ~Disney Channel~ era) is evident. Despite these combinations, also thanks to a soundtrack perfectly integrated with the game atmospheres (with, however, some sound mixing problems, particularly evident when using headphones), Wytchwood still manages to stand out from the competition and find a stylistic singularity, capable of binding itself to its narrative nature, which is also derivative, but extremely fascinating.", "date": "2021-12-16", "grade": "7.5"}
