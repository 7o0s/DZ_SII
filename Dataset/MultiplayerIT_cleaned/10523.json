Even today, the Polish open world based on zombies and parkour represents a milestone of the past generation. Over the years, an inordinate amount of new content has arrived to enrich the already very full-bodied original campaign; in view of the sequel, again postponed to the beginning of next year and after a series of hitches in the ambitious development of the game, Dying Light is ready to arrive in its Platinum version also on Nintendo Switch. We are back to throw ourselves into the devastated landscapes of the zombie apocalypse of Techland and in the review of the Dying Light Platinum Edition we are ready to tell you if this version does everything to push you to spend your money again. An infection is forever Dying Light: The Following maxi expansion also adds the Dune Buggy! Dying Light has focused a lot since its debut on the narrative component, as well as on the immediacy and depth of the gameplay. The desire to tell a zombie apocalypse through a well-kept choral cast and the deepening of the psychology of many characters was so important for Techland, as to push them to focus a large part of the promotion of the second chapter on the freedom of narrative choices. Leaving aside the infinite amount of additional content and the four main expansions, the Dying Light plot presents us with a world in jeopardy, where a variant of the already known rage has pushed a large part of the population to turn into flesh-hungry zombies. With this idyllic setting assumption we are driven, in disguise, to help an advocacy group desperately trying to study a cure, while survival becomes more difficult every day. However, thanks to close ties and the increase in our skills, we will be able to escape the mess we have gotten ourselves into, also making us a clear idea of the actions that human beings can achieve when cornered by something bigger than them. Only the main campaign of Dying Light will easily take you about twenty hours if you are not very attentive to exploring the map and worrying about secondary tasks and upgrading skills, divided into different branches and with two distinct and independent experience progressions. If this is not enough, the Platinum Edition contains all the content that arrived in the five years following its launch on the market, including the maxi expansion The Followig, which almost doubles the duration of the game and which shifts the focus of the action to beyond the city walls. An even larger map, a structural change of the setting that turns into a more rural environment and the presence of a splendid personal and upgradeable Dune Buggy are the backdrop to the story of the lands outside Harran. We are driven there by curiosity to find out if the rumors of a cure for the virus are valid and we come across a cult that worships the ~mother~. Certainly less narratively impacting than the main campaign, just as the level design is less structured, which inevitably loses the labyrinthine and vertical shapes of the city, but it is a new and fresh approach to the mechanics of Dying Light, complete with new skills, weapons, outfits and situations. There would be much more to add to the package, but it is useless to make a sterile list of contents. What matters is that everything that has arrived over the years on PC and consoles - or almost - is now available in a single package which, although not cheap, is still the most comfortable and complete way to prepare for the sequel. The Nintendo Switch version Dying Light: parkour is always a pleasure For those wishing to really delve into all aspects of the gameplay, we refer you to the Dying Light review, certainly more detailed and complete than the one you are reading. In our case, instead, we prefer to dwell on the success or otherwise of this porting for Switch. Over the years we have experienced many ups and downs, going from atrocities like RiME to real miracles like The Witcher 3 and Bioshock. Dying Light in this sense surprised us positively. It is obvious that it would be wrong to expect a version that is technically close to the original on PC, which at the time was absolutely beautiful to see. Here, aliasing increases dramatically, the horizon is reduced, many details are lost and the quality of the textures and models is significantly lowered. This, however, does not really affect the final result and what concerned us most in a title like Dying Light, or the frame rate, behaves better than we thought. Forget about finding yourself in front of agame optimized to the fullest, in the most agitated situations the Nintendo hybrid loses a few shots and some shots are noticeable, but for most of the time Dying Light maintains its 30fps and is at least playable. The instability problem would seem to be more related to a currently unstable frame pacing, which however will be resolved through a patch already promised by the developers. On the other hand, expecting a perfect and flawless version, having Techland chosen to avoid the increasingly famous cloud versions, would have been unfair and naive on the part of the players. Dying Light: be careful walking around at night! At the same time it is obvious that, as already happened for The Witcher 3, playing Dying Light for the first time with these features may not give you the most appropriate sensations. For all those who can't do without the Polish team's zombie apocalypse, this port will still make them feel at home. What we strongly recommend is to enjoy the experience in portable mode, so as to avoid accusing technical deficiencies due to the hardware more than necessary and making sure to take advantage of some of the new features developed for the occasion. busy with the porting, in fact, he preferred to go beyond the simple homework and insert a series of more than welcome elements. First of all, the game takes full advantage of the vibrations of the Joy-Con, so as to increase the immersiveness even more, also allowing Nintendo Switch players to cooperate locally up to four people with four different consoles. Next to the most purely technical, the Switch version of Dying Light implements motion controls and the use of the touchscreen. The writer is not a great lover of the former and it is no coincidence that even in Dying Light we resisted just a handful of minutes with the Joy-Con in our hands, before giving up and returning to prefer the classic control. However, it is a pure personal preference and for this reason we do not feel like sinking the judgment due to subjective incompatibility. We are sure that those who have enjoyed this feature in the past will do it again this time, albeit with a frenzy of gameplay with very few equals. Dying Light: give me a hug! As for the touchscreen, however, we are really happy with the work done. Not because it totally changes the cards on the table, but being able to manage the navigation of the menus and the map with the use of the fingers on the screen is a plus that cannot really be underestimated, especially for those who are used to the freedom of using a mouse cursor compared to those who already use a controller constantly.", "date": "2021-10-18", "grade": "8.0"}
