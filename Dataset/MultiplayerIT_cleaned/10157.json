Obviously it also becomes a double-edged sword when the approach to the game takes place when you are too excited and who knows what is expected, and every judgment or thought must be weighed and perhaps analyzed with a cold mind, before proceeding with the drafting the final. But here we are talking about a certain Kratos, a shady figure who quickly entered the ranks of the most charismatic characters in the videogame universe and is perpetually pissed off with everyone and indiscriminately, violent beyond measure and exponent of a genre, that of action adventures, still among the most popular on the market. The God of War saga has a pinch of mystery in its background, as each episode has seen its Game Director capitulate for reasons that are never fully clarified. And so after the more famous David Jaffe it was the turn of Cory Barlog, who suddenly resigned at the beginning of the development of the third chapter, to finally arrive at Stig Asmussen, who at this point we suppose may have the hours numbered starting next March 17th. The strength of ideas and the awareness of what is being done, however, has never changed, the Santa Monica Studios have been able to benefit perfectly from the greater computing power available, to conclude in the best possible way what began a few years ago on PlayStation 2 . Zeus! Do you hear me? God of War III begins exactly where the second chapter ends, when Kratos after a first clash with Zeus wants to complete his revenge and therefore finds himself on the back of the Titan Gaia while he is climbing Olympus, accompanied by the other giants intent on recovering what was taken away after the Great War. However, Zeus still has many allies among its ranks: Poseidon, Hades, Hermes, Elio and others, united for a battle that promises to be epic and with no holds barred. The distinctive feature of each episode of God of War has always been to start ~with a bang~, catapulting the player immediately into the center of the most total action and making it clear that spectacularity and large scale are fundamental components for making an action adventure in the most fitting sense of the term. Imagine then if the thing could not be repeated with this third chapter. Indeed, the first hour of God of War III is one of the moments with the highest adrenaline rate ever seen in a video game, a crescendo of action, emotions and elements thrown on the screen that return an absolutely out-of-parameter impact. Specifically, as always we find a huge boss to be faced several times, fighting on the backs of moving titans, a camera that always captures the moment perfectly, many effects on the screen, destruction of the scenario and an impressive polygonal mass, so much so that struggles to metabolize overall everything experienced firsthand after this first wave, when the title returns to the tracks for a moment after the initial outburst. Do not despair, the title thrives on these situations, huge and spectacular boss fights, ad hoc use of the camera to increase the degree of identification and the glance, extreme wickedness of the main protagonist, which is never reproduced as in this chapter perfectly and justified in narrative terms. Kratos has to carry out a revenge and has no mercy for anyone standing in front of him, like when he takes off Elio's head to take possession of his ability to see ~hidden~ areas or when, always in the aforementioned orgasmic hour, the unfortunate Poseidon sees himself subjected to head butts, knees and more up to blinding, while the camera expertly moves to first person, making the scene visually even more bloody and spectacular. God of War III, as announced by the developers, concludes the trilogy on a narrative level, and actually Kratos finds himself settling accounts with practically anyone and even more, to arrive at a long, structured ending and also with a completely different epilogue that obvious, which perhaps closes the circle on the former god of war, but certainly not on all the events that concern him. The foundations of the game are obviously well known, we are dealing with a third-person action-adventure title mainly based on fights, but with different puzzle sections that become more and more prominent in the second half of the game, resulting more airy than to the past. Santa Monica Studio has in fact rebalanced these sections, eliminating qthe most tedious ones of the past (the memory always goes to those where, for example, it was necessary to carry a statue uphill while being attacked continuously) and making them more structured along Kratos' path. The changes to the gameplay are actually much more interesting than it initially seems and have touched practically every main aspect, from the control system to the management of weapons and magic, up to the actual fights. No upheavals or particular innovations, mind you, but each element has been refined again, eliminating unnecessary frills that sobbed in the previous chapters and trying to make everything more fluid, dynamic and with fewer dead moments. First of all, weapons and spells now move in symbiosis with each other, in fact every weapon obtained is associated with the digital cross, which in turn carries with it a different spell, which can be activated immediately with the R2 key. For example, the blades supplied by Kratos have the phalanx of Sparta, the claws of Hades can release souls of various kinds that attack enemies and so on, and the beauty is that each weapon is indicated for different types of enemies or to have it gets the better of some objects, which leads to varying their use according to the situations, even though the preference towards one or the other remains. This great interoperability is also reinforced by the fact that all weapons can be changed ~on the fly~, using the aforementioned digital cross or with the L1 + X combination, which allows you to not interrupt the combos while attacking enemies. Other moves in Kratos' repertoire include a claw grip to headbutt, the ability to ride some enemies to take advantage of their increased attack power, or use others as a shield and run wildly to overwhelm anything, also because the scale of fights has increased compared to the past, and it is also possible to face dozens of enemies on the screen at the same time. To make everything even more dynamic and fluid, in addition to dodging, counterattacks and so on, this third chapter introduces a third energy bar, dedicated to the use of objects that the main protagonist acquires during the adventure. For example, we have the bow, which can incinerate enemies and elements of the scenario that block the way, to switch to the boots of Hermes that allow you to throw enemies into the air with acceleration while running and to reach otherwise inaccessible high places. The quick time events, of which God of War was one of the major supporters after Shenmue, are obviously very present and dedicated to the final killing of the bosses and rather difficult opponents, they accompany as always bloody and spectacular actions and also in this case they are have been slightly modified, as the front keys of the pad appear on the four sides of the screen, leaving the focus fully on what is happening. The only big comment that we feel like making to the control system lies in the choice of the R2 key for the immediate activation of the spells, quite irritating given the extreme sensitivity of the Sony pad triggers, which represent one of the weak points of the controller. There are obviously some notes to make in the game, but more often than not you have to get out of the context in which it arises. The gameplay is in fact only marginally based on the skill of the pad in favor of brute power and rhythm, albeit more dynamic as previously mentioned. Paradoxically, the initial part of the title is so incredible that replicating it in the later stages is practically impossible, even if the game is full of these moments, but of shorter duration. It is therefore necessary to make it clear that the new title by Santa Monica Studio brings all the elements that have decreed the success of the saga to the nth degree, but does not have the ambition to redefine the genre or win new followers in the ranks of those who never they appreciated the saga in terms of gameplay, but this is a discussion that can be continued with many similar examples. In our test we completed the title in 10 hours and 50 minutes, a good but not excellent time, while apart from the extras, which we refer to the appropriate box, the replayability of the main adventure is all dedicated to a greater level of challenge or the desire to appreciate the spectacular side of the game, since you always start over and the special power-ups can only be used on the already completed difficulty level. Playstation 3 trophies God of War III offers 36 trophies, of which 18 secrets set not to reveal important parts of the boss and plot. The ~known~ ones are obviously dedicated to completing the game, maximizing everythingand available energy bars, making a 1000-move combo, killing a certain number of enemies according to specific techniques and completing extra modes that unlock. It is possible to get all the trophies in the first round, but you have to complete it directly on the highest difficulty level initially selectable. I care nothing We have to be honest, after playing God of War Collection, the high definition re-release of the first two chapters which among other things benefited from a frame rate of 60 frames per second, the impact with this factor in God of War III becomes a unsettling moment, as the third episode is instead anchored to 30 frames per second, always stable in any case, with different points upwards but which in any case make you feel a different sensation in terms of fluidity and speed altogether. Fortunately, it's all about getting used to it, to leave room for the good things that appear before your eyes. As mentioned, the first hour of the game is something extraordinary in every aspect, and is a clear and strong demonstration of what the game's graphics engine offers for the entire duration of the adventure: an incredible polygonal mass covers the bosses, structures and Kratos, which never as in this case is detailed in detail, in his facial expressions and in the various animations available. But this thing is only the apex of a technical production at the highest levels, where effects of bloom, light, dynamic shadows make the title a pleasure for the eyes, and where the setting, which ranges from Olympus to Hades, passing for many other elements of Greek mythology, it has, as always, an impeccable and fascinating artistic realization, made up of color-saturated landscapes, stroke softness (accompanied by a rather good anti-aliasing) and a clearly uncommon design of enemies and structures in the development in the videogame field. Another element that contributes in an important way is the camera, which remains managed directly by the engine and by precise choice, as can also be seen from the Making of the game: in doing so, the programmers have always chosen the best point of view, and they are not uncommon the moments in which the view contributes decisively to making the action interactive or not and truly spectacular, which would otherwise be impossible if control were left to the player. This ~policy~ already comes from the two previous chapters and obviously the fact that it has been so perfected does not make us regret manual management of the camera, at least in this specific case and obviously not as a general rule, where we have many excellent opposite examples. However, the programmers have introduced several ~points of interest~ which when selected allow you to move the view and zoom it using the two analog sticks of the joypad. However, such a high graphic standard also has some flaws that are not in line with the rest, in particular the interaction with water and fluids, or the textures, which, although varied and often well defined, are among the most see-sawing, perhaps in sections indoors or ~quiet~ from the point of view of level design. The sound sector follows the lines of that of the first two God of War and can boast four different composers, ~hired~ to give precise identity to different moments of the game, with musical pieces rearranged on the basis of those already known but also some unpublished and impeccably made, even more pressing to better underline the action of this chapter. The dubbing is completely in Italian both in the texts and in the voices, it is of good quality in almost all the interpreters and in line with that of the previous episodes. However, we must say that the English one, also for the perfect synchronized lip, is more incisive and atmospheric in its creation. In God of War III therefore, when all these positive factors mentioned above work in unison, and this happens quite often, the result is absolutely devastating, and once again we are faced with a title that manages to return a graphic impact at the top of this console generation and which is also accompanied by rather interesting technological solutions such as the absence of installation on a hard disk and the complete lack of uploads between one section and another. All this contributes to making the experience fluid and exciting also from a visual point of view. Extra Mon Amour The Santa Monica Studios title offers several extras that are obtained after a first completion of the adventure, albeit not sensational from the point of view of the actual gameplay. It starts from the classic additional difficulty level, up to the possibility of tackling the new game", "date": "2010-03-08", "grade": "9.6"}
