However, the developers Hothead Games remind us that, although the protagonist of the game is DeathSpank again, it is not necessary to know the previous chapters of this series to appreciate the story and the characters of this unpublished The Baconing. We recall, for the record, that the brilliant American author is among other things the creator of series such as Maniac Mansion, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Zak McKracken and none other than Monkey Island. In January 2008 he finally became Creative Director of Hothead Games who then gave birth to his latest creature on digital platforms, a title that Gilbert himself initially presented as a cross between a Monkey Island graphic adventure and a Diablo-like RPG. The Backoning is the third installment of the saga, and the first developed with Gilbert now away from the project (he is currently creating a new title with his friend Tim Schafer). The new game in the adventure/hack & slash saga introduces a greater number of areas to explore and four new bosses, all with the promise (quite easy to keep) of preserving the goliardic spirit of the series, succeeding in full. In the game we visit Fires of Bacon, Spanktopia, the Throne Room and we will fight against the AntiSpank: ~if someone manages to get hold of all 6 Thongs of Virtue (loincloths!) he must never bring them all together, otherwise he would risk awaken an incredible evil version of himself~, claims the prophecy that is heard at the beginning of the adventure. Obviously something goes wrong as Deathspank, our digital alter-ego, during a boring day in Spanktopia, decides having nothing better to do than wearing all his thongs together, thus awakening the terrible AntiSpank. To defeat the dangerous (nuclear) threat evoked by himself, it is our task to gather the entire ~nuclear family~ of atomic scientists: Betty and Dick Nuclear are the parents, Elroy and Chastity Nuclear are the children, essential for accessing the Fire of Bacon and defeat the fearsome fluorescent green menace. As any lover of LucasArts adventures knows, humor is the common thread throughout the adventure that revolves around bizarre characters, grotesque situations and funny enemies. Xbox 360 goals Like any game downloaded from Xbox Live Arcade, this too The Baconing offers the player the classic 200 points, divided into 12 fairly automatic objectives to be unlocked through the normal progression of the game. There are no particularly difficult objectives, and simply by completing the adventure we will get all the loot available. Hack'n slash action, but with humor! The gameplay of Deathspank: The Baconing mixes a typically action soul with rpg elements such as the characterization of the character, the search for items, weapons and powerups and a certain amount of customization not very typical in hack'n slash adventures. However, the world of this new DeathSpank appears to be a sort of guided tour rather than an ~open world~ in which we can get lost, explore and love. The adventure develops along an endless corridor made up of enemies and bosses, always well characterized and with strong ironic connotations, seasoned with intelligent and quite difficult puzzles, perhaps one of the most successful aspects of Backoning. Some novelties in the gameplay, such as the use of the shield, do not change the substance of the action much, always centered on the menar slashing right and left with a continuous no-brain action. To tell the truth, however, it is a very demanding and difficult game due to a very unfavorable global balance of the fights towards us. Hordes of enraged enemies are often difficult to escape, and healing ~potions~ cost too much to stockpile enough to withstand the largest waves. In essence, it is a question of attacking and defending on and off, having to resort to backtracking on more than one occasion to sow the enemies once they approach the gameover with no return. Luckily, these rather boring phases of the game are interspersed with well-designed and always very varied quests, in which we have to solve truly intelligent and challenging puzzles. All this also thanks to the massive use of the inventory, which always contains all the elements useful for completing a quest: keys, mechanisms, nuclear technologies, weapons, powerups, everything is essential in the world of DeathSpank to be able to proceed in the adventure. I knowThere are some completely new areas to visit which include a sort of playground, a very ~peculiar~ Las Vegas, the rest home for gods and the Polluted Lake, all quite suggestive even if not at the level of the first episode. The Backoning constantly mimics itself, resulting however in a sort of bad copy of the original: the gameplay is often boring and repetitive, the humor is not at an all-time high, even if it is always very pleasant, the fights too difficult. The constant sense of deja-vu may not give great satisfaction even to the old fans of Ron Gilbert's creature. Always at the top, however, the general design of the characters and the cartoonish graphics that give a fun and pleasant look to our eyes. Once again it is possible to play the adventure alongside a friend, but not through the online infrastructure - a pity. Definitely a must try before you buy.", "date": "2011-09-06", "grade": "6.2"}
