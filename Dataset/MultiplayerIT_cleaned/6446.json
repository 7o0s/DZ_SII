When the package including the game finally arrived, we immediately rushed to the guidelines dedicated to the review, to ascertain that the embargo would expire in four days. The first thing that came to mind was ~But in Sony they are crazy!~, to then agree that reviewing the title in that period of time would have made no sense: the 40-50 hours needed to strip it would have been too much tablets to mature a satisfactory judgment, with the risk also of triggering a constant race against time in which important phases such as exploration and secondary activities would have been heavily undermined. Bloodborne can be positioned as the fourth title of an Action RPG sub-genre created six years ago by From Software, in which the learning curve is steep but constant, a brutal kick in the player's butt, with the ultimate aim of making it videogame better. The first to use this type of approach was Demon's Souls, the memory of which still remains vivid in our minds. It was the Tokyo Game Show of 2008: in the Sony booth we were channeled into a sort of closed corridor, inside which there were the stations of this phantom title just announced. Pad in hand, we began to gain confidence in the might and apparent woodiness of these knights, immediately exclaiming ~U(nm)! How beautiful the armor and the setting!~ BAM, sword to the back and instant death. We tried again with determination and, while we faced the opponent with all the concentration in this world, another one sneaked up and took three quarters of our life. At this point, panicked and to avoid being hit, we fell downstairs. Oh well... from that moment our long epic with Soulslike began, which if placed in front of a mirror represent the direct emanation of Hidetaka Miyazaki. The talented Japanese designer actually cut his teeth with such a learning scale starting from the first-person directed Armored Cores, such as For Answer. Then came Demon's Souls, Dark Souls - the second chapter ~only~ supervised it - and Bloodborne, who fully expressed their peculiar ideas not only in terms of gameplay, but also in terms of narrative. Hidetaka Miyazaki studied Sociology and Psychology at university, has consumed a multitude of Western books and has always appreciated their many facets. It is no coincidence that his sensitivity has met the full taste of players from all over the globe, and this can be seen from the fantasy and medieval setting that characterized Demon's Souls. Mr. Miyazaki is a particular guy who looks up and takes his time when you ask him a challenging question, and then gives you answers that are never trivial and show how much his games are influenced by personal experience. He always believed that a story could be told without unnecessary rants, directly from the game world with visual references, cryptic sentences, happenings that people can wonder about if they want. It does not skimp on making fun of those on the other side of the pad, as in the case of Dark Souls which offered one that was completely useless among the starting objects, but accompanied by a phrase that many have racked their brains over. He has always believed that the gameplay of his titles should offer a punitive but not gratuitous approach, from which the player is called to improve and experiment how to deal with the next situation. To give a practical example, there is never a skill to know in advance what type of attack or element the enemy is weak to, you have to experience it on your own skin perhaps after an indefinite number of deaths. All that Hidetaka Miyazaki's titles offer is not accidental or the manifestation of a bad day; we after having cleaned Bloodborne well, having gone into the dungeons of Yharnam and played in multiplayer, we are finally able to express our definitive judgment. The detailed analysis of which we would like to start from a tweet we received a few hours ago from a reader, and which recites, verbatim the words ~the last time I had so much rejoicing over the defeat of a boss dates back to the 90s with Street Fighter and Mr. Bison on the SNES~. After more than fifty hours of gameplay, we are able to give you our final verdict on Bloodborne Playstation 4 trophies Bloodborne offers 34 trophies, most of which are hidden because they are linked to moments in historyor particular bosses. The rest are obtained by discovering the optional settings, obtaining all the glasses, upgrading a weapon to the maximum and so on. It takes several hours to platinum the game but there don't seem to be insurmountable objectives, they certainly aren't more so than the enemies present. The adventure begins The events of Bloodborne have the city of Yharnam as the protagonist, which sanctions a complete change of setting by From Software, recalling the cities of the late 1800s in Gothic and Victorian style. Mr. Miyazaki claimed to have also been inspired by the great architectures of eastern cities such as Prague, and in fact wandering around the game map it is possible to see large cathedrals, squares with an immediately recognizable style and in general a very dense and detailed conformation . Inserted in a decadent dispute, because this new intellectual property exclusively for PlayStation 4 tells of an open hunt every time the sunset arrives: ordinary people hide in the house, the streets are teeming with beasts and hunters, but this line always becomes thinner due to an undefined sore. The story of the main protagonist is even more complicated, because it is found in a context in which it is not clear exactly what is happening, and the danger is around the corner even from people who initially seem not to be hostile, or sane . In case of death, we start again in the vicinity of some lamps that act as a connection point; lamps that also allow you to reach the Hunter's Dream, a sort of central hub within which there are altars that can be used to awaken in already visited settings. The game world therefore offers two reading levels, which become three if we consider the underground dungeons of the chalice (we will come back to it later), a sort of hybrid that takes inspiration from Dark Souls for the possibility of moving between connected environments without loading , Demon's Souls for the presence of this central hub, a similar game rhythm and also for the presence of some settings that recall iconic places such as the Tower of Latria. Although Yharnam is the absolute protagonist of the game, able to offer a multitude of views, structures and sections to explore, Bloodborne offers a much larger scenario, between forbidden woods, magical cities, castles, nightmares and dreams that offer a different yet fascinating visual language. Let's take a step back first, however, once a new game has been selected, it is possible to access a rather complex character editor, which offers everything one would expect to customize the main protagonist. We have predefined general parameters, such as hair, beard, body type; or the ability to operate on specific features, on a single eye, eyebrows and so on. To reward this level of customization there are some slots in which you can save your creations, in order to recall them later. It should be noted that the protagonist of Bloodborne is the figure of the hunter in and of itself, and for this reason there is no subdivision into canonical classes, but a choice of initial origins, ranging from mild to difficult childhood, cruel or marked destiny ; this choice modifies the initial parameters, which as per tradition represent only a rather flexible starting point, given that it is then possible to develop any characteristic to adapt to one's style of play and use the weapons with which one has greater confidence. Vitality is added to the Resistance, represented by a green bar that is consumed when running and with each attack and dodge; Strength and Skill, Blood Tint, linked to the power of firearms, and Arcane, which among other things increases the chance of obtaining items from slain enemies. In Bloodborne there are no spells in the classic sense of the term, but it is possible to find weapons and infuse your own with elemental bonuses such as fire, electricity and arcane, parameters which vice versa are part of the defensive baggage of a protagonist who must also beware of enemy attacks that breed madness and poison. But how do you level up? Collecting the so-called Blood Echoes with each kill, which must be consumed within the Hunter's Dream to enhance the aforementioned characteristics and to satisfy the requests for some weapons. Be careful, though, because when you die Blood Echoes remain on the battlefield, and nearby beasts can absorb them to the point of having to kill them to recover all the loot. If you still die uOnce without having recovered it, it is lost forever, with consequent curses that always suggest having to plan the next move, perhaps spending the precious bargaining chip before facing a boss, unless you feel like a budding Pele. This feature of the ~soulslike~ can be very frightening at the beginning, but it is part of the dynamics that made this sub-genre famous, and in reality it is enough to calibrate oneself mentally to be able to grow the character, buy objects and generally progress in the course of the adventure. In fact, inside the Hunter's Dream there are some messengers who sell consumables, armor and weapons at the cost of Blood Echoes, others instead in exchange for Intuition Points (which we explain in the curiosities), which offer special objects that are unlocked gradually which continues in the story. From sunset to the end of the world We have finally reached the part relating to the control system and the combat system, which see some important innovations compared to the previous From Software titles. First of all in the interface: the Japanese developer has decided to change part of the command scheme following the feedback received with Dark Souls 2, separating the vials of blood, which restore energy, from the rest of the objects. They are activated with the triangle button, while the square is responsible for using the rest of the consumables, modifiers and offensive items. The circle, on the other hand, is used to run and use the absolute protagonist of the gameplay: dodging. Unlike the previous From Software titles, in fact, the setting of the fights suggests a more dynamic and aggressive type of approach, which will especially displace those who used the shield in the previous chapters. Shield which is also present here in a single wooden model, definitely a mockery by the developers: in Bloodborne you have to constantly avoid enemy attacks, anticipate them when possible, counterattack if you are hit, thanks to the so-called ~regain system~ which provides the possibility of recovering part of the lost energy if the blow is returned within a certain period of time. This system changes the cards on the table, and the technique of luring enemies to kill them comfortably remains valid only in rare cases, since they often attack en masse and from all sides, as well as being very aggressive in their range of moves. In the same way, being splendid and throwing yourself headlong into the fights means certain death: just deliver one blow too many and run out of resistance to not have the next dodge available, getting a blow that usually hurts like hell. Not to mention that even when you are quite sure that you have learned all the strategies of the opponents, a moment of distraction is enough to have the worst, and since there is so much variety and even a small evolution of the enemies during the adventure, in Bloodborne you can never be calm. In support of dodging there is a collection of weapons polished for the occasion: with R1 and R2 we usually have a fast and powerful attack, but now every offensive tool has a double combination that is activated with L1. For the ax it translates into single and double-handed grip, with a greater extension radius, the swords go from an agile version for the lunge to a classic two-handed broadsword, some hammers are imbued with electricity ... the nice is that it is possible to switch from one configuration to another even in the middle of a combo, load the shot by leaving it pressed and also alternate it with the other present introduction, or firearms. Left-handed, they feature single or repeating pistols, flamethrowers, cannons and more; their power is tied to the tint of blood and they are practically the only type of ranged attack. In general they don't do much damage, unless you use specific objects or upgrade them to the maximum, but they play a fundamental role above all because they allow you to interrupt the opponent's attack and guarantee an advantage to counterattack. In certain situations they can stun him, and at this point it is possible to perform a critical hit similar to the one from behind present in Dark Souls. The lock on enemies takes place with R3 and it is vital when they are single, a little less when you have to attack en masse, the camera occasionally throws tantrums but after a few hours you manage to have adequate control. All the weapons in Bloodborne have durability, can be evolved with special stones and also have one to three slots, within which the so-called blood gems can be freely embedded. Such gems enhance a whole range of characteristics not just alloy", "date": "2015-03-31", "grade": "9.5"}
