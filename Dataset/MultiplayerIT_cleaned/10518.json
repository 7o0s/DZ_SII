These were warriors of noble extraction, skilled in martial arts and in the use of the sword, who followed the code of honor of bushido. Given the absence of ties, Daisuke Shimada, the protagonist of Samurai: Way of the Warrior, could be more likened to a ~ronin~, or a samurai without a master. During his wanderings, Daisuke sees a woman in danger and rushes to save her, killing her assailants. These are not just any henchmen, but the servants of Hattoro, an evil and powerful daimyo who governs his territory with an iron fist, spreading terror and anguish among the population. Hattoro is not only cruel, but also smart: he surrounds himself with warriors endowed with extraordinary dexterity, able to protect him from any assault and at the same time to quell any revolts dictated by desperation. Faced with such a situation, Daisuke can't ignore it: thanks to his convictions and his experience in combat, he decides to declare war on Hattoro's army and to free the region from his evil influence. Samurai! Dressing! Developed by the newly formed Mad Finger Games, Samurai: Way of the Warrior presents iPhone owners with a really exciting load of new features. The game uses the screen in portrait mode (vertical, therefore) and puts us in the shoes of Daisuke Shimada in his fight against the forces of Hattoro, using an undoubtedly original control system: you have to touch the screen in a certain point because the character moves in that direction, while the combat is regulated by a series of gestures translate into as many blows of variable effectiveness. For example, drawing a line downwards gives rise to a vertical slash which in some cases can literally cut our opponent in half. Quickly drawing two converging vectors instead triggers a double maneuver that cuts off limbs and heads. The further you go on in the game, the greater the number of moves that can be performed, shown in a special screen to be stored. The gameplay is simple and linear, in practice you have to explore the locations in search of enemies and kill them all to complete the stage. Between one level and another we will be able to enjoy the superb manga-style sequences that tell the evolution of the story, while from the start screen it is possible to try your hand at a secondary mode which represents a sort of ~survival~ to all intents and purposes. Bow down to the shogun The strengths of the game undoubtedly reside in its technical realization, which makes use of cel shading to represent environments and characters. The results are fantastic, thanks also to an excellent use of colors and scrolling that is always fluid and free of uncertainties. Daisuke has a good set of animations, also seen the high number of moves that can be performed, and at the same time his opponents are eliminated in the most gruesome ways, ending up in pieces under the blows of the sword while their blood is spread on the ground . The scenarios are beautiful to look at, profoundly different from each other and designed with great attention to detail. You never find yourself walking roads that feel like they've been ~forced~ with graphics, and that's important. The sound accompanies the clashes as best it could, thanks to melodies perfectly in line with the oriental atmosphere. The effects do their job convincingly.
