To give greater completeness to the entire project, Cameron wanted to closely follow every step of the development of the film tie-in, entrusted to the hands of Ubisoft who carried out the pioneering challenge of wanting to legitimize the same 3D technology of which the film also within the game of the same name. It was immediately realized that this implementation would have cost some compromises, in addition to the fact that the use of true 3D for all videogame users still remains a utopia today. At this point we need to understand if the efforts made have paid off and if with James Cameron's Avatar they have given us an enjoyable product beyond the mere three-dimensional issues. pandorapedia The events develop on the surface of the planet Pandora, characterized by a thriving vegetation and by a native population with humanoid features, the Na'vi, with marked tribal characteristics and who live in a particular state of symbiosis with the nature of the planet itself. Already from the selection of our character it is clear how during the story we will be called to impersonate both a human and a Na'vi, who represent the two sides fighting for control of the planet. The campaign begins in the role of a soldier who has just arrived from the earth and after a very few hours of play a narrative crossroads forces the player to decide which side to take: that of the invaders of the RDA, or whether to take the defense of the Na'vi in their fight for their homeland. Not two distinct campaigns but only one which, if wanted to completely dissect, requires to be replayed from the beginning a second time. Proceeding by missions gives us the opportunity to unlock and visit numerous areas of the planet, these are particularly vast and can be explored throughout their surface almost as if we were in an episode of the GTA series. In each game area there are missions to unlock and secondary objectives to achieve, all integrated into the level design of the area that can be explored in its entirety thanks to the use of vehicles or creatures, both aerial and terrestrial. Great importance has been placed in proposing a credible and deeply characterized world down to the smallest detail, the game in fact boasts its own encyclopedia called ~Pandorapedia~ which offers some information about each element of the universe created by James Cameron, from information on the fauna and flora of Pandora to those on the Na'vi up to the technical data sheets regarding the structures of the humans and the tutorials on the means to command and on the creatures to ride. The number of Pandorapedia entries can also be expanded by allowing the player to scan the environment with a scanner that closely resembles the one used in Metroid Prime. Lost Pandora During our wandering through the inhospitable jungles of Pandora we have to deal with numerous dangers posed by the flora and fauna of the planet and by the bluish natives, if we are wreaking havoc as a human, or by the invading army of the RDA if decide to embrace the noble cause of the Na'vi. In the first case, the gameplay closely resembles that of Lost Planet, with the camera behind the character and the selection of weapons through the d-pad together with a third-person aiming system without any zoom on the weapon. The action is fast and sometimes confusing, thanks to a camera placed at a non-optimal distance from the character and the dense vegetation which often helps to hide our assailant. The human campaign is certainly more fun even if the overwhelming war superiority of the RDA and the use of particularly effective military means on the battlefield flatten the difficulty of the game excessively downwards. Fighting among the ranks of the bluish natives appears not equally convincing, in this case we must mainly turn to hand-to-hand combat by exploiting the physical superiority of the aliens. Boring and repetitive, this facet of the campaign does not offer stimuli or particular memorable moments that encourage you to continue it. To give greater depth to the clashes, a fair number of skills come in handy that can be unlocked or enhanced by accumulating experience and which reflect the peculiar and technological characteristics of humans (such as a request for an air attack) or the innate fusion of the Na'vi with the nature of their home planet. In addition to the enhancement of the variousskills, the accumulation of experience in combat leads to obtaining new weapons and armor always following a pre-set reward scheme. Some bosses contribute to giving a little variety to the fights which, even if they do not require a particular technique to be right on them, still offer a greater challenge than the excessive ease of the campaign. On the other hand, the longevity is really limited, which settles down to just 5 hours if you dedicate yourself only to the main missions, the latter being excessively repetitive and trivial and the expedient of the double campaign is not enough to raise the general opinion. Risk Avatar To facilitate movement within the large game areas, in addition to the use of human means and wild beasts, the teleporters scattered in numerous strategic points that can be used once activated run to the aid, this resource is present for both commandable species by the player who, however, use different and independent elements to move. Another function of teleporters is to be able to access a secondary game called Conquest. This strategic mode offers a three-dimensional representation of the entire planet Pendora divided into several colored areas of different colors, red or blue, depending on whether they are under the control of humans or Na'vi. In each area it is possible to locate, credits permitting, support bases and defenses of various kinds, in addition to the mobilization and creation of troops divided, in order of strength, between infantry, land vehicles and flying units. Following an alternation of turn-based action, just like in the famous risky board game, we have the task of conquering all the areas of the enemy, consequently becoming the sole masters of the planet, the clashes develop following a numerical criterion, which can be influenced by the presence of fortification or higher-level unit. Surely this is a very welcome accessory feature, which can help lengthen the stock of a campaign that runs out too quickly and which gives a lot of satisfaction, as well as a good number of bonuses that can be enjoyed in the main game. Xbox 360 goals James Cameron's Avatar is not very generous with regards to points and objectives, many of which are secret or unlockable during the campaign or in multiplayer, while a large part of the loot is destined for those who manage to complete all the submissions of every area available on Pandora. 3D or not 3D Useless waste of resources or new frontier of video games? Certainly James Cameron's Avatar will not dispel all the doubts that revolve around the use of 3D technology in videogames, especially because it is obvious that the vast majority of users still do not have the right equipment (read a high-definition television that support it) in order to enjoy this technical marvel. For the lucky few who have a suitable TV, we refer to our field test to evaluate the influence of three-dimensionality on the game. Lived in normal mode, Avatar denotes some compromises due to the implementation of the new feature, noticeable especially in the field of dynamic lighting, shaders and various effects that are absent from the scene, but the general impact is certainly very good and enhanced by the total absence of aliasing. An applause goes to the programmers for the creation of Pandora's environments which offer truly admirable naturalistic scenarios that convey the sensation of an ecosystem as fascinating as it is hostile, but still alive and dynamic. The number of polygons used does not make one cry for a miracle, but it is never deficient or crude. These results were obtained thanks to a careful and appreciable work in the artistic direction phase, rather than resorting to mere graphic opulence, the latter certainly being the most successful aspect of the whole package.", "date": "2009-12-02", "grade": "6.6"}
