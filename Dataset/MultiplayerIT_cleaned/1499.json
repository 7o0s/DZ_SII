{"name": "Outlaw Volleyball", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/outlaw-volleyball_a.html", "text": "Hot sand As many as 16 bizarre characters are waiting for you to tread the most infamous beach volleyball fields you've ever seen, from the suburban neighborhood to the sewers, passing through the Arctic (!) and even a jungle. The insane group of jocks has it all: Pamela Anderson and Britney Spears weirdos, street gangsters, heavy metal singers, shifty hedonists and London punk anarchists, there's enough to satisfy the most insane tastes. At the beginning there are only four available, to unlock the rest, in addition to the many available clothes, it will be necessary to progress through the game. The characterization is clearly demented-comic, as well as the presence of the infamous super shots, which make the ball a fiery comet ready to unleash devastating atomic mushrooms on the field. If we add a good number of additional follies to this, which make the sphere a timed explosive device, or allow sticks of dynamite to be deposited in the opposing half, the picture of an arcade completely devoted to entertainment becomes decidedly clear. The embellishment cuts after the conclusion of a play are hilarious, in which the protagonists try their hand at improbable entr'actes. Malice at full throttle, like Shawnee shooting down her faithful eagle that stole her ball with an arrow, and it's just one example of what awaits you. As icing on the cake, the player is allowed, through a specific command, to unleash furious fights between two athletes, functional to the increase of the turbo bar for the execution of the aforementioned superstrokes. In this case the game turns into a mini-fight with encounters, albeit remaining a substantially limited addition. For the rest, the basic rules of volleyball are followed, with an interesting combined action pointing system. In a nutshell, the reception / attack requires the player to press and hold the respective keys to establish the power of the blow, and at the same time direct a special cursor using the analog stick to establish its direction. A procedure that is certainly simpler in practice than in theory, which is also well explored in the hilarious internal tutorial. live enabled! We thoroughly tested Outlaw Volleyball's online features and got very good impressions. The service fully supports the features of the game, it will therefore be possible to play by establishing the various rules to be applied on the field (bombs, explosive ball, etc.). Interesting is the possibility of being able to exploit both the character's default skills and those altered with mini-games in game, while paired games can be played via four separate consoles (as opposed to Top Spin). We encountered minimal lag during testing, which allowed for smooth matches. Endless summer The most appropriate term to describe what happens on the pitch is: casino!. Apocalyptic explosions, breathtaking twists, shameless display of roundness and blindfolded blows. Nothing is to be taken seriously in this gaming celebration of the most extreme trash-competitiveness, and fun is guaranteed. Provided there are many, since OV was born in the name of collective use, a feature that makes Live support a crucial component (further details in the appropriate box). Little remains to the single player, limited to a tour mode that fails to make up for the lack of human counterpart, and a series of mini-games along the lines of Virtua Tennis 2, functional to improve the characteristics of your character. These special skill tests also align perfectly with the spirit of the game, distinguishing themselves with overflowing humor. Just to name one, we will have to learn the dunks under the net in a sort of Space Invaders, in which the aim will be to knock down the public engaged in a delirious collective dance! Technically the work done by Hypnotix is valuable, and even if the presence of sporadic clicks remains, the Microsoft hardware shows its qualities. The textures are well made, while a totally polygonal field goes well with an excellent modeling of the athletes. The shots available have been increased favoring, in addition to the standard bird's eye view, another dynamic type (actually a bit chaotic in certain situations). Of course, it's not all rosy, the anatomical softness achieved by Team Ninja with DOAX is still far away, the figures often have a sense of Poser-like plasticity, which doesn't make them very credible. This is particularly noticeable in the animations of the fighting game section, decidedly approximate when compared to the rest. In any case, these are negligible details in a contesto generally more than appreciable. The audio department shares the same quality, with a rich and overwhelming soundtrack, and a commentator whose expressions have very little to envy to the sickly climate that pervades the game. The aforementioned Live support is great, but its success will largely be dictated by the community that will build around it. Comment The concept is simple: if EA Big doesn't play beach volleyball, Hypnotix will do it! The TDK product definitely winks at the irreverent team responsible for SSX and NBA Street, but with a greater propensity for excess. The suburban trash look, the numerous sexual allusions and a demented-anarchist flavor are all highly distinctive elements, which may not be liked by everyone. For our part, we appreciate a caciarone arcade, immediate and hilarious, which adds Live support to the excellent gaming department, in the name of an almost infinite longevity. Green light therefore for the craziest beaches ever seen on the crusader shores, even if the peculiar characteristics require us to recommend trying them before proceeding with the purchase. Pros: Excellent graphics Immediate and fun Live Cons: Shallow singles Some slowdowns Ehm To bed the children! Tecmo with DOAX has rekindled the desire for volleyball, skimpy players and hot sand. TDK also decided to put a game behind it, isn't that commendable? For us who can't get enough of it, certainly yes, and after the good impressions aroused by the promising beta tested some time ago (see preview), we can happily confirm its goodness. On the other hand, the press release is already clear: ~Sex, humor, lot's of gameplay plus XBox Live!~, All of this is fully reflected in the product that you will find in the best shops within days.", "date": "2003-11-06", "grade": null}
