Naughty Dog, the true symbol of the PlayStation consoles, took several months to make the first and only single player expansion available for the game, and its purpose is very specific: to tell the evolution of Ellie, from a helpless girl to an expert survivor fully armed and aware of how to deal with danger. In fact, Left Behind alternates moments before what is told in The Last of Us to other contemporaries to its plot, on which we will defer in order not to spoil the surprise. The former tell of a girl who, although born during the epidemic, is still in the training phase and is not ready to face the Clickers and the other mutants in the various stages of the infection, also because she is confined to a quarantine area. Riley is one of her closest friends; after 45 days apart, the two find each other and decide to run around, in spite of the soldiers who control the area and the fact that Riley has entered the Lights. This part of the expansion is all about discovery, a sincere story that increasingly highlights the relationship between the two girls, who explore, tell each other, smile, argue and spend some carefree time. Naughty Dog confirms its excellence in applying a narrative layer to the typical interaction of a video game, involving the player even when he simply moves between settings without doing much, but imagining what could happen if sooner or later something were to happen to interrupt the exploratory idyll of the two protagonists. There are many activities to do in this sense, such as playing with bricks and competing to see who destroys the most glass, up to turning the power back on in a shopping centre. And here we discover a carousel that is still semi-functional, a machine for taking passport photos, a mask shop that becomes the perfect place to joke and try on disguises, regardless of the world out there which has become so harsh and bad. The dialogues are never trivial and always interesting, there are some optional ones but the setting leads to exploring while learning about the past and the relationship between the two girls. Among other things, we will be able to better understand the future events of The Last of Us. Left Behind is a small, great adventure that makes us feel empathy for its protagonists Playstation 3 trophies The Last of Us: Left Behind adds 8 trophies to the original game, which are obtained by completing the story on all difficulty levels (including Survivor), by performing specific actions during the adventure and by collecting the documents and recordings scattered around the map of game. Be kind, rewind The classic action and combat parts are left to the more ~adult~ Ellie, with whom you are immediately at ease even in the collection of bandages and other parts that are used to create healing kits, smoke bombs and explosives. In terms of gameplay we have sections to deal with preferably stealth (death penalty), others even more unpublished within which we come across hostile survivors and Clicker / Runner at the same time: in this case the best tactic is to ~unleash ~ the latter towards the former, then get rid of the few remaining victorious from the battle. As offensive weapons, the classic knife is available, perfect when attacking enemies from behind, the bow and the pistol, which we used ~a lot~ in the final part of the expansion. Our adventure with Left Behind lasted exactly two hours and thirty minutes; if we had to make a proportion, the part dedicated to the clashes can be quantified at most in a third, this is because evidently Naughty Dog still had something new to tell the player, less in terms of gameplay. From the point of view of the title, this choice is understandable and actually makes it quite good; incidentally, we would really like a possible follow-up of the same bill. From a technical point of view Left Behind still defends itself very well: the detail of the textures and the setting remains one of the maximum points touched by PlayStation 3, and looking at what the title offers, it is hard to think that titles that are difficult to watch run on the same platform , released recently. The close-ups during the dialogues remain excellent and the variety of some of the shops in the mall give a hint of freshness in terms of visuals. The music remains the masterful one created by the Oscar winner Gustavo Alfredo Santaolalla: it is always a pleasure to listen to and is perfect to accompany the progress of the adventure, even when it is underlined only by background noise or light musical tones. The Last of Us: Left Behind ultimately wants to tell the story of Ellie, in which way she grew up and how she discovered that she could be the cure for the epidemic; it does it in a wonderful way like the original title, and overshadows the gameplay component which, although reduced, presents a summary of the original title with the small novelty of being able to exploit the infected to one's advantage. It is easy to recommend this expansion to those who have enjoyed the game, but keeping in mind the strengths mentioned above and a certainly not exceptional duration in relation to the purchase price, set at  14.99.", "date": "2014-02-14", "grade": null}
