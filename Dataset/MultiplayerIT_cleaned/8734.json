It's hard to get used to the unbridled speed of the elegant vehicles (or aircraft?) that battle each other with missiles in the metropolis of the future, but the progressive sensation of improvement is a satisfaction that is difficult to silence. The appointment with Wipeout, at least once if not twice per generation, is essential and it is a pleasure to see it in the initial line-up of the new Sony console, as happened more than ten years ago on the occasion of the launch of the very first PlayStation console, also because it is undoubtedly one of the most visually spectacular titles available for PlayStation Vita. If you've been looking for a game to complement Uncharted: Golden Abyss and Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 to flex the muscles of your new console, you've found it. With these premises, one might think that one of the best Wipeouts ever is in one's hands, unfortunately some flaw intervenes to deny it excellence... Speed racers! At its core, Wipeout 2048 is always the usual Wipeout, and this is certainly a good thing given that after years of improvements, any too much modification could compromise a delicate balance that now characterizes the mechanics of the franchise. For the uninitiated, Wipeout races take place between futuristic anti-gravity vehicles that basically ~slide~ on the asphalt. The absence of a clutch means that the vehicle is controlled significantly different from what you are generally used to in other driving games and for all those who have never played it or have lost the habit, the first few minutes, as we said in opening can be excruciating, continually punctuated by collisions and sudden swerves. Once you understand how to properly use the only two buttons used to move the vehicle, one button to accelerate and one to brake, a little practice is enough to transform the Wipeout 2048 races into an elegant ballet where three other factors get in the way: the opponents, defensive power-ups and weapons. In this version for PlayStation Vita the various bonuses that can be acquired by sliding on the appropriate yellow or green panels play an even more important role depending on the mission we are facing: the Campaign mode is in fact structured in a decidedly interesting way and unfolds through a series of races with the most diverse objectives. In some we'll have to earn points by beating our opponents, in another we'll have to finish at least fifth, in some races we'll just have to do our best and break a record and so on. Each mission is represented by a hexagon on a sort of map that develops branching laterally, therefore the player has the opportunity to choose the next mission to face, heading towards new challenges that will allow us to expand our fleet of vehicles, characterized by different values of acceleration, control, defensive power and so on. The Campaign mode for a single player of Wipeout 2048 is not particularly demanding but within a handful of races it becomes increasingly important to learn how to control your car perfectly and, above all, memorize the configuration of the various tracks. The latter is a common practice in driving games and in the Wipeout series especially, as it helps to predict the position of accelerator panels, shortcuts, power-ups scattered throughout the track. Knowing when to start leaning the car to take a corner a second before your opponents can make the difference between victory and defeat, especially in this version in which the guys from Studio Liverpool have literally indulged themselves with the creation of really complex tracks. full of detail and realism. The overall glance is truly exceptional, not only for the always captivating and modern style of locations and cars, but also and above all for the elaborate variety of panoramas and the multitude of particle effects that whiz around us on the splendid screen of the handheld. All this goodness comes at a price: unlike the previous Wipeout HD for PlayStation 3 and its 60 fps, Wipeout 2048 ~simply~ sports thirty granite frames per second, a truly impressive result that does not affect the general experience in the slightest. Playstation 3 trophies The Wipeout 2048 Trophies are not many but collectors will have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts to unlock 14 Bronze, 9 Silver, 6 Gold and Platinum Trophies. You will have to make perfect laps in various tracks, complete the campaign, play the multiplayer mode for a long time and, in general, know the various pthis. Too fast to notice The visual and structural complexity of the tracks unfortunately contributes to making the approach of a novice much more difficult, despite the satisfaction that follows after having played and learned enough. This on the other hand is a minor problem, Wipeout 2048 has some a bit more obnoxious. The most obvious one is certainly the duration of the loadings: despite the installation of the patch specifically released to reduce them, the loading of the various races can take up to forty or forty-five seconds of time; a decidedly unfortunate amount for a portable console and a game that should lend itself to quick games, perhaps on urban vehicles. Thumbs down also for the peculiar control system developed taking advantage of the motion sensor integrated in the hardware, decidedly frustrating, imprecise and uncomfortable. On the other hand, the performance of the analog stick is excellent, which once again proves to be precise and functional. We haven't mentioned the excellent soundtrack, some fifteen tracks composed by artists who need no introduction including Kraftwerk, Orbital and the Chemical Brothers. We have left the multiplayer component for last, which deserves a wider discussion and has a particular impact on the final evaluation. Wipeout 2048 takes advantage of some new PlayStation Vita features in a truly ingenious way to enrich a multiplayer mode which, on the other hand, leaves something to be desired. While playing it is possible to receive real-time alerts of the records and progress of friends in the contact list and it is also possible to take a picture of yourself before a race to show it to the competitors; the game also supports cross-play with owners of Wipeout HD/Fury for PlayStation 3, with which it is possible to compete on the same tracks. The multiplayer mode itself, on the other hand, is structured in a fairly original way: in fact, the players are thrown into ~mission~ races exactly like in the single-player campaign and must test themselves in the most diverse ways. Sometimes you just need to participate, other times you have to cross the finish line before the others, in other more intricate cases you have to hit a specific opponent with a certain weapon. The multiplayer campaign has two great advantages: firstly, it's a nice diversion from the usual single-issue races; moreover, it allows you to compete without huge disadvantages against the most experienced players in terms of speed and knowledge of the slopes. Unfortunately, however, it is also a mode that is not very configurable by the player, who is at the mercy of the pre-set rules, without having any control over them. Instead, it is possible to configure ad hoc multiplayer games, but always within certain limits, but the lack of a more customizable multiplayer mode is still felt.", "date": "2012-02-22", "grade": "8.0"}
