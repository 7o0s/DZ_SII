{"name": "Disney's Doug: Doug's Big Game", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disneys-doug-dougs-big-game.html", "text": "IN THE GAME The game was developed by NewKidCo, a house specializing in video games for children, which mainly operates by taking licenses from the vast world of cartoons, while UbiSoft has exclusive rights for European distribution. The title offers a simple and apt structure: the game is divided into missions; each mission consists of two parts, an initial exploration and a final one in which you will transform into a flying super hero who, complete with shooting and multidirectional scrolling, will have to face the boss who prevents the continuation of your adventure. According to the time it will take you to complete each mission, the plot will evolve differently, presenting you with different endings. During the exploration you will wander around the locations of Bluffington (you can move via a video map that appears by pressing START) talking to the inhabitants and looking for clues that lead you to Patti Mayonnaise. Longevity is either infinite or non-existent - it's up to you. To complete the game you need 4 missions (at the end of each one you will be given a password that will allow you to pick up where you left off); in any case, every time you start the game over you will find new situations or perhaps some already faced arranged in a different way, so there is an extreme replayability factor. In any case, do not tremble because throughout the search you will be accompanied by your faithful dog and by the ~logbook~ (operated with SELECT) which informs you about what your current objective is, the pennies you own and the objects you you hold. With the money you will collect in the various locations (school, shopping centres, parks, candy shops...), you will be able to use the telephone booths scattered everywhere to receive information and advice on how to find your Patti. The accompanying music is nice and pleasant, while the sound effects are those of the GameBoy: croaking and irresistible. WHAT TO SAY You will have clearly understood that the game is aimed at a very young audience. However, I must warn you because the product is completely in English and I know few 10-12 year olds who master the Anglo-Saxon vocabulary well enough to enjoy it 100%. I confess that I enjoyed playing it a lot, especially for the funny situations I had to solve and the sweet and imaginative style that accompanies these adventurous walks around Bluffington. Obviously I don't know whether to advise you to spend a hundred thousand lire for this title, but I can tell you that it's an excellent gift for your nephew, little brother and company (then you'll probably play with it); moreover you can always rent it to spend an evening with friends because the title is well done, cute and fun. And finally... PRO long-lived carefree imaginative CONS completely in English especially for children Useful Links Nintendo Gameboy UbiSoft Disney of Europe NewKidCo LET'S GET INTRODUCED There were times when the arid and sterile wind of reason and division did not blow, but there was only a great dance; days when it was enough to close your eyes to fly in joy: do you remember? Do we remember? It seems to me that I too spent whole days solving my quests and turning into a super hero as soon as there was a need... I think, but I don't remember exactly anymore. Doug is one of Disney's little heroes who wanders around the town of Bluffington with all his friends and supporting actors, but now, if you want, you will also see him pass on your GameBoy. The reason for this passage is easy to tell: our favorite beard (girl, friend, damsel) Patti Maionese, didn't show up for our appointment, where will she be, with whom will she be, is she fine, does she still love us? You will answer these and other insidious questions by participating as protagonists in his research.", "date": "2001-08-01", "grade": null}
