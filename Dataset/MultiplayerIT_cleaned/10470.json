{"name": "Non solo per Metallari!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71248-brutal-legend-non-solo-per-metallari.html", "text": "Version tested: PlayStation 3Metal will never die, even in times like these dominated by boy bands and pathetic schools of rock. Eddie Riggs knows something about it, the greatest roadie in the world, orphaned of the old sound of the 70s, indeed of the early 70s, forced to earn his bread to work for a (hip) pop metal band, Kabbage Boy, which he hates Sincerely. The story begins right during the concert of these very truzzissimi and very fake metalheads. To save one of the group Eddie ends up under the collapsed stage, a drop of his blood wets the buckle of his belt, summoning an Ancient One, a flaming Balrog-like beast that incinerates the sad musicians and transports Eddie into his world, a sort of epic metal version of Middle-earth. Here he will have to help the human resistance led by the very blond Lars to free themselves from the yoke of the perfidious Dovicolous and his human acolytes, such as the metalhead, with a glam 80s look Lionwhyte, made up and worn out like a vintage Nikki Six. It is therefore understood that everything is played on the edge of parody and humor, a distinctive feature of the works of the good Tim. Of guitar and axe The structure of the game has the basic characteristics of a hack'n'slash in an open world, but it is immediately discovered that the creature of the great Tim Schafer, or the mind behind titles that have made history such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango and more recently the beautiful but unfortunate Psychonauts, is not a trivial action title. Brutal Legend hides different genres behind the surface of a rough fighting game: stealth, racing game, free roaming, bland rpg, rhythm game and just to make sure you don't miss anything, even robust real-time strategy phases. Eddie, with voice and features of Jack Black, has two main weapons, his Clementine guitar, with fiery riffs to play like in Rock Band and a huge double axe. As you progress through the game, following the main quest, but above all by carrying out the many (and too similar) secondary missions, unrelated to the main story, you earn tributes of fire, or the hard cash of the game. This can be spent in the forges scattered around the world managed by a highly inspired and shrewd Ozzy Osbourne, to learn new combos, to equip the ax or guitar with additional damage bonuses (fire, lightning...), to modify the machine by adding rostrums, turbos or new weapons and so on. The secondary missions as previously written are very many, unfortunately repetitive, but they must still be undertaken since the game is not very generous in paying tributes. So here we are engaged in car duels with a sort of ogre in ghetto pimp sauce, or hunting for porcupines and various animals, ambushing enemies or defending an outpost by loading our armed car on a turret or acting as a forward observer for a mortar. The possibilities are many, and at any time it is possible to postpone a main quest to dedicate ourselves to these, but the impression is that these alternative missions are just a gimmick to give the game a free roaming look, necessary for character development but with zero connections with the story and except for a few cases with the characters you meet going forward. Another way to earn tribute is to look for the various artifacts, statues, observation points and relics (like Ozzy's forge or those that give us new riffs) to activate around the map. Playstation 3 trophies Brutal Legend rewards the player with 51 trophies, the bronze ones are almost all obtained with the simple progression in the game, being related to victories in individual chapters, or to a certain number of secondary missions completed. The silver and gold ones are more difficult, however, they are unlocked for example by completing the game in the various difficulty levels, winning numerous multiplayer games or buying all possible upgrades. The coveted platinum trophy is achieved by winning all previous trophies. General Eddie Eddie does not fight alone, in addition to the beautiful and tormented Ophelia, in the village of Bladehenge he gets to know members of the men's resistance, the aforementioned Lars and his sister Lita. Not only do these characters play a prominent role in the story (which will undergo an unexpected and serious twist towards the middle), but they allow our combat roadie to carry out devastating combined attacks, each with a particular style. Later, the group will increase in number, and Brancaleone will become a real army. More than supporting actors, we are talking about units, each with its own strengths and weaknesses to know by hand to exploit them to perfection. So here are the Razor Girls, very blond and very backcombedme Charlie's Angels style armed with a sort of rifle derived from a mechanical boar, the headbangers, the first to be freed from exploitation in the Lionwhyte mine, capable of headbutting enemies, but above all of forming a sort of defensive tortoise around Eddie, the dwarf roadies with their gigantic amplifiers smashing structures or the giants with gigantic fists and tiny heads, modeled on Tenacious D. There is no shortage of wheeled vehicles, such as the ambulance chopper of the Motorhead holy man Lemmy or a sort of flyable crossbow tank personally. All this list to say that Brutal Legend in some key moments of the narrative takes the license to abandon its being hack'n'slash to become a real-time strategy to all intents and purposes. Since the game basically tells us the story of the clash between metal and other musical genres, such as hair metal and later emo/gothic, what better than a battle between stages for domination over fans and the industry musical? The game abandons the endless lands and focuses on vast arenas where you have to control the fan geysers on which to build the T-shirt stands, this is the only way to strengthen the loyalty of your aficionados. Here you can buy new units, upgrade your stage to enable heavy troops, all while paying attention to the maximum personnel cap present. Eddie then becomes a full-fledged general, but always present to take to the battlefield. Going down is the right term as at a certain point in history our roadie will earn bat wings (which makes us doubt his true nature), with which to fly over the arena, facilitating the task of leading the troops. There are many commands to memorize, not very immediate to be honest, in fact it will be very easy to get confused in the first moments of the game. Multi event multi fun? It is possible to summon the rally point standard, perform the general call riff of all one's army, manage all the troops present in the vicinity or give single orders to specialized units (the roadies thanks to their stealth skills can be sent silently to destroy the static defenses of the opponent's stage). There is all the sampling of an RTS scaled down to be used as part of a wider context and in fact you have to play these sections not as a minigame but with the tactical attitude of a true strategic. It all works quite well, a bit cumbersome at the beginning given the lack of a real tutorial, but however well done these sections, which should be the culmination of the battle for the freedom of the earth, turn out to be a bit too much on their own standing, breaking the narrative and the pace of the game too much. In fact, it is better to coordinate your men in the ~normal~ moments of the game, in which to attack large groups of enemies or defend your tour bus rather than stopping to fight in closed arenas. To reiterate the extreme variety of game situations, Tim Schafer is not satisfied with creating an action that suddenly becomes a strategic one, but between a flaming ax blow and a face-smashing riff, the game also engages us in missions in which we must settle a union dispute (?!) in a mine, act as an armed escort for our bus, escape Lyonwhite's collapsing Tony Montana-esque pleasure mansion, repair a collapsed bridge, capture (Empire Strikes Again fashion) then ride some strange metallic fire-breathing animals, not before having made the acquaintance of the tribe of women living in the swamps, made up and (un)dressed like Kiss. Plus there are huge end-of-level bosses too! This is the beauty of Brutal Legend, a powerful, ironic and engaging narrative, at the service of an inventive and varied gameplay, full of things to do, never banal, except for the necessary side quests, which in practice can be played with pleasure with a smile always on his face. The only perplexities concern a certain global fragmentation of the gameplay and linearity of the main quest. The missions are all quite short, with a good rhythm and fortunately they don't force us to long wanderings around the map, but thanks to the secondary missions, all the same, they don't enhance the free roaming aspect of the game. In fact everything is very rigid and guided even if it is possible to decide when to do what, the epic breath of the story is interrupted when you are forced to earn the dozen tributes necessary for the expansion or for yet another clash between armies. On the multiplayer side the game focuses on the battle between stages, both against the CPU and withmany human adversaries. In this case there is very little to say, without the ironic and grotesque background of the single player, playing a pure RTS, but obviously limited and simplified, does not have much appeal although everything works very well. If in normal conditions they seem partially unrelated to the context, in this case the battles between armies are completely detached from the spirit of the game, being neither too funny as an extra for an action title nor too deep as a strategic one in the strict sense. Metal for everyone The metal flows powerfully in Brutal Legend, although Eddie prefers only that of the early 70s, the soundtrack is an epic ride in all the branches in which the genre has evolved over the years, not even drawing brutal doom or death pieces. There are about 100 songs, impossible to write them all, alongside historical groups such as Manowar, Motrhead, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer we also find ~new generation~ such as In Flames, Cradle of Filth, Mastodon, DragonForce and many others. An extremely varied and complete selection, let's hope that in the future a nice Rock Band: Brutal Legend or at least a soundtrack on a double CD will come out, but a nice black vinyl like the one on the opening menu would be the real icing on the cake. Beautiful, not beautiful From a technical point of view, the game has two faces. Tim Schafer's visceral love for metal (and for videogames tout court) is present and palpable in every texture, in every single polygon of the game. But before the artistic / technical side it is right to talk about the goodness of the staging of the game. Brutal Legend is many things and among these it certainly stands out being an intimately comic production, full of jokes, gags, effective shots in the wake of the best American TV series or comic cartoons. Everything is willfully over the top, from the way characters are introduced, to the locations, to Eddie's own attacks. Unforgettable is the entrance of Lars, dressed as a warrior of the night, intent on scowling at the horizon perched on a statue/sword 100 meters high, or how not to enjoy Eddie's self-satisfied expression when sliding incinerates enemies with a searing riff. In short, the characterization of the heroes, the general design of the world are the real flagship of the game. On a purely artistic level, Double Fine's teamwork is simply exceptional, Brutal Legend is capable, based on the 70's metal imagery painted on the album covers, of sending an extremely peculiar and original universe to video, in which the classic topos of adventure genre are distorted under the lens of heavy metal. Metal is present everywhere, the forges are nothing more than engines protruding from the ground, in the village of Bladehenge scattered instead of wooden crates there are instrument and amplifier cases, the enemies ride large fire-breathing chrome motorcycles, the first boss, a snake full of beaks has well-shaped model legs as its weak point, and then there are all the supporting actors, from the fire barons dressed in leather and studded like the shady Blue Oyster Bar goers, to the basic infantry, the aforementioned headbangers with huge necks and Axel Rose-style bandanas. In short, the game is full of quotes, references and easter eggs, whoever knows how to catch them all will enjoy playing the title doubly. Unfortunately, however, such opulence in the artistic direction does not always correspond to a perfect translation in coldly technical terms. Brutal Legend certainly cannot be taken as a paradigm for the quality of modeling, the characters as well as the endless lands of the game world are certainly not free from defects. The overall look is of great impact, but valuable textures such as those of the tour bus and the bosses are often alternated with decidedly dull and flat ones. The game delights us with fluid animations, copious splatter and an almost always granite frame rate even in the most agitated stage battles with dozens of units on the screen, but at the same time it afflicts us with numerous examples of pop ups in the evocative valleys of the game. Ultimately, the highly inspired artistic work only partially manages to hide a more than discreet graphic substance, but in the face of such an excellent characterization of the Brutal Legend universe, one can safely turn a blind eye to this criticality. Absolutely top notch the soundtrack that deserves a separate box and the dubbing work, which luckily remained in English with Italian subtitles. Brilliant dialogues, lightning-fast jokes, profanity and various cursing in rain (which can however be deactivated with a nice initial skit) and paradoxical situations are recited", "date": "2009-10-14", "grade": "8.3"}
