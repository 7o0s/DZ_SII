{"name": "Yaga: The Roleplaying Folktale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yaga-the-roleplaying-folktale-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Yaga: The Roleplaying Folktale takes us to a world inspired by Slavic folklore, where values such as magic, fate and luck substantially condition people's lives. Like that of the protagonist of the adventure, Ivan, a skilled blacksmith who lost his left hand during a fight and who is seen by the other villagers as the most unfortunate man there is. Based on these rumors, the Tsar decides to summon Ivan and entrust him with a series of missions that can increase his power over the territory: extraordinary strength, eternal youth and other blessings that we will be able to discover during the campaign of the title developed by Breadcrumbs Interactive. A story capable of keeping us company for at least ten hours, depending on how much we want to delve into the numerous quests and secrets that the game has to offer, leading us to witness six possible endings determined by our choices. Available exclusively on time Apple Arcade, Yaga: The Roleplaying Folktale will soon also arrive on PC and consoles: a modus operandi not new to the digital platform of the Cupertino house, which represents on the one hand an advantage for subscribers and on the other an important moment of media attention for often independent development teams, who in this way have the opportunity to make their projects known before ending up in the cauldron of online stores, crushed by the weight of much more publicized productions. Gameplay and structure Right from the aforementioned narrative incipit, Yaga: The Roleplaying Folktale stands out for its delicious and brilliant writing, almost always recited in rhyme both in English and in Italian subtitles. The intention is clearly to create the atmosphere of a medieval ballad, even if from this point of view the pleasant soundtrack seems to row in the opposite direction, accompanying the action with rhythms that in our opinion have little to do with the events, characters and places depicted on the screen. The touch controls are discreet, despite the implementation of a fixed and non-repositionable virtual stick, but it is with a Bluetooth controller that the game gives its best, quickly involving us in its exploratory mechanics and, above all, in the frequent fights that we will have to face to complete the various quests. Yaga's protagonist, Ivan, can in fact wield a seemingly magical hammer, which he can hurl at enemies Thor-style for it to return to his hands, and use a mix of somersaults and parries to cancel the effects of his opponents' hits, even when it comes to huge bosses. The yield of the impacts is excellent and therefore even the frequent random duels give satisfaction: thanks also to the different creatures that will appear in front of us, each equipped with peculiar patterns as regards movement and offensive maneuvers. Supported by a very beautiful graphic as far as it concerns the characters, we will therefore find ourselves visiting randomly generated settings, which change from time to time or in any attempts after the game over (in a somewhat frustrating way, to tell the truth), collecting precious minerals with which to build weapons and equipment best, as well as following the dynamics of a system of luck and bad luck capable of influencing our path in an important way.", "date": "2019-11-02", "grade": "7.8"}
