Completely free for Gold users, this fighting game edited by Kung Fu Factory projects us to the times of the mythical gladiators, inspired by the television series produced in 2010. Despite the name, however, we do not find ourselves impersonating the mythical slave of Thrace, but we are rather in the shoes of a manager capable of managing a diverse stable of warriors. The reason is quite clear right away, Spartacus Legends is a title focused on micro transactions, where the silver currency that can be recovered within the game is joined by the gold one, which can be purchased in the store with real money. Will the programmers have managed to maintain an acceptable balance between paying and non-paying players? Glory and blood Set in ancient Capua, the game has a vaguely articulated structure with managerial veins. We can move through the neighborhoods of the city to face duels of increasing difficulty. Each area offers a certain number of fights that differ in the weapon used. Unless otherwise indicated by the rules, we are forced to face certain clashes with a pre-established weapon, in the style of the displacements of a Gran Turismo to be clear, a condition which obliges us to build a stable of fighters specialized in the specific white weapon. It starts from the classic sword and shield to daggers, double blades, hammers and even tridents. Other parameters to take into consideration are those relating to fame and earnings. The first allows you to level up, a necessary condition to unlock new areas, weapons and opponents. In the gym we take care of growing our sinewy gladiators, buying them from the internal market and then equipping them with the best equipment, also available for a fee in a special shop. Weapons and armor can be purchased with the game's internal currency, provided that the required level is met, otherwise it is possible to skip these conditions by paying for higher level items with real money. In addition to this, each gladiator can take advantage of a certain number of slots to use specific perks that offer various advantages. The tidbits, such as those that allow the increase of fame and money, are available only through the disbursement of real money. These aspects are starting to cast the menacing shadow of pay to win, a not very flattering twist of a free-2-play product where those who spend more money win over those who invest in time and mere skill. Pockets with holes The weight of microtransactions is definitely felt in the mechanics of Spartacus Legends, fortunately, however, the game is not crushed by them. It is possible to face unlimited battles to earn new silver and fame, an appreciable feature for a type of product like this. The aspect of greatest concern was that of deaths. The clashes can end with the permanent death of the opponent, in our case it is sufficient to perform a spectacular fatality if we have managed to adequately exalt the public (there is also a special perk), while as far as the cpu is concerned, it remains a parameter established by the lethality level in statistics. The burning detail is that once we have been killed we will definitely lose our gladiator, unless we resurrect him by paying bloody sums. This gimmick undoubtedly increases the tension of the fights, but at the same time risked breaking the delicate playful balance. However, Kung Fu Factory was very clever in getting around the problem, allowing the hard-earned equipment to be transferred and releasing the level of experience accumulated by individual wrestlers. Updating the roster is indeed facilitated by the game itself and allows you to discover very different fighters. In short, do not become morbidly attached to your virtual gladiator, because you can lose it at any moment. Spartacus Legends winks at lovers of the television series Xbox 360 goals 400 player points await anyone who wants to try their hand at Spartacus Legends, despite the presence of an online mode, to conquer them all it is sufficient to complete the single player campaign. Of the 12 objectives, the most coveted are those relating to the maximum level that can be reached, the fiftieth, and the (deserved) prize for beating the terrible legendary gladiators. Blood and sand Once in the arena it is easy to ascertain the nature of the Kung Fu Factory production, or that of a fighting game with a rather el combat systemement. The moves are reduced to the bone: a powerful blow, a light one, a hold, a sort of counter and two evasive moves, there really isn't much else, even if the variety of weapons and related approaches gives a certain dynamism to situations . The problems are others and are quickly identified in the dubious collision system, the artificial intelligence and the poor reactivity of the wrestlers, the latter truly unnerving, so much so that you have to press the keys several times without being sure that the move will be made. The risk of leading to vulgar button mashing is strong, exacerbated by the ease with which it is possible to knock down most of the opponents with a single and repeated move. The artificial intelligence is based on elementary mathematical calculations linked to the statistics of the wrestler, once in the presence of the Legends, particularly difficult fighters who preside over the districts, things get problematic and with the practically certain risk of losing the wrestler in case of defeat . It is clear how it is practically impossible to defeat an opponent with a sensationally higher ranking than ours, a feature also extended to online matches, where it is possible to face flesh-and-blood opponents through an advanced matchmaking system, but in this case the gap between free and paying players it's almost unsustainable. Graphically Spartacus Legends is far from exciting, with anonymous wrestlers, woody animations, slowdowns and a remarkable video dirt, the game uses particularly aggressive antialiasing filters, with the result of presenting a terribly blurry image. The polygonal modeling is so poor that it seems to belong to the last generation. On the other hand, the video violence is rather satisfying, adequate for the type of setting, with blood splatters that progressively smear the arena and particularly gruesome final moves. The game is in English with Italian lyrics.", "date": "2013-07-22", "grade": "6.5"}
