{"name": "Robe dellaltro mondo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/164643-et-armies-robe-dellaltro-mondo.html", "text": "From time to time it's nice to go back to the old and ignorant glories of first person shooters, a genre that, while continuing to enjoy considerable success with some of the most famous brands (Battlefield, Call Of Duty, Far Cry, Crysis), seems to have lost a bit of appeal compared to the wave of titles that had invaded PC monitors at the turn of the millennium. So welcome here E.T. Armies, a shooter whose value goes beyond the world of videogames to represent a sort of ~Arab spring~, one of the first and tangible results of the agreement signed last July between Iran and the UN, which loosened of the embargo imposed on the state currently governed by Hassan Rouhani. In fact, in his native land the work of Raspina Studio came out last year, after having gathered a good consensus at E3 in 2013: now, thanks to the collaboration of the publisher Merge Games and a short warm-up period on Greenlight, it has finally entered be part of the huge Steam family. Despite the few ideas ET Armies is pleasant, pity only for the extreme brevity A family like many others The Middle Eastern origins of the title are not mentioned at all, were it not for the names of the authors who, just like in a film, celebrate themselves in the introductory sequences. Instead, the game is set in the not too distant future, in which the planet Earth, the scene of increasingly devastating violence and destruction, has now been abandoned in favor of other colonies. However, not all have managed to embark on the search for a new tomorrow and those who remain continue to fight for supremacy. As can be easily understood, the narrative plot only serves to create the pretext for putting together a series of levels, not very varied but at least consistent with each other. The structure is the classic one that we have come to know from the times of Doom and all his offspring: you proceed along corridors (more or less masked; the path to follow is unique) usually sparsely populated, to then arrive at larger areas , a sort of arena, where you have to exterminate the crowds of enemies that separate us from the next level. In E.T. Armies there are no classic end-of-level bosses: they are replaced by respawn situations in which you have to try to survive for a certain number of seconds. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is far from superfine, but one willingly overlooks it considering the good pace that the action is able to offer. If anything, the problem concerns the appearance of the bad guys, who more than sometimes materialize out of nowhere in front of the player's eyes (or better still behind them), thus creating unpleasant situations of frustration. The interaction is at a minimum wage: apart from a few bombs to be placed in well-indicated points on the map, there is no possibility of modifying the surrounding environment, perhaps by blowing up the usually inevitable boxes of explosives. However, even this shortcoming is forgiven in the title of Raspina which, as mentioned, offers a good dose of fun. Just started, already finished The main defect of the product is that everything lasts too little: what is sold as a complete game is in fact a sort of demo version, which can be completed in less than four hours. There are three levels that make up the offer of E.T. Armies, of which only the first, although not exactly original, was convincing thanks to a beautiful reproduction of a post-nuclear desert in perfect Mad Max style. The remaining two instead (ie the interior of a refinery and a citadel) instead they are sloppy, devoid of architectural elements that can somehow attract the player's attention even for a few moments. The same color palette, so vibrant in the introductory map, seems to follow the creative wave of the developers who, after a promising start, falls into the mediocrity of the hackneyed. The variety of arsenal and enemies is also more than limited. The player's paraphernalia includes a laser pistol with unlimited shots (in fact the only advantage of this inaccurate and ineffective means of offense), a machine gun and a sniper rifle. The ammunition for these is not recovered from the corpses of the enemies but by resupplying from boxes usually placed near the checkpoints; to use the rifles with which the opponents attack us, it is necessary to replace one's equipment with that dropped by the bad guys, aware of the fact that in this case, to fill the bar with bullets, the only way is to plunder the bodies on the ground . The total calculation of the guns therefore stops at five units (there is no possibility of launching melee attacks): a decisive valuemind too low, especially considering that none of these presents the slightest element of originality. What about the opposition forces? In this case we find just two types of opponents: for the most part we will have to transform the elite bodies dressed in a Crysis suit and armed with a light machine gun into synthetic carpet, while from time to time we will have to send to the graveyard of curious guys with helmets and shotguns who prefer to tempt fate bare-chested. Unreal takes care of it In any case, the technical realization, beyond the lack of inspiration, is of a discreet level: the qualitative standard is guaranteed by the Unreal Engine which also in this case does its duty, providing effective libraries (although abused, especially in audio section), not without some flaws. It happens, albeit occasionally, to get stuck between some walls, but the most annoying defect is certainly related to the precision of the viewfinder. It often happens that we are convinced of hitting an enemy without him being touched by the bullet in the slightest: a frustrating situation especially in the siege phases in which it is necessary to sweep the battlefield in the shortest possible time. The degree of challenge is not bad: already at a normal level there are situations that may require fast loading of the previous checkpoint, while in the higher one the enemies' shell thickens further, guaranteeing even those who chew bread and shooters an interesting confrontation. There would also be a multiplayer mode that we have not been able to test, having had the title available a few days before the release. In theory it could represent a not negligible added value, but the aforementioned paucity of the arsenal leads us to think that, after a first approach, the title can quickly fall into oblivion. The last note of color for the upload bug: despite the title saving autonomously each time a checkpoint is reached, trying to recover the save after restarting the game from the desktop and selecting Continue Game, you are catapulted to the final sequence. Fortunately, it is possible to pick up where you left off from the level list, which is made available right away.", "date": "2016-03-09", "grade": "5.0"}
