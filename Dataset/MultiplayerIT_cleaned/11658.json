From the very first screens we realize that there are many moving elements, but the trick is soon revealed: the polygonal models used are really simple, and even the protagonists of the action have the typical ~angular~ traits that derive from a of this type. Unfortunately, this is not reflected in an advantage even in terms of frame rate: thirty fps are reached only in situations of great calm, for the rest there are more or less evident drops. The animations, made with the usual motion capture on real athletes, are well done and quite realistic, with only a few subdued episodes (the awards, for example). Finally, the scenarios are quite detailed and well designed, and no defects are noticed in the rendering of the polygons. As for the sound, we have a number of good effects and some noteworthy music, while the commentary (in English) may be varied in the sentences but is extremely flat and lacking in enthusiasm. Finally, the control system, which in a product of this kind is the thing that ultimately matters most, works very well in all disciplines, with a few exceptions (curling...). The detection of movements is precise and there are no problems of any kind. Game mode It is clear that the ~single event~ mode is limited to allowing us to get some practice with the control system, where the other modes represent the most substantial part of the game. The competition, for example, will see us face off against a varying sequence of disciplines, competing against a certain number of opponents just like in the Winter Olympics, complete with a final podium finish. In career mode, however, it will not be up to us to select the applications in which to try our hand: once we have selected a nationality for our character, we will have to compete in the times and in the ways that will be indicated to us, trying to reach the podium to earn experience points. The latter can then be spent to improve our skills in the various disciplines. Finally, the ~campaign~ mode is the one characterized by the greatest difficulty, and sees the presence of a large number of challenges of various types (forty-two in all), which are unlocked as you progress. As a good sports title, Winter Sports 2008 does not miss a multiplayer mode: it is possible to compete in four alternating controls, or use the split screen to organize engaging head-to-head matches with a friend. Both solutions immediately prove to be a lot of fun and add a ~competitive~ element to the package, which you end up losing sight of a bit in single-player competitions. Checks The start screen allows us to access the various game modes: competition, campaign, career or single event. The latter sees us choosing any of the various disciplines to test our skills, and is a great way to take a close look at each sports application, starting to become familiar with its control system. In fact, we will be faced with different controls depending on the context, which are explained quite clearly before each session. To ski we will use the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination, holding the two controllers in a parallel position and turning them to the right or left to make our character go in one or the other direction. The Z and B keys will serve us, in this case, to ~tighten~ the curve and recover the right trajectory towards the flags. The situation relating to ski jumping is different: we will have to pull the controllers down at the right time to leave, then rotate them to maintain the direction and finally tilt them upwards to take the leap. While we're in the air, we'll have to move the Wii-mote and Nunchuck to the right or left to balance the character, then tilt them down to land. The combination of the two controllers is also required in speed skating, but in this case we will have to limit ourselves to ~up and down~, as suggested by the visual indicators, to reach maximum speed and burn opponents over a distance of 500 or 1500 meters. There is even room for the ~rythm game~ element, especially when trying to figure skating: we will simply have to ~beat~ with the Wii-mote or with the Nunchuck when indicated on the screen, following the rhythm of the music: the skater will perform acrobatics more or less precise in relation to our skill. Finally, there are disciplinessuch as bobsleigh racing (for two or four) or skeleton which see the use of the Wii-mote only: first we will have to make it spin quickly to give strength to the push of the sled, then put it horizontally and ~drive~ the vehicle by tilting it from one side or the other depending on the distance to the edge of the frozen channel. The less friction with the walls will be, the less time it will take to reach the finish line. Winter Sports 2008: The Ultimate Challenge is available for Nintendo Wii, PC and PlayStation 2. The tested version is for Nintendo Wii. Unfortunately it is better to appease enthusiasm right away: Winter Sports 2008: The Ultimate Challenge, as the title suggests, is indeed a sports compilation, but with a purely winter background. This means that we will be dealing with a total of fifteen different disciplines, including various cross-country skiing, giant slalom, bobsled racing, skeleton, figure skating and so on. The time has not yet come to see something on Wii that continues the discourse undertaken by Wii Sports, therefore, but that does not mean that this RTL Sports licensed product is not worthy of attention, on the contrary... Winter Sports 2008: The Ultimate Challenge from a technical point of view still belongs to a generation of Wii games that fail, for one reason or another, to exploit the technical capabilities of the Nintendo console. Apart from this, however, the game amazes because of the excellent control system, specially designed for the Wii-mote / Nunchuck pair despite being a multiplatform title. The movements that must be made change according to the sporting discipline and do not have who knows what complexity, but are detected in a precise way and have the merit of involving the player in the action (let's not talk about multiplayer, then). Also considering the selling price, it is clear that we are dealing with a product to be taken into due consideration, especially if you love the genre. Pros: Varied and engaging control system Multiplayer mode Good value for money Cons: Technically only fair Not all disciplines are fun Commentary in English, dull and listless", "date": "2008-01-24", "grade": null}
