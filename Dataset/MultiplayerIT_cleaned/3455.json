Through alpha sessions, some increasingly open closed betas and the launch on the free to play market a few days ago, we were able to notice the constant and incessant refinement work carried out by the developer to bring the probably more complex CCG to PC screens and laborious to digitize. Magic is in fact the collectible card game by definition: born in 1993, strongly linked to its physicality not only as a product but precisely as a meeting between players, complicated, complex, deep and today strong with more than 20,000 different cards that make up its huge library. Transforming it into a game suitable for everyone has never been a simple operation and if we look at the past there are more than a dozen projects, some of which, the most recent, are relegated to the mobile sector with highly simplified versions and limited editions such as the Duels of the Planeswalker series. Looking closely at today's situation, alongside successful phenomena such as Hearthstone, The Elder Scrolls Legends and, in a much more limited version, Gwent, it is emblematic that the only way to play Magic on PC is the difficult, archaic and super Hardcore Magic Online. But now, finally, this new free to play is also added that we are ready to judge in this review of MTG Arena. What is Magic: The Gathering? Let's start with the fundamentals. MTG Arena is a free to play collectible card game, currently only for PC, which fits into the vein presided over by the various Hearthstone, The Elder Scrolls Legends and Gwent. The main difference with these other titles is that Arena is based on what is undoubtedly the most famous and long-lived CCG in the world, Magic: The Gathering, as well as being the only ~physicist~ among those mentioned. This digital transposition does not offer the entire existing card library (also because we are talking about more than 20,000 different cards) but is limited, for the moment, to including the last two blocks of expansions and core sets, with the precise aim of Wizards of the Coast, the publisher and creator of the original product, to keep the two markets, physical and digital, perfectly synchronized, starting with the most recent add-on, Throne of Eldraine. Furthermore, MTG Arena currently seems to be completely unbalanced on game modes that respect the rules of the Standard type: it is still allowed to make Legacy, Modern or even Singleton decks but then, in concrete terms, it is not possible to use them outside of single dedicated challenges . But let's go back to the initial question of the paragraph: what is Magic? Obviously, it is not the task of this article to solve the question, also because a dedicated in-depth study probably would not be enough, but in very general terms it is a card game where the skill required of the player is not resolved exclusively in the plays carried out during the matches but partly from the deckbuilding phase and requires a particularly deep understanding of the mechanics and most of the cards in the Magic universe. Basically, however, it is a question of putting lands on the board that allow you to summon mana of different colors which is then used to cast spells. These are basically of two types: there are actual spells and creatures. In all cases, the ultimate goal is to be able to attack your opponent's avatar to reduce his life points to zero. We guarantee you that the stratification of possibilities granted during a match tends to infinity and, if you want to understand something more about Magic: The Gathering, we strongly advise you to go to Wikipedia and take a look at the millions of videos on topic that you can find on YouTube. But what distinguishes MTG Arena from all other card games and why do we feel so confident in calling it the best card game out there? There tends to be two mechanics that place the Wizards of the Coast creature completely on another level compared to other products of the same genre. First of all, in Magic any dynamic that involves randomness or luck is eliminated: coin flips, abilities that are activated randomly, attacks or damages for which you don't decide the targets, they don't exist. Everything is strictly in the player's hands and must be determined by his actions. The only element of luck is related to card drawing and deck shuffling. The second element concerns the possibility of intervening during the opponent's turn. An integral part of Magic The Gathering, indeed probably its most distinctive feature, is precisely the need to manage the mana and the cards in hand, not only to prepare one's attacks but to inhibit the opponent's moves by slowing down or blocking his actions during his shift. Probably with a view to easing the dynamics and therefore simplifying the rules, practically all the other CCGs eliminate or greatly reduce this component, ensuring that during the opponent's turn one remains there, passive, observing his moves, at most clicking here and there on the board to activate some cute animations. In Magic: the Gathering and therefore in MTG Arena, exactly the opposite is true: it is probably during the opponent's turn that you need to be more concentrated and ready to intervene. How MTG Arena works Arena is simply perfect in the complete and faithful digitization work of Magic: The Gathering and has, among other things, the great advantage of arriving on the market in its final version, with a practically perfect interface. The main menus, management of your profile progression, information regarding daily missions and the various reward unlocking steps are all clear and easy to navigate. Perhaps it is only the screens concerning the games that suffer, which sometimes force a few too many clicks. The same positive argument can be made for the interface that regulates the creation of decks and the one that allows you to navigate your own collection. Here too we are faced with an excellent optimization of the essential information for the composition of the library: mana curves, types of creatures and magic, filters for quickly scrolling through the library; everything is in the right place and is particularly intuitive. Wanting to look for a fly in the ointment, we can find it in a tendency of Wizards of the Coast to refer to online resources outside the game to understand the mechanics behind the construction of decks, the various existing archetypes and however to be able to understand how to combine the cards together, especially at the beginning. We would have expected a sort of integrated help that could hold the neophyte's hand when for the first time he finds himself having to create his own deck from scratch. Let's spend other positive words also for the in-game interface since it was not easy to streamline phases, interruptions and target assignments, stack resolution and all the other variables that influence every single Magic action, but the guys at Wizards of the Coast they managed to amaze us. Once you enter the game Arena does everything to put you at ease by deciding in an extremely intelligent way how to spend mana during summons, when to stop the action waiting for a command, also suggesting targets and elements to sacrifice or spend according to the cards played. At the same time, however, the interface is also fully configurable in its automatisms and, through a couple of keyboard shortcuts, it is possible to circumvent some blocks to prevent the opponent from getting an idea of the presence of any instants in his hand. However, it is in the game modes that the first of the structural problems of MTG: Arena lurks. In fact, the game offers a good range of choices given that, alongside the inevitable single games classified or not, it allows you to participate in a whole series of events where, at the price of a variable number of gems or coins, you face some challenges with rewards via gradually increasing as you bring home a maximum of seven wins (avoiding losing three times). The focus is above all on drafts and sealed, two game modes that involve opening a certain number of packets to compose a 40-card deck on the fly with which to then face the other challengers. We were saying that here lurks the first limit of the Arena given that practically the entire game hinges on games with decks of the Standard type, i.e. including only cards released in the last two blocks of expansions and core sets. The physical card game of Magic is in fact based on the launch of a new expansion every three months or so and after three expansions a revision of the basic set arrives, thus completing a cycle of expansions in a year. When the first expansion of a new cycle arrives on the market, the older one falls out of the Standard type effectively making all its cards unusable except those revised and reprinted in one of the following expansions or in the following core set. Arena is perfectly aligned with the physical card game, which means that even your digital cards will fall out of the only supported game mode. In fact build mModern or Legacy or Vintage type aces are allowed, but then in fact the only possibility you have of using them is in individual free games (unranked) or against bots. The publisher has underlined in several press releases that in the future it will implement new types of games to meet even those with more extensive collections but, to date, if you accidentally open boosters from the Ixalan cycle, then you can do very little about it. Limits and monetization Directly linked to the question of the game modes available, the other structural limit of MTG Arena is related to the absence of any campaign that allows the player to unlock sets of cards, but also only to face challenges of variable difficulty against the computer before throw yourself into the fray against human opponents. There is obviously a long tutorial that allows you to familiarize yourself with the basic rules of Magic and that allows you to have access to some basic decks with which you will be easily disintegrated by other players, but if you want to start building sensible decks you have to get ready to open the wallet. Exactly as happens with physical and concrete Magic. And so we come to the question of monetization and microtransactions. MTG Arena implements two currencies: Coins and Gems. The former can be earned in-game by completing daily missions and winning games. The latter can be collected with a sporadic handful of extremely difficult events or by spending real money. Now, most of the items that can be purchased in the game can be purchased with both currencies, including sachets, with the exception of some aesthetic objects and, as we said above, the most profitable and interesting events, such as drafts and sealed linked to the new expansions. The imbalance in favor of the newer cards included in the Standard type and the absence of a campaign that leads to their rapid and economic unlocking, joins the system adopted by Wizards for managing crafting. Unlike most of the CCGs on the market, Arena does not allow you to ~split~ the cards you own to create the ones that interest you most, but requires you to spend special jokers that are earned only by unpacking the boosters. In practice, every six packets opened we will put an uncommon and a rare joker in our pocket, while every 18 packets we will have a mythical joker. In addition we will also be able to find extra jokers instead of the cards inside each sachet. At any time we can then transform these jokers into a card that we do not own as long as we respect the correct level of rarity. The result is, once again, a system completely unbalanced towards the maniacal opening of boosters in order to be able to collect as many cards (and therefore jokers) as necessary to build a competitive deck with which to be able to face matches and events. It is certainly simplistic and probably misleading to define Arena as a pay to win given that, basically, any collectible card game benefits whoever is willing to open the greatest number of boosters, but this absolutely does not mean that having the complete collection automatically transforms into the chance to win every match. In Magic, having the cards is only the first step, then you need to know how to combine them into a competitive deck that makes the most of the meta and finally you need to be particularly good at playing this deck by reacting to all your opponents' moves (and their decks) in a smart and competent. The mastery pass (a sort of battle pass) is also approaching little by little, which, precisely in the last phase of the beta, was introduced in MTG Arena and allows you to unlock additional aesthetic elements, new boosters and even a few hundred gems as you you level up. What is really missing in the game, in our opinion, is a sort of internal marketplace that allows you to sell your cards and buy the ones you need to complete the deck of your dreams, possibly even paying them with real money, exactly as it happens with Magic's physical marketplace. Or at least it would be convenient to have a system that allows us to discard the cards we don't need to have access to additional jokers. In terms of graphics, MTG Arena does its duty without excelling: the cards are reproduced perfectly, they are legible and with some interesting variations on the theme relating to the special animated versions. But what didn't convince us is the game board where the cards are placed: it's bare and truly minimalist, exactly like the animations and special effects that are activated in combination with the most important summons. However, the game is poorly optimized and often shows annoying fen", "date": "2019-10-06", "grade": "8.0"}
