The transalpine publisher must have seen potential in this game, starting from an intense and tear-jerking story as only the best Japanese sports series can be, but above all, we think, for the control system that appears on paper extremely complete and fulfilling. There are five different configurations, four (actually two with two different variants each) dedicated to the Wiimote/Nunchuck combination and one for the Classic Controller and/or for the old GameCube pad: the one on which the developers seem to focus the most is definitely the first, which should guarantee total identification by including four types of punches (jab, direct, hook, uppercut) to be carried out with the corresponding hand movements, and entrusting the boxer's movements also to remote control and nunchuck, to be moved slightly by hand ' of joysticks. The second control system instead provides a screen pointer to be placed where you want to direct the shot; the two variants simply transfer the movement of the boxer to the Control Stick. In theory it is all exciting, but in practice it is quite different. You will immediately abandon, already in the tutorial, the idea of playing with the pointer, since the experience becomes too cumbersome and does not convey the idea of being in the ring at all, while as far as the main system is concerned, the game often misinterprets your intentions, for example creating an upright is practically impossible, and everything becomes almost unplayable when you decide to move with the remote control and Nunchuck and not with the Stick: of all the directions that it is possible to give, the program seems to understand nothing and go completely at random. The first step On the scene for 18 years now, dozens and dozens of clashes have passed through the pages of the comic, many of which are reproduced in the animated series: it is precisely on the most important and memorable of these meetings that the Story Mode is based, which sees us take the control not only of the protagonist Ippo Makunouchi but also of other characters. The cut scenes that link the meetings and unravel the plot have numerous references to the anime, but are not up to it in terms of intensity and drama. It does not hurt! No, it doesn't hurt at all... We really realize that things are not going well when, despite the above premises, we get to the bottom of the long Story Mode even at the most difficult level, just with a little patience aimed more at enduring the not entirely engaging cut scene between one match and another, and this is because of tactics and strategy in Victorious Boxers there is very little. Although the 25 wrestlers present are all characterized by their own style and special shots, it will always be enough to get close, avoid the first shots and launch into a frenzied volley; the impression is confirmed when using the traditional controller, which makes the experience much more classic and linear: Victorious Boxers is a classic ~button-masher~, i.e. a game where whoever presses the keys faster wins, it doesn't matter which. And it's also a button-masher afflicted by some problems, the most obvious of which is the camera, which for a good result should always focus on the opponent but which often gets stuck behind our boxer: for a design choice when we stay on guard, and due to a lack in the programming phase when the opponent laterally moves away from us with quick small steps, which is, among other things, the only effective defensive tactic that the AI can adopt and that vice versa we cannot use, given the control system. The situation improves when facing a human opponent, but the background problems, control and camera, remain, and apart from Story Mode and Multiplayer there are no modes. Victorious Boxers is a classic ~button-masher~, i.e. a game where whoever presses the keys the fastest wins, no matter what. It does not hurt! No, it doesn't hurt at all... Graphically we are clearly faced with the same engine that supported the PS2 episodes, with greater care given to the cleaning and brightness of the textures: it is not a typical thingAll negative, as above all the style used, a cel shading with a decisive and angular stroke, is noted for its ability to remain very faithful to the drawings of the anime. Furthermore, the boxers' animations are very realistic and convincing, and above all fast, giving a nice feeling of intensity and frenzy. The downsides come from aliasing and flickering, very pronounced in the outlines of the characters and in the shadows, and from the audience of the matches, which is unacceptably ugly even if we were talking about a PSOne game! The sound is just right for the large amount of spoken, recited (in English, like all the text) in a way that is not particularly brilliant but not unbearable either. 480i and 16:9 mode supported. Comment The gaming roots of Victorious Boxers: Challenge are quite solid, and the developers competent enough not to package a shabby and unplayable title. Unfortunately, however, a good control via Wiimote, which would have raised the series to heights of great value, has not been achieved, and the historical problems have remained the same, with the result that, in addition to the (few?) fans of comics and cartoons, we really don't see who to recommend this game. The fact that currently, in addition to Wii Sports, it is not possible to virtually hold the gloves does not justify an expense of a certain level.Pros Excellent style and animations Faithful to the anime Cons Poorly made controls Camera to fix Hajime No Ippo is one of the longest-running manga in Japan: it was born in 1990 and is still published today, with great success, by Kodansha. The obligatory animated television series dates back to the first two years of the new millennium; while manga and anime still have to take the long step of localization in Italian, not so instead for the video game series, which we have already seen in its iterations for PlayStation 2. And the reason is soon said: Hajime No Ippo is the classic uplifting story set in the world of one of the most strenuous and noble sports, boxing. A video game dedicated to it could, therefore, be perfectly enjoyable even for those who have never had anything to do with the original material.", "date": "2008-06-18", "grade": null}
