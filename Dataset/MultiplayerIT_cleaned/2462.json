{"name": "Startopia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/startopia.html", "text": "The zero-atmosphere populace... will be the first of your concerns: so many races, so many worlds we are in space! Imagine the classic ~cauldron~ you see in science fiction movies or TV shows and you'll have a great idea. There will be more meditative and thaumaturgical races like the Greys, but there will also be the ever-needed Salt Pigs, your manpower. There will be consuls and diplomats, always ready to judge what you will do, and there will also be those who, strong in their size and dedication to order on the station, will willingly accept joining the police. The really interesting thing is that each of these individuals has their own life, everyone has different interests and expectations, everyone behaves according to their aptitudes. All this information is accessible from a simple panel that opens by right-clicking on the character. In addition to the above, you can constantly know what his mood is, for example if you click on the balloon-shaped icon it is as if you were asking him: ~Are you bored?~ to which he will respond with a gesture that can be: No, Yes, So-so. Really nice as an idea. Certainly we can't just go around asking people how they feel about being a good mayor, otherwise we would have done better to choose the parish priest as their role... So you are called to manage the construction of buildings, which will provide well-being, services and so on it serves the community to make it prosper. By selecting the infirmary for example, it will then be enough to drag the mouse on the screen to fix its size. Once built it will then be at our discretion to equip it with all the tools necessary to make it work: a hospital bed, an analysis device and certainly some Gray hired as a doctor. My button room it doesn't necessarily have to be the equivalent of a ninja computer, since in my opinion the programmers have done an excellent job to optimize the cleanliness of the code, and the game runs smoothly even on mid-range systems. You can move in any direction, rotate and zoom as you like and I assure you that if in some titles that boast the free camera it seems more like a forced addition, here it is not at all, because you will really need to enter your buildings to see how vain things are, and at the same time ~flitting~ here and there at high altitudes to keep an eye on everything. In any case, don't worry, there is a nice multi-stage tutorial that will teach you all the basics, and will even give you the opportunity to test what awaits you in the advanced stages of the game, namely the real reclamation of a livable environment from 0. Or change altitudes to create mountains or depressions, alter humidity to create waterfalls or deserts. Everything is done to perfection to create a good balance between simple interface, but powerful effects on the practical side. I thought they were boring, but...  I have to change my mind! This is the phrase that the main detractors of managerial / management will say. Indeed Startopia represents an excellent ~gateway~ for those who have always been hostile to this genre, for all the characteristics mentioned above and for all the fun you will get from it. Attention, this does not mean that it is a simple game, in fact it always maintains the connotations of challenge that will make the veterans of the genre happy. In any case, no more miniature characters, bare graphics and statistics with graphs, but colors, vitality and lots and lots of sympathy which, believe me, is needed. Basically for those who are intrigued by the genre, and want something more than hours spent on RTS, desiring a deeper contact with the people governed by him (and perhaps adore the space setting), I recommend that you absolutely try it. On the other hand, I certainly can't blame those who feel they don't have the time to play it, or believe they can't give it all the attention it deserves, given that Startopia is immersive enough to grab a good chunk of your free time. Whether it's good or bad well, that's up to you to decide! More screenshots 15 The asteroidal municipal elections... have decreed that you are the new mayor of the new orbiting station. It was to be expected, given that the bad governance of the previous junta has provoked a semi-civil revolt on the part of the working class, no longer willing to work in conditions of per-capita limitation of oxygen use, kilometric queues at the entrance to spaceports, and failing healthcare. In fact, now there are you, who caress your command console and look forward to the citizen rallies that welcome youthey will lament by popular acclaim, but for now fly low and dodge the stone. In Startopia, the new jewel of Mucky Foot (same software house as Urban Chaos) you find yourself immersed in a game that I would define as pleasant-managerial, a new genre that I coin here after having swallowed 3 liters of beer evidently to understand a genre that includes certainly the legendary series ~Theme (something)~ by Bullfrog, or rather the creation and management of a community or a town with an eye always open to the management aspect of the thing, but always in the name of good humour. Therefore, your responsibilities will not be lacking, but everything is diluted by the jokes of your assistant, for example, which seem little but which in reality make you go through apparently disheartening situations unscathed, such as a serious illness that has struck people, problems of civil revolt in slums, etc.", "date": "2001-07-03", "grade": null}
