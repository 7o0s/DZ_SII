Skybound has in fact taken the reins and, although postponing the conclusion of a quarter, all enthusiasts are now certain of being able to close the last chapter of a journey that lasted seven years. It is difficult to decree with certainty whether the reworking that took place has somehow also affected the screenplay, but what immediately catches the eye is the narrative consistency of an episode, The Walking Dead: The Final Season - Broken Toys, which opens at the end with a power of which this season was still an orphan. We have already talked abundantly in recent months about a Final Season that strongly evokes the atmosphere of the distant GOTY of 2012, but Rotti Toys offers some moments of remarkable intensity, which it would be a shame not to live to the fullest of our possibilities. Clem and AJ's story This third episode picks up right where we left off. The cheerful and not very cohesive gang of the orphanage is now grappling with a group of stubborn people eager to create a real army. Despite the kidnapping of other members of the group, the new leader Clem is called to counterattack, with the aim of delivering a serious blow to the structure of the antagonists. We will avoid giving further information on the events that form the background to the episode: what we would like to communicate, however, is that if on the one hand Rottis Toys seems to start in a less pressing way than one might expect, it is with the passing of the scenes that the growing up it becomes more and more high-sounding, until it flows into a successful final sequence with a strong emotional component. In the world in which Clementine and AJ live (as The Walking Dead has always accustomed us to) it is not the walkers who make life hell, but the man himself. While creatures now completely detached from reason move in the background, those who are still struggling to survive are divided between the will to survive and those who have instead decided to exploit the event to assert their supremacy. Clem has always been an emblematic character in this sense: raised in a dirty and bad world, the task of adoptive mother of little AJ made her a woman well before her time. The emotional strength of this whole season, necessarily, continues to revolve around the relationship between the two protagonists, divided between the desire to prove themselves as the best people, and the awareness of never being able to give in to weakness. AJ is growing up, and is increasingly plagiarized by the teachings that we ourselves affirm at the hands of the young woman. The backgrounds of the other protagonists remain less intense, which are too often left aside just when the deepening seems to be around the corner. Whether it's a writing slip or a precise choice to focus on the protagonists, Rotti Toys doesn't change this approach to events and, if possible, intensifies it even more. Over the course of the couple of hours of duration of the episode, what the title does best is to prepare us for the grand finale, accompanying us with scenes of strong intensity and a more reasoned and in-depth approach to walkers. In short, if this fourth season is keeping you glued to the screen, be aware that you will not be disappointed by what is probably the best of the sections made so far. The gameplay at the service of the narrative The gameplay situations certainly do not change what we already knew. If the action phase of the second episode was a repetitive (but still short) variant with respect to what the series has accustomed us to, Rotti Toys perfects that way of launching us into dynamism, without however upsetting the cards on the table. On the other hand, The Walking Dead remains a title that assumes the objective of narrating rather than interacting. The choices are interesting and the evolution of the relationship between Clem and AJ also leaves room for a certain pressure in the player, aware of having to decide whether to teach the child to survive in all circumstances, or try to maintain that humanity which by now seems to be a distant memory of the past and of which she herself has no memory. The dynamism in the movements and the incipit for the finale of the series also introduce new locations and spaces, well made and characterized by a technical care that represents the true stylistic code of the late TellTale's last work. It is useless to focus again on elements that we know perfectly well by now. What matters is that the swan song of the entire series seems ever closer to the glories of the unforgettable first season. If good morning is seen from the butttino, is confirmed in the afternoon and intensifies in the evening, we can only be positive and ready to enjoy the night, arriving on March 26, with the latest episode.", "date": "2019-02-07", "grade": "7.5"}
