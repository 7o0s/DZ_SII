{"name": "Sniper Elite 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sniper-elite-5-recensione.html", "text": "There is no doubt that Rebellion has been able to create a solid and interesting brand with Sniper Elite, with a well-recognizable protagonist, a consolidated formula and even the ability to draw some pleasant spin-offs from the mother series, from the horror saga of Zombie Army to 'Strange Brigade cooperative adventure. In short, what we are facing in its small way is a real sniperverse and we hope it will grow further, however coming to terms with those technical and artistic limits that characterize each new release and which over time time become more and more evident, inevitably giving the experience a hint of dated. Does the new campaign set in France also suffer from these problems? Or have the innovations introduced for the fifth chapter, available at no additional cost for Xbox Game Pass subscribers, been able to smooth these edges? Do we reveal it to you in the Sniper Elite 5 review? History Sniper Elite 5, Karl Fairburne does what he does best Sharpshooter Karl Fairburne won't be able to get some well-deserved rest until the Second World War has ended in victory for the Allies. And so, after taking part in the African Campaign in 1942 and having fought with the partisans in Italy in 1943, the infallible sniper leaves for France with the task of shedding light on the mysterious Kraken project: a plan that could allow the Nazi army to hit the enemy troops even before they land in Europe, thus reversing the tide of the conflict. The story of Sniper Elite 5 therefore adopts the same plot as always, with the deadly weapon to be identified and sabotaged while the protagonist unfortunately remains unfathomable , the stereotype of the fearless hero who can never get out of his role. In short, the general inability to build a more sophisticated plot than usual is confirmed, also and above all as regards the characterization of the supporting actors and the antagonists. And the renunciation of dubbing in Italian after all these years only makes things worse. Structure Sniper Elite 5, a close-up X-ray execution However, there are some novelties regarding the offer, with a campaign made up of nine rather substantial missions (whose total duration should be around ten hours, depending on the secondary objectives completed and the difficulty selected) and which can be played by alone or in cooperation with a friend, thus coordinating actions and creating potentially exciting combat sequences. The story mode maps turn out to be quite large, freely explorable and full of secrets and points of interest that we will be able to discover by traveling along them and broadly, between one main objective and another. We will also have ziplines available to move quickly in some areas and new climbing-related abilities to be able to access buildings controlled by enemy soldiers in a different way. The possibility of the invasion has also been introduced, that is the possibility for a second player to enter our game by playing the role of a Nazi officer whose task will be to try to put a spanner in our works, identifying us within the scenario and attacking us in a way that is certainly more effective and unpredictable than the usual action stealth artificial intelligence. The package is completed by the Survival mode, also playable alone or in cooperative, in which we will have to defend a series of locations from the arrival of the troops Nazis within three possible scenarios; and the Multiplayer mode, with the now traditional competitive stipulations for up to sixteen participants that add a small but pleasant extra to the experience. Gameplay Sniper Elite 5, the protagonist takes aim So we come to the gameplay, which beyond a few small variations on the theme remains firmly anchored to the formula we know well. The open maps, which we have seen starting from Sniper Elite 4, imply a substantial freedom of action and approach which also in this case makes the difference, avoiding getting stuck in a pre-established progression and giving us the possibility of completing the mission exactly as we wish. We will therefore be able to act in a strategic manner, highlighting the targets with binoculars and finding raised points from which to hit them with our sniper rifle, perhaps after having tampered with the usual internal combustion engine to cover up the noise of the shot and avoid alerting the enemy troops; or reduce the distances, move crouched in the tall grass to remain hidden and eliminate the guards with the dagger or the silenced pistol; or even give a fuck about everything and open fire aopen face, aware however that at that point we will find ourselves facing dozens of enemies who will try to surround us. Sniper Elite 5, the devastating effects of bullets in X-Ray Kill Cams The stealth mechanics are basically the same as always and inevitably bend the intelligence of the enemies to the needs of the gameplay, making sure that they remain behind for a long time to favor our sorties or that they do not sound the alarm for more than a certain amount of time to prevent the entire mission from being compromised. The balance achieved by Rebellion in this situation seems sensible and the novelty of the upgradeable skills is nice, but the problems are others. Out of the comfort zone of shooting from distance with active concentration, which thanks to the spectacular X-Ray Kill Cams are even more bloody, the gunplay of Sniper Elite 5 is in fact confirmed modest, approximate and confusing. Blame the general woodiness of the movements and animations, but also and above all the way in which our character interacts with the scenario, revealing frankly dated technological bases. The controls do not help, with various overlaps which in some situations can prove to be really annoying, while we appreciated the use of the DualSense's adaptive triggers: half-press for third-person aiming, full-press for iron sight. Graphics and sound Sniper Elite 5 boasts some fascinating scenarios There is little to get around it: the graphics of Sniper Elite 5 are very dated and the series from this point of view would definitely need a substantial renovation. The textures are more defined and the scenarios chosen for this campaign are truly fascinating when French castles are involved, however fictitious, but the quality of the polygonal models and animations really leaves something to be desired, as well as the general effects.Su PS5 the game moves at 60 fps by default, without allowing alternative choices, and there is no doubt that the doubling of the frame rate compared to the previous episodes adds responsiveness and precision to the experience, especially in moving shots and in the most frenetic situations . Little to say instead about the sound, which alternates the usual themes of the franchise with dialogues interpreted in a barely discreet way, as mentioned without dubbing in Italian but only in English with subtitles (which a bug does not allow you to deactivate, however).", "date": "2022-05-25", "grade": "7.0"}
