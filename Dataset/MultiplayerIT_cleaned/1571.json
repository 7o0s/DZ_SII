{"name": "The Hulk", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-hulk-2.html", "text": "He's big, green and suffers from aliasing... Developed by Radical Entertainment (memorable for the Beavis&Butthead video game on Megadrive and... well little else, a list of their most recent products could at best serve as bad publicity...) The Hulk presents itself as an honest 3D Action but without technically demanding. Based on a solid but unsophisticated engine, the game does not shine for the amount of polygons, but boasts a physics engine worthy of the name and satisfactory graphics without being excessive in terms of hardware requirements. Even in the most agitated phases the action remains fluid and free from noteworthy slowdowns, but more than an exploit by the programmers, this is probably due to the almost exclusive use of cel-shading, which lightens every aspect relating to the management of textures. If on the one hand this technique accentuates the feeling of being in a sort of comic or cartoon (thus revealing itself to be particularly suitable given the main subject), on the other it is paid for, as often happens, with a scarce incisiveness of the scenarios, far too dull in their solid colors instead of the canonical textures. The game also features highly questionable choreographic choices, which show the side of the criticism of those fans (virtually anyone who has ever followed the adventures of the green giant on comics...) to find the implausible clouds of unidentified energy terribly in bad taste green that the Hulk emits when he lands a punch. They look like a bad copy of Tekken special effects. Likewise, some of the protagonist's most glorious ~moves~ (such as his legendary sonic slap) have been aesthetically sacrificed for showmanship, something that could make the Hulk a little more like a sort of X-Man shooting green beams around when he claps his hands... luckily Jack Kirby is dead and he can't see him. If from a certain point of view some - after all understandable even if perhaps not shared - ~artistic~ licenses have been taken to make the Hulk character more ~saleable~ from a videogame point of view, from another one one cannot fail to notice how every other aspect of the character has been reproduced with an almost moving fidelity. His movements, the way he grabs things and people, with that charge of repressed anger that almost makes him plot and makes him proceed with that swaying gait that we have already appreciated in the film every detail of the physiognomy of the character has been reproduced with commendable care and is definitely a source of satisfaction. Too bad the enemies weren't made with the same care: the enemy soldiers are absolutely all the same, soulless puppets, cannon fodder in all respects. The Super-Villains are certainly more charismatic, but they don't boast the same number of animations and attention to detail as the protagonist. Finally, talking about special effects, we cannot deny that although fire, explosions and electric shocks are made to conform with the general look of the game's graphics, the point is that we have seen much better on more than one occasion and from every point of view. Overall, therefore, the technical sector is satisfactory, but sensitive to large improvements. When destroying becomes a way of life For once, it seems that the gameplay has been modeled to adapt to the character and not vice versa: you will never see the Hulk lower a lever or find the key to open a door ... finally an attempt has been made to abandon, at least in part, the hackneyed such clichs, to create a plausible game within ~his~ fiction. It's also a very fun game. There is little to do, when playing a character like the Hulk, the primary impulse is to destroy everything in sight and when we realize that the level of interaction is so high that we can actually do it, the devastation that as a result it becomes tremendously addictive. The control system is so well thought out that before you get bored of it you will have had the opportunity to experiment with no less than a dozen ways to knock out a single enemy soldier. We can punch them, grab and slap them, crush them to the ground or throw them at others. We can jump on them, collect crates, stones and cars to use as weapons or projectiles or wield steel bars and pipes like huge clubs. Not to mention the most historic applications of the Hulk's Superstrength: we can hit the ground and create a shock wave or clap our hands so hard that they stun the animals.opponents. And if the bar dedicated to ~Anger~ fills up completely, it is possible to perform a special attack with an enormous destructive scope. Naturally the Hulk is not only unsurpassed in attack, but also a champion of self-defense: for each blow he suffers he will lose energy, but a substantial amount of the same can be regenerated simply by passing the time, or by collecting the green energy spheres released by the enemies shot down (ok this is nonsense, but it's also a classic). In fact, however varied, the entire experience in the role of Hulk is resolved in a continuous advance by massacring human insects and annoying mutants with strange powers, perhaps resulting in repetitive, but on balance the game is not long enough because the thing may annoy you. Whether this is good or bad, you decide... What is definitely bad for the purposes of the final evaluation of the game, are the levels in which Bruce Banner is played. After an hour of furious and destructive fighting anyone might want to indulge in something quieter and more reflective, but in that case you might consider turning off your PC and switching to a book or TV, not some sort of stealth-game with dubious tactical-strategic ambitions. The intention of making the game experience more varied is commendable, but the point is that there is really no good reason why anyone would be interested in guiding a helpless scientist through repetitive levels, hiding from sentries who seem blind from birth, with the primary objective of mashing buttons (uuuh!) and solving numerical puzzles that only a three-year-old would have a hard time grappling with (haha no three-year-old is going to get into my secret laboratory! Nd Madscientist). Conclusions The Hulk turned out to be a pleasant surprise, which is in itself an unexpected event, in light of recent, very famous, post-cinematic disappointments, such as Enter the Matrix. The Hulk is a game that amuses and entertains to perfection, with a story that is not too pretentious and excellent gameplay ideas. Sure, it's short and is dotted here and there with real boring pearls (the sections with Banner), but it's worth finishing just to enjoy the beautiful and frequent cutscenes and the additional game modes, which for once add actually something original to the game. Pros: Varied and fun gameplay Sound effects from the Movie Cons: Improved graphics Sections with Banners are boring and approximate ~Hulk Smash!~ It seems that by now, every film season, no less than a couple of films dedicated to superheroes await us, in particular the Marvel ones, which after years of absence from the big and small screens, seem determined to take the place that once belonged to Batman and Superman, historic DC Comics champions, who historically boast the highest number of appearances on celluloid. According to the script that we all know, for each of these ~dollar-grinder~ films the relative videogame tie-in is created, possibly multi-platform and suitable for all ages. For unknown reasons, this year we were spared the Daredevil game (as well as gadgets and puppets, despite the fact that the film was a blockbuster in the States), while in the case of Hulk, the game was already served and we met a real advertising invasion that goes from TV to the Internet, up to Fast Food, despite the fact that the film is exactly driving the crowds crazy (wrongly, since it is very beautiful). Quite a paradox indeed. In any case, the Hulk video game takes off from the end of the cinematic story, on which I will be careful to keep silent. Suffice it to say that your favorite nuclear scientist - Bruce Banner - is still happily at large and haunted by the uncomfortable presence of his green alter-ego as a new Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. In the hope of finding a cure, he will find himself surrounded by the military again, who, like mosquitoes throwing themselves into a fire, will continue to foolishly attack him, regardless of the uselessness of their weapons. However, a new disturbing element appears, in the form of a mad scientist who wants to steal the Hulk's power to use it to his advantage (hey, I've heard that one before! Wait a minute, I promised not to mention the plot of the film ). As the Hulk you will naturally have to get out of trouble with what you do best (break everything), but the novelty is that part of the game will be played in the role of poor and defenseless Bruce Banner, for the occasion in a spy-stealth version at the service of himself and of those he will have to save from the clutches of the caactive on duty, without necessarily having to transform into a giant as big as a whale and with the intellect of a wren.", "date": "2003-07-28", "grade": null}
