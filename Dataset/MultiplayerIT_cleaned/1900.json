But this time the extra is worth mentioning right away, not only because it's the only one there is, but also because it's really curious: it's a comics generator, with a very high number of images to be used to create a real story to print. An image among those proposed in this article is very eloquent on the potential of this ~optional~ of the game, already present in various Disney CD-ROMs and reproposed here with the settings of the video game, so as to recreate, if if desired, a comic that tells the story of the various missions. Powerpuff Girls is a very difficult genre to categorize. While on the one hand it has the classic layout of games for children under 10, with puzzles or arcades that are relatively easy to solve (it is still possible to set the level of difficulty), on the other it has some politically incorrect aspects that could make the nose to many parents (such as throwing children, bouncing on people's heads or involving people in wheelchairs which for the most bigots could be taken as an offense). The game is based on a series of missions to be completed in sequence. Each completed mission unlocks the next. Almost all missions require a good familiarity with mouse and keyboard, a good glance and quick reflexes. The objectives are different from mission to mission and vary from the defeat of killer broccoli (all too similar to trees, actually) thanks to ravenous children ready to eat them after the Powerpuff Girls have thrown them at them (curious way to teach children that broccoli is good for you), to the shearing of the hair of the inhabitants who risk making them roll into a sort of black hole; from the arrangement of bricks that come out of their seats (and which hold up a bridge over which a train passes) to the collection of coins and films with one of the heroines inside a bouncy bubble (it is easier to see than to explain, the screenshots are explanatory). The missions are eight in all, and as mentioned it is necessary to complete the previous one to face the next one. Not too smart a choice, because if a mission proves to be excessively difficult (and some really are) you risk having to abandon the entire game. The setting, while remaining in the Townsville area, varies from mission to mission: a park, the sewers, a city street, the center of Townsville itself, etc. etc. Certainly the imagination is not lacking. Furthermore, each mission is accompanied by short animations of good quality and in any case decidedly in line with the graphic quality of the cartoon. Conclusion Powerpuff Girls will prove to be a decent pastime for the youngest (very young), especially while waiting for the pasta to be ready or for mum to finish combing her hair before going out. Strong doubts remain about longevity, given that once all the missions have been completed (which I repeat, there are only eight) it will be difficult to go crazy to do them all over again. I recently saw Rayman's video game on Nesquik packaging. Well, maybe even Powerpuff Girls would look great as an ~attachment~ to something else. It would please fans of the cartoon (perhaps as an attachment to the comic), curious new kids (attached to groceries) and even lovers of Unreal and Quake (attached to electric saws). Introduction ~The Powerpuff Girls~ (Powerpuff Girls) is one of Cartoon Network's strengths. At its debut in the United States on November 19, 1998, it immediately met with great success among the youngest. The plot that introduces the big-eyed heroines is simple: during an experiment to create the perfect little girl, an accident occurs that causes the birth of the Powerpuff Girls. Just like real superheroes these little girls have special powers. They are very strong, they fly and two of them have a unique power: Lolly, the leader of the group, spits fire or ice and Dolly is able to communicate with squirrels. Molly however has not yet shown any particular power. There are many enemies of the Powerpuff Girls, including ~Him~, who will get to know whoever decides to buy this game. Him, like other ~villains~ of the animated series, aims to become the undisputed master of Townsville. However, the Powerpuff Girls are always ready to defend their city from all the super villains thus giving life to the episodes presented on TV (in Italy on Cartoon Network). The success generated has led, specially in the United States, to the marketing of the most disparate gadgets and the release of a comic strip and a film. The video game industry wasted no time, releasing Powerpuff Girls: Gamesville, which I will present in this article.", "date": "2002-12-02", "grade": null}
