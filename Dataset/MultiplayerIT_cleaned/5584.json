The online game theoretically it is neither a sequel nor a reboot but it should be a remake: we use a conditional because in reality the title is a huge mash-up of all the previous chapters, as if the developers had taken the best of each to create a unique amazing adventure. The result? They made it. After a three year absence Ratchet & Clank return in an exciting remake Playstation 4 trophies Ratchet & Clank contains 47 trophies that will require some patience to achieve. In addition to the classics unlocked automatically as the story progresses, the others are entirely dedicated to reaching maximum weapons, health and equipment, plus a dozen secret trophies. So get ready to collect a lot of Bolt and Raritanium to expand and upgrade your entire arsenal! Stroll through time The story of Ratchet & Clank is roughly that of the chapter dated 2002: Ratchet, a nice Lombax busy in a garage on the planet Veldin, meets Clank after the little robot has escaped from the Quartu robotic plant and together they will join forces to President Drek's plans, seeking the support of the idolized Captain Quark in hopes of becoming Galactic Rangers. The story is actually narrated by the captain himself, as if we were reliving everything from the point of view of the jaunty hero; the expedient works perfectly, not only because Gianni Gaude (the historic Italian voice actor of Quark) once again gave his best, but above all because the introduction of the narrator's voiceover acts as an in-game tutorial. However, get ready for some narrative changes of course because in addition to the introduction of some new secondary characters, we will see the return of old friends and antagonists, not all of whom belong to the first chapter (although it is not a mystery because they are all clearly visible in the various trailers, but we don't want to anyway go ahead with the spoiler). Quotes, references and references to the past are not lacking, on the contrary, they are often present and seasoned with the usual irony of Insomniac. This is simultaneously the strong point and the weak point of the story: if you haven't missed even one chapter in the past, you will probably have a smile on your face for the duration of the game; on the contrary, if you have never had experience with Ratchet & Clank, this is indeed a great way to familiarize yourself with the series but bear in mind that some details may escape you and unfortunately it will not always be explained to you. It almost seems that the intent was to condense eleven years of saga into a single episode, as if the developers wanted to create a gigantic summary to continue with something new ... and obviously we hope that our risky prediction can be correct! This walk back in time has a very variable duration: by pursuing only the main missions, the campaign in normal mode can last from a minimum of six to a maximum of eight hours. Obviously the experience doesn't end completely there, because the search and collection of all the extras and all the weapons will last much longer. We estimate that a full campaign could last up to fifteen hours, not counting the Challenge mode, which we'll tell you about later. It is clear that to lighten the game some levels have been completely eliminated: the appeal is missing several planets including Eudora, Umbris and Orxon, while the outpost of the planet Batalia has been joined to the icy snow of Hoven, thus giving the level a whole new identity. However, the work done on the remaining levels is astonishing and, although some have been modified for gameplay needs, none have lost their character, neither the rainy Rilgar nor the lush Pokitaru. The same goes for characters, enemies and weapons, even if Ratchet compared to its previous versions seems more tender and ~cuddly~ than usual... those big eyes and furry cheeks will probably make you regret your domestic cat! Graphically the game looks splendid: overall the restyling work on the old settings is very accurate and convincing and the graphic rendering is also visually satisfying. We have not noticed any programming bugs or frame rate drops, even during the most frenetic fights where the animations on the screen are very numerous. However, some smudges are visible because although the particle and light effects are completely successful, we have found a little' flat out explosions and reflections on wet surfaces. The animations, on the other hand, are all exceptional, both on the faces of the characters and on the objects. Particular attention was then given to the game videos, obviously as a matter of necessity ... after all, the video game cannot disfigure compared to the animated film! Fire at will The game has maintained the typical gameplay style of the old chapters: intuitive, dynamic and with very pleasant feedback. As for the command interface, the X, circle and square key are respectively assigned to jump, hook the grappling hook and melee attack with the Omnikey (and by pressing circle in the air, Ratchet will perform an impact shot on the ground); the backbones are dedicated to the use of backpacks and jetpacks if the level requires it, while the triggers are used for combat with firearms, where in particular L2 blocks the camera by making Ratchet move sideways and R2 allows you to fire. The directional cross is assigned the quick choice of our four favorite weapons while the triangle key shows the complete inventory; the touch pad finally opens the map. Overall the system is pleasant and well structured; perhaps the only flaw is the directional cross as it is slightly too sensitive, which is why in a very excited moment you could ~mess up~ the quick choice of weapons by adding more confusion to that of combat. The weapon you are using will always be visible on the screen with relative amount of ammunition and level of use, collected Bolt and Raritanium (i.e. currency to buy weapons and minerals to upgrade them) and Ratchet's life which will gain an additional 10% each time the experience points bar will be filled completely. The gameplay is solid and varied, capable of keeping us glued to the console for hours: if over the years more and more attention has been given to the combat sessions, in this chapter each component of the game is present in a balanced way, creating a pleasant harmony that ranging from combat with guns to intricate platforming sessions, through space battles and small puzzles. Obviously the difficulty depends a lot on what kind of player you are but we are sure that the most difficult moments are the fights, which will gradually become more challenging as the game progresses. The platform phases are the most fun however, because in addition to jumping on mobile platforms and extricating yourself in dense forests of deadly lasers, jumps with the grappling hook, walking upside down on magnetic surfaces and long runs on the rails are back as expected. To all this we still have to add both the Hoverboard races, races on the track with gravitational skateboards, and the battles on the spaceship. The last parenthesis should be dedicated to the puzzles represented essentially by the riddles of the Trapper and by the mini-sequences dedicated to Clank. The Translayer is a passe-partout for electronic locks, which will only open after completing a small puzzle: the puzzles to be solved during the main campaign are quite simple but the optional ones will give you a hard time. Last but not least are the levels dedicated to Clank, in which the little robot will have to advance using little Gadgebots to solve puzzles: in the original game Clank could give four commands to the little robots (follow, attack, enter the door, wait) while in this remake will be able to change the functions of the Gadgebots at will in order to electrify switches, create spring platforms to reach too high places or create bridges. The levels dedicated to Clank run quickly but are not boring at all and indeed, some passages will be even more complex than it seems. Weapons of Destruction A separate discussion should be dedicated to the arsenal of Lombax, one of the points most loved by players and on which we would like to reassure you: in the inventory you will find more than thirty objects including gadgets and weapons. The gadgets are the same as in the first chapter: in addition to the Omnichiave8000 supplied from the first level, you will find a vast assortment of backpacks, boots and bypassers. Speaking of backpacks, a fun addition was made by inserting the use of the Jetpack in some levels, similar to that of Grummel Net Industries in Ratchet & Clank: Nexus, which will allow you to freely fly over every corner of the planet you are visiting. The weapons available, on the other hand, have been drawn from all the games, combining them with some novelties. Alongside the brand new Pixellator and some basic weapons, small jewels such as Mr. Zurkon and the Gauntlet of Fate are back, which are joined by the absurd Discotron, which generates a strobosphere that will babeat all the enemies to the rhythm of the disc, and the Pecorator which, well... you can imagine its use. Instead of making available to the players an excessively loaded armory in which three weapons could usually be selected and only used for the entire duration of the adventure, in this remake the developers propose a leaner arsenal but made up of versatile and all indispensable weapons: it will therefore be necessary to pay attention to all the pieces in our inventory, learning to use them in the most appropriate way. Each more weapon is used the more it will level up, becoming more and more powerful and once you pass the fifth level it will unlock an unprecedented upgrade by changing its name (for example, the Warmonger becomes Peacemaker). Obviously it is not enough to use a weapon to enhance it but you will also have to invest large quantities of Raritanium; as we explained before, Raritanium is the mineral that you will have to use to upgrade weapons and it will be spent in the Gadgetron shops that you will find on the various planets. By opening the weapon upgrade grid you will find yourself in front of a beehive scheme, where each cell represents an upgrade. Among the various cells you will find some with a question mark: those are secret weapon upgrades that you can only use after unlocking the cells adjacent to the secret one. It is therefore important to think carefully about the upgrades because it is not only what you want to unlock that matters but above all the position in which the cell is located. In search of treasure As we said, the experience gains many hours if you decide to go in search of all the treasures scattered on the various planets, essentially of two types: the Gold Bolts and the Holoschedes. Golden Bolts are the classic secret found in all Ratchet & Clank levels, for a total of 28 golden bolts. Hidden in secret areas of the planets, some even exactly where we collected them in 2002, once collected they will allow you to access some extras: you can therefore change the graphic interface and make other aesthetic changes or unlock cheats... and you would be hypocrites in saying that infinite ammunition does not make you hungry! The Holoscards instead replace two old collectibles at the same time: the secret projects of the RYNO and the style points. But how do they work? During the game, or after a fight or hidden in a secret area, you will find packets of Holoscards: these are divided into sets of three cards each and once you complete a set you will unlock an upgrade, then by exchanging five double cards you will be able to unlock a missing card from an incomplete set. In addition to the thirty-one basic sets, you will find three special ones necessary to unlock the RYNO, the most powerful weapon in the game; if you manage to collect these nine rare cards, you can then take them to Slim Cognito and ask him to build you the former M.I.P.S.. The sets of Holocards depicting places and characters unlock a higher percentage of collected Bolts and Raritaniums, while those of weapons allow you to unlock the Omega version of the aforementioned weapon for Challenge Mode. This mode is nothing more than a New Game Plus, which will allow you to restart the game with your arsenal of weapons, Gold Bolts and Holoscards (but not gadgets), in order to be able to bring each piece to the maximum level of your inventory; to succeed in the enterprise as an addition the Bolt multiplier will be inserted so the more enemies you kill without getting injured, the higher the percentage of Bolts collected will be. Small note: if you manage to unlock the RYNO before the end of the game (which you can easily do with a little effort) when you start the Challenge mode you will no longer find the weapon in your inventory but you will still have the Holoscards to build it new, also once you unlock the Omega version of a weapon you will have to spend a considerable amount of Bolts to buy it again. Among the various additional contents you will then find an Extra item in the main menu in which all the sketches of the first chapter are collected and a museum that can be visited in the garage on Veldin, with six hangars full of old ships, monsters, robots, enemies and many other goodies from all past chapters.", "date": "2016-04-11", "grade": "9.0"}
