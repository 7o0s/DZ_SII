Carrying on the healthy Twilight Zone tradition, Chris Carter's creature had a significant impact in those years and remained indelible in the memory of those who lived it live. Also for this reason, it is a bit surprising that the new official video game on the series (recently back on TV with a new season, after last year's revival) is a free-to-play mobile game equipped with all the classic traps of this business model, but we have to be like Moulder and get to the bottom of the investigation without stopping at appearances, because ~we want to believe~ in the power of this brand. X-Files: Deep State is a sort of graphic adventure that mixes different game mechanics, mainly presenting itself as a classic hidden object but with the integration of a series of investigative-setting mini-games that, unexpectedly, all work quite well mixed together, although the gaming experience is obviously somewhat fragmented. The story is told with interlude scenes and dialogues in a structure similar to that of the show, therefore with background, traumatic event and the arrival of the agents, who in this case are not Moulder and Scully (however present within the story , obviously) but a ~rookie~ grappling with the first cases in the FBI and his cynical and very little imaginative companion. With a particularly apt idea, the game allows users to choose the approach to follow in each case between ~believer~ and ~skeptic~, or between ~empathic~ and ~rational~, through a series of options during the dialogues and above all a definitive final choice at the conclusion of each case, which determines a clear demarcation in the conclusion of the stories. Trust No1 The basic mechanics are that of the hidden object, i.e. one is called upon to examine different scenarios trying to identify a certain number of objects within a given time limit, but discovering probative elements and fragments of the stories to reconstruct the cases they unlock further investigative mini-games. We then find ourselves looking for fingerprints, reconstructing decomposed images, solving basic puzzles based on figures and numbers or taking part in exploratory sections that can also lead to basically action situations, even if they are always short and simple gameplay unstructured. Then there is the usual system of traps linked to the free-to-play model to take into consideration: to advance through the fundamental phases of the cases, a certain number of stars is required, which can be acquired by returning to the hidden object sessions, which which in turn consumes an energy bar that can be recharged over time or through the inevitable microtransactions. The catch is not so much in the risk of having to spend continuously, but in this having to continually return to the same screens to look for more or less the same objects, which fortunately are sorted and masked each time in different ways but not enough to avoid a certain tiredness after a few hours of play. Fortunately, the hybrid and fragmented nature of the gameplay at least manages to vary the experience even if the game never gets to actually be fun or engaging on this front. There are also enforced breaks that can take up to an hour and can only be avoided by paying. There is still some good writing behind it and interesting cases to follow, in which the typical X-Files vibes can be seen in the background, even beyond the obvious references to the cast and recurring topics of the original series.", "date": "2018-03-01", "grade": "6.5"}
