Fortunately, the transition from two to three dimensions was not particularly traumatic: the old faces of the original series that we find in Maximum Impact retain the characteristic features created by the SNK character designers years ago, updated to modern standards through a few but spot-on tricks. So Terry Bogard, Rock Howard, Athena Asamiya, Leona, Iori Yagami, Kyo Kusanagi, Ryo Sakazaki and others are back again, here in three dimensions, as we have never seen them before, and with fairly satisfactory results: the polygonal models show remarkable dimensions and they are detailed and proportionate, the animations are fluid and natural, the texturing is accurate, the colors are bright and in good variety. The fighters play them in numerous arenas that recall the historical ones of the two-dimensional episodes: an airport, a temple, the roof of a building and so on, in which the background elements are often animated and give the idea of a place alive and pulsating, while the clash rages which in some cases also modifies the environment itself: throw an opponent against the airport gates and they will bend and writhe, repelling the opponent and allowing us the possibility of inflicting additional damage. There are also the characteristic special effects that distinguish the supernatural nature of certain special attacks: energy emissions, flashes of fire, electric discharges and more manifest themselves during the fights in a fireworks display of sure impact. And therefore in general Maximum Impact at first sight seems like a good game, certainly not at the technical level of sacred monsters such as Tekken 5, Virtua Fighter 4 or Soul Calibur II, but certainly well taken care of. It is a pity that terrible slowdowns often occur on the move which not only put a fairly good technical department in a bad light, but also affect the conduct of the combat itself. It must be said that even on the sound side the situation is not exactly rosy: pass the mediocre musical tracks that accompany the fights, but the dubbing is truly terrible, even if only in the few cutscenes in which the wrestlers and their referee chatter to start or end the fight. At this point many readers, perhaps fans of the original The King of Fighters, resigned to the mediocrity of the technical realization, will hope in the programming of a title that can recall the ancient glories of their favorite saga. Another disappointment to come. The King of Fighters EX...plus Alpha? If it weren't clear by now, The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact is not a real 3D fighting game, but a 2D and 1/2, one of those titles that reproduce a two-dimensional mechanics set in a polygonal technical context. A famous example could be Hudson's Bloody Roar, but at this point it is more fitting to mention Street Fighter EX plus Alpha, or the unfortunate three-dimensional series of Capcom's most famous fighting game. The King of Fighters fans sit down: no more three-on-three fighting, the team system has been removed and relegated to a secondary option for an extra mode, replaced by the very classic one-on-one combat system view. And exactly as in Street Fighter EX, also in Maximum Impact the spectacular (relative, however) of the images takes the place of the technical nature of the gameplay, which does not properly exploit the three dimensions except for the possibility of performing a side-step in order to to dodge direct attacks, moving the clash onto a new axis, but substantially bringing it back to the starting situation. There is no freedom of movement, apart from this, and ultimately the three-dimensionality of Maximum Impact almost seems like a joke. Moreover, the same move-lists of the characters are quite perplexing: accustomed to titles such as the aforementioned Tekken 5 or Soul Calibur II, one would expect dozens of special moves and combos, but one finds oneself faced with a couple of skimpy pages illustrating the combinations of keys to press to perform some special attacks, a couple of super-attacks (the good old Desperation Moves that consume the appropriate bar at the bottom of the screen) and half a dozen combinations of basic attacks (weak and strong kick, weak punch and strong), pre-established and, above all, predictable. The lack of variety in the combat system, which is reduced to a totally old-fashioned exchange of special moves, where moreover the more classic distance shots such as Terry's Power Wave or Athena's Psycho Ball are monstrously disadvantaged precisely by the side-step encouraging close combat, she is further mortified by the disproportionate strength ofsome wrestlers, who happen to base their repertoire of attacks on multi-hit combinations, and who find devastating multiple attacks as Desperation Moves that are incredibly difficult to block due to their speed and, sometimes and paradoxically, by the slowdowns that occur during the fight. The result is therefore bland and ambiguous: a two-dimensional fighting game, placed in a three-dimensional graphic and playful context, in which classic characters have been inserted almost by force with attacks unsuitable for the new mechanics, literally dominated by the new characters based specifically on the ~new~ gameplay. However, Maximum Impact lets itself be played, and at least offers a good variety of game modes, among which it is worth mentioning the Story Mode (actually embarrassing, given that characters like Terry and Clark, who have challenged each other for years in past editions of the tournament, here they don't even seem to know each other!), the Mission Mode (also already seen in Street Fighter EX) and a sort of entertainment where you can admire the models of the characters, dress them up and read their stories and descriptions. A wasted opportunity, only in this way can we define the Playmore production that bears the name of The King of Fighters, deviating so radically from the original spirit of the series that it is almost impossible not to be disappointed already by the premise, the lack of historic team fights. As if that weren't enough, Maximum Impact turns out to be a bland fighting game, technically good but marred by extremely annoying slowdowns and a mediocre soundtrack and atrocious dubbing. But after all, with similar games it is important not to stop at the aesthetic aspect and focus on the fun that the playful front is able to offer, and also in this case Maximum Impact fails, proposing an all too old-fashioned gameplay, devoid of that profound technicality that had characterized its illustrious two-dimensional prequels, practically becoming a title for ~geeks~ looking for an easy and immediate beat'em-up. And if it's this type of game you're looking for, you can even overlook the technical quality. But if you are a fan of the glorious saga or a lover of new generation fighting games, direct your attention towards certainly more deserving titles. One last thought: SNK, we miss you. Pros: Old favorites in the roster of fighters Decent graphics Good variety of game modes Cons: No depth and technicality Awful voice acting Not The King of Fighters It's been a few years now since SNK bid an official farewell to its fans, but we still miss it like it happened yesterday. The eternal rivalry between the two-dimensional fighting games of SNK and Capcom now seems to belong to a mythological past, now that the playrooms of beat'em-up enthusiasts are dominated by three-dimensional titles, increasingly technical and spectacular. The legendary series born from SNK, mainly The King of Fighters, Fatal Fury and Samurai Spirits, have still popped up on the shelves lately, with more or less successful conversions of some chapters, but the magic seems to have gone out. This sad awareness is confirmed by Maximum Impact, the first polygonal episode of the most famous SNK series, precisely The King of Fighters, considered among the best fighting game series ever made for the technicality, depth and completeness of the gameplay, and the first fighting game to introduce the teams in clashes. The problem is that Maximum Impact from good old King of Fighters has nothing at all.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
