Will it be another card expansion with sleeves or another adventure? The cards are becoming thousands: does this mean that they will decide to divide the game into formats, like the good Magic the Gathering did when it introduced the Standard one (using only the cards from the latest expansions)? No answer for now, so let's just end the adventure by going to the museum in the Explorers' Hall. At the end of the third wing, the evil mummified archaeologist Rafaam has stolen the Staff of Creation, now complete, to be able to animate some exhibits in the museum and keep our Brann, Reno, Ser Pinnus and Elise Seekers busy while he steals everything he can; it will be our job to put everything back in order, first by facing the two bosses that Rafaam will put against us and then by defeating the same one twice. The class challenges are also completed, which this time are reserved for thieves and wizards. Throughout the adventure, the four explorers will enrich the experience with funny interventions in some key moments. The clashes of the latter wing are really difficult in the heroic version: some can even be complicated in the normal version and, for this, it will be necessary to build special decks, but the effort will guarantee the coveted reward, i.e. the completion of the adventure collection with the last 12 cards that we will examine also giving our ranking of the best in the League of Explorers. Look out Rafaam, we too are entering the Hall of Explorers! The League of Explorers change the Hearthstone metagame in a very significant way A night at the museum The first creature animated by Rafaam is the Skelesaurus with its fun Ancient Power, which provides a random card to each player, and its cost reduced to zero. The heroic version of the boss, in addition to equipping him with extra armor, grants the ~free to play~ card only to himself, making the fight not a little complicated; we recommend a mage deck with Phantom Armor, the new minion that takes only one damage at a time, obtained in the normal version: the artificial intelligence will not attack it with minions therefore, if you manage to use spells that freeze them and keep them there 'Phantom Armor alive, you will win. Rafaam, not happy with having animated the Skelesaurus, thought of animating the Steel Sentinel as well: this boss, in the normal version, only takes 1 damage at a time and is already complicated enough, but it is enough to build an aggressive deck with minions from 1 damage and with the Knife Thrower in support to overcome it. The heroic version is a nervous breakdown as both the boss and all his minions suffer 1 damage at a time and the latter, needless to say, are almost all equipped with Provocation: it took us over an hour to beat him, playing very long games and using a Sorcerer deck with the Dreadsteed able to return to the battlefield after dying, however, it is also possible to win with the paladin which maximizes the effectiveness of Equality, bringing all minions to 1, and Military Rally, to invade the camp of 1/1 soldiers. This is undoubtedly the most difficult battle of the whole adventure! After you've pissed off Arch Thief Rafaam, he'll take the field himself being funny enough to steal your deck to play (and that's exactly what you need to take advantage of to take the game home) while there's a deck prepared by the explorers that is quite pitiful and that will lead Elise Cercastella to apologize to you with a joke that we do not want to reveal; Rafaam's hero power is the ability to make an Unstable Portal (well known wizard magic) every turn and the difference between the normal and heroic version is that the boss will have extra armor. The strategy to overcome the battle, possibly using the warrior, is to take advantage of the Rare Spear, a weapon present in your deck that costs 1 and is 1/2 but gets +1 in attack and +1 in integrity when the opponent plays a rare card: obviously, you will equip the deck to give to Rafaam with completely useless rare cards like the new Mysterious Statue, which is a 7/7 but does not attack unless it is the only minion in play, or the harmless Ancient Guardian; the important thing is to put in the deck the new weapon obtained from this wing, the Cursed Blade which, when equipped, causes the boss to suffer double damage. This battle, although much simpler than the previous one, has enemy number one in the randomness of the Unstable Portal, given the boss's ability to draw any minion.Rafaam say hello, kisses, hugs and new papers Rafaam, equipped with the Staff of Creation, is the last obstacle to overcome to finish the adventure and, in both the normal and heroic versions, it is possible to attack him every three turns while, in those in which he is immune to damage, we will take care of keep the table clean. Whenever he becomes vulnerable, he summons a Boss already faced in the previous wings with characteristics similar to his hero power (Bigfin, Archaedas, and so on) but, if in the normal version it is a 5/5, in the heroic one it is always a 10/10 and his skills are much more annoying. Don't despair, because your hero power is replaced by Exploration which activates for free in normal mode and with 2 mana in heroic mode and which puts artifacts in your hand, at no cost and with different abilities, each accompanied by the explorer who found it and who comments on its discovery: there's the one that gives you extra mana, the one that lets you choose a minion giving you three copies, the one that does splash damage and even one that replaces your hand with Unstable Portals. We beat the latter enemy with a priest deck with a lot of removal and Mind Control to take Rafaam's 10/10: the fight will keep you busy but even this doesn't compare to the Steel Sentinel. This time we start by examining the last adventurer's legendary Elise Starseeker: she's a 4-mana 3/5 neutral minion who puts Map for the Golden Ape into your deck, a 2-cost spell that makes you draw a card and puts, in fact, the Golden Monkey in the deck, a 4 mana 6/6 with Taunt that, as soon as it comes into play, replaces all your cards with legendary minions! This card is really complex and the only type of game capable of exploiting it could be that of control, even if getting to have all the legendary in the deck seems like something very remote (who knows if some pro-player will surprise us in this too case); in the arena it could be a valid card, since the matches tend to last a little longer. The Fossil Gigantosaurus is a neutral 8/8 that gains taunt if you control a beast: a really bad card, very slow for the hunter, useless for the druid, given that there is the Ironwood Treant at the same cost, and very bad even in the arena. The Cursed Blade is the warrior's new weapon which, for a single mana, is 2/3 but has a really big problem, that of making you suffer double damage: it was also rejected in the arena. The mage receives the Phantom Armor, a 4-mana 4/4 minion that, as long as it remains on the table, causes you to take only one damage at a time, however, we don't believe it will find use in any format given its body so vulnerable. The Mysterious Statue is a 4 mana 7/7 that can't attack unless it's the only minion in play: at first glance it might seem better than the Ancient Guardian and find space in the famous Handlock deck, moreover, it could be a target of the Hunting Expert who will not go on your Dr. Boom but the 4 cost makes it less attractive than expected, given that the Defender of Argus is usually played in that turn, and the constant presence of servants at the table push us to also advise against it in the Arena. The Staggering Pygmies card is a 2/6 neutral minion with a ~Summon three 2/2 Pygmies~ deathrattle, and while a priest can steal it with Shadow Cabalist, it has great potential to be played with its devastating deathrattle. death: imagine a warrior playing the Brawl card and, as a result, finding the table full of pygmies instead of cleaning up! Finally a convincing totally positive card also for the arena. The Errant Dromedary is the hunter's new beast minion, it's a three-mana 2/4 that, as a battle cry, puts a 1-mana minion from its own deck into play for each player: it seems a bit slow to us for the ~face hunter~ but, perhaps in a mid-range, it could be used to get Ser Pinnus out of the opponent's deck so that he doesn't activate; in the arena it could also do damage since, almost certainly, both decks have minions at 1 cost. The Curse of Rafaam is a spell for the Warlock that costs 2 and which ends up straight in the opponent's hand; at the beginning of each of his turns he will inflict 2 damage to him unless he gets rid of it by spending 2 mana: this card seems like the icing on the cake for the Zoo and slows down the opponent's deck considerably, since he has to use 2 mana to not suffer its effects; even in the arena it does its job. The best cards Here is the ranking of the best adventure cards for Multiplayer.it, they have been chosen based on the influence they are having on the metagame, do you agree? Reno Jackson: This legend is creating many new decks iaround it Brann Bronzebeard: This Legendary's effect really turns the tide of a fight Ser Pinnus: a legendary that revolutionizes the game, too bad you play in one copy Goodbye League of Explorers The last 4 cards seemed to us to be the strongest in this wing: the first is the other neutral legendary, the Arch Thief Rafaam, a 9 mana 7/8 who unearths a powerful artifact, which costs 10, choosing between the one that does 10 damage split between enemies, the one that gives +10+10 to a minion, and the one that fills your field with Zombies 3/3. This minion can ideally fit in any control deck and be lethal in the arena as well. The Grave Raider, a 4-mana 5/4 thief card that puts a coin into your hand as a death rattle, is a minion, excellent as an aid to developing a death rattle deck and as an accelerator aimed at getting off a turn earlier the big shots like Dr. Boom or to activate a combo in the later stages of the game; promoted in both modalities. The druid's new 1-cost spell is the Idol of the Raven, capable of uncovering a spell or minion and is fantastic both in the aggressive druid and in the ramp, nevertheless in the arena, in our opinion really a bomb. Priests, get ready because you too have your own adventure card, the Museum Curator who, for just 2 mana, is a 1/2 who Revives a deathrattle minion: it is no coincidence that he is already present in the dragon deck and in the pro-players priest control deck, he is really strong with his ability to provide a Dark Cultist or a Piloted Woodwrecker, to name the best, authentic spectacle even in the arena, indeed, in this format it could give players the desire to choose priest, one of the least played classes. We just have to greet you with the usual end-of-adventure melancholy wishing you, as is happening to the heroes after the Christmas decorations of the various game arenas, Happy Winterfell Eve!", "date": "2015-12-16", "grade": "8.5"}
