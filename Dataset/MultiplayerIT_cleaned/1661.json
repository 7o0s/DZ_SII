{"name": "Grande Fratello", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grande-fratello.html", "text": "Pedro, it's roooot Well, this risks being one of the shortest reviews in the history of Multiplayer, there is so little meat in the fire that I'm afraid to finish the arguments in ten lines. Let's get straight to the point. Once you have chosen your favorite character, among those of the latest editions of the TV show, one hundred long days await you to face together with nine other roommates. All the protagonists of Big Brother have different physical, emotional and intellectual characteristics. The gameplay resembles that of a particularly successful title, known as The Sims: each day is divided into rounds (just to prove me wrong, this is a big difference compared to The Sims) and, once you gain control of your character, simply clicking with the circle key on an object or on an opponent, a drop-down menu will appear with a list of executable actions. Depending on your behavior, you will influence interpersonal relationships with the other inhabitants of the house. You won't be frowned upon if you don't wash and, likewise, behaving badly with everyone won't help your overall reputation. All of this could lead you to the nomination: every Thursday night, all the tenants of the house will have to choose two people they would like to kick out of the house. The two inhabitants who receive the most votes will be nominated. Here the only innovative factor of this title takes over: the public at home will decide, the following week, the competitor who will be eliminated. In fact, your actions, in addition to making your roommates love/hate you, will also be judged by a virtual audience who will appreciate your ravings in the confessional or your farts around the house. The aim of the game, needless to say, is to win Big Brother after a hundred long days of confinement. Said like this, it might even seem like an interesting game, in reality the mechanics are so repetitive and banal that it will get boring within a few minutes. The technique We must not forget that we are dealing with a game for Psone. Having said that, the 2d used in the game is very poor: the general design is not of a good standard and everything appears rushed and careless. The only thing that is saved are the animations accompanying our actions that shine more for irony rather than for real qualities. The sound accompaniment is entrusted to pleasant music for the first few minutes but haunting in the long run. Each week, you will unlock a low-quality footage from past Big Brother TV editions. This is the only extra in the game and, on closer inspection, the only reason that could push a GF enthusiast to purchase. Comment I was literally speechless. After only a few minutes, about ten to be precise, the game gets boring: once you've faced the first two weeks, you'll have experienced everything there was to experience and the title won't offer you any kind of fun. The technical realization, not to mention an absolutely poor style and little appeal, is so ridiculous that it seems to be back to the 16-bit period, PSOne has accustomed us to an infinitely higher graphic level. In summary, there is no single reason to buy this game. The final grade might seem slightly high, at least in relation to what has been read in the previous lines. In reality, it is to be considered as an average between a 3, considering the title a full-fledged video game, and a 7, thinking of big brother lovers looking for a few carefree hours in the company of their Playstation. Pros: Italian software! It's a pastime... Cons: Bad graphics Bad sound Bad gameplay Bad longevity PLEASE NOTE: The Big Brother game was developed for the PSOne system. Of course, it's perfectly compatible with Playstation 2 as long as you have a PSone memory card for saves. Could a video game about the most successful media event of recent years be missing? Naturally not it was the task of Trecision, an all-Italian software house, to fill this hole in our soft banks. But was there really a need?", "date": "2003-05-08", "grade": null}
