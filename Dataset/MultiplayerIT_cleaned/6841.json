Not only that: thanks to a mysterious link with Amber, the warm magical substance that the elves extract from the Tree of the Earth, this peculiar character also possesses special abilities, such as a ~thermal~ vision, the ability to make himself invisible for some instants and to generate clones that can sneak in his place through narrow passages, to distract a guard or activate a switch. The plot of the new title developed by Cyanide Studio is told through the device of flashbacks: in the early stages we witness the capture of Styx by the guards of the Tower of Akenash, then a harsh interrogation by the governor and his son. The part played therefore refers to the ~confession~ of the protagonist, who reveals to his jailers what led him there, namely his intention to steal the heart of the Tree of the Earth. A high-risk operation, which unfolds through seven chapters in which there is no lack of major twists, and which require fifteen to twenty hours to be completed, depending on how many times certain sections will have to be repeated. Styx: Master of Shadows stands in fact as a damned hardcore stealth game, devoid of a friendly checkpoint system and therefore capable of generating great frustration when game over occurs after passing a difficult area, forgetting, however, to save the position. Similarly, the use of quicksaves breaks up the rhythm of a gameplay that is based solely and exclusively on stealth, and which when it goes off these tracks shows enormous limits. Styx: Master of Shadows is a solid and challenging stealth game, but with a few too many edges Little goblins grow up Powered by the tried and tested Unreal Engine 3 (this can be understood both from the conformation of the polygonal models and from the traditional ~bounce~ of the corpses when they fall on the ground near railings or crates...), Styx: Master of Shadows draws on the same fantasy imagery of Of Orcs and Men, of which it is practically a prequel, painting a scenario made up of intrigues and power games, a weak alliance between humans and elves and a bestiary all around (the huge trolls and, of course, the goblins) just waiting for the moment to unleash. At the center of this precarious equilibrium is the Earth Tree, a plant of enormous dimensions, around which a fortress-city has been built, manned by hundreds of armed guards. Our goal, as mentioned, will be to introduce ourselves inside the walls, find a safe haven and from there tackle the various missions, meanwhile taking care of the growth of the character through the unlocking of extra skills that refer to Styx's different talents . Defining the game an ~action RPG~ precisely because of the presence of these elements honestly seems exaggerated to us, however there is a certain freedom of action with respect to the qualities that we can decide to enhance, for example by activating the ability to kill an enemy from behind a shelter, from a height or overhang; muffle the noise of our steps and become truly invisible in the dark; increase the carrying capacity of the bag to be able to carry with us a greater number of healing potions, doses of Amber, vials of acid (to eliminate corpses around) and throwing knives; focus on special powers such as magnified vision and, in general, the location of opponents in the scenario; improve combat and our life expectancy in case we get caught; and finally enrich the repertoire of our clones, so that they can provide us with concrete support rather than just distracting some sentries. My clone's clone is my clone We were talking about Unreal Engine 3, which in the PC version of the game translates into graphics nailed to sixty frames per second (with v-sync activated, otherwise the result is much higher) at 1080p and with all effects maxed out. The visual impact is unfortunately not ~next-gen~, although Styx: Master of Shadows is only available for the Windows platform, for PlayStation 4 and for Xbox One. On the contrary, the assets often seemed uninspired to us, already seen, sketched, with a quantity of not exactly defined plots, some interpenetration and a global rendering, even of the landscapes, of the lighting system and of the connecting animations, far from being able leave a concrete mark. Similar speech for the sound sector, which beyond some inspired tracks, based on strings, offers dialogues in English generally recited with poor convinction (protagonists aside), well subtitled in Italian. However, the problems of this production do not lie in the artistic figure or in a just discrete polygonal count, but in the aforementioned excessively hardcore approach and in the lack of facets beyond a stealth phase which also appears traditional and devoid of innovative solutions. So imagine the soldiers who follow pre-established routes, without variations, and who do not ask themselves questions if their colleagues disappear one by one because in the meantime we are killing them; or they regain their composure after the sighting of a corpse to enable us to dutifully resume our action. Creating a more advanced stealth game would probably mean redesigning certain mechanisms in order to leave possible alternatives anyway, but if people like Hideo Kojima don't take care of it, we can't expect the guys from Cyanide Studio to make the revolution. Which is entirely legitimate, for heaven's sake, but acceptable solutions must also be adopted for the standard combat phases, or when our character is caught and decides to make his way noisily among the enemy troops. In this juncture Styx: Master of Shadows shows all its limits, presenting blows devoid of any sensation of impact and a combat system that leaks from all sides, in which it is not clear how to enter into direct confrontation, ending up getting caught always and in any case some extra slash. Which, considering the shortage of healing potions and objects to collect around, closes the circle of a hardcore approach that fans may appreciate, but which will not fail to make them curse profusely too.", "date": "2014-10-13", "grade": "6.8"}
