Three Tales of in the space of ten months, translated into Italian moreover, stuff that if you had told us a few years ago we would have burst out laughing and made you admit to a psychiatric hospital, also asking for a ban on approaching which at least you were dangerous too. Instead, towards the end of 2014, it is now clear that Hideo Baba, the father of Tales of, and all of Namco Bandai are looking at our market with renewed interest, evidently aware that there are many fans here too. Tales of Hearts R, then, is a real extraordinary case given that it is the remake of the homonymous and controversial episode released for Nintendo DS in 2008 and never localized for the West. It was a poll that decided which of the three episodes for the Nintendo portable should be remade from scratch (the R stands for Reimagining, ~Namchese~ for remake) and Hearts won against Tales of Innocence and Tales of the Tempest, doing happy Hideo Baba who always called it one of his favorite Tales and one that all fans should play. But does Tales of Hearts R really deserve all its praise? Tales of Hearts R is a great jRPG for fans of the series who own the Sony portable console The meaning of the R The PlayStation Vita version of Tales of Hearts has been completely redesigned from scratch, keeping only some cartoon cutscenes from the original - they are distinguished by the square format and the black side bars - to which some brand new ones have been added which, although they are quite short, they have a much higher quality. The remake has completely abandoned the computer graphics kinematics proposed in the ~alternative~ version of the original for Nintendo 3DS, an experiment that Namco Bandai had tried and abandoned in a hurry, fortunately. Apart from this, everything is new: the R edition features polygonal models and environments instead of two-dimensional sprites, so much so that some dungeons have been totally redesigned to meet the new engine. In reality, it is not that Namco Bandai has squeezed the most out of the excellent PlayStation Vita hardware: on the Sony laptop we have seen much better running both in terms of textures and animations, and in certain moments the interlude sequences through which it develops the story seemed rather crude to us. Fortunately, the developer has taken great care of the models of the main characters, the level of detail and the color palette: Tales of Hearts R certainly does not leave you speechless, but it is a very colorful jRPG that gives its best in fights, where the The effects and excellent animations of characters and enemies make every fight a pleasure for the eyes, with all due respect to the bland and poorly detailed backdrops. It is also an ~old-fashioned~ Tales, with its fully explorable world map, albeit not very detailed and approximate, and the illustrations to underline the most important moments instead of a cold interlude cutscene. Motoi Sakuraba's soundtrack is sparkling and lively but also dark when necessary, and fits perfectly with one of the choices that will make purists happy and which allowed the ~economic~ localization of the game: Namco Bandai has in fact given up on dubbing the lots of spoken dialogues, keeping the original Japanese with Italian subtitles. We liked the adaptation, a little foul-mouthed but youthful, also because it must not have been easy to translate the many puns and an entire rhyming tale. The tale of the heart The technical sector, despite its ups and downs, didn't worry us but the story, the characters and the gameplay did. Let's say right away that the beginning of Tales of Hearts R is not the most promising in every respect, but by insisting for a few hours, all the merits of what is actually one of the funniest Tales we have played immediately emerge. We have to wait a long time to understand the meaning of the tale of the ~Sleeping Beauty~ that peeps out from time to time in the story, the favorite of Kor Meteor, the young protagonist of this adventure. Kor is a somatic like his grandfather, that is, an individual capable of using the power of his own spiria (the soul, basically) to interact with that of others and manifest his fortitude in the form of a weapon. Kor's quiet life is turned upside down when he meets the Hearts brothers, the beautiful Kohaku and the surly Hisui: fleeing from a witch named Incarose, the two brothers are looking for Kor's grandfather and the unfortunate reunion will have two dramatic consequences. First, Kor's grandfather dies, and second, Kohaku's spirit falls apart and scatters across the world, beforevandola of practically every feeling. Thus begins a journey in search of Kohaku's fragments that the title of the game sums up in a decidedly explicit way: Tales of Hearts is in fact the story of the two Hearts brothers, precisely, but also that of the ~hearts~ in which Kor and associates they will come across and that they will often have to purify from the Xerom, nightmarish creatures that seem to feed on negative emotions. At the beginning, the story of Tales of Hearts R is quite linear and reminiscent of the old Dragon Quests, with the journey taking our heroes from one village to another to solve problems on duty, perhaps recruit a new party member and recover a fragment of poor Kohaku. After a few hours, however, the knots begin to come to a head with the introduction of various supporting actors and intrigues: between knights of the Church, witches and spies, the story of Tales of Hearts R acquires a decidedly different flavor, thanks also to the peculiar characterization of his characters. Although there is a lot of focus on the value of friendship, as usual, Tales Studio has opted this time for a truly bizarre party, in which at the beginning no one seems to get along with the others: Kor is the victim of constant teasing about his his naivety, Hisui is excessively towards his sister, Gall hides far too many mysteries and so on. The journey will, of course, bring these wacky heroes together, as they must come to terms with their pasts and begin to trust each other. Once again, the title felt more fitting than ever. Vintage is beautiful As we said, the story and the characters can initially be misleading, and the same goes for the gameplay. Before discussing the combat system, the fundamental nucleus of any self-respecting Tales of, it is worth emphasizing how happy we were to find ourselves in our hands an old-fashioned Tales, where the cities are separated by an explorable world map and the dungeons they are not linear combinations of corridors, but rather intricate mazes in which you often have to solve various puzzles, moving boulders, walking on certain platforms in the right order and interacting with switches and elements of the scenery through Kor's magic ring. In these moments we definitely recognized the touch of Team Symphonia, brought in at the time to help Team Destiny develop the Nintendo DS version. The ecstasy is somewhat spoiled by the random fights, unfortunately returned from the past with a fair frequency. Which certainly doesn't improve the first two or three hours of the game, when the combat system appears decidedly dull and monotonous. Tales of Hearts R is played like any other Tales, directly controlling one character at a time and facing enemies in real time, almost like a fighting game. The problems arise by studying the control system, which unusually associates the left stick with free running on the battlefield and the right stick with the limbs of the character used. The circle key is also used to use the limbs, but not in combination with a direction: you can simply associate up to four limbs which will follow one another by repeatedly pressing the button. This means that you have free access to only five limbs at a time, not to mention that their chaining is limited by the CT points that recharge over time and that are initially only two, which means that you can only use two limbs in a row and then you have to wait a few seconds in which only basic attacks can be used. Nice rip off, huh? As we said, however, it is only the beginning. Within a few hours the combat system begins to expand to take on a decidedly more dazzling shape. To begin with, the touch screen allows you to associate shortcuts to each character and to order the use of a certain art simply by touching his portrait even when you are not personally controlling him. In addition, we will soon be taught to stun enemies or counterattack by parrying at the right time when they are enraged. As if that weren't enough, Tales of Hearts R at a certain point introduces the mechanism of the Hunt which basically changes the combat system from day to night. By repeatedly hitting the enemy it is in fact possible to weaken him and therefore throw him into the air; at that point, by pressing the correct button, you can teleport behind him to continue hitting him, over and over again, perhaps ending the assault with a powerful special blow or a combined technique thrown by two characters simultaneously. The problem of the CTs, then, is easily solved thanks to the somas. In fact, the characters' weapons can be upgraded with the points earned at each level up: the systembut it is not very different from the one seen in Tales of Xillia and allows you to enhance a certain parameter of the soma to increase the CT and unlock new arts, new spells, passive special abilities and more powerful forms of the weapon in question. Combining the upgrades unlocks further abilities which, moreover, can be shared by multiple characters if their friendship is strong enough. In short, as you may have guessed, Tales of Hearts R is anything but the dull and superficial game that appears at the beginning, and the combat system gives its best especially at an intermediate difficulty level: like any good self-respecting Tales , fighting soon becomes a lot of fun and one more reason to explore the world in search of side missions and hidden objects such as the legendary cook, Namco tokens and other goodies.", "date": "2014-11-10", "grade": "8.3"}
