{"name": "DC Universe Online", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/84918-dc-universe-online-tutti-eroi-per-la-liberta.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3Protagonists of an endless series of cinematographic, editorial and videogame productions, the heroes and ~villains~ of the DC world still represent a big attraction for all fans today, thanks to the stories and the unique characterization of the characters given by the excellent screenwriters and designers. Thanks also to masterpieces such as The Dark Knight (without detracting from the previous interpretations of the Bat Man, often featuring a stellar cast but with a decidedly more ~excessive~ cut), and famous television series such as Smallville (starring a young Clark Kent) and before that Wonder Woman and Flash, without forgetting the three Superman played by the unforgettable Christopher Reeve; the heroes ~come out~ from DC comics have therefore entered the collective imagination, often also becoming protagonists of idioms. Videogame speaking and if you shift your attention to the latter period, the lion's share is undoubtedly entrusted to the excellent Batman: Arkham Asylum, never too acclaimed work by Rocksteady Studios whose long-awaited sequel is now in the pipeline; the last appearance of a large part of the DC gang is however due to a fighting title, that discreet Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe which, while not disfiguring in absolute terms, managed to dissatisfy both the fans of the gruesome former Midway fighting game and the followers of Superman and company. Strengthened by this large group of historical fans, Sony Online has had the audacity to attempt an experiment as interesting as it is risky, that is to transform this imaginary universe into something real (always videogame speaking) and tangible: DC Universe Online is in fact for all effects an MMORPG, a title that develops totally online in which the player plays himself, however endowed with the superpowers dreamed of as a child. Brainiac, you won't get my scalp! If in the not too distant future, thanks to deception, all the heroes of the earth are defeated by the villains (led by Lex Luthor), there is certainly nothing to rejoice about; then considering the pitiful state of the planet, which has become a battlefield for the occasion, the situation appears even more discouraging if possible. But as if that weren't enough in this context of destruction and desolation, all of humanity (or at least that which survived the furious clashes) is in a situation of extreme weakness, deprived of the defense of its superheroes and victim of the ~villains~, albeit debilitated they too from the struggle sustained: so without its heroic defenses, the earth is forced to passively (or almost) suffer the invasion of the terrible Brainiac, as ferocious as he is lucid alien artificial intelligence, whose declared objective is the subjugation and destruction of all the worlds it encounters. The only survivor of Brainiac's carnage will be Lex Luthor, responsible for most of what happened but who manages, thanks to a time machine, to go back and warn the skeptics Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman of the impending danger; as proof of what has been said, Luthor brings with him from the future the exobytes, androids that were originally meant to be used by Brainiac to steal the heroes' powers but which, due to the state of chaos in which the earth was at the time of the invasion, did not they actually became necessary. Thanks to the expobytes stolen from the future, the Justice League can give powers to all human beings who request them, thus helping to prepare a very powerful army to defend the planet. Playstation 3 trophies DC Universe Online initially starts with a budget of only 14 trophies, but 10 of which are gold, 3 silver and one platinum. The reason for the unusual distribution is due to the particular nature of the objectives, essentially linked to reaching level 30 for each type of possible character, both hero and villain; a choice that makes unlocking all the trophies long and tiring, but certainly helps to keep the desire to play the title high for a long time. With great power comes great responsibility The disturbing as well-narrated premise, a prelude to DC Universe Online, gives rise to a fascinating story that sees the player protagonist of heroic (or ignoble) actions around the two symbolic cities of the DC universe, namely the sunny Metropolis and the dark and gloomy Gotham City, in accordance with the classic iconography linked to the two settings. Like any self-respecting MMORPG, the main and perhaps most delicate phase is that of creating the character, to be selected from among the good or bad heroes: a small premise to make is that throughout the article, for convenience, reference will always be made to the world of heroes, but each characterca mentioned also applies in the same way in the case of the creation of a villain, naturally with opposite and specular objectives. After the customization phase, to which an in-depth box has been dedicated due to its complexity, the long and interesting main quest finally begins, obviously preceded by a tutorial phase set inside a Brainiac spaceship; at the end of this little escape the player will be able to meet and fight side by side with his mentor (selected at the time of character creation), who will give him access to the main city he belongs to (in the case of Superman, for example, he will inevitably start in Metropolis) guiding him during the first missions. Each city is structured in neighborhoods and security coordination is entrusted to three police stations, places where it is possible to buy and sell objects, repair damaged components but also obtain new main and secondary missions; moving between police stations or from one city to another is possible thanks to the teleporters present in the Watchtower, the famous Watch Tower from which the heroes coordinate all operations. The Watchtower tour, which among other things is one of the side missions initially available, allows you to discover real gems for DC comics lovers, among which it is worth mentioning the Hall of Heroes, with the three statues giants of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, and the Hall of War, where the three protagonists discuss battle plans through the great glass dome. On the streets of Gotham and Metropolis The control system is certainly one of the strong points of DC Universe Online, managing to combine immediacy and completeness with simplicity: attacks are in fact delegated to the traditional square and triangle buttons (respectively for close-up and distance shots), the circle button it acts as a classic action key (to move levers or lift objects for example), while the X is used to advance through the movement power chosen at the beginning (in the case of flight, for example, it increases the altitude reached); the parry is set on the R1 backbone, while holding down the two triggers R2 and L2 activates the powers menu, which can be recalled through the canonical 4 PlayStation buttons. The game hud is ultimately very simple and clear, with health, level and mana at the top left, the available powers at the bottom, the map at the top right and the mission objectives below the map; in the case of chat messages, these will be displayed in a window located on the right of the screen (in truth, the written chat is a bit cumbersome to reach, no problem instead for the audio one within the same group). Once you get off the street, you immediately realize how the action component is fundamental in Sony Online production: savagely beating enemies is in fact practically the main activity to be performed, resulting at least initially also quite satisfying. In the long run, however, the formula of finding a defined number of opponents, eliminating them, finding another type and eliminating them again could cause a certain intolerance even in the most ardent supporter of the comic book saga; it is true that alongside the frequent battles there are also exploratory sub-quests, but the percentage of these missions does not exceed (to be optimistic) 20% of the total. However, if, after the initial enthusiasm, you have the patience to overcome all those repetitive missions that lead up to level 23, the situation improves significantly, so much so that we can say that the final quests are probably the most interesting part of the game. Although of course you never stop beating like blacksmiths, after about fifty hours the activities to be carried out to achieve the objectives are diversified, as are the settings: without anticipating too much, in some circumstances it will be necessary, for example, to blend in with the enemies or even give up momentarily to one's soul, thus changing its appearance. Continuing through the levels, other game modes are unlocked as usual, always linked to the main plot but which do not take place in the two usual initial cities: the classic PvP Arenas can thus be selected from the menu for healthy fistfights between friends (maximum 8 vs 8) , the Alarms, i.e. special missions to be carried out in co-op set in different locations (Area 51, Hive Moon Base, Bludhaven, Gorilla Island, Oolong Island) and which can be tackled both as Healers and as Damage, the PvP Legends mode ( which is the only one in which the DC heroes can be used, after unlocking), the Raid and the Duo, always cooperative actions available once level 30 is reached; finally the Vaultit's a bonus environment, where you can search for upgrade items. Once the access request has been made, for example to a PvP arena or to an Alarm, to deceive the waiting time of the queue it is possible to move through the cities, in search of secondary quests or simply ~on patrol~; in fact, it is not uncommon to come across robbers, saboteurs or simple thugs along the dark alleys of Gotham to stop and arrest, helping to keep the city clean and to satiate the desire for latent heroism inherent in anyone who has read a DC comic at least once. The missions obtained following a specific arrest warrant for famous criminals are particularly difficult: the case of Bizarro for example, an unsuccessful clone of Superman who roams free in Metropolis, is an example of how to carry out this type of arrest it is not enough to throw headlong into the fray but on the contrary coordinate a cooperative attack strategy, with which to hit the opponent by exploiting his weaknesses. The tactics in the fights, although it takes over in a tangible way only in the second part of the game, is another of the strengths of Dc Universe Online: cooperation is always rewarded, while tackling a quest alone, if of a level comparable to the one reached, it is often a prelude to frustration and defeat. Heroes, but certainly not perfect... As we have seen, there is little to discuss about the vastness and videogame potential that Dc Universe Online has fielded for the first time in the console environment; however, this majesty has a high price to pay, linked both to the general technical quality and above all to the cleanliness of the game code. While artistically speaking the level design of the settings appears well cared for (with peaks of excellence in the case of the reproduction of Gotham City, including the Bat-signal in the skies and the rain that comes at times), the speech on the bare technical front is different , with a very high pop-up effect and accentuated bad clipping, as well as evident texture loading delays on approaching polygonal surfaces (especially if at high speeds). Of course, given the console's performance and the vastness of the game world, these graphical glitches can be at least partially justified; however, it is the numerous and frequent bugs that instead cause frustration and anger, especially after a sudden system freeze during an important mission. It must be said that in this sense, compared to the public beta, the situation has at least improved (in the case of the beta, at least one freeze was ensured for each hour of play...). In chaotic situations, the ambient audio suddenly disappears, while the volume of the voice of the heroes and non-player characters remains in any case always barely perceptible; moreover, it is not uncommon to witness the sudden escape along the roads of dead adversaries, dragged into thin air by invisible ropes. To partially resolve the situation, both the detail and the modeling of the heroes, moved by the Unreal Engine on certainly acceptable levels, and above all the soundtrack, truly epic and able to convey unique emotions; the PnGs, on the other hand, are less cared for, even if fortunately you don't see too many clones around the streets. Finally, a special mention should be made to the animated tables designed for the occasion which after each quest tell the story of the defeated character, in many cases using the historical Italian voice actor: an extra that DC design purists can only appreciate. More powers for everyone There are many and diversified powers that can be adopted by the player during the character creation phase: fire, devices, ice, mind, nature and sorcery are the categories concerning the source of the attacks, while on the movement front it is possible to choose between flight , stunts and super speed. The weapons, on the other hand, are divided into bows, fists, double pistols, double sided weapons, energy hands, martial arts, single-handed sidearms, rifles, sticks and two-handed sidearms. Impossible then to list all the combinations of aesthetic and functional customization present, without counting the objects that, during the missions, will be released or found around, capable of significantly enhancing the statistics (as well as adding further material to the already rich wardrobe) .", "date": "2011-02-07", "grade": "7.8"}
