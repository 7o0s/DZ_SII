{"name": "Tetris Ultimate", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/141257-tetris-ultimate-tetramini-hardcore.html", "text": "Gamers of the world, rejoice! Perhaps it will have escaped you between one billionaire next-gen production and another, but 2014 marks a very important anniversary in our world: thirty years of Tetris. It was in fact 1984 when a young Aleksej Leonidovi Paitnov showed the world that even in Great Mother Russia, then Soviet and communist, they knew how to make video games as well as and better than the hated capitalists behind the Iron Curtain. Of course, Tetris remained for years, well after the fall of the Berlin Wall, an isolated case of great videogame success from Eastern Europe, but what a case! Immediately brought to numerous systems and definitively consecrated with the Nintendo versions for NES and above all Game Boy, the progenitor of puzzle games remains to this day the most famous and most played, with a trail of conversions, reissues and new versions that comes smoothly up to the present Tetris Ultimate. For the 30th anniversary, Ubisoft offers us its version of Tetris, dedicated to the most ardent fans The ultimate Tetris? The basis of a success that knows no stop obviously lies in the game formula, simple and diabolical, so well known to all gamers that practically there is no need to explain the tetrominoes with different shapes, rolling, which descend from above at speed gradually greater and must be inserted once they reach the ground trying not to leave even one free space, that in doing so the completed lines are eliminated, earning more points the more these lines are, from one to four, and that the game ends when the mass of tetrominoes reaches the top edge of the screen. Over the years, a series of elements have been added, which Ultimate takes up again: the shadow projected at the base of the screen by a tetromino still in the descent phase, which makes it immediate to see where it is going to be placed, the possibility of making the descent of a piece is faster or even instantaneous, the preview of the next bricks that the CPU will make available up to a maximum of seven, and the possibility of putting one of these pieces in ~reserve~ to then use them when it is more useful. The Ubisoft title then takes up a concept in the game system that has already appeared in some previous editions, namely the T-Spin: it concerns exclusively the T-shaped tetromino, and is activated when we rotate it once it reaches the base. In doing so, in fact, there is the possibility of jamming it in otherwise unreachable ~ravines~, perhaps created for this purpose, and forfeiting more points. It may seem like a secondary novelty and not completely amalgamated with the rest, at least for those elderly players who will take a while to accept it and make it their own, but it begins to reveal a little of the spirit of this Tetris Ultimate: getting the most out of the T -Spin, voluntarily creating a space for the tetromino in question by carefully planning the road that we will then have to make it take, is a rather difficult exercise but very rewarding in terms of points. In short, a challenge designed for real ~professionals~ of Tetris, the category to which Ultimate, as we will soon see, seems dedicated. Quick overview of the modes present, some to be unlocked by meeting various requirements: the Marathon on 15 levels and the Sprint, which asks you to eliminate 40 lines in the shortest possible time, are very classic. Then there is Endless, which as the name suggests ends the game only at Game Over, Ultra which gives us three minutes to score as many points as possible, and finally Battaglia and Battaglia Definitiva. The latter two consist of the classic challenge against the CPU, with the lines that we eliminate ending up on the opponent's screen, but the second allows you to activate special bonuses once certain special bricks have been deleted. All these modes are playable both in single player and in multi-player, local and online, as we will see shortly, and there don't seem to be any particular efforts of imagination on the part of the programmers, as instead happened in the other Tetris for Nintendo 3DS, the one by Hudson released about three years ago, which inventively envisaged the use of all the characteristics of the machine, from stereoscopic 3D to the microphone up to the mistreated Augmented Reality. The 3D effect As we said in the body of the article, stereoscopic 3D in Tetris Ultimate is practically not noticed, so much so that we only noticed its presence because it is a feature that must be analyzed during the review. This is due both to the programmers' choice to calibrate it very low, and to the fact that all it does is detach the game plan from the backdrops; however, the latter are so discreet that they also determine the sobriety of the stereoscopy. In Mother Russia, they arethe tetrominoes to trap you! The novelties regarding the game modes come from the four Challenges present, which can only be used in the single player. The only one immediately available - the other three are unlocked by progressing through the system of objectives that the game offers us - is Rotation Lock, in which it will not be possible to rotate the tetrominoes during their descent. Then there is Invisible, also quite clear from the name: once we reach the base, the bricks will disappear from our sight and we will only be able to resort to memory to position the next ones properly. Escalation is a Marathon which, however, involves the elimination of an increasing number of lines to complete each successive level, and finally Maestro, which is simply Sprint at the highest possible difficulty, in which the falling speed of the pieces is practically instantaneous. these brief descriptions that, rather than fantasy, in Ubisoft Montreal have decided to take the brakes off sadism, simply imagining ways to make the Tetris-experience as difficult as possible. Sometimes going beyond the limits of surreptitious: Invisible, for example, is simply ~too much~, requires a herculean effort of memory and we really can imagine few players who will complete it successfully. All this penalizes, on a purely playful level, Tetris Ultimate compared to the other versions available on Nintendo 3DS, the already mentioned, imaginative Hudson edition or the spectacular version on Nintendo DS, but it makes clear the road that the team wanted to take in the direction of a Tetris hardcore, for true lovers of the discipline, almost at the limit of e-sports. . And all this reveals its benefits in the online multiplayer (there is also the offline one among other things with the possibility of Download Play even with the presence of a single card), which is based on a whole series of worldwide rankings and on a system of belts borrowed from martial arts which identifies the skill of a given player. It must be said that at the moment the servers are not very populated and it takes a while before starting with a challenge, especially if you do not choose to do a Battle, but when you manage to catch a challenger, a real massacre starts; we cannot say if the feeling of impotence experienced numerous times is simply due to the incapacity of the writer, who has always considered himself a decent Tetris player since the days of the Game Boy, or rather to the high competitiveness of those in the world has purchased Tetris Ultimate, the fact is that it is possible to witness truly spectacular plays also as regards the mastery of the semi-novelty represented by the T-Spin, which at the moment seems to distinguish amateurs from true professionals thanks to the many points it offers. In short, if you have always wanted to show the world what you are capable of with tetrominoes, Tetris Ultimate is the one for you; we also hope that Ubi provides the possibility of cross-play with users of the PlayStation Vita versions, due out next month, and PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, announced but still without a precise date. Finally, the ~e-sports~ atmosphere of the latest iteration of Tetris is also reflected in the presentation. Graphically, the game is clean and little else, almost ~professional~, with only the Miis occasionally giving a breath of joy; the backgrounds are so sober that the 3D effect, although present, is practically not noticed. However, if this is ultimately good for the eyes, which are thus concentrated only on the game action, the ears will suffer. The music is very discreet, techno but far from explosive, very soft, and does not put pressure on the player as in the historical editions: the ambient version of the historical Korobeiniki makes the heart cry of those who have thrown hours and hours of their life on that small cartridge that was included in the Game Boy box.", "date": "2014-11-27", "grade": "S.V."}
