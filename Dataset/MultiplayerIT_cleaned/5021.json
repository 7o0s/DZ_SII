In this article we will not talk so much about the work itself, but about the differences between the edition for Switch and that for Wii U. The project, as many of you know, started on this last console, now five years ago. However, there is nothing left that benefits this version in terms of exclusivity: the dual screen is not exploited at all, apart from the fact that it can be used to play the adventure instead of the television. The map on the Gamepad, the one we saw in the video shown at the end of 2014, has disappeared completely: even on Wii U to check your position you have to press the ~-~ button, thus interrupting the action. According to Aonuma it was a choice of pure game design, because they would have realized, developing it on Switch, that it was much more comfortable not having to look from one screen to another - we have our doubts that this is the case. The most important thing, however, is that the title has actually also been released on Wii U, despite the ominous predictions of many: not only was it released, but also on the same day as the Nintendo Switch version (which did not happen, for example, in similar case of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess). Although no official numbers have been provided, it is evident that few copies of the Wii U edition have been printed, and we doubt they will increase in the future: for those who have not pre-ordered it, finding it will not be easy, and therefore it is highly probable that, among some years, a beautiful immaculate case of the title can be worth several rupees. Euros, that is. Breath of the Wild on Nintendo Switch is extraordinary, but let's see together how it fares on Wii U Graphic differences Many people feared that, for obvious commercial reasons, the Aonuma team would give absolute priority to optimizing the game on Nintendo Switch, thus leaving out the one for Wii U. This was not the case, and it was a compromise that allowed both to be satisfied: that it was a correct choice with respect to one's own is undeniable, that it was a one hundred percent right choice instead is not obvious. In comparing the two editions we have come to a certainty: the only way to deal with Breath of the Wild without slowdowns is to play it on Nintendo Switch at 720p, therefore in portable mode. Indeed, on Wii U the game - and how could it be otherwise? - highlights the same minimal but fairly frequent stuttering we experienced in Switch's Dock mode. With the clear difference that, it should be clarified for the uninitiated, on the hybrid console Hyrule is visible at 900p (we repeat: when it is in the Dock), while on Wii U it is revealed at 720p. The difference exists, but it doesn't alter the general glance too much. Other improvements have been included on Switch that are denoted in the details, especially in the quality of certain textures of the setting: those of the trunks, rocks, trees and so on. There's also more aliasing on Wii U, particularly on the parts of the world furthest from Link - those in the background. Even at this juncture there is nothing dramatic or annoying, but since the differences between the two Breath of the Wild are minimal, we can only point them out to you. In line with what has been said, the lighting management is also included, the same in the general setting but slightly brighter and more convincing on Switch. Uploads and checks Unlike the concern with which we began the previous paragraph, inherent more to the sphere of suspicions than to that of deductions, the fear that on WiiU it could double the duration of uploads was more than legitimate: after all, even ignoring the power differences between the two platforms, it is undeniable that Game Cards are superior to discs in this field. Before continuing the discussion, however, we must specify an obvious detail, namely that in this field - predictably and understandably - there is a fair difference by playing Breath of the Wild on disc or by downloading it (by the way, it weighs 11 GB). In the first case, the loading times are almost double compared to Nintendo Switch: don't be impressed by the word, they are however short-lived compared to those of most open worlds, as well as less frequent (the game loads only near the Shrines or after a teleporter, a small technical miracle that we expected and that Nintendo gave us as a gift). By installing Breath of the Wild instead thethings change, and surprisingly in doing so the Wii U edition rivals the Switch one: if it suffers in terms of loading at the beginning of the game, it proves to be faster after (for example) a Shrine in the middle of the lands of Hyrule. In summary: it is slower in short loads, faster in long ones. The last sector that separates the two editions is the control system, but even in this case we must reiterate a point already expressed at the beginning of the piece: Nintendo did not want to exploit the exclusive capabilities of the two consoles (Switch portability excluded, obviously ), so even the vibration is essentially identical, and that of the Wii U GamePad feels more raw not because of the software, but because of the hardware itself. In any case, no HD Rumble support, and substantially identical sensations. Aiming with the gyroscope works very well, so we advise you not to experience Link's adventure through the Wii U Pro Controller. For the same reason, the best control system, at least in terms of efficiency and functionality, turned out to be the one at Separate Joy-Con so you can aim with a free hand, which is not possible on Wii U. Nothing dramatic, however: the GamePad has also proved to be a faithful ally for this last experience, provided that you have large enough hands to effortlessly switch from L to ZL (front and rear dorsal, in summary).", "date": "2017-03-06", "grade": "9.7"}
