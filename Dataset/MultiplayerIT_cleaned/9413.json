{"name": "Diventiamo tutti attori!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/86324-yoostar-2-diventiamo-tutti-attori.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3 The game requires PlayStation Eye for PlayStation 3 and Kinect for Xbox 360 Cinema has always been a great source of desire for young and old. Anyone who at least once has dreamed of being able to act alongside his favorite actor or even to replace him. Thanks to Yoostar 2 Ubisoft finally offers us the possibility to become actors for a day. The idea is as simple as it is brilliant: take some of the scenes that have made the history of cinema and replace the actors with yourself. Everyone on set! Once we've started the game and chosen the main mode, the first thing we'll have to do is decide which movie we want to play in. The title offers a large selection of films, trying to satisfy the tastes of all people: action, drama, comedy, sentimental films and obviously the great classics could not be missing. Once the feature film has been selected, a second screen will open where we will be asked who we want to play. In almost all the scenes we will be able to choose not only the main actor but also the actors who interact with him, thus giving a different perspective to the scene itself (in 300 for example we will be able to choose whether to play Leonidas rather than the Persian emissary!). As if that weren't enough, in many scenes it will be possible to act alongside a friend of ours, thus creating historic couples of the big screen such as the Blues Brothers. Once the scene has been selected, before acting, we will be shown the original clip so as to be able to memorize both the times and the posture of the actor we will have to play, after which the PlayStation 3 camera, indispensable for playing, will cut out our image (of the guidelines they will also tell us the exact position to have the same shot that the original actor had in front of the camera) and will transport us inside the set. To make the recitation easier for everyone, we won't have to learn anything by heart, but follow the lines to be recited as in a karaoke that will follow one another in the upper part of the joke. At the end of our test we will be evaluated on the basis of various parameters such as intonation, tempo, facial expressions. In addition to a numerical score we will also be assigned a star rating from a minimum of one to a maximum of five. Although it is a title that rightfully falls into the party game category, the developers have not neglected those who love to play solitaire. In challenge mode we will have the opportunity to act following different directives that will be given to us scene by scene, constantly increasing the difficulty as we go forward. In the forest of TV rights Developing a game is never easy, if you add to this difficulty the additional one of having to work with movie scenes covered in their entirety by copyright, the task becomes really difficult. The guys at Blitz Game have been commendable in this, managing to grab the rights of almost all the American film majors, thus offering us an absolutely enviable portfolio of titles. We will have the opportunity to relive scenes from: The Terminator, The Wizard of Oz, 300, The Blues Brothers, Forrest Gump, American Pie, Angels & Demons, Casablanca, Karate Kid, Rocky and Men in Black. In addition to all this, given the enormous popularity it has at the public level, the developers have also bought the rights to some television series such as CSI Miami and Star Trek. Truly an excellent job, knowing above all the reticence with which the majors leave their rights to third parties. Room for improvisation In addition to the dubbing of the original scenes, Yoostar 2 also gives the right space to our imagination. In the improvisation mode, several film sets will be available to us for months, also borrowed from famous films, where we will be able to improvise without having to follow any script. Among the many, we can for example reinvent the Gladiator's speech inside the arena, rather than reconstructing various scenes present in King Kong to our liking. In this mode, it's a lot of fun, the only limit is really our imagination. Given the enormous importance it now holds within games, even the purely social part is well developed. For any game mode it is possible to put our performances online, on some of the most important social networks (Facebook and Twitter) or on the game website, so that all our friends can see our qualities as an actor, and maybe, answer our remake with one of their own. Yoostar 2 is based on a concept, as mentioned, very simple but at the same time fascinating and usable for all age groups, despite the lack of filmthe Italian and children's films, the developers have ensured that downloadable content will be released periodically that will enrich the filmography of the game, thus giving breadth and duration to the project. However, it is necessary to point out that Yoostar 2, despite being completely localized in the texts, has several cinematic sequences in the original language and this could make synchronization with the original piece difficult during acting.", "date": "2011-03-16", "grade": null}
