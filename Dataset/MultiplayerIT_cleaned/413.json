{"name": "Command & Conquer: The First Decade - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/command-conquer-the-first-decade-recensione.html", "text": "The full-bodied package The future... The news, announced shortly before E3, aroused strong emotion in all fans: EA is working on Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, a title that promises the return of all the peculiar features of the series, from the column interface, to movies with the actors. The ~tips~ games from EA talk about the collaboration of some old characters and an incredible sci-fi storyline. It didn't take much to unleash the community, which expects a lot from this new chapter! Meanwhile, longtime fans are clamoring for the return of Joseph D. Kucan, (the actor who played the mad Kane), for many a true idol and that it would be sacrilegious to replace. Comment Command & Conquer: The First Decade is a collection that all fans of the series and lovers of strategic games absolutely cannot give up. For the modest sum of 30 euros (!!!) you take home a piece of gaming history that includes six games in the series plus six other expansions for hundreds of hours of gameplay! The package also includes Generals plus additional missions, still best-selling and graphically current. It should be noted that the titles are all in English, including the last two which had also been dubbed into Italian (demerit note in this case to EA Italia), so non-English speakers may have some difficulty understanding the story and the missions. There were also several bugs, due to the age of some games (the first ran under DOS), only partially resolved by patch 1.2 which is currently the only one available. New generation players will surely turn up their noses at the graphics of the first titles, but on the other hand they will discover a gameplay that has never been equaled! Those who live on bump mapping and pixel shaders stay away... Pros The entire Command saga on a single DVD at a bargain price Hundreds of hours of single and multiplayer gameplay Playability at the highest levels Cons Absent Italian dubbing Outdated graphics (excluding Generals) Several bugs (which however do not affect playability) Frank Klepacki, who is this? Surely fans of the saga will know the answer, since it is the musician who has dealt with the soundtracks of all the ~Commandconquerian~ titles except Generals and its expansion. Composer from a very young age, Frank has won several awards for the soundtracks of the series, thanks to his multifaceted talent that allows him to pass through the most disparate musical genres (from commercial to Hip-Hop, passing through electronic and symphonic) with total ease . His absence from the Generals saga is due to the fact that upon the breakup of Westwood, he too moved to Petroglyph, where he is now the head of the audio section. His latest job was supervising the musical side on Star Wars: Empire at War. It is worth taking a look at his website, where in addition to his story you can listen to practically every work of his in streaming! P.S.: good news for those who wanted the collection of all the soundtracks of the series; EA is about to launch an online music sales service (but it doesn't mean that it won't arrive in stores too) in which all the audio material of its games will be published (and knowing the EATrax system present in all the titles, one can expect a encyclopedic collection!). The Tiberium saga We are in the future. Life on Earth is threatened by Tiberium, a mysterious alien mineral that has come to earth. While the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) tries to stop its expansion, the terrorist brotherhood Nod, led by the insane and charismatic Kane, wages a war for world domination. The best setting of the series, a concentration of science fiction, politics, terrorism and even cinema, with the story narrated by real actors and scenes in Computer Graphics. The games released with this background scenario see the first Command & Conquer, C&C: Tiberian Sun, C&C: Renegade (which however is a shooter) and the future Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars. Command &amp; conquer Tiberian Sun Renegade The first legendary Command & Conquer is presented here in the Gold version, released sometime after the first edition. As a change we find the graphics brought to 640x480 and the icons of the units totally redone. Furthermore, all the patches released at the time are included and in Windows XP there are no problems of any kind. From the start menu, you can also immediately choose the missions of the ~Covert Operations~ expansion. A complete masterpiece, the very first RTS! It's a real pleasure to replay everything, even if you notice a certain cumbersomeness in some game mechanics (the creation of single units, or the filling of vehicles with one man at a time). However, it remains a great title, to be finished with both land factions to get to know every aspect of the plot well. Despite the futuristic setting, the title is a precursor of modern history, which sees a very similar scenario to the current one: United Nations against terrorists from all over the world.Pro It is the first real RTS The female voice of the EVA (the talking computer) remains unmatched Cons A bit dated game system Uninteresting additional missions Worth mentioning: the introduction of the manual is absolutely worth reading, which offers some backstory to the story and certain pearls such as Kane's politics and the description of the factions (the Nod are aimed at uniting third world nations with a Neo-fascist ideology. They are affiliated with the IRA and Islamic Jihad). Furthermore, the final gem is given by the secret missions with the dinosaurs! By creating a link to the executable ~C&C95.exe~ just put as path: ~D: (the drive letter where it is installed)EA (or the folder where it is located)Command & Conquer The First Decade Command & Conquer(tm)C&C95.EXE~ funpark -cd. EXACTLY as it appears, including the quotes and period after ~cd.~ A myth! The Hand of Nods The Tiberium saga Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun is the sequel-evolution of the first: it perfects the concepts and enriches the story. The plot is told to us with actors of a certain level (including the legendary Michael Bienh, the protagonist of Terminator) going further in time. The mutants (people who have been infected by Tiberium) and a much more futuristic look than the original are introduced, in a post-atomic graphic framework; this time we can say that the game mechanic is perfect, and introduces for the first time secondary objectives at the user's discretion. The idea of external influences on the field is also nice, from dangerous ion storms to mutant animals, passing through the cursed roots of Tiderium (in practice in some levels there is a sort of pulsating plant that spreads roots around the screen, damaging vehicles and bases, and producing toxic gases when struck with weapons). The expansion turns out to be done with dignity, with an expansion of the story, movies made ad hoc and new units. Definitely the best immersion in this universe, thanks to the most advanced graphics and a strong attention to detail. Pros The ~Tiberian~ setting taken to the highest levels Perfect game structure Cons Some graphic smudges It cost nothing to animate the water... Worth mentioning: the atmosphere is rather gloomy, and the immersion very high, thanks also to the good actors, among which we mention James Earl Jones, or rather the ~voice~ of Darth Vader! Even the soundtrack turns out to be more ~mature~ than the previous ones, with very dramatic musical pieces. Trick: by editing the ~sun.ini~ file with notepad it will be possible to increase the resolution of the game beyond 800x600! The advice is to play in 1024x768, in order not to have too small writings (however graphically we are at a good level). in 1024 he makes his figure the menu; business suit Beginning of Nods The Tiberium saga Command & Conquer Renegade: this title deserves a separate discussion, the only non-strategic of the series, as it is a shooter brought into the Tiberium universe. Unfortunately, this experiment was only half successful and was unfortunately the last game released before the dissolution of Westwood. The basic idea was certainly good, to put the players in the role of a ~smash it~ GDI Commando and put him to kill armies of Nod but, thanks to the embarrassing graphics engine and the inexperience of the programmers in the field, the result was a mediocre title. Despite a certain amount of fun offered, the scary angular aspect of the characters and environments penalizes everything, especially by virtue of the fact that the game is from 2002, and at the time there were already visually superior engines around. The scenes that tell the story are made with the same in-game graphics, which makes them even surreal in their paucity. Different speech for the multiplayer, which makes the team game very collaborative, and compensates for the poverty of the single player. Pros All in all, fun You are in the role of the legendary ~Commando~ to get behind the wheel of some typical Command vehicles, offering moments of pure action and destruction! The atmosphere is quite immersive, but always penalized by the graphic aspect. It begins The menus they are the best thing A little bit edgy... The saga of Generals (to say saga is an exaggeration...) And here it is, the latest series of products released after the closure of Westwood studios: Generals. This novelty has given a twist to the saga, both positive and negative, inhow much it modernized the concept of RTS, but also made some radical changes that the fans didn't like. This time the story is set more or less in the present day (despite some sci-fi technologies) and sees a rather realistic and disturbing scenario; three warring factions: Allies, China and terrorists. Released about two and a half years ago, Generals and its substantial expansion still enjoy current graphics, given that the powerful game engine is still used in the latest RTS releases (The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth for example ). What the fans of the saga did not approve of was the disappearance of the legendary double column interface-symbol and, far more serious, the elimination of any interlude scene made with actors. All the facts are narrated with real-time scenes of the game, which despite enjoying the excellent graphics, do not render as the ~acted~ movies. Generals has also broken with the classic barrier of the 1vs1 clash at the faction level, offering us three armies each with its own peculiar characteristics.Pros Finally a sequel in 3D polygonal Graphics still very current Cons Cut-scenes with the actors gone The original interface has been changed Worth mentioning: there is a good calibration of all three sides, which can enjoy special bonuses that can be activated with the ~command points~ earned by carrying out the missions. Sorry to say but the soundtrack of the game does not enjoy the experience of Frank Klepacki. Generals the graphics hold up well The commemorative DVD As already mentioned, the package contains an unmissable bonus DVD for fans. Analyzing it specifically we find a substantial interview with Louis Castle, creator of the saga, who tells us a little about the background, a special on all the titles, the creation of Command, a couple of sections dedicated to fans with some videos made by them in amateur way (and well done too!). Among the bonuses some artworks, the trailer and a short video that talks about the future (and hints at Command & Conquer 3). All in all an enjoyable product, from which perhaps a little more was expected (an interview with Kane would have been nice!) but which lets itself be looked at. The Red Alert saga Surely the most controversial setting of all: the Red Alert series is either love it or hate it! Nothing to do with Tiberium, since we are in an alternate universe where the communists won the Second World War. All this because Einstein (!!!) was able to create a time machine with which he went back to kill Hitler before the Third Reich! Definitely an original story, which, however, without too many explanations, shows us historical characters totally out of their era, in a mixture of science fiction, anachronisms and slightly exaggerated technologies. There are two main titles, Red Alert 1 and 2, which can count on three expansions in total. Red Alerts Red alert 2 The Red Alert saga The first was released a few months after Command & Conquer, and left everyone a bit perplexed, as the continuation of Tiberium was lost (a bit like what happened with Metal Gear 2 and 3) in favor of this historical hodgepodge. Fortunately, the game offered several interesting units, including naval ones (which allowed you to manage battles at sea and offer valid support) and other more strategic ones such as the Chronosphere (which could transport some units around the map). The success was striking, so much so that it generated two expansions: Aftermath and Counterstrike. Graphically there was a slight improvement, missions were introduced inside the buildings and the accumulation of resources was no longer based on the alien substance but on an unspecified ~mineral~. Otherwise the mechanics remained the same, only the context and unit types changed. The expansions don't offer much more than the original, just the new missions and some new elements studied ad hoc.Pros New environments and units, some strategically interesting Cons The setting may not appeal to everyone The story is bizarre and confusing. Worth mentioning: in favor of this breath of ~novelty~ Westwood changed the voice of the EVA interface with a more subdued robotic; the ~break-all~ commando was replaced by Tanya, a rather ridiculous clone of Lara Croft. Unforgettable the initial theme by the usual Klepacki: the Hell March! The Reds Inside buildings The Red Alert saga Red Alert 2: the latest strategy released by Westwood (not counting the expansion) evolves even more the non-historical background of the first, dragging us into an absolutely absurd world! Mental powers, exceptional technologies, crazy units are the framework of RA2, which offers colorful graphics, both in game and in movies", "date": "2006-07-12", "grade": null}
