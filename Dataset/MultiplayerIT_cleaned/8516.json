In one word, caciarone. All those who were scandalized by the betrayal of simulative origins are warned. In Showdown the doors and bumps are more important and decisive than the actual driving, which almost takes a back seat both in normal races and in timed or elimination ones. The desire to put the player at the center of a bumper car is evident not only in the different types of Destruction Derby present, but also (and above all) in the competitions called 8 Ball, where the narrow paths intersect in open crossroads in which, given the lack of traffic lights, he presses to the floor and closes his eyes hoping not to be hit by the other cars. Luck therefore can play an important role in certain events. Paradoxically, the most guided parts are the so-called gymkhanas, the competitions in arenas where we are asked to accumulate points by performing freely or following a particular track all the ~stunts~ seen in the previous game, but even here, in deference to the immediacy, the model driving has been made more accessible. Traffic on the runway All this does not mean that DiRT Showdown is an easy and uninspiring title, far from it, but that it is not very demanding from the point of view of pure driving. This choice rewards Codemasters' effort because in the end Showdown is an absolutely fun and carefree title, which gives its best when played against human opponents. How did we get to this turning point? The cars practically drive themselves. The brake is practically banned, the handbrake immediately, with virtually no learning curve, allows us to brush without problems the sharp bends and the wider ones, taking advantage of an opponent artificial intelligence that is so aggressive and deliberately incorrect in phase attack as docile in defense. The cars are very light, but not such as to be defined as ~slippery soaps~. Unfortunately their lightness becomes a double-edged sword in tussles where you are hooked, slammed against the walls and practically always rear-ended. For most of the career, especially if played at an intermediate level, all this is not a serious problem, but by climbing the competitions and raising the level of difficulty, the risk of restarting a race several times is present (not to mention the frail health of the car) above all because, as written at the beginning, luck is in some ways a decisive component of the gameplay. To overcome this criticality, Codemasters has included two very important features. The nitro, which recharges automatically or after spectacular crashes, and the possibility of customizing the cars. The temporary speed boost is obviously essential to gain a few more seconds, but also above all to get out of the way of the most congested situations. Its wise use is therefore highly recommended. Customization (for a fee, of course) is very minimal, the values at stake are power, strength and handling, but by choosing the right car and boosting it properly, it is possible to limit the unpredictability of collisions. In bumper cars, is it better to drive a faster, lighter and more driveable car or a slower van, less slippery when cornering but better able to absorb shocks? The choice is simply this, but it can make all the difference in tight city tracks, not to mention clash races. DiRT on Xbox 360 To the delight of young and old, we also had the opportunity to try the Xbox 360 version, actually finding some differences compared to the Sony counterpart. The Ego engine has always shown a slight advantage over the Microsoft platform, a tradition that has also been renewed for DiRT Showdown. The framerate proved to be devoid of those slight uncertainties that plague the Playstation 3 version, resulting in a substantially smoother driving experience. Nothing that could affect the usability of the Codemasters product, mind you, but performance purists and multiplatform owners should probably turn to this version. Easy target The vast, but in the long run repetitive, single player game offer is therefore tailor-made for this type of gameplay. The types of competitions are really many. The career is based on four seasons, from the easiest Pro to the most difficult Champion, for a total of about fifty events. Progressive unlocking is obtained initially by completing the races, while the climb towards the final event of each single championship passes through a certain number of first places, inway to complicate things. Each victory then unlocks new cars, which must be bought with the money earned on the track. Ideally dividing the events into macro blocks we can talk about ~classic~ competitions, ~destructive~ ones and ~gymkhanas~. It goes without saying that each offers different variations on the theme. We wrote about the 8 Ball, to which we add the Race Off on the classic side, with tracks full of obstacles and ramps, where you have to be very careful therefore with energy and the health of the machine. Then there is Domination, perhaps the one in which driving is most put to the test since we have to try to get the best time in the various sectors of the track, while Eliminator sees the last in the standings being progressively eliminated until the most classic of the only ones left one. However, the elimination is only virtual given that the car canceled from the race will remain on the track as an obstacle, adding a pinch more difficulty. These races work without a doubt, the mix of bumps, right choice of car and careful use of the turbo, all while keeping an eye on the health of the car, is undoubtedly fun and exciting, but where the caciarone spirit of DiRT Showdown is enhanced it's in the Destruction Derby. Here too we are faced with different types. Rampage is the most normal of the lot, a simple arena and many cars delicately exchanging paint, while Knockout places a sort of huge raised ring in the center of the arena. The goal now is not only to rack up points by devastating your opponents, but also to knock them out for extra points. The maximum pleasure is then in the last thirty seconds when the score is doubled. It goes without saying that being kicked out means losing precious time and, if we lack a first position to unlock the next race, this means repeating the event again. The highest point of the developers' wickedness can be found in Hard Target. We are alone against several waves of killing machines that gradually fill the arena. The longer you stay alive, the more you climb the leaderboard. Really difficult and challenging. However, some small criticisms emerge. The detection of the score according to the point of impact does not always seem to be accurate, while if you are not very fast with the right stick to look left and right (this maneuver is very cumbersome anyway) you are easy prey for your opponents. This is essential in Hard Targets. Party online Among the various gymkhana events, the most interesting and most successful is Head to Head, as it mixes acrobatics and running. The challenge is all about beating an opponent by being first to the finish line in a double equal track. In between drifting, donuts around poles, smashing objects and jumping. Thumbs down instead for Smash Hunter where, in very large arenas, we are asked to destroy panels of various colors in order, wandering around the huge open space. Still remaining in the acrobatic field, the mode external to the Joyride campaign is apt. There are two areas to explore freely, Yokohama and Battersea. There are dozens of objectives to accomplish, the usual drifts, donut jumps and so on, plus dozens more hidden objects to find. Very cleverly, the developers have inserted a menu thanks to which you can choose which goal to look for, a sort of direction indicator that shows us the area where to concentrate our efforts. As for the online mode, predictably, DiRT Showdown (subject to use of the VIP Pass) manages to give its best thanks to the great wealth of modes, capable of bringing the frenzy of the races into matches with players from all over the world. The support stops at a maximum of eight users, but this limitation, if we want to call it that, allows you to face a large part of the competitions faced in the single player mode. Excluding those that are not convertible in a competitive context, we also find specific modes such as the team mode with a ~capture the flag~ structure, just in the style of the first person shooter, where we have to decide whether to bring the precious trophy into your home or protect it from opposing cars . Another interesting mode is the one where checkpoints are placed randomly, leading to real fast-paced races where the fun literally skyrockets. Of note is the support for local split-screen for up to two players. To better blend the experience, Codemasters has integrated everything with its own network called RaceNet, an ID system that allows players to communicate with each other, launch challenges and share material such as videos, while the latter can even be uploaded to Youtube .A lot of completeness therefore, for long-term enjoyment. Playstation 3 trophies DiRT Showdown rewards the player with fifty trophies. The bronze ones are obtained with relative ease, almost all of which are tied to the progression of the game, while the silver ones, not to mention the gold ones, lock down to particular conditions, such as obtaining a sort of five-fight kill streak in Rampage , but also completing the Joyride events one hundred percent. An overflowing ego On a technical level, DiRT Showdown is, as usual, a real splendour. The Ego engine stages, with the usual soft and warm palette, richly built tracks and cars and even better covered by hyper-detailed textures. With the plus of particle effects galore, excellent refraction effects and the meticulous destruction of the cars, which lose pieces and deform with the same ease with which they brush the most ~difficult~ hairpin bends. However, all of this has a price to pay in terms of fluidity. Often and willingly in the most agitated phases the canonical thirty frames per second give way to moments in which the fluidity falters. Nothing exceptional or particularly penalizing, but still perceptible. A round of applause goes to the Italian dubbing of the race announcer. A real histrion given the caciarona nature of the game. At certain moments it really seems to listen to the ~vocalist~ of the bumper car who makes fun of us in front of unwatchable performances.", "date": "2012-05-25", "grade": "8.0"}
