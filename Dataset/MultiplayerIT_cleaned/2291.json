{"name": "Top Gun Combat Zones", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/top-gun-combat-zones_a.html", "text": "An ambiguous game ~Top Gun combat zones~ looks like a common shooter with some simulative element of the contour. In fact we are not dealing with an excellent product, as the feeling of already seen is always present in the different game sessions. The only purpose is to complete the objective that the mission requires, and then proceed to the next one. The texture of the product is as non-existent as its presentation. As soon as you turn on the console, in fact, the first screen that appears is that of the mode selection. In terms of structure, the Titus product is a bit ambiguous. That is, if on the one hand we find a rather bland structural realization, on the other we notice some details that emphasize the simulation aspect of the game. For example, if you touch an element of the environment, your plane will explode in no time. But the most annoying thing is the difficulty with which goals are achieved. This is largely due to the slightly ~cumbersome~ playability that affects the movements and evolutions of your controlled vehicle. Around the world or almost Before starting the real military missions, in TGCZ you will have to face a series of tests (or exams) at the virtual aeronautical school. These consist of different types of actions such as hitting a series of target balloons or bombing the airplanes guided by the instructors (interesting). After the five pre-missions, the serious part of the game begins and takes place in three different areas of the globe, namely South-East Asia, the Persian Gulf and Siberia. Each completed campaign is worth a brand new aircraft like an F/A-18E Super Hornet, an F-22 Raptor etc. The missions have various objectives including bombing of some locations, destruction of ~flying~ enemies, defense of some means and so on. The available arsenal is always predetermined by the CPU depending on the military action. However, the weapons consist of homing and pointing missiles, bombs and the ever-present machine gun with unlimited ammunition (Vulcan, for friends). The overall difficulty of the game is not very high, especially that of the enemy fighters, so in not too long you can very well complete all three campaigns. Another mode allows you to configure various game parameters such as mission difficulty, enemy AI and similar stuff, adding a touch of extra depth to the entire game product. By completing the latter several times it is possible to acquire the secret fighters which are: the X-32B JSF, the YF-23, the AV-8B Harrier II, the V-22 Ospery, and the F-4E Phantom. The landscape from above The cosmetic aspect of the title in question stands at almost discrete levels. Although the fluidity of the polygonal engine is quite high, the surrounding environment is rather poor and sparse. Another negative note (however found in all productions of the genre) is the low speed of the controlled vehicle. I think that at 2000 Kmh the cheekbones should move at least a little The structures that one encounters often appear angular and approximate, even if they are not ugly. There are two views available, the first (subjective) unfortunately does not allow us to identify who we are chasing, while the second (outside the vehicle) seems the most enjoyable as all the evolutions of the plane are displayed. The controlled fighters are well made and characterized by a good number of details. The same goes for the textures that cover them too. The environments surrounding the action are not interactive, except for a few targets which explode if we drop some innocent bomb on them... but it's Christmas! Unfortunately the explosions have not received a particular care in their realization, for this they resemble those seen in past, very past games. The nice replay that accompanies the mission just completed with a cinematic eye deserves a positive mention, where you can even see the pilot's face! In general, the technical aspect of the title is not exactly negative, but much more is expected from a PS2. As always A few lines are dedicated to the audio sector of the game, which is really poor in effects. The music during the missions, although present, seems to dissolve in the air, while the effects of explosions, shots fired and the wind are nice but nothing more. Many will ask themselves: ~do you listen to music on an F-14?~ True, it would actually be absurd, but what are video games for? This is why we would have liked much tougher and adrenaline-pumping songs that were certainly more suitable for products of this type.Globally speaking This Top Gun combat zones is not a bad title. It has its flaws as well as its strengths. Fans of the genre, who manage to overlook some structural problems, will surely find bread for their teeth. While those who prefer something else and demand the most from their black console would do better to evaluate the purchase of this product very carefully. As they say take it with a grain of salt and due caution. And if you have time and patience, I would advise you to wait for a certain Ace Combat 4 from Namco. Am I asking too much? Pros: Fun if you are a fan of the genre. Nice replays. Cons: Sa already seen. Not very innovative. Boring in the long run. Like Tom Cruise in the movie The name ~Top Gun~ has been exploited to the maximum in every field of commerce, this latest episode is the confirmation. For years now, on various platforms, we have been offered the opportunity to relive the same emotions felt by the famous protagonist of the film of the same name. Instead, strangely, in this TGCZ there is neither a precise plot nor any reference to the film version. All you have to do is complete the 36 missions that the game makes available, preceded by a very short briefing.", "date": "2002-01-03", "grade": null}
