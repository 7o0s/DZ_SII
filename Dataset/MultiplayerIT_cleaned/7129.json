Showing off an Olympic calm, the Czech team took it very easy to release this iPad conversion of its latest effort on the App Store, but we can certainly say that it was worth it... What a struggle botany The delightful universe of Botanicula is introduced to the player through a sequence which, even without using even a single line of text, makes it perfectly clear the simple plot that forms the background to the game. The protagonists are five little creatures who find themselves in spite of themselves in charge of an important mission: to save the last seed of the tree they live on from the clutches of dark spider-like creatures who want to feed on it. The unusual group will therefore have to start from the branches of their ~home~ and overcome a whole series of pitfalls and puzzles to reach the ground where to plant the precious seed, in the context of a very simple graphic adventure in terms of mechanics but which does not skimp on solutions originals. There are no indicators whatsoever on the screen, and the user is left free to discover which elements on the display react to his touch. The nice thing about Botanicula is that not everything that is interactive is necessarily linked to the progression in the game: it often happens that you tap objects or creatures with your finger whose reaction has a pure entertainment purpose, moreover guaranteed by the adorable audiovisual sector of the product. However, all without taking away space from a gameplay that proves to be competent in dealing with the genre to which it belongs, albeit with its very precise rules: it is difficult to be able to apply here the same mental schemes that are used for more classic graphic adventures, since there is almost never a clear cause and effect relationship with the interactive elements that you meet on your path. A minimum of initial effort is therefore required to enter the particular logic that regulates the bizarre puzzles of Botanicula, but once this is done, the enjoyment of the playful experience is guaranteed until the end of the game, with the credits arriving after about five very pleasant hours. Botanicula brings to iOS all the advantages it showed in its PC debut The developers of Amanita Design have been very good at infusing massive doses of creativity into their product, with new and fun solutions that follow each other in each box, except for a slight decline in the final stages of the game. The user will therefore find himself committed to guiding the five protagonists in the most disparate situations, even if all characterized by the same subtext, given that the main objective of each chapter will be to collect a certain number of objects that allow in one way or in the other to continue towards the final goal. From time to time, it will also be necessary to choose which member of the group to perform a particular action, and also in this case the touch of Amanita Design is decidedly personal: in case the wrong choice is made, there will therefore not be a sad game screen over, but rather a funny skit that will illustrate the clumsy failure of the character to complete the assigned task. As it is easy to understand from what has been written so far, a good part of the charm of Botanicula derives from the excellence of its artistic sector, which emerges irrepressibly on the iPad. The display of the Apple device highlights the variety of colors used by Czech graphic designers, and allows you to better appreciate the care that has been lavished down to the smallest detail. Using headphones then becomes almost a moral obligation to be able to perceive the myriads of sounds and voices that animate the game world, as well as the beautiful and evocative music by the DVA.", "date": "2014-05-12", "grade": "8.4"}
