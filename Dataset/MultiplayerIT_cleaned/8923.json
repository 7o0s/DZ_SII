The Swedish team was founded in 2003 and two years later churned out the first gem, the GTR that revolutionized the PC racer scenario with its satellite-based tracks, real telemetry software, twenty finely reproduced cars and the different adjustments capable of making the experience accessible to both the most demanding enthusiasts and novices. After the interlude represented by GT Legends, not appreciated by all however widely appreciated, the team confirmed its talent with GTR 2, judged by many as the perfect sequel, capable of enriching and optimizing the work done with the first episode. Then it was the turn of a new franchise, RACE, which in its 2007 edition generated a large number of expansions, five of which are collected in the RACE Injection package, which we have been able to try these days. The numbers of this production speak for themselves: forty-three different classes of cars for a total of over eighty models, all customizable, to be raced within over forty unique tracks, which thanks to some alternative versions lead to more than sixty events available. The contents As mentioned, there are five expansions included in the package, all recently released. The first is Formula Raceroom, released for free on 18 March this year, which includes the legendary Hockenheim track in three variants (GP, Short and National) and the RR1 Formula cars (practically the Formula 1 single-seaters), the most fast never put on the track by SimBin and consequently those that require greater attention to gas dosage and trajectories. Driving such a racing car is an experience in itself, given that it has unique values in terms of braking distance, acceleration and handling. The sensation of speed returned by these models is amazing and at first it can catch you unprepared, so it is more necessary than ever to practice to be able to exploit their power in the best way, without fearing that it will backfire. The second expansion included (but it would be more appropriate to talk about a stand alone product) is STTC The Game 2, based on the 2010 edition of the Swedish Touring Car Championship and the Scandinavian Touring Car Cup. Numerous cars included, with Opel branded models , Volkswagen, Toyota, Chevrolet, Alfa Romeo, BMW, Honda, Volvo and Seat; while, as regards the tracks, we have five Swedish circuits (Falkenberg, Goteborg Eco Arena, Karlskoga, Mantorp Park and Ring Knutstorp) and one Danish (Jyllandsringen). The feeling of touring cars is well known to fans of the RACE series: these are powerful and versatile vehicles, which on the track give a realistic feeling about the shifting of the load and are very pleasant to drive. Then we have the GT Power Pack, released in April, which allows us to use the powerful BMW M3 GT2, Pagani Zonda R and Matech GT1, as well as to compete on the Chayka circuit in Ukraine and the US Mid-Ohio circuit. Certainly significant elements, but not comparable to the numbers of the fourth expansion, the WTTC 2010 Pack, which adds four cars to the base of RACE 07 (Chevrolet Cruze, Chevrolet Lacetti, Seat Leon TDI and BMW e90 320si) and eleven tracks: Marrakech, Zolder, Algarve, Oschersleben, Curitiba, Macau, Monza, Brands Hatch, Brno, Valencia and Okayama. Finally, the Retro Pack should also be added to the picture outlined above, which introduces the novelty of the Hillclimb Stage, the first SimBin track to offer the typical gradients of the Alps, the Poznan circuit and eight fascinating vintage cars, including the Volvo 1968 Amazon, the 1968 Mini Cooper S, and the '74 Chevrolet Corvette. Really a lot of irons in the fire, in short, for what looks like the final chapter of the RACE series. The online multiplayer RACE Injection gives us the possibility to host or participate in online multiplayer races for up to twenty-five players. There are no private slots, but the game can be protected with a password to allow access only to our friends. It is possible to join the matches only during free practice and then ring in a few laps to get familiar with the track and perhaps adjust the car settings accordingly, after which you move on to qualifying and the actual race. This is not a friendly approach, in the sense that in single player it is possible to skip stages if we are in a hurry, while online one is forced to grapple with every single session and therefore have the necessary time. The value of the opponents is clearly high, as the infrastructure unites players of RACE 07 and singlesthe expansions in a single, shrewd cauldron, ergo don't expect to have an easy life at the first experience. Engines on the track There is undoubtedly a lot of substance in RACE Injection, also offered at a very popular price (29.99 euros), but we must approach this collection knowing exactly what it can offer us. In recent years, especially on the console front, titles have in fact come out capable of combining a simulation experience of great depth with a progressive structure, that is, of taking the player by the hand and making him practice, starting with racing on standard cars to even get to Formula 1 single-seater, with all the intermediate stages of the case and without neglecting the technical sector in any way, indeed raising the entire racing game genre to new standards. Well, don't expect such an approach from the SimBin product. Although the offer is wide and varied, it must be enjoyed ~manually~, i.e. it is possible to try single events or entire championships within six different ~compartments~ (2010, 2007, 2006, Hillclimb, STCC '10 and Extra ), but there is no structure that unites all these appendices to shape some sort of all-encompassing Career. From the point of view of driving simulation enthusiasts, there are no problems, after all what counts are the sensations that the cars are able to give back once on the track, as well as the number of possible combinations between cars and tracks, and in these terms we are still at levels of absolute excellence in the panorama of PC racers. The problem arises precisely if RACE Injection is expected to offer something it cannot offer, even from a purely technical point of view. In fact, the graphics of the game move between ups and downs, however with too wide margins from one extreme to the other: some tracks are visually satisfying, with a large number of objects in the background, while others give the impression of being too empty and poorly detailed. A similar argument can be made for the cars, with the touring cars generally expressing the best in fidelity and attention to detail, while for example the F3000 single-seaters suffer tremendously from the lack of reflections and effects on the surfaces. Finally, the views from the cockpit are unfortunately very distant from what is offered by Forza Motorsport 4 or Gran Turismo 5, which represent points of reference in this sense. The replays are very enjoyable and the cars on the track are always quite numerous (twenty-five at most), but even during these situations the discordant note appears, like the bitmap audience spread over the grandstands, not exactly splendid to see. On the other hand, the sound effects are excellent, with very realistic rumbles, which manage to give an idea of the power of the vehicles we drive.", "date": "2011-11-21", "grade": "8.0"}
