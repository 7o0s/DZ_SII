This further reaffirms the success of Switch and the importance that third parties are giving it, especially since the Wii U version was released, almost as a sop, at the end of its life cycle. Mojang's masterpiece, which earned its creator a couple of billion dollars when he decided to sell it to Microsoft, certainly needs no introduction and, if you've never heard of it, you've probably lived through the last 8 years of your life as a hermit in a cave (but you wouldn't even be reading this piece!); just think that Minecraft has been converted for anything with a screen, generating an impressive number of games that follow its main gameplay and dynamics. Minecraft Switch Edition has therefore arrived at great speed and will certainly be able to exploit a still very limited stock of titles, furthermore this version can be placed halfway between those of Xbox One / PlayStation 4 and that of Wii U. Having said this, in the review we will try to understand what should prompt us to spend 29.99 euros for this new incarnation, either assuming that you already have it for some other device, or if you want to enter this world of infinite constructions for the first time in which the limit is only your imagination . For now, Minecraft Switch Edition is available in a digital version at the Nintendo virtual store and takes up just over half a gig of memory space but, later, it should also arrive in a physical version, presumably at the same price. Minecraft Switch Edition is certainly the best portable version available Many beautiful things my friend builder Let's get the tooth out right away: in terms of size, the Minecraft Switch Edition map doesn't reach the levels of PlayStation 4 or Xbox One but sports a respectful 3072x3072 which makes it the largest Minecraft map for a portable device, if we consider the real portable versions, namely those for Android, iOS (smartphones and tablets) and the one for PlayStation Vita. We cannot include the Wii U version in the comparison which, despite being playable on the Pad with the television off, forces you to remain within 5-6 meters of the console. Minecraft Switch Edition is precisely the natural evolution of the one for Wii U in terms of content, setting of the various menus, game controls and the skin and texture pack system (which we will tell you about shortly). Staying technical, the draw distance is 10 blocks when played in the dock while in portable mode it drops to 7 blocks but, in both situations, the frame rate remains consistently fluid at 60 frames per second at 720p. Although the resolution is the same as the version for the previous Nintendo flagship, Minecraft Switch Edition seems to be on steroids, with very short load times (we imagine even less when the cartridge version becomes available) and a faster sensation in everything from navigation in the menus to terrain generation while flying or running, and this in both the dock and portable versions. In our opinion, this is enough to make Minecraft Switch Edition the best possible version for a portable device and to illustrate the main reason for the purchase. The performances remain stable even when played in split-screen in multiple players, but be careful: having kept the control system identical to that for Wii U, in which one analog stick is used for movement and the other for the camera (more this system is similar to any other controller version), you cannot play with only one Joy-Con, therefore, you will need either another pair of Joy-Con or a Pro Controller. Super Minecraft Bros. The versions of Minecraft for consoles are all characterized by the presence of Texture packs, Skins and Mash-up packs (which contain multiple features at the same time) to customize the environment and the characters, the Switch edition is no different. Before we get into how many and which ones are available in the shop, it's worth pointing out the free inclusion of the Super Mario mash-up pack in the Switch version. It had already been given as a gift on Wii U but, considering that the price of the mash-up packages is 5.99 euros, it seems like a very welcome addition to us also because it is really wonderfully made. If we analyze it in a stark way it is a simple Minecraft re-skin but the meticulous research into detail, the reconstruction of typical Mario elements such as the gigantic perfectly functional pipes, castles and entire areas dedicated to the individual characters of theseries, make this Mash-up pack a real Super Mario theme park: attention, we are talking about the creative mode because the worlds created by the creators of the pack are only available by creating the initial map in this mode. The gem used for the creation of the Nether Realm (the world parallel to that of Minecraft which is accessed through the construction of a special portal) is truly appreciable, which is none other than Bowser's world complete with fortress and lava everywhere. In both creative and survival modes, textures and skins are replaced and enemies such as creepers, zombies and skeletons have a more ~Super Mario~ look. Even the appearance of your character can be changed and, in addition to the obvious Mario and its variants, there are also Luigi, Peach, Todd, Yoshi, Wario, Bowser, etc. for a total of 40 different aspects! The music tracks of Minecraft, in the Mario pack, are replaced by those typical of the world of the most famous plumber in the gaming world, increasing the feeling of being in a Mario game rather than in Minecraft. Not just Mario Other mash-up packages are also available, but only as a test and therefore without the possibility of saving the game, and can be unlocked by paying later: the caramel one if you have a passion for sweets, the one with Greek and Chinese Mythologies, the medieval fantasy one , that of Halloween, that of plastic textures and that of Steampunk. Some of these packs, such as the Greek and the Christmas packs, also add lots of skins for the characters or maps for the battle mode of the minigames. Let us pause for a moment precisely on the minigames because it is a content exclusively for consoles (since in the PC version there are hundreds if not thousands of mods including various unofficial minigames) also present on the Wii U version but added with a subsequent patch and the which we didn't tell you about in that review. The Minigames present in the Switch version are, for now, the Battle and the Mortal Fall. The Battle is a ~last man standing~ that mimics The Hunger Games series and in which the players, after waiting for all the participants to arrive, are transferred to a map where there are full houses of weapons; the last one alive simply wins. Mortal Fall is, on the other hand, a race in which the winner is the one who manages not to fall into the lava below the game arena and, to make your opponent make a lethal dive into the magma, you can remove the blocks below him with a shovel or you can hit him with snowballs (you choose the rules: you can use only the shovel, only the snowballs or both). Also featured in the Wii U version is the Glide mini-game where your character flies off in a mad race against the clock or against an opponent, wearing wings that make gliding easier - we expect this to be added in a later patch also in Minecraft Switch Edition, given that in the presentation video of the Switch version, two players are clearly seen competing in this fun mini-game. The ultimate portable Minecraft This is the part of our review that expands the answer to the question we asked ourselves at the beginning and to which we had already partially answered. Minecraft Switch Edition is truly THE Minecraft for consoles (and it must be specified, because Minecraft PC with the keyboard-mouse combination is something else) with the splendid addition of portability; it is not a version in which you fight with touch screen commands (smartphones and tablets) or with technical limitations (PlayStation Vita). True, the limitations are there, we've seen them, we would have liked 1080p resolution and the huge maps of the PlayStation 4, PC and Xbox One versions, but the Minecraft feel is intact. Another positive aspect is the possibility of playing multiplayer for up to 8 players without having to be connected to the Internet, only with the home connection simply by being in the same place and using two or more Switches but, as mentioned, provided you have the right number of Joy-Con or Pro Controllers or simply by using eight Switches. So all good? Not really, there is also another problem that adds to those of a technical nature already seen, in particular, voice chat has not been implemented, a feature already present on the Wii U and removed here while waiting for the game system to take shape. communication via app on which Nintendo will sooner or later have to clarify. In our opinion, Nintendo has definitely nailed the moment of the launch of Minecraft Switch Edition and this will bring excellent sales results but, looking for the furin the egg, he could have at least worked on the resolution; it is not excluded that a subsequent patch will add this feature as we had already mentioned in a news story a few days ago, therefore, we remain hopeful.", "date": "2017-05-17", "grade": "8.5"}
