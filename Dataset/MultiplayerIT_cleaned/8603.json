In reality, however, there aren't many exponents of this videogame genre on the App Store, probably considered ~niche~ by most publishers. The release of Hunters: Episode One last year should have paved the way for the trend, and in fact the title of Rodeo Games has put on the table a series of effective and concrete ideas, demonstrating that it is not only possible to create this type of games on the iOS platform, but that it is also possible to do it very well, offering more ~hardcore~ users deep and demanding entertainment, up to their expectations. He should have led the way, we said, but unfortunately we do not think that the example has been followed and it is therefore fortunate to be able to try our hand today with Hunters 2, which renounces the ~more of the same~ approach right from the start to offer us a rather substantial number of novelties; starting with the introduction of a plot, which uses the device of the flashback to make us understand how our team of intergalactic bounty hunters got into trouble. The presence of chapters that make up the single player campaign does not mean, however, that the developers have given up on the system of self-contained missions that ~regenerate~ every twenty-four hours. Indeed, grappling with them between one level and another of the story mode proves to be essential for obtaining the level of experience and the equipment necessary for the characters to be able to survive certain clashes. Another of the novelties of Hunters 2 is in fact represented by the degree of difficulty, which seemed to us considerably higher than in the first episode and which underlines the importance of careful planning of the moves, as well as an appropriate setup before launching head down in action. Kill responsibly The fundamentals of the gameplay have remained almost unchanged: once a mission has been selected from the start screen, it is possible to place one's own units (even less than those allowed, if we want to multiply the final score) in the round scenario, then proceed to achieve the objectives that are indicated to us and which may involve eliminating all threats, collecting objects or finding and escorting VIPs. Each of the characters that make up our team has a variable amount of action points available (visually represented by ~balls~ next to the vital energy bar) which can be spent to move on a ~box~ or to attack a target on the range of equipped weapon. There are no limits in terms of equipment: hunters can equip themselves with a powerful war hammer, rifles, submachine guns, miniguns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and more by spending the points earned during missions and acquiring the necessary skills. The constraints in terms of number of units have also been eliminated, so if we have enough credits we can buy new soldiers and therefore enjoy an advantage over our opponents. As mentioned, the degree of difficulty has obviously been increased, which is evident during clashes with certain enemies, as well as by the elimination of the armor bar, replaced by a single indicator which, once empty, decrees the death of our character . The ~leveling~ brings with it substantial advantages, first of all the possibility of unlocking special powers that affect our offensive or defensive capabilities, and this will certainly push us to complete as many side missions as possible in parallel with the main campaign. Unfortunately, the interface has not been modified as regards the setup of the characters and the purchase of weapons and equipment, and therefore remains a bit obscure at first, as well as relatively inaccessible, while in terms of in-game graphics you do not notice particular additions and the view from above unfortunately does not help to do justice to the excellent contents of the Rodeo Games production.", "date": "2012-04-12", "grade": "8.4"}
