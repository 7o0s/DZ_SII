{"name": "Terminator: Resistance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/terminator-resistance-recensione.html", "text": "You may not even have noticed it or will have deliberately ignored it, but Terminator: Dark Fate, the latest film in the franchise, has just arrived in theaters. What better occasion, therefore, to offer the public a nice themed video game, which in any case has absolutely nothing to do with the film? In our review of Terminator: Resistance for PlayStation 4 you will find enough material to reconfirm a small universal truth that you have all in all known for a long time, namely: tie-in video games are usually not worth the price of admission. And if you entrust the rights to Teyon, the developers of Rambo: The Video Game, when they might be worth it, you're probably also a bit masochistic. The plot The plot of Terminator: Resistance is the most bland, monotonous and linear you could imagine, yet it does not even represent the worst side of the production. In the post-apocalyptic sci-fi future that Terminator fans know well, Skynet controls the world, and a few survivors try to regroup to counter the advance of the killing machines. In full swing of these events, the title offers the events related to Jacob Rivers in Los Angeles of 2028, when the latter, separated from his own division of the Resistance, finds himself taking care of a group of survivors. The player's choices during the main campaign will determine the relationship between the main hero and his companions, up to a series of alternative endings that in no way stimulate playing the entire adventure again (the duration of which is around twelve hours) . If you have never seen even a film in the Terminator series, Teyon's production will probably reserve you some interesting revelations; vice versa, you will understand that all the events, characters and stories told are purely derivative, without some kind of originality, not even the slightest, shining anywhere. The proposed game difficulties are four, but calibrated in a questionable way: playing in normal mode, for example, the ease is already disarming, so much so that you don't even need to hide from enemies by taking cover behind improvised covers; it is sufficient to fire on anything capable of movement, machine or living being, and the game is done. Even the Terminators come down which is a beauty, just take up a nice uzi or an M16 (and weapons and ammunition are almost always abundant). The gameplay Terminator: Resistance is an extremely traditional first-person shooter: you fire on the machines present, collect objects, explore the rooms of a building and the buildings of a town, and so on and on. The main missions almost always require you to simply move from point A to point B, or to collect certain items; the secondary ones the exact same things, but on a smaller scale and with the possibility of ignoring them quietly. This basic monotony in all the actions to be performed is accompanied by a gameplay already seen in a myriad of secondary B-series productions, based on the main weapons in the rapidly selectable wheel, secondary gadgets such as explosive fuses and sound decoys, torch for dark areas. In some moments (the more intelligent ones) Terminator: Resistance also winks at titles of far different caliber such as Fallout 3 and New Vegas: it is clear, for example, that the developers were inspired by Bethesda in the furnishings of the buildings and also in some aspects of production. By collecting a series of otherwise useless junk, you unlock the crafting mechanics at the workbenches: here you can create new items or upgrade your weapons. Or, by leveling up and unlocking certain parameters, the skills related to burglary and hacking emerge, distinguished in the easy-medium-advanced levels. In certain situations you can therefore proceed quickly by picking the lock on duty, or go around wide by eliminating the enemies if you are not yet sufficiently experienced. The problem is that basically the way to go is always that, and there are no real advantages in investing skill points in one branch rather than another. Playstation 4 trophies Here's some good news: Terminator: Resistance has the Platinum Trophy and lots of nice Gold Trophies. Furthermore, conquering them all is a piece of cake: just finish the main adventure on any difficulty level, keeping an eye on the surrounding environment and exploring as much as possible. In the worst case, a second run will recover the trophies missed during the previous game. Few advantages, many defects Terminator: Resistance has only one string to its bow, that is, only one quality: the relationships between the second charactersari and the protagonist. The answers provided in each discussion affect personal relationships and will also partially determine the final outcome of the whole story: you can behave like good guys and help everyone, or send the whole world to hell and do what you like, according to your consciousness. Let's be clear: we are not talking about a very deep system in managing relationships with NPCs, and we are not even saying that the latter have their own personal history behind them to live with specific missions. Simply, among many boring aspects, this is the one that succeeded a little better than the others. To the banality of the proposed game mechanics and the eternal sensation of ~already seen somewhere else, where it worked much more~, Terminator: Resistance also adds a poor technical and graphic sector, worthy of the previous console generation, as well as a column sound so forgettable that the writer does not even remember what he had to say about it. And again: the artificial intelligence of the enemies is embarrassing, given that they seem more interested in shooting against walls than against human beings (we remembered the Skynet system more awake), the present collectibles do not enrich the main story in any way nor they gratify the collecting craze; some bizarre lighting problem sometimes sprinkles the more distant buildings with a sort of retina, remnant of who knows what bizarre phase of development", "date": "2019-11-20", "grade": "5.5"}
