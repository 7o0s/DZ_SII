{"name": "Pokmon Battle Revolution - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-battle-revolution-recensione.html", "text": "That Nintendo has taken the path of simplicity has been known for years now, and on the other hand this path is bearing fruit that no one would have been able to predict until recently. As long as this simplicity is called Mario Galaxy, accessible and very immediate while remaining very varied and profound, it is perfectly fine and indeed cannot be considered anything other than an advantage. And even when it's called Brain Training or WiiFit, which may offer little to the hardcore gamer but which open up new, very large market sectors, it's only a positive thing. But sometimes it goes too far, and you are faced with games that within their own series take numerous steps backwards on what they have to offer the gamer: Pokmon Battle Revolution is, unfortunately, the most striking example. A story betrayed We all know the Pokmon phenomenon, we know what it has meant and continues to mean for Nintendo, the gaming market and popular culture, and we know that the RPG core of the series has always remained on the portable. In 2000, however, Nintendo decided to extend the franchise to home consoles as well, at the time the flagship was the Nintendo 64, with a title that dialogued with portable RPGs and brought at least part of the experience to the TV: the main attraction of Pokmon Stadium was the possibility of using Pokmon bred on the Game Boy in fierce 3D battles that maintained the same mechanics of the battles of the original, but this was accompanied by numerous ~bonuses~ such as the unlocking of rare monsters to bring back to the handheld, being able to play Pokmon Red/Blue on the TV screen, some nice mini-games and so on. Over time and with the various sequels, the series had evolved to such an extent that on GameCube it had become a real role-playing spin-off, not as complex and profound as the games that continued to be popular on GBA and DS, but with its own dignity and own well-defined personality, so much so that it was reasonable to expect that the first episode on Wii, whose online functionality had been announced for a long time, would have represented a further, perhaps fundamental step forward towards a home Pokmon experience finally comparable to that ~walking~. But no. Pokmon Battle Revolution is presented to the playing public even less varied than the first episode: the only important thing you can do here, after all, is to fight, with some variations and finally also online, but, frankly, it leaves a lot perplexed. This feeling of disappointment will accompany you throughout the experience, because it's not that the fight is, in hindsight, this great videogame orgy ... But let's go in order ... Welcome to Poktopia With Battle Revolution, the series also loses those management/storage features that gave it a touch of a very playful ~Pokmon database~: without introduction, without any frills, you find yourself in the city of Poktopia, where there are arenas in which you'll have to fight a series of other trainers to get the trophy, and nothing else. If you are a happy owner of Pokmon Pearl/Diamond for DS, you will be able to transfer your gladiator monsters and fight with them (the moves will be kept, but the level will be standardized on 30 or 50 to avoid disparities), otherwise you will have to resort to the so-called rental, which feature a trainer and six Pokmon, which will become yours once you beat the Master Arena; when you have more than one pass you can exchange the various Pokmon between them, in order to create a personalized pass suitable for your needs to bring in personalized fights (practically the ~friendly~ battles of Battle Revolution, where you will decide the rules) and in the online ones, and finally for each conquered arena you will receive ~Pokcoupon~ with which to buy various objects to customize your coach, only and exclusively on an aesthetic level. In terms of personalization then, it is worth mentioning the possibility of writing an introductory message and various phrases for the coaches; however all this must be done with a virtual keyboard like that of mobile phones, on which various letters correspond to each key. Why we didn't choose a normal computer keyboard, like the default Wii keyboard, is beyond our understanding. Pokmon Battle Revolution is presented to the playing public even less varied than the first episode Welcome to Poktopia Once you have grasped the mechanism, which although spartan is not entirely immediate, you move on to the actual combat, which takes place exactly like in portable RPGs, or in turns during which you do nothing but choose a move among the four available and frithen display the result on the screen. Once all the opponent's Pokmon have been defeated, the battle is won and we move on to the next one: three to six Pokmon can be used in the fight, to be selected at the beginning even when all those present in the pass must necessarily be selected... The computer does not indicate which Pokmon the opponent is choosing, we know those of his pass but not those that will actually go on the field, nor their typology, making a strategy possible (I put my Flying-type Pokmon against his Bug-type and so on ) only on a very vague and superficial level (and only for those who already know the characteristics of a Pokmon) and leaving plenty of room for chance and luck. Finally, the double fights recently introduced on the laptop are possible, which do not change the mechanics of the fight that much. Gladiators in the arena Combat mechanics which is, for the avoidance of doubt, very solid, being the legacy of a game of a very different caliber. But even here Battle Revolution manages to do damage, with the aforementioned impossibility of implementing a concrete strategy before taking the field. However, what has always been asked of the series is to bring the battles of the original into 3D, and here the game defends itself well: first of all, there are the three-dimensional models of ALL the Pokmon available, in one way or another, in Diamond and Pearl, and then, while not at all shining in the amount of polygons, detail and texture (in all these respects the title is fully GameCube-worthy), it features a whole series of very nice visual effects, from bloom lighting which is really excessive (for cover the engine gaps?) to those accompanying the moves. On the animations the speech is different: the coaches will have a total of four or five while those of the Pokmon, more varied, however, are badly linked. Just an example: after each hit received, a Pokmon gets up and returns to its place determined to fight and not give up, only this happens even when the hit suffered is the definitive one; simply, one absorbs the whole phase of the hit and the recovery, and then the animation of the defeat and the return to the Pokball starts, among other things also with a short break. Whether it is an oversight, an oversight, whatever you want, but they are things that immediately catch the eye of even the occasional player and that do not require great effort to be corrected. On the sound front we have more or less the same situation as the animations: little music, very repetitive and not at all exciting, announcer, Italian, who says few things, fortunately almost always spot on but which, due to the simple fact of being few, are often repeated and they quickly get on my nerves. The most heralded feature of Battle Revolution is online Gladiators in the arena The most heralded feature of Battle Revolution is online: even in America and Japan it was the first Wii title to take advantage of the Nintendo WiFi Connection, while in Italy the honor fell to Mario Strikers. Well, we were luckier. Beyond the technical side (the search procedure is not always successful, and must be started over. If it lasts quite a while, it can become a nuisance), which in any case can be justified by the fact that we are at the first stirrings of Wii in the field, what leaves a bad taste in the mouth is once again the poverty of available options. You can search for a random opponent or a friend with the well-known Friend Code system, different from the console one, and all that entails; no rankings, no tournaments, no chats, no statistics, nothing at all that could push us to play online beyond the pleasure of the combat itself, which thus becomes completely similar to what is offered offline (and indeed offline multiplayer becomes even funnier) plus the uncertainty of the preparatory stages. Comment Pokmon Battle Revolution leaves you stunned by its poverty, even more disconcerting if you think that we are talking about Pokmon and a series that in recent years made a big step forward with each episode. Even the new possibilities offered by the Wii, in terms of graphics, controls and Internet connection, are little and badly exploited and what remains is the sensation of a game thrown in just to have something related to pocket monsters. There remains a glimmer of hope for those who own Diamond and Pearl and want to see their little creatures fight in 3D, provided they don't expect anything else; for everyone else there is nothing in PBR, and for Nintendo there is a call to try harder, much harder for the next installment. Pros Good models and effects Always solid mechanics Cons A staggering poverty! animalactions to be reviewed Online very limited", "date": "2008-01-14", "grade": null}
