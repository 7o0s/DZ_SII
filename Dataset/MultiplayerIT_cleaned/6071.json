An extremely troubled history that of this studio, which has also gone through real bankruptcies that forced it to buy the rights to its own games. Also for these reasons, the Risen series presented itself as a true spiritual successor to Gothic, an adventure that began in 2009 and ends with the third chapter examined in this review. Released a year ago on the old generation of consoles, Risen 3: Titan Lords returns to PlayStation 4 in a special edition, improved graphically and enriched with all the additional content released by the house in the time that separated us from the original release. The second chapter curiously deepened the pirate theme, moving away from the fantasy-medieval contours of the progenitor. Risen 3 tries to partially return to that style, but without denying what was told by the previous episode. In fact, the strange adventure keeps many characters in common but not the protagonist, an unnamed pirate who we find ourselves impersonating without many preambles: on board a ship and during an assault by monstrous creatures. The situation is immediately tense: enemies were not enough, the specter of an old pirate joins in, intent on taking over the body of our hero. But in the end it's all a dream and the Unnamed is awakened by the attractive sister Patty (coincidentally a character from Risen 2: Dark Waters). Time is running out, however, there is a treasure to be recovered in a small island nearby and we just can't help but find out what it is. Unfortunately we pay dearly for our curiosity, since our hero loses his soul and life following an unpleasant encounter with a mysterious skeleton demon. It turns out that what we experienced is a simple prologue that opens the story of Titan Lords and, resurrected by a shaman, we will have to wander the world looking for a way to recover the lost soul; otherwise our body will inexorably abandon itself to the charm of the forces of darkness. The incipit curiously recalls another title: Capcom's Dragon's Dogma. Risen 3: Titan Lords - Enhanced Edition also brings the title Piranha Bytes to the PlayStation 4 Fantasy pirates Once you leave the island of the introduction, the title immediately reveals its role-playing nature with ample decision-making power: you can immediately go wherever you want, with a dozen islands full of missions available and countless objects to discover . As mentioned, the Caribbean setting of the previous Dark Waters is maintained, as well as the narrative focused on ironic dialogues and a vaguely light-hearted general style, but at the same time we have also tried to recover the fantasy spirit of the first chapter. The player has many possibilities to express himself as he wishes in the game world: the inevitable main quest, centered as mentioned on the search for the spirit of the protagonist, is accompanied by a generous number of secondary missions and the need to rely on one of the three factions, or guilds, which we will meet on our travels. This serves to fine-tune the character's abilities, but guilds can be joined independently. From Dark Waters, Titan Lords unfortunately also recovers the imperfect combat system. The protagonist can swing his sword, parry, fire a pistol shot, a magic shot or perform an evasive somersault; it is even possible to carry out simple combos with a white weapon. Unfortunately, very little has changed from the original and all the flaws are in place, including the total invulnerability of the protagonist during the somersault, which can also be used without limits, which leads to a series of almost comical situations. The lag in the commands and the slowness of the animations of the character also make it difficult to counter the suffocating enemy attacks, still forcing the infamous evasive move to fall back on an unsatisfactory hit and run tactic. There is a simple moral inclination system, which will influence the recovery of the protagonist's soul at the end of the main story, altering its conclusion, while there is no lack of crafting of objects evolved to the right point and a skill system that for once is not it rests on the classic level progression. The overall duration is satisfactory, guaranteed by the amount of content proposed and enriched by the DLCs included in the Enhanced Edition, which consist of two islands and a new uniform. Thus, the fifty hours of play can be greatly exceeded. Playstation 4 trophiesRisen 3: Titan Lords - Enhanced Edition features forty-two bronze, eight silver, and two gold trophies, as well as platinum. To get them you need to complete the main and secondary missions, which can reach up to three hundred. But don't forget to also develop the character's skills, collect all the items, accumulate money and beat the mini-games. You will have a really long way to go to reach the coveted platinum. Sometimes they come back Risen 3: Titan Lords Enhanced Edition has been revised for PlayStation 4 hardware. The improvements over the old-gen versions are clear and appreciable, from the resolution boosted to native 1080p to texture quality now comparable to ultra settings on PC. But in addition to this there are various improvements, such as variations in depth of field and some graphic effects, such as bloom. The image is thus very soft, with warm tones and saturated colors. For the occasion, the cloud system was also revised, which is now entirely volumetric. Unfortunately, however, there are various technical problems, such as the unlocked frame rate which, however, can hardly keep the thirty frames per second. The dips are constant and often severe in their severity, impacting gameplay, while a number of really annoying bugs are still present. Graphically you can glimpse the strengths and weaknesses of the work of a small house like Piranha Bytes: it is commendable to look for a Fable-like visual style, but the budget is what it is and it is impossible to turn a blind eye to the paucity of the artistic direction. As far as possible, however, we have tried to create environments that are as varied as possible, in certain situations even pleasant if not evocative.", "date": "2015-09-02", "grade": "7.4"}
