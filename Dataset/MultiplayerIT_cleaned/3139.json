From an official collaboration between Homa Games and NERF, Hasbro's famous toy line, we can't expect anything different than an exaltation of the famous plastic weapons with foam rubber bullets. In fact, it is a nice interpretation of the fake war game, which millions of children around the world undertake using the toys in question, enhancing their more cheerful and light-hearted component. The cataloging is not simple because to explain it according to the classic schemes of video games, an all too high-sounding representation emerges: third-person tactical shooter with covers, one could say, but it is a bit funny to define it in this way if you think to what these words usually represent and what we are on the screen in this game. NERF Epic Pranks puts us in front of a long series of progressively difficult levels in which we have to eliminate the various opponents we are facing with rubber erasers, whether these are the unfortunate relatives of the terrible little boy protagonist, simple innocent bystanders or characters a bit ' more experienced and also armed with NERF, therefore ready to return fire. It is an extremely simple game, which is controlled with a single finger and performing a single action, paying attention only to the timing: tapping the screen you shoot, leaving you behind an element of the scenario, with objective and position that are chosen automatically , leaving us the only task of calculating the right time to get out of cover and fire. The goal is to hit the targets with the required number of bullets before they see us or hit us back, with the mechanism being simplified by the visual cone of the characters represented very clearly on the screen. In fact, each level requires you to do essentially the same things, tapping the screen to fire and releasing to hide at the right moment, with variations applied by the progression of the protagonist and the level of difficulty. Minimalist shooter The NERF line has become a bit of a popular costume phenomenon, but basically it is a series of toys for children and this could be the ideal target for NERF Epic Pranks, which would also explain its extreme simplicity both in terms of mechanics of game and as a level of challenge. It is probable that a young audience could find themselves more involved in a mechanism that simply requires tapping the screen at intervals with a minimum of timing, advancing through levels that substantially repeat the same situations, but for those looking for a slightly more complex challenge and challenging, it can prove limiting in the long run. The level of challenge also follows an extremely gentle curve, perhaps too much, considering that minimally demanding situations only begin to occur towards level 70 and beyond, with the increase of opponents simultaneously present on the screen and able to return fire. However, there is something that attracts in NERF Epic Pranks, between its facetious atmosphere and a certain sense of satisfaction that derives from shooting others with machine gun fire with foam rubber bullets with impunity, thanks also to the dynamism of the action, always very fast, and to the well-placed slow motion to mark the decisive shots scored. The constant progression of the protagonist also helps to keep the attention active from level to level: it is possible to unlock new characters, new costumes to use, new emotes (all quite annoying to tell the truth, but in line with the annoying essence of the protagonist ) and especially new weapons as you progress through the game. Switching from one weapon to another determines actual variations in the approach to the game, thanks to the different rate and power they possess and which modify the fighting style, but they are still marginal changes. The game is offered as a free-to -play with a few micro-transactions, but its real problem is the storm of advertising it subjects us to with obsessive frequency. Fortunately, it is possible to buy the ad-free version for the price of 3.49 euros, which is however perhaps a bit high compared to what the title has to offer. However, it is a strongly recommended solution to anyone who intends to devote themselves to NERF Epic Pranks for a long time, because the amount of advertising seriously risks undermining the system.nervous theme, otherwise.", "date": "2020-04-15", "grade": "5.0"}
