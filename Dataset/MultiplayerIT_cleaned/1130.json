{"name": "Viewtiful Joe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/viewtiful-joe_b.html", "text": "The policy of exclusives, apparently, has not proved profitable for Capcom, which for obvious economic reasons has decided to publish a PS2 version of Viewtiful Joe and has already announced for the Sony console not only the related sequel, but also the release of the highly anticipated Resident Evil 4. Great news, don't you think? Well, unless you own a GameCube... In any case, Viewtiful Joe in the PlayStation 2 version not only does not make you regret what you saw on GC, but adds some bonus elements of great interest. Joe, a fanatic of Japanese action films of the ~superheroes and rubber monsters~ genre, is at the cinema with his Silvia to enjoy the screening of a classic of the genre. Suddenly, however, the villain of the film escapes from the screen and kidnaps the girl, bringing her into his world. Incredulous, Joe also finds himself in the film: following the enlightening advice of his idol, Captain Blue, he will have to awaken his heroic instincts to save not only Silvia, but the whole world from a terrible evil plan. All clear? It's a Viewtiful day Each level of the game is divided into several sections, after completing which you will proceed to a boss fight. Apart from some variations on the theme (for example the shoot'em up section), generally everything takes place according to a ~classic~ logic and which incorporates situations made famous by Capcom titles of the past: you face hordes of similar enemies, gradually replaced by others smarter or more resistant, with few surprises but a lot of substance. In this regard, a plot with simple implications but enriched by hints of demented humor cannot fail to be mentioned, which are expressed in the numerous animated sequences. And let's not forget the Booster, or the possibility of buying, between one level and another, a series of powers, skills and objects by spending the acquired points. Finally, this PS2 version of the game includes the possibility of unlocking characters that can then be used to complete the adventure again, and among these Dante, the protagonist of Devil May Cry, stands out. As far as the technique is concerned, Viewtiful Joe features very well done graphics, created according to a precise style and full of appreciable touches of class. The levels are beautiful to look at and the enemies follow each other at a frantic pace, while Joe performs spectacular stunts in slow motion. All this is supported by an effective sound sector, which does not make one cry out for a miracle but does not look bad in comparison to the rest either. The Italian version of the game, tested by us, boasts a complete translation of the screen text into Italian. Comment Capcom has managed to create a video game that is the exaltation of a particular genre, a feast of spectacular acrobatics and shots that tries in every way not to be repetitive and basically succeeds in the enterprise. Technically excellent, very original in design and innovative in gameplay, Viewtiful Joe will surely conquer the public of PS2 owners, after having made a massacre of hearts among GameCube users. Among other things, the extras present in this version also offer those who already know the game a valid reason to buy it. Definitely recommended. Pros: Great graphics, with a weird but effective style Classic gameplay Version enriched with some extras Cons: Inevitably, it's a bit repetitive All of this is Viewtiful If you haven't played Viewtiful Joe on GameCube, you should know that it is a two-dimensional action game that gives a nod to classic platformers while basing its mechanics above all on fighting. The protagonist, Joe, transforms into a superhero dressed in red as soon as the all-important VFX indicator (which stands for ~Viewtiful Effects~) reaches a certain threshold, and remains so until its energy is depleted by the abuse of super powers deriving from it. When this happens, the character returns dangerously normal, at least until the gauge automatically reaches a certain level. There was talk of super powers not without reason, as their use is the key to the playability of Viewtiful Joe. We are talking about three different types of skills: the ~Slow VFX~, the ~VFX Mach Speed~ and the ~Zoom VFX~, which are activated using a special button and which allow you a large number of spectacular and effective attacks. The Slow Motion VFX, Joe's first super power, drastically slows down the movement of objects and enemies, proportionally increasing the power of your attack. In slow motion mode you can also dodge enemy attacks or even deflect bullets and missiles, all with the aim of generating defense and attack sequences that are as effective as they are beautiful to look at, which will yield precious points for raising the maximum limit of indiVFX er. Speed Mach VFX is perhaps a less important power than Slow Motion in game mechanics, but equally spectacular: it increases the speed of the character until it is transformed into a frenetic war machine, which even doubles and flames to inflict damage on the opponents. Finally, the Zoom VFX can be used in combination with other super powers to create new attack maneuvers and make everything more effective. All three special abilities lend themselves to numerous uses in addition to the offensive one, effectively modifying the laws of physics of the virtual world in which Joe moves: the Slow Motion VFX, for example, influences the force of gravity as well as the operation of rockets and reactors; otherwise, the Speed Mach VFX makes objects lighter and helps you put out any fires.", "date": "2004-11-23", "grade": null}
