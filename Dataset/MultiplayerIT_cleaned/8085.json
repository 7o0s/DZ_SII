It is an animated series produced in the USA, broadcast by Cartoon Network for some years, which tells the adventures of Ben Tennyson, a boy who accidentally comes into possession of an alien bracelet called ~Omnitrix~. The device allows Ben to assume various alien forms, each characterized by different powers, and to defend his friends as well as the entire planet from the invasion of evil extraterrestrial forces who want to take possession of them. A great potential in terms of merchandising, it is clear, that even here in Italy it has met with some success and which has naturally been transposed into various video games, the latest of which is precisely Ben 10: Omniverse. Based on the series of the same name, the game developed by Monkey Bar Games offers us a campaign strongly oriented towards local cooperative multiplayer, given that we will always have two characters on the screen: the aforementioned Ben and his adventure companion Rook, an alien agent capable of traveling through time and therefore interacting with two versions of his friend, child or adolescent. Ben, it's you, awesome warrior During the early stages, a rather slow but certainly complete tutorial illustrates the basic mechanics of this third-person action game, in which we will be able to use the various buttons on the GamePad to assume a different alien form (acting on the d-pad and selecting the four main choices from a menu), jump (B), dodge (right stick), return to normal form (L back), interact with the scenery (R back), block enemy blows (ZL back), activate the special abilities (ZR) and attack in various ways with the main buttons of the controller, creating different combos depending on the alien we have assumed the features of. Unfortunately, the first impact with the interface is not the best, in the sense that little attention has been paid to making this version of the game adherent to the peculiarities of the Nintendo console. In fact, it is necessary to turn on the TV to be able to choose whether to view the action on the television screen or on the one integrated in the GamePad, while playing only with the latter and using a pair of earphones, various problems are noticed with the audio sector, croaking and often subject to to sudden interruptions, the latter evident even when the experience is enjoyed in the traditional way. It can also be said that the touch controls have not been used in any way, and it is a pity because a simple menu with the various alien forms would have made the change with characters that are not part of the default roster much simpler and more immediate. Orbit barrel Although the locations offer a minimum of exploration and some simple puzzles, solved by resorting to certain skills (see the switches to be charged thanks to the electric powers of Energy Eater, or the platforms to be moved using the gravitational control of Planetarium), the core of Ben's gameplay 10: Omniverse definitely resides in the fights. In this sense, the mechanics appear simple but relatively articulated: you ~hit~ well, there is a good amount of combos and, most importantly, it makes sense to switch from one alien form rather than another. If you use Inferno, for example, you can throw powerful fireballs from a distance, while Diamond is capable of causing a shock wave in the ground that knocks opponents out, and so on. So many powers and so many characters (sixteen), in short, which however are valued less than what would have been reasonable to expect, perhaps due to their rapid introduction. In fact, during the first levels you find yourself tinkering with a slightly too high number of possibilities, and this translates into conservative choices despite the fact that the degree of challenge is far from high, a factor that reflects the user target of this production. Unfortunately, the problems with this solution come to the surface quickly: continuously proposing fights makes little sense if the latter are anything but demanding, bosses included, and the repetitiveness of the action soon begins to make itself felt. Furthermore, the fact of depending on the Omnitrix bar perhaps makes sense from a balancing point of view, but on balance it only breaks up the action, forcing us to avoid the fight once the energy is exhausted and then return to the 'attack a few seconds later. On the technical front, the good dubbing in Italian is partly ruined by some blunders (sometimes the same voice interprets the lines of both Ben and Rook, inexplicably), while the graphics in cel shading are not bad at all, but in situations more crowded shows the side to drops in the frame rate and moreover gets lost in the details, such as the characters who do not move their mouth mboth speak. In conclusion... Ben 10: Omniverse is a tie-in dedicated exclusively to lovers of the television series, ergo to younger gamers, who precisely because of their passion for the character will tend to turn a blind eye to the limits of the experience in terms of variety and depth. There are in fact many possible transformations and as many combinations of conventional or special moves, but in the end the gameplay consists of nothing but an alternation of fights within scenarios that have little to offer in terms of exploration, despite the presence of some small puzzle. After the very cloying first stages, the Monkey Bar Games title can be played honestly but without ever an acute and without making good use of the peculiarities of Wii U. The result is still better than we expected, for what it's worth.
