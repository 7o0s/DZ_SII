This must have thought Jacob Reeves as he let himself fall, backwards, from the edge of a cliff. Except that at the end of the flight there wasn't oblivion waiting for him, but a surreal, grotesque, sometimes cruel nightmare. And with the nightmare began the questions. What is this place? Who are these people? Why are they subjecting me to such torture? At the end of the approximately ten hours it takes to finish the game, Silence of the Sleep satisfactorily and unpredictably answers all these questions, and more, that arise along the way. In addition to a well-written story, fundamental in this genre of game, Silence of the Sleep excites with musical compositions, which combine the inevitable melodies of the piano with the chords of a guitar played by a mysterious psychotherapist. The game system owes a lot to two great titles of the same genre, Lone Survivor and The Cat Lady, but goes further, experimenting with original gameplay solutions. At this point it is good to say that behind Silence of Sleep there is only one author, Jesse Makkonen, who has taken charge of every aspect of the development. So expect a sometimes rough game, which in certain passages seems to hold the pieces together with string, but no less convincing overall. You can feel the presence of the author and his personality in the gameplay choices, even in the funny end credits, and this unique and personal look compensates for the creaks due to the lack of funds and the inexperience of a developer who has yet to reach maturity . But these are side talks, let's leave them aside and fall into the abyss together with Mr. Reeves. A soul haunted by guilt is the protagonist of Silence of the Sleep, original 2D horror Beyond the limits of reason The protagonist of this game, more than a man is a soul, that of Jacob Reeves to be precise. His is a very long journey, which alternates dreamlike, almost relaxed sequences with others of relentless horror. For example, a long chapter takes place inside a psychiatric clinic located on top of a mountain and surrounded by an impenetrable fog. There we live the routine of a typical patient for three days in a row, alternating moments of daily life with hypnosis sessions that plunge us into ever worse nightmares. But once we return to reality we find our world waiting for us, as if nothing had happened. The program even includes an hour of drawing in which we can express our emotions by actually drawing them with minimal software. This is just a small example of the ingenuity of Jesse Makkonen, who often manages to circumvent production limits with clever ideas. And the clinic represents only one of the five chapters that make up the game, all very different from each other in terms of atmosphere and game system. Sometimes we have to solve visual puzzles by examining the background with a special distorting lens, in other cases we have to solve the problems of strange characters who follow us in our dreamlike wanderings. These sections are sometimes too long for what they offer, and the desire not to take the player by the hand often ends up putting us in front of obscure passages in which it becomes difficult to understand what we have to do. Nothing insurmountable, however. Above all, the sudden changes in atmosphere and the many variations in the style of play compensate for the frustrations. And solid writing, coupled with thoughtful art direction, come to the game's rescue when the foundations falter. Lights and shadows emerge above all in the action phases, which in their essence are a game of hide and seek between us and dark presences who manage on more than one occasion to keep us on edge. The controls are a nuisance and dying instantly because we don't see at a glance which direction we're facing is unpleasant, but if we put our mind to it and use our heads, slipping unseen through the corridors of the game offers a subtle satisfaction . To help us, we peek through doors or listen to what is happening on the other side. In addition to the chilling noises that come out of the speakers of our PC, we can therefore also count on Jacob's ear, who describes to us in words what he hears. And so even a two-dimensional game can simulate sensory effects typical of three-dimensional horror. Perhaps Makkonen could have exploited these mechanics more, but after a long chapter of tension the scenario and atmosphere change, and new rules come into play. As confusing as it may seem, the story actually sticks together and stitches the sequences together without losing the player. The fragmentation mainly concerns the comvisual birth, which experiments relentlessly looking for new solutions every time to make us feel different emotions. Musical notes also mark the passage of atmosphere, and are a fundamental clue to understand when to worry. We therefore pass from the sly melodies of an orchestra playing against the background of an absurd motel to the disturbing verses produced by the monsters that hunt us down. Then, unexpectedly, we have a moment of real peace in which we have to tune a guitar with the commands of a very simple mini game. Nothing more. But we confess that it is still among our favorite memories of Silence of the Sleep.", "date": "2014-11-04", "grade": "7.5"}
