Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. ~How much did you do?~ ~I'm stuck at ten, are you?~ ~I just broke my record and got to eighteen. I really have no idea how some people score higher than fifty.~ If you have made such a speech in recent days, on Facebook or in real life, you were probably talking about the phenomenon of the moment in terms of mobile games: Flappy Bird. The game has been available on the App Store and Google Play for a few months now, however it has only recently established itself in the charts, turning into a real mainstream phenomenon, so much so that its author earns something like $50,000 a day in revenue alone advertisers. There are no in-app purchases in Flappy Bird, so these revenues depend exclusively on the small banners that appear while we play, alternating at the top and bottom of the screen. In short, it is possible to download this simple action game and use it completely free, forever, without waiting and without the dreaded ~paywalls~. A great result for a videogame developed in forty-eight hours by a single person, which once again highlights the opportunities offered by mobile gaming, a market in which it is still possible to produce with extremely tight budgets but without giving up great ambitions and dreams of glory. It's just a shame that Flappy Bird's success story isn't exactly deserved, and we'll explain why in a moment. Brilliant pastime or a simple demo made in minutes? Flappy Bird is both Jump, don't stop There's nothing stopping an independent developer from making an ~ultra arcade~ that works with a single input, after all, there are many on iOS and Android and some have even been very successful, see Jetpack Joyride. The problem is when the experience doesn't go beyond what you see in the first screen, which is precisely the big limitation of Flappy Bird. In the game we control an obese bird who must stay in the air and try to pass between pipes that are disturbingly reminiscent of those of Super Mario Bros., but absolutely without touching them, otherwise it will be game over. Each passed pipe is worth one point, and the goal is to get the highest score possible. A far from easy undertaking, given that the only way we have to proceed is to press on the touch screen to make the bird flap its wings and therefore project upwards, holding itself afloat in a very ~heavy~ and particularly punitive inertial context. The background remains practically identical, the character is in fact stationary on the screen and it is the pipes that flow from right to left towards our position, generated by a simple algorithm that changes their position. There is no increase in speed, there is no tightening of the difficulty: you run into game over simply when you miss the size of a jump, which happens damn frequently given the assumptions. We must applaud the author's idea, so simple yet capable of attracting the attention of millions of people and even acting as a hardcore experience; but it is absolutely impossible to reward its realization, given that anyone, even using a simple editor, could have done the same. As someone has already said, Flappy Bird stands at the same time as a summary of what is good and wrong in mobile gaming. By the way, what score did you achieve?", "date": "2014-02-08", "grade": "5.5"}
