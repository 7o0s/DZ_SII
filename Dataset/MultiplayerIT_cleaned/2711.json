The Finnish studio has tried to create a lore very similar to that of The Legend of Zelda, and the story of this curious Gauntlet-style spin-off is no exception, being set two centuries after the events narrated in the second chapter of the series. Same world but different eras and characters, just like for the Nintendo brand. It's a pity that Chrono Dungeon lacks practically everything else: the incipit of the game is interesting, on paper the structure promises great variety but in fact the experience immediately turns out to be very weak and repetitive. intent on exploring scenarios that reward too little initiative, we will be able to take turns in command of four heroes with different characteristics, who, however, can grow and become more powerful during the campaign. Gameplay The formula adopted by Oceanhorn: Chronos Dungeon actually recalls the very first Zelda or the classic Gauntlet, which we have already mentioned, while trying to introduce elements of variation within the structure. The four adventurers that we will be able to control, alone or in local cooperative (at least bizarre and very little exploitable option compared to an online solution), in fact have the task of entering a huge dungeon whose characteristics are determined randomly. As they explore the scenarios, defeat enemies and collect coins, the characters (a sword-wielding warrior, a spear-wielding master, an archer and a sorceress) grow, become stronger and acquire special weapons to use in battle. The problem, however, is that in fact the gameplay never takes off, remaining flat and banal from start to finish. There are discrete boss fights to grapple with every ten stages, but otherwise the action appears dull from the outset due to a simplistic and limited combat system, which does not even allow you to attack diagonally with edged weapons, it makes aiming with ranged maneuvers extremely complicated and gives us specials that are not worth the loading time. It is interesting that you can switch between heroes at any time, but in the end this feature boils down to a mere safety measure in order not to consume all the health of each individual adventurer, which would result in game over. The enemies, for their part, are moved by a practically absent artificial intelligence, characterized by basic routines: they do nothing but come towards us and attack, regardless of our blows. Technical realization In terms of technical realization, Oceanhorn: Chronos Dungeon comes with pixel art graphics that recall the era of 16-bit games, combined with a strictly top view. I'm sorry to say that the moments in which this solution gives its best are the loading screens between one dungeon and another, because then in-game we have generally seen better around. The animations of the characters are in fact not very varied, while on the one hand, the settings manage to well disguise their random composition, probably limited to specific aspects, without showing design blunders; on the other hand they don't strike that much, a speech which also applies to the soundtrack of the game.", "date": "2021-01-14", "grade": "5.0"}
