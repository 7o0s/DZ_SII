The plot sees Paris committed to launching her own line of jewelry by traveling with her private jet between the trendiest cities on the international scene (New York, Cancun, Paris, London, etc.) in search of exceptionally rare precious stones. Our task will be to help her by solving a series of increasingly complex puzzles based on the gems in question in different game modes that find their common denominator in the universal rule that if we manage, by exchanging places, to align three diamonds, rubies, sapphires or any other precious of the same type, these will disappear discovering bonuses that will help us to progress to the next level.
