{"name": "Conan Unconquered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conan-unconquered-recensione.html", "text": "Once there was Command & Conquer, now there's Conan Unconquered; once there were RTS, now there are MOBAs; Once there was PvP, now there's co-op. Once upon a time there were many more people who played strategic games, today we need to intercept casual smartphone gamers. It was better when it was worse, one might say, especially after having tried and written the review of this pumped-up title that enriches the Conan The Barbarian saga. If you're browsing the Steam pages, the Conan Unconquered banner might seem like a DLC for Conan Exiles, Funcom's famous survival: same font graphics, same color tones, above all, same name. Instead, it is a spin-off commissioned by the Norwegian company to Petroglyph, a software house with a respectable pedigree that experienced its best moments in the second half of the 2000s. The team based in Las Vegas has made itself known above all for real-time strategy (Star Wars: Empire at War, Universe at War), having been founded by a group of Westwood programmers after the historic developer was incorporated in 2003 , from Electronic Arts. All these premises to say that from people like Michael Legg, Patrick Pannullo and Ted Morris, whose big faces appear in the launch trailers and who have milestones behind them such as the aforementioned Command & Conquer, Empire Earth, Dune II, we definitely expected moreover. Defend yourself enough The kinematics make your mouth water, but it is enough to sift through the initial menu to get back down to earth. There are two modes: cooperative in pairs (which should be the most fun, but which, due to the elitist nature of the code, we were not able to test) and skirmish. There is no real single-player campaign, but rather five maps put there just to act as a tutorial that differ from the ~standard~ ones only in having some updates blocked. Obviously there is also the possibility of setting up a customized game by deciding its size, number of enemies and resources, but that's all. The first few minutes after booting made us think we were dealing with an ~old school~ RTS. It always starts with a stronghold, a non-replicable building whose capitulation coincides with the game over screen, with Conan or Valeria (two other leaders, Kalanthes and Conan the King, are only available in the deluxe version which costs 10 euros more ) and with a time counter that indicates how far until the next barbarian invasion is. While waiting to defend yourself from the enemy hordes, you need to find the time to build buildings, defensive walls and, possibly, an army: the hero is decidedly stronger than the other units, but he can do nothing against the more numerous waves. To succeed in all of this, as per tradition, three resources have to be collected: wood, minerals and food, to which are added command points and army capacity. Unlike the consolidated schemes, in Conan the player is relieved of producing workers: it is sufficient to build the sawmill near a forest (which will never run out) to see the amount of timber progressively rise; the same goes for quarries and farms. Of course, not everything is available immediately, so to build, for example, the ballista tower, it is first necessary to have researched it in the engineering office. On closer inspection, the most delicate moments of the game are precisely the initial ones because you have to guess the right path to follow in order not to find yourself overwhelmed after a few waves. The real challenge is to guess the correct order in which to develop the updates; a task made more complicated by the random generation of the maps and their morphological conformation which can make the base more or less exposed to enemy attacks. While waiting to unleash hell, it is advisable to explore the map, hidden by the smoke screen, to quickly recover other raw materials, often kept by neutral monsters, while increasing the experience of the hero and troops, who thus improve their statistics. Enemies from the other world The computer has no base and the only way to ~defeat~ it is to resist until the last wave. This is in summary the skeleton of the game that offers no other types of challenge. It must be recognized that this mode allows you to keep your attention always very high even for some ~smart~ choices introduced by the developers. The corpses of enemies, for example, over time can lead to diseases and damage units; the fire set on the walls can also spread inside the citadel causing the destruction of structures that were thought to have heldto safe. The player can therefore never feel in a comfort zone because the enemies force him to constantly maintain his fortress. The first hours spent in Conan's company are pleasant, one gets the feeling of having found a friend who hasn't been seen for a long time, perhaps a little aged, but with all the strengths and weaknesses that one had learned to appreciate. Unfortunately it is an effect that tends to run out in a short time: the absence of other modes, including a single player campaign and a PvP, is felt quite a bit and is weighed down by the average duration of the games which varies from one to two hours , depending on how many waves were selected at the start. The presence of in-game achievements (therefore we are not talking about Steam medals), as ~blackmail~ to continue launching the title, is a gimmick that has particularly irritated us: in practice, by enlisting a certain number of warriors their value of attack improves permanently; same reasoning for the resistance of the walls, the life of the mounted units and so on. In short, the more you play, the more bonuses you unlock, almost as if it were impossible to get the better of the enemy in the first few games, when the statistics are reset. Monothematism is unfortunately not the only flaw of Conan Unconquered. We are not referring so much to the pathfinding flaws, which in any case can be particularly frustrating when enemies attack from multiple directions, as to the lack of variety of units, both available to the player and enemies; it is unacceptable that there are only two heroes (or at most four) and the absence of keyboard shortcuts that allow you to select specific groups of units is also difficult to digest, reducing battles to a simple battle for whoever has the most. Too little The disappointment with the smallness of Conan Unconquered also extends to the graphic design, which does not do justice to years of technological progress. It almost feels like playing the remastered version of Age Of Empires, rather than a strategy game released almost ten years after StarCraft 2 which continues to be one of the benchmarks for the genre. The animations are wooden, the models of structures and militias not very detailed, the special effects, such as the fog of war, absolutely unwatchable. Even the user interface is too affected by the legacy of the past, resulting in a bit heavy and not without some bugs; thankfully there's the option to pause to avoid getting lost in the menus and the action. The soundtrack, which is heard only at the right moments, is pleasant, but slightly repetitive, while the sound effects seem to have been recycled from some previous Petroglyph work and stand on the level of this production on which, evidently, they have not been adequate resources are lavished. The artificial intelligence defends itself well: when it can, it tries to attack the base directly, while in other cases it seems to realize that it cannot prevail and is therefore limited to annoying damage to the structures. The level of difficulty therefore remains on medium-high standards, especially at the beginning when the units are ~weakened~, without running the risk of resulting in frustration.", "date": "2019-05-29", "grade": "5.0"}
