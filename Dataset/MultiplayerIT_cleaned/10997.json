Making such a product is simple: just get a good number of photos depicting girls in scanty dresses, then build them around a simple but captivating application, such as a card game or a puzzle game. On mobile we have been able to see numerous titles belonging to this trend, some better than others but always characterized by the massive presence of killer models, taken from life or simply drawn. Among the ~softcore~ products, it is worth mentioning the excellent Pillowfight, an unusually funny and rich fighting match game, which featured scantily clad and exceptionally designed girls. Bikini Summer Games 2008, the latest effort by Twistbox Games, is presented as a sexy but graceful product, in which, driving a beautiful girl in a bathing suit, we will have to pass five different sports-related tests. From the start screen you can start a new game or try your hand at just one of the minigames available, even in multiplayer mode for several people on a single phone. The first step consists in creating our protagonist, determining her appearance and nationality using a simple editor, after which we will be able to dedicate ourselves to the challenges in sequence: acrobatic diving, obstacle course, fencing, kayaking and basket shooting. The basic setting is typical of rhythm games, in which you have to press the keys indicated on the screen with the greatest possible precision: doing so during acrobatic dives translates into a series of spectacular evolutions before our athlete enters the water, for example. The obstacle course works in a similar way: when indications appear, we will have to press the right and left buttons on the d-pad for the character to run faster. Decidedly more complex is the functioning of the minigame dedicated to fencing, in which we will have to both attack and defend ourselves using the 1, 4 and 7 keys for high, medium and low parries, and the 3, 6 and 9 keys for the corresponding attacks. The peculiarity of this test is that the girls who participate in it will end up being stripped of their equipment as they are hit. The kayak sees us facing a speedy descent on a river, with the aim of crossing all the passages and avoiding dangers, alternately pressing the left and right keys on the d-pad to simulate paddling. Finally, basket shots constitute the minigame in which the greatest precision is required: we will have to block the indicators to ~hook~ the basket board, then pay attention to the character's breathing to obtain more or less power and finally hold down the key 5 until the shot indicator turns green, then immediately release it. Each test consists of three attempts, with a score that is calculated globally and that at the end of the five disciplines, if we have behaved well, will see us conquer the podium. One of the fundamental elements, when one tries to develop a ~sexy~ title, is the quality of the graphics, in this case the drawing style of the girls (if drawn). From this point of view, the aforementioned Pillowfight was absolutely excellent, while unfortunately Bikini Summer Games 2008 leaves a lot to be desired: the drawing style is mediocre, the athletes are not valued in the right way and the quality of the animations is decidedly low. The action is accompanied by fairly good quality MIDI music, but far from unforgettable. PRO Good number of minigames Simple and immediate Discreet music AGAINST Mediocre graphics Very limited gameplay Definitely short and without thickness", "date": "2008-12-02", "grade": "S.V."}
