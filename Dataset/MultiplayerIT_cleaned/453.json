Evolution and involution Wanting to write about KOF2002 without making merciless comparisons, the most logical thing to do is to proceed with an analysis of the old and new characters, to see what has changed and what has not in the main element of the game. The fighters are about fifty in all, and the most important ones (from the same series of The King of Fighters, from Fatal Fury, from Art of Fighting and from many SNK games of other genres) are all still present. There are also some new proposals, which however are not surprising either for their originality or for their abilities. Abilities that, in some cases, prove to be decidedly disproportionate in a negative sense: if completing the tournament with the classic characters is a feasible undertaking after all, it becomes practically impossible with the less ~fortunate~ wrestlers. The general balance of difficulty also complicates things: getting to the final stages of the game is relatively simple (in some cases even too much), but then there is a sudden and abrupt increase in difficulty. Rugal's character, for example, must necessarily be faced by being on the defensive, given that he has moves capable of covering all the space around him and which activate in half the time compared to ours. A blow to playability: an opponent more resistant to blows would have been preferable to one that hardly lets you even get close. A matter of A matter of space The Neo Geo is the longest running gaming system ever, and this is also due to the particular approach of the SNK developers. In the Neo Geo titles there are no animated sequences or cumbersome full motion video: all the memory is used to enrich the game graphics, and this is why the various Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting and so on could boast the most beautiful backdrops that ever seen in a two-dimensional video game. And it is no coincidence that the settings of The King of Fighters 2002 represent the strong point of the game, on a technical level: as per tradition, the landscape changes color according to the time of day, and in the background it is possible to recognize famous places scattered the world (in this case we can see the tower of Pisa representing Italy), enriched by nice details and ~cameos~ of characters who appeared in this or other SNK series. Unfortunately, this aspect of the product is also subject to ups and downs: the polygonal elements introduced in the backdrops are generally of good quality and give a better ~scenic~ presence, while other elements, absurdly placed in the foreground, denounce a truly mediocre realization. The characters themselves are more or less the same, they have not undergone significant changes other than the addition of some animation: an absolutely insufficient work. Everything then has to deal with the low-resolution graphics, which at this point in the history of PS2 are simply unthinkable, no matter what technical problems we encountered... It's even sadder to comment on the sound sector of the game, unfortunately. The old KOFs had accustomed us to exceptional music in terms of workmanship and the ability to create an epic atmosphere, while those audible in this 2002 edition are decidedly anonymous and uninspired. Not to mention the sound effects, which have been the same for years and which have also been modified for the worse as regards speech. [C] Among the newcomers is &ldquo; also something of an emulator of Kyo. Here is the Italian setting, with the tower of Pisa in the background. Over time, Clark &ndash; been far too weakened compared to his comrade Ralf... [/C] Comment A title for nostalgics. Sorry to say, but The King of Fighters 2002 can't aspire to something more than this: the technical realization of the game, however perfect in the conversion, doesn't hold the comparison with current videogames nor, even, with other SNK games. Fans of the series will find the gameplay they have always appreciated, but applied to a poor structure and moreover devoid of even the slightest hint of a plot! We're just not there: SNK can and must do much more to revive its (legendary!) production. Pros: The playability is that of the various KOFs Some new characters Appreciable by nostalgics and fans of the series Cons: Technically unfeasible even in the music! Extremely limited Classics are classics, good ideas are practically immortal, and so on. However, seeing The King of Fighters 2002 run on PS2 one wonders which onespossibility still has the ~2D school~ in the videogame field. The latest SNK title (in order of arrival on PS2, of course), perfectly converted by Ignition Software, represents the ideal example for this reasoning. As much as the meetings between the various Kyo Kusanagi, Terry Bogard, Ryo Sakazaki etc. are sophisticated in mechanics, take place within an extremely limited structure, worthy of a budget game at best by today's standards. You are given the opportunity to face the tournament with a team of three characters or alone, or to try your hand at resistance tests in which all the other fighters face each other in sequence while always keeping the same energy bar. Or finally, you can challenge a friend. And, from time to time, take a look at the images that appear in the gallery with each goal achieved.", "date": "2006-06-10", "grade": null}
