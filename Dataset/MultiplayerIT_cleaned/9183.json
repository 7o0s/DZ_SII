This was a natural consequence of the much more action soul than in the past of the last two REs, and, as a complement to the classic Story Mode, it certainly made sense and constituted a juicy opportunity to add value to the expense; but can a game that consists only of this concept be considered a complete product from all points of view? Let's check. Arm yourself and go The ~pretext~ that The Mercenaries uses to catapult us into the classic settings of Resident Evil 4 and 5, surrounded by the enemies also encountered in these games, is that of an elusive training course: this is why the only characters that can be used since start are Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine and Hunk, the Umbrella Corporation supersoldier also known as ~Agent Death~, who first appeared in Resident Evil 2; in fact, all three of these characters have a military background, which is not necessarily true for the other 5 historical characters that you will unlock as you play. But playing what, exactly? Well, actually there isn't much to add to what has been briefly mentioned so far, given that the gist of the game is and remains having to kill all the enemies that a stage offers you in the shortest possible time. The game view is the one in vogue from the fourth chapter, behind the character who enters a sort of first person when shooting, and the work done to adapt the control system to the Nintendo laptop is certainly admirable; the only real problem is in fact found in what is new for the saga, the ability to move while shooting. By holding down L while aiming, our character can in fact move in the game environment: the lack of control lies in the proximity of L to the other buttons, which will not be very welcome with normal hands. the basic limitation lies in the fact that, due to the lack of a second analog stick, when you are ready to shoot or move your arms to aim or the character, the first alternative, the classic one, remains absolutely preferable. Not bad, it is still a novelty and as such appreciated; for the rest, you will have no problem familiarizing yourself with a control system which also effectively relies on the touch screen for operations such as choosing a weapon (each character has his own specific weapons) and looking around. Another novelty is a system of skills, thirty in all to be unlocked of which only three at a time can be ~equipped~ to make them advance in rank and effectiveness; but these are skills that do not have a huge impact on gameplay and whose main purpose is to push for replayability, the same perspective in which we can see both the grade that is assigned to each mission based on performance (even if it is necessary to get at least ~B~ rank to unlock the next mission), Xbox Live Achievements-style achievements, and secret characters, each with slightly different characteristics and their own alternate costume. The 3D effect Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D is practically free from any attempt at spectacular and forced effect, and prefers to focus on a ~deep~ 3D that renders an excellent service to the game's considerable polygonal mass and its good draw distance. The proof that we are dealing with an excellent, intelligent and well-made 3D lies in the fact that we hardly notice the effect, only to immediately feel the difference, in negative, when we eliminate it. In this, hats off to Capcom. The Limits of Horror To complete the package there is the possibility of playing some levels cooperatively, via the Internet or locally, as well as a demo of Resident Evil: Revelations, the next episode of the series exclusive to 3DS and which promises to take us back on those Survival Horror tracks that from tempo has abandoned in favor of emphasizing the Action component. But, even in these cases, we are faced with the usual script: the demo of Revelations, although it gives a glimpse of excellent things, lasts a maximum of two minutes and, much more important, the cooperative game changes the mechanics very little (there is just the ability to heal the companion) and lacks any complement such as scores, leaderboards and so on. In short, like a bit of everything that the game offers more than the bare-bones concept, these things are there, but they don't seem to want to offer any real incentive to the player; however superficially sembri a product very rich in content, the reality is that The Mercenaries 3D hardly goes beyond what the mode of the same name offered in the fourth and fifth episode of the saga, but is offered at full price as a full game. This alone would be enough to reject any title, but we will see in the final comment that the discussion to be made is a little more complex; in the meantime we have to devote ourselves to a very important aspect of the package, namely the technical one. Graphically, The Mercenaries 3D looks very good: the arenas have a remarkable polygonal complexity, as does the main character, thank you however, from exceptional textures that only upon careful examination reveal their limits. At first glance and at an overall glance, which certainly also contributes to the 3D and the fact that we are on a laptop, one gets the feeling that the game has nothing to envy not only to the fourth episode on the GameCube, but also to the fifth on PS3 and 360: obviously a slightly more shrewd look is enough to realize that the enemies do not enjoy the same attention as the rest (but there can be more than one on the screen at the same time), that when they are far away they take on behaviors and animations totally busted (and this, however, testifies to the excellent draw distance), and that the framerate is far from the fluidity of 60 fps and moreover in particular situations it is lowered further, without however affecting the gameplay. Despite all this, the judgment on the graphics is extremely positive, and goes in favor of both the potential of the console and the ability already acquired by non-Nintendo development teams to exploit it properly. Just a quick hint to the audio: the now totally Action dynamics of the game does not require a soundtrack or atmospheric effects, but only a robust contribution to the frenetic gameplay; the department in question responds perfectly to the call, with music, effects and voices that have the strength precisely in the ability not to be particularly noticed. Very last hint for a controversial and much debated issue, the single and ~eternal~ rescue: referring to other shores for an examination of economic and ~moral~ issues, here we can assure you that, due to the very nature of the game, it should not never even the desire to cancel the progress achieved.", "date": "2011-07-11", "grade": "6.7"}
