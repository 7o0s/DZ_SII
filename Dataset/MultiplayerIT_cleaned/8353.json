{"name": "Papo & Yo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/107831-papo-yo-profondo-toccante.html", "text": "Is it possible to tell a personal experience through the videogame? In cinema and literature, but also in music, examples abound, with directors, writers and musicians who try to tell their audience a piece of their life, perhaps to exorcise a trauma from their past. But is our media mature enough to do something like this? The debates on recognizing videogames as an art form abound, but getting to create an interactive entertainment product capable at the same time of bringing the author closer to the end user as only an autobiographical story can do is a completely different story. Why are we asking ourselves all this? Because Papo & Yo is an experiment (the first?) that attempts to achieve precisely this goal, to let us experience one of the most traumatic experiences for a child, namely the family abuse of a parent who is too fond of the bottle. The monster within us To my loving mother, brother and sisters, with whom I survived the monster that resides in my father. This message signed by the creator and head of the entire project Vander Caballero, kicks off the adventure, which sees the protagonist Quico hidden in a closet while outside the shadow of a monster terrifies him. A drawing made with chalk in the shape of a spiral captures the attention of the protagonist who is teleported to a fantastic world, far from the fears of his home, or at least this is the initial hope. Here the player will accompany him through an adventure made of puzzles to solve and platforms to jump on. But even more central to the dynamics of the title is the relationship between Quico and Mostro, a large heavy creature greedy for coconuts that we will meet early in the adventure and will accompany us until the end. The creature will be a tool to be used to overcome some puzzles and with which the protagonist will create a very special friendship. Monster is in fact irreparably attracted by frogs which he will try to feed on whenever he has the opportunity, but unfortunately these bring out the anger in him, transforming him into a deadly and unstoppable threat. Through this relationship and what it represents, the player is led by the hand through a traumatic experience such as that experienced in his youth by Caballero. Having an alcoholic father whose addiction turns the kind and loving parent into a fearful, foggy monster unable to reason or realize the harm he is inflicting on his own family. Papo & Yo builds with great skill the swirling spiral that leads the player to become attached and at the same time to hate and fear Monster, as funny and harmless in the peaceful form, as capable of increasingly atrocious acts as the anger unleashed by the addiction from the frogs it is getting worse. We don't want to tell you anything else about the plot so as not to spoil the element that works better than any other in this title, but we have rarely let ourselves get involved so much, up to an ending that made us cry like it hadn't happened before in front of a video game. Playstation 3 trophies The game offers 10 trophies, 2 gold, 1 silver and 7 bronze. Most will be unlocked simply by reaching the end credits, but there are some collectibles to find to get one of the two golden trophies and some somewhat peculiar actions to be carried out to earn all the bronze ones and the silver one. Life as a puzzle The experience that we would define as almost cathartic of Papo & Yo rests its videogame foundations on a simple but well-studied gameplay, made up of puzzles to solve and short platform phases. Essentially each level will be divided into sections whose exit can only be reached by moving the objects of the scenario by activating different mechanisms. The chosen setting appears initially familiar, a representation of the South American favelas, but the strokes on the walls made with plaster will allow Quico to manipulate what surrounds him, opening passages, moving small houses, creating bridges of flying cubes and so on. The puzzles, although never particularly difficult, are well studied and some really imaginative, while Monster from a gameplay point of view is not exploited that much, only capable of making us jump higher when asleep by jumping on his stomach and activating mechanisms by entering squares drawn on the ground. To move it we will be able to exploit its passion for coconuts, to be used as bait to move it at will. We will also soon meet Lula, Quico's toy robot capable of flying thanks to the small rockets supplied, which we will be able to use to activate mechanicalnisms too far away for us or to glide for a few moments during a jump. Unfortunately, the title is not very long, and the proposed mechanics are then introduced and then not fully exploited, which is a shame given the inventiveness shown by Minority, the development team. It is difficult to explain in words, but the title skilfully manages to restore a world that really seems to be the fruit of a child's imagination, where a magical power is enclosed in a few strokes made with chalk, capable of materializing a staircase where before there was only one wall, stacking a dozen houses and then positioning them horizontally suspended over a precipice and thus building a bridge and much more that we leave you the pleasure of discovering. This imaginative force unfortunately collides with some technical problems probably dictated by the low budget, which ruin the platform phases with jumps that are anything but precise and some bugs that are not particularly insignificant but still annoying. Magic favelas The story told is tremendous, and for this reason Caballero has wrapped the themes in a fairytale-like, colorful visual context, capable of making us children again. Because the best way for a kid to face reality is to take refuge in fantasy, and Papo & Yo is just that, a journey through Quico's fantasy, up to the confrontation that unfortunately and inevitably will come with his own experience of the life of all days. The artistic work done by Minority is very respectable, supported by the Unreal Engine 3, even if technically unfortunately there are some defects. The sound sector is exceptional, in particular the music, original, enveloping and never out of context. Skilled composer Brian D'Oliveira accompanies the player with melodies that are neither too dramatic nor unnecessarily cheesy, but rather create a dreamlike atmosphere with latin-like guitar and rhythmic lines, simple harmonies and crescendos that underscore the approach to solving the puzzle. The game is not spoken, but the characters communicate in an incomprehensible language while comics summarize the concepts expressed. The intent, fully successful, was to tell without using words, just as done in one of the inspiring titles, namely ICO by Fumito Ueda.", "date": "2012-08-29", "grade": "8.5"}
