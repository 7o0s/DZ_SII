{"name": "Eroecottero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/154933-heroki-eroecottero.html", "text": "Although it was the debut title of the small and unknown Dutch team Picomy, Heroki on paper showed that it possessed the potential qualities of a proverbial mobile jewel: an excellent technical realization, an original concept, an intuitive control system and an amount of content to envy products sold at much higher prices. In short, there were all the conditions to ensure that the title produced by SEGA conquered audiences and critics, placing itself firmly in command of the rankings of the most downloaded video games from the App Store. Unfortunately, however, something must have gone wrong along the way... Two shovels like that The protagonist of the adventure is Heroki, a young inhabitant of the suspended village of Levantia, a place made up of many islets floating in the clouds where everyone moves by flying thanks to helicopter headgear. The proverbial quiet of this idyllic place is jeopardized by the sudden attack of the evil Dr. N. Forchin and his assistant Vapor: the two steal the Emerix, a powerful artifact placed to protect Levantia, and it will obviously be up to our hero chase after them to return things to their pristine state. A trivial story that couldn't be more trivial is made extremely tolerable by the excellent visual impact of the product, which we would not hesitate to define as one of the best things seen recently on the App Store. Developed on the proprietary Picon Engine, Heroki features colorful and detailed scenarios on which characters move with varied and well-crafted animations, all seasoned with very valuable light effects that do not affect one iota a frame rate that travels constantly at 60 frames per second. Also in terms of design, Heroki proves to have nothing to envy to much more famous productions: everything, from the look of the characters to the interface and menus, denotes a search for details that is not always easy to find in mobile scope. Having exhausted the enthusiasm motivated by such great aesthetic richness, however, it is sad to note that this is not accompanied by an equally valid play structure. Gorgeous to look at, Heroki proves too uninspiring to make his mark The main problem of Heroki is that it is simply a rather boring title, excessively biased towards a rather sterile exploration of the scenarios and devoid of that bite necessary to entice the player to move forward. In the levels offered by the Picomy title, you only have to move the fluttering protagonist by collecting the various (more or less hidden) collectible elements that are scattered around, with the only action component represented by the few and often harmless enemies that you can avoid or hit by throwing them on boxes. An underlying flatness that is also the result of the developers' initiative - commendable on paper - to guarantee a control system simple enough to be managed with a single finger: with the default settings, keeping pressure on the touchscreen moves Heroki in the desired direction, tapping under him makes him go into free fall while another tap is enough to collect the crates, which can then be launched with the slingshot movement made famous by Angry Birds. As is evident, the actions that can be carried out are few, and thanks to a level design unable to propose new solutions with the necessary frequency, the Picomy title soon ends up being decidedly monotonous. This is a defect which proves to be particularly serious when the product does not lend itself to being used in quick game sessions: Heroki's stages are quite extensive and it takes some time to complete them by collecting all the objects (a condition that at a certain point in the adventure proves necessary in order to continue), with the scarcity of checkpoints constituting a further obstacle to a hit and run consumption that would certainly have been more suitable for a title like this. What is certain is that, for those who are passionate about it, Heroki offers a much higher amount of content than the iOS average.", "date": "2015-08-20", "grade": "6.7"}
