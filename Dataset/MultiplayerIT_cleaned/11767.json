Haven Park's review is just yet another demonstration of this, one of those that are worth keeping in mind: it is in fact an indie now available on Nintendo Switch and on PC in which you play the role of a chick intent on managing the camping areas of a practically uninhabited island. Two distinct inheritances meet: that of the management software itself (albeit without too many pretensions); and that of the animals that live in contact with nature, already seen recently in Animal Crossing: New Horizons and above all in the very similar A Short Hike. In short, the idea is good, as are the intentions of one of the few developers who has worked on Haven Park, Fabien Weibel. We assess the situation. Plot: a weak thread Haven Park and its island It is certainly not the plot that constitutes the backbone of Haven Park, since the narrative premises are minimal; however, it is good that they exist, above all within a management system that then focuses on quite other elements. The game island, which also constitutes the only explorable environment, is really beautiful and luxuriant: nevertheless the ancient guardian is no longer able to keep an eye on it in every nook and cranny, because age advances for everyone. The task is thus handed over to Flint, who suddenly finds himself with a heavy commitment; or at least in this way it is perceived by the protagonist. What then, to be honest, Flint is not a young caretaker as you might imagine him: it is a chick forced to receive the inheritance of his grandmother, who we imagine to be somehow the ~owner ~ of the camping areas of the island. From now on it is precisely these areas that we will have to look after, trying to bring the island back to its former glory, enhancing it in such a way that more and more visitors (respecting the surrounding environment) are encouraged to come and visit it. The ultimate goal is therefore to obtain a real tourist destination of excellence. Gameplay: camping life Haven Park features different settings and climates From the gameplay point of view, Haven Park is a simple and unpretentious management system, evidently designed and suitable above all for the little ones. We immediately advise you, if you have something at the level of SimCity in mind, to aim decisively elsewhere: there is nothing complex or particularly intriguing in the possibilities of Fabien's title, because this is not his goal. Also keep in mind that about six hours are enough to do and see practically everything. In camping life, the main offer of the title is condensed, as well as its proposal to the players. Flint must move from one camping area to the next, one at a time, always starting from scratch and accommodating a certain number of visitors. It starts with placing a few tents, improving and restoring the objects present (bonfires, benches, garlands), enriching everything with some tempting proposals (why not add a barbecue or an ice cream truck?) until the guests are happy. And of course they will point out what is missing and what is already in abundance, it will be enough to listen to the speeches that are only apparently meaningless. Here is one of Haven Park's already well-equipped camping areas But don't expect who knows what task: usually the progression in the individual areas is very linear. If tents are already present, guests (cuddly pets like Flint) will ask for food; if there is food too, they will ask for decorations; if there are also decorations, they will invent something else. From time to time the editor expands the construction possibilities, and the individual objects are placed within a small (very small) area, where the player wishes. Resources and secrets Haven Park and its bird's-eye view There is at least one element that contributes to making the whole procedure a bit interesting, openly devoted to pure relaxation: this element lies in the resources. That is, you will not be able to build everything you like right away, because you will need some material to find around; this forces you to explore the island in all its extension. The main materials consist of fabric, stone and wood, but you will also find more. And you will also find the coins (or you can get them from the shops built at the campsites): the main currency of the game. All this helps to guarantee a certain air of ~depth~ to a title which, however, has little depth. The same goes for example for experience points: Flint even goes up therefleece by constructing certain buildings and pleasing visitors. But the unlocked skills aren't fundamental for progression, because around there is everything that can be used, and given that the ultimate goal is to relax and have fun, it can be achieved without ever opening one of the menus dedicated to these options. Does it really take a lot, for example, to jump higher than usual, just to reach completely useless areas of the map? Haven Park: here is an uninhabited area (for now) Disappointing without a few appeals are then the performance on Nintendo Switch, because we have noticed not only slowdowns, but also a general glance that can be defined in many ways, but certainly not ~cured~. To see, Haven Park is pleasant: but it is really strange that a game of this type, with its few pretensions, has not been optimized in a practically excellent way on Nintendo Switch. If you have to choose between the PC version and the one for the Nintendo console, we still recommend the latter: on the other hand, the portable mode certainly represents an additional value for a management system.", "date": "2021-08-17", "grade": "6.2"}
