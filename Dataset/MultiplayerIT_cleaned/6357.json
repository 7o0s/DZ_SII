{"name": "Arriva Mewtwo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/149336-super-smash-bros-bundle-collection-arriva-mewtwo.html", "text": "A few days ago we gave a positive review of the second downloadable set of Mario Kart 8, praising both the high level of the offer offered and, last but not least, the excellent quality/price ratio: an authentic rarity in a world where by now, alas Games are often born broken, waiting to be completed by downloading ~additional~ content. We also hoped that Mario Kart 8 could represent the Nintendo corporate line, but evidently this is not the case; at best, it may be indicative of how EAD feels about it. Overall, Iwata seems to have left free rein to the various employees in dealing with the DLC: see Monolith Soft and, more interestingly for us, Sakurai with Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. If the abundance of Mario Kart 8 is seemed to some, think about it, even anachronistic and naive, well, following the same procedure we could define the attitude of Super Smash Bros. pragmatic and current. There is worse around, of course: after all, Sakurai's fighting game was already published full of characters, modes and stages. So let's be clear, here we will criticize the DLCs, which however do not in any way affect the granite solidity of the original work; of DLC that includes a new fighter - the much sought after Mewtwo - and various new costumes for the Miis, all offered at a degrading supermarket price. I would like 90 kilos of pokmon, three shirts and yes, even a Majora mask. And an envelope, thank you! Costumes at the discount You may not like this list, yet we believe it necessary to show the difference in elegance - as well as quality - between this Super Smash Bros. DLC and that of Mario Kart 8. Who could argue, even rightly, that there would be other worse examples to refer to, we reply that the Kyoto company often adopts counter-current and autarkic policies on many issues, and that it seems more appropriate to compare these two brands rather than bothering other companies here. If in Mario Kart 8 with twelve Euros you get sixteen tracks and even a new engine for free, in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS the approach is more fragmented: as written before, the sensation is that of entering a discount store, with a flyer that indicates the offers and the various ~3x2~. Mewtwo is downloadable - like the other elements - from April 28th: those who registered the game in both the Nintendo 3DS edition and the Wii U edition by March 31st can have the pokmon for free. Otherwise, for a single platform it costs 3.99 Euros, 4.99 Euros for both. A single costume - shirt and/or headgear - for Mii costs 0.79 Euros, which reaches 1.19 Euros if you wish to purchase it for both consoles. It doesn't end there, of course; prices ending in ~9~ aside, now come the offers. The whole set of costumes costs 6.32 Euros, 9.52 in the all-inclusive edition. Overall, you can grab the entire first pack for 10.31 Euros, which we could define as the official price of this set; you wish it both on Nintendo 3DS and on Wii U, the figure reaches 14.51 Euros. Details and tacky prices aside, the real problem is that a large part of this pack doesn't have the slightest influence on the game mechanics: the Mii costumes are nice, but they don't increase or differentiate their abilities and as usual, as any customization, cannot be used online. Basically, only the appearance of the protagonists varies. Headwear is universal, while some costumes can only be applied to certain Miis (swordsmen, for example). Among the individual pieces we find the black T-shirt with the game's logo, and the disturbing Majora mask, which decontextualized seems less dangerous than usual. The complete costumes, however split between hats and clothes, include Link, Proto Man and Mega Man X from the Capcom saga of the same name, Dunban from Xenoblade Chronicles, and finally two animalistic monkey and cat sets. Mewtwo Far more interesting than the Mii costumes, needless to deny it, is the arrival of Mewtwo. Because the fans have requested it for years after the exclusion from the Wii episode, and sadistically Sakurai did not include it in the initial roster, but as the first, for some irresistible, DLC. This is the same character that many had loved in Super Smash Bros. Melee, but with some substantial differences. It wasn't a complete Bowser-style revamp, rather a re-tuning of the fighter's moves and stats. The most immediate and evident effect is the re-evaluation of some special shots, designed to stun the opponent, previously considered useless: now they are well integrated into the fight, especially during combos,and all thanks to a general speed up of Mewtwo. Which is not only faster, but also more powerful in its elegant and sudden fluctuation for the stage. Of the improvements that have managed to fit the character into the complex gears of the chapter for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, which however do not come alone: greater speed implies less weight, and therefore in this new edition the pokmon, as well as more powerful , it's also easier to knock out of the ring. He has become, in a nutshell, a more attacking character. And it can be used online like everyone else, even against those who have not purchased it. Unlike the original wrestlers, however, he has, at least at the moment, no other moves than those of the basic set: not that it makes any difference to the game on the net, however he is the first fighter to not offer alternatives in the customization of actions. We're talking about a very elegant and certainly well made character, sold at a rather high cost - just like the rest. Our impression is that it is not convenient to buy any of these DLCs, unless, and it is not a difficult hypothesis, you are passionate about the respective sagas: a speech that fully applies to Pokmon - we repeat, Mewtwo is really beautiful - and even more for the various Mii costumes, which have almost nothing to offer from a playful perspective.", "date": "2015-05-06", "grade": null}
