{"name": "Risk", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/risk.html", "text": "Risk (known in Italy as ~Risiko~) is a board game created by the French director Albert Lamorisse in the late 1950s and published by the then Parker Brothers. The package includes a board with a world map, divided into six continents and forty-two ~zones~, as well as a series of differently colored pawns which are entrusted to the various players. At the beginning of the game, each of the participants chooses a color and draws an ~objective card~, to be kept hidden, which will indicate which condition will be reached and which will have won. Very often, the objective to be achieved will be the conquest of certain territories or the destruction of a specific army. Players divide up the available pawns (which decrease in number as participants increase), then take turns placing them within the territories they have chosen as starting points. Following the same order, the attack and reinforcement phases are carried out: the first sees us move the troops towards an enemy territory adjacent to ours to conquer it, the second allows us to flesh out our armies by moving pawns from one area to another according to of necessities. The attack phase is carried out by rolling two six-sided dice, and the player who gets the highest score has the right to eliminate one of the opposing pieces, until the troops are completely eliminated and the territory conquered or until the attacking army he is not left with a single pawn available. At the beginning of each round, extra tokens are provided to all players, especially those who have managed to conquer at least one continent in its entirety. On mobile, Risk is presented in a form that is extremely faithful to the original, with the only difference being that the conquest of all territories is the only objective to be achieved in order to achieve victory. From the start screen you can try your hand at a quick game, with the multiplayer ~pass and play~ mode or with the ~conquer~ mode, which is the core of the new EA Mobile title. Once the number of participants, the level of difficulty and the color of our troops have been selected, we will therefore find ourselves placing the pawns on the territories from which we want to start, planning the attacks based on pure arithmetic: conquering a territory defended by a few troops is clearly preferable to going up against a huge army, because more pawns mean more dice rolls and therefore more chances of winning the battles. Just like in the historic boardgame, we will have to take care of our attack and reinforcement phases to then observe what our opponents are doing, even if in this case we can press the left function key to skip the scene. At the end of each round we will be shown the world map to assess the situation. The controls are very simple, as could be expected: you have to use the d-pad to move your selection and the 5 key to confirm or, during battles, to roll the dice. Moving on to a purely technical discourse, there isn't much to say: we are faced with the videogame reduction of a board game, a reduction well done as regards the interface but absolutely devoid of frills and touches of class. In short, what we see on the screen is functional to the action and nothing more. The artificial intelligence of the opponents, which really matters a lot in such a product, appears well cared for and no particular blunders are noticed. It is a pity that the game is very heavy to handle for mobile, with frequent and annoying loading. PRO Very faithful to the original The strategist par excellence Fascinating as usual AGAINST Functional graphics to the action, nothing more Very long and slow games No extra modes", "date": "2009-02-13", "grade": "S.V."}
