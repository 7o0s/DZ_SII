This basically thanks to the fact that the game created by Bossa Studios, despite the title may suggest a realistic approach to the subject, is actually the most over the top and far from rigorous medical practice imaginable. Although crime news often tells us chilling stories about public and private health, here we are really on another level. In fact, imagine finding yourself, in the role of the surgeon, in front of an operating table with the poor victim ready to undergo an operation, perhaps a heart transplant. The room is ready, the instruments are all available. There's only one problem: you have no idea how to proceed, and the damn hands are completely out of control... The Cheerful Surgeon in splatter version is called Surgeon Simulator. Ready to operate? Surgeon Simulator is therefore essentially an improbable, crazy and unmanageable tour through five surgical operations that no one would want to undergo. The first ~mission~, and we start off strong right away, is to perform a heart transplant. OK perfect. First step, crack the ribs with a hammer and remove the ribcage. Second step, tear off the lungs and place them comfortably on the coffee table. Thirdly, remove the esophagus, sever the veins and arteries of the heart, remove it from its lodging, and place the replacement organ as it comes. Mission accomplished, someone else will take care of closing and sewing (maybe). The cornerstone of the concept lies, in addition to the incredibly splatter approach, in the presence of a deliberately complex, imprecise and irritating control system, made on purpose to put a spanner in the works to the player's plans and projects. Because perhaps the latter, driven by compassion and empathy towards the poor man lying on the couch, would really like to try to behave like a good doctor and solve the patient's health problems. But succeeding is simply impossible, which is why Surgeon Simulator is definitely more suitable for cynicistic players attracted by the absolutely over the top humor of Bossa Studios. An absolutely fundamental type of attitude to be able to accept the ~defects~ of the game, capable of being really frustrating. We were talking about the imprecise control system, but perhaps this is an understatement: whatever tool you decide to hold, whether it's a scalpel or a syringe or a hammer and so on, it's simply impossible to be able to use it correctly and effectively. In fact, the physics is so ~light~ and the management of the tools of the trade so approximate as to transform even making a simple injection into an effort. Let me be clear, this is an absolutely deliberate and conscious design choice: with a more precise and rigorous interface, Surgeon Simulator would not have achieved even a fraction of the popularity it has instead achieved. Precisely for this reason, however, it should be emphasized that it is an experience to be faced with an absolutely conscious approach, or with the desire to experiment and have fun without thinking too much about the result. Also because the poor guy's blood level and heartbeat must be kept in constant sight, in order not to run into one of the very frequent game overs that force him to start all over again. In the iPad version, compared to the original one, it was decided to eliminate the surgeon's arms from the view, thus freeing the view and allowing objects to be manipulated directly through the touch screen: a tap to grip something or interact with switches and the like, another with the second finger to ~aim,~ and then swipe away. Even considering the efforts (?) of the programmers in an attempt to keep the formula of the original intact even on tablets, the feeling is that things work much better on PC, where things remain on a greater balance between fun and frustration . The technical component, on the other hand, is intact, which in any case certainly cannot count on a particular complexity. Finally, the presence of two extra operations with respect to the predecessor should be noted, specifically the transplant of eyes and teeth.", "date": "2014-04-02", "grade": "7.0"}
