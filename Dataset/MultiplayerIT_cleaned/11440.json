The series was born in 1995 on the Amiga, with a first episode that was developed for no less than a competition organized by Amiga Format magazine. Placed to the attention of the famous Team 17, it was published and met with incredible success, so much so that soon the conversions for PC and for all home gaming systems arrived, without exception. For those unfamiliar with it, it is a turn-based strategy game in which you control a variable number of worms in ever-changing stages, with the aim of completely eliminating the opposing team. Among the peculiarities of the first episode, it is worth remembering the numerous quotes from the videogames in vogue at the time, for example the worm who performed the dragon punch or the fireball like Ryu in Street Fighter 2. Over the years the series has been able to renew itself, keeping the basic mechanics intact but switching from 2D to 3D graphics. On mobile, then, the success was immediate and by now the episodes available are very numerous: thanks to a structure that goes very well with the concept of mobile gaming, with self-contained stages that can be resumed as soon as you have a few minutes available . With Worms 2008, THQ Wireless continues the renewal work begun last year, when it brought the series to levels comparable to those seen on dedicated gaming systems in terms of number of weapons and depth in general. Leading a group of worms made up of a maximum of four elements, this time we will not find ourselves fighting in exotic locations on our planet, but in space, on the most diverse planets in terms of appearance and climatic conditions. As per tradition, this does not simply translate into an aesthetic factor, but has profound repercussions on the gameplay: the weapons we use, above all rockets and grenades, use a propulsion system that takes into account the force of gravity and the displacement of the 'air. Shooting without paying attention to these factors often results in a suicide attempt, with the bullet coming back and hitting our worm instead of the opposing team's. For the rest, the mechanics are the ones that fans of the series know well: by taking turns, with a time limit available for movement, we will have to move a member of the team each time and possibly launch an attack against the enemy. The control system is immediately simple and immediate, with the joystick that allows us to move left or right at the same time and activate a viewfinder that rotates around the worm by pressing up or down. The 5 key is used to load the shot and release it, while the 7 and 9 keys are used respectively to perform a frontal jump or a back flip (often even more effective, given the impervious nature of the locations). There really is a large number of weapons available and the difficulty level seems to be managed in the best way, with the first few games running smoothly and the opponents becoming more and more cunning and determined. To add a pinch of variety there is also an interlude minigame when you go from one planet to another, in which you have to do some anti-aircraft fire to prevent the enemy's missiles from reaching your position. On a technical level, the game rests on already well-established foundations: the worms are always nice, with essential but effective animation, and they move within scenarios where colors are the masters. In fact, it is precisely the different shades that strongly characterize each stage, which usually develops on two levels (one in the foreground, completely interactable, and one in the background). Physics management is the usual, just get used to it to launch precise and devastating attacks, while the sound boasts an excellent mix of music and sound effects. Lastly, the control system stands out not only for the organization of controls, but also for an always immediate and precise response to inputs. PRO Nice graphics and very well colored Tried-and-tested play structure Excellent control system AGAINST For better or worse, it's always the same game Basically repetitive Multiplayer on the same mobile", "date": "2008-05-06", "grade": "S.V."}
