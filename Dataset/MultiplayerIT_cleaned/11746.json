{"name": "CSI: Dark Motives - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/csi-dark-motives-recensione.html", "text": "With the advent of the new gaming technologies proposed by Nintendo in recent years, it happens more and more often to see things on television or simply around the street and think ~here, this would be perfect to play with the stylus~ or ~this thing would be very fun interfaced with a Wiimote~. One of the TV series that has probably lent itself more to this series of digressions is CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, the concept of the show is quite linear: there is a dead man, evidence to collect and a guilty person to be put behind bars. all under the banner of science and the indissolubility of evidence. Over the years CSI has actually become a video game, unfortunately far from the shores offered by Nintendo, or at least until this year, in which CSI: Dark Motives was released in November, the portable version of the game that appeared on PCs for more than a few years does. Will this portable CSI manage to live up to the expectations of fans of the series and those looking for a good detective adventure? Arm yourself with a stylus, there's no other way to find out... Who are you Like its television counterpart, the structure of the story follows in all respects any episode of CSI (whether it's Las Vegas, Miami or New York, it doesn't matter, the characters change but not the concept): the player, new signing of the team headed by the grizzled Gil Grissom, he is the absolute protagonist of five different cases with the common constant of a criminal to be framed. The first day of work Gil Grissom introduces the player to the entire CSI team, describing salient character traits and - very importantly - the primary task of each member; the tour inside the new offices ends in the laboratory, the real terminal and starting point for each analysis, the place where the tests are analysed, compared and found. Not even the time to familiarize yourself with all the tools offered by the game that detective Willows is assigned as supervisor for the first case of the game, a motorcycle accident involving a stuntman, evidently boycotted during a particularly dangerous exhibition. The first case is in fact the training gym for most of the tools in the game, the player has the task of interrogating those present and suspects, collecting evidence thanks to a sufficiently intuitive game interface, thoroughly examining the crime scene and then move one's steps towards the laboratory to obtain some more information. From the evidence in possession it is then possible to unlock new areas to be analyzed (if necessary, unlocked through a search warrant thanks to the infallible Jim Brass) and so on, taking up investigations, interrogations and evidence collection as head until you get to the overwhelming proof, to the squaring of the circle that sends the criminal on duty to jail. In any case, the player is supported by one of the CSI team experts, able to provide useful support if needed, always bearing in mind that for any additional help requested for a simpler resolution of the case, Gil Grissom at the end of the case will reserve a lower evaluation. The game takes full advantage of the stylus and touch screen to adapt to the game structure. The crime scenes and the settings visited are interactively 'navigable' at 360 (a bit like the virtual tours found on the websites of some well-known tourist resorts), thus allowing the player to have a precise idea of what the conformation of the place he is visiting and - if necessary - to hypothesize a possible guideline of the moments relating to the accident. The tests can be taken with a stylus and analyzed by selecting the appropriate tool from a long list: the tools are divided according to the action required by the test (taking impressions, collecting samples,...), and for each of these there is always only one way to be collected. The tests are indicated on the screen with a clearly visible green arrow (when the stylus passes over it) and in the same way the areas of the stage where it is possible to approach and observe more closely the elements that characterize the case are highlighted. Unfortunately if on paper everything seems to be represented in the best way, the reality of things is that this CSI: Dark Motives is a game that is not very linear, complex (more for reasons of misunderstandings in the use of the tests) and graphically much inferior to what are the best productions in terms of graphic adventures on Nintendo Ds. To negatively permeate the atmosphere of the game there is also a certain repetitiveness in the situations, which unfortunately does not play in favor of the experienceience of play, often frustrating in moving from location to location. Finally one of the potential strengths of the game - the movies of the series reproduced on the upper screen of the DS - turns out to be one of the worst things, due to the bad video compression that shows nothing but pixelated images and black holes. CSI: Dark Motives isn't a bad game, it's just not a DS game and it shows. The game structure born on PC has simply been adapted and reduced to make everything fit in the best way on the two screens of the Nintendo laptop. Unfortunately, the defects of the game and the lack of linearity of the whole remain unchanged, an element that inevitably collides with what is the desire and patience of the players. Worth noting is the good Italian translation, an element not to be ignored for a game of this kind. A good game for fans of the series, but for lovers of adventures - at the moment - on Ds you can find much better. Pros Good use of the license Numerous evidence analysis tools Completely in Italian Cons Poorly linear cases At times frustrating Simple porting of the PC version", "date": "2007-12-12", "grade": null}
