The title in question was born on PC, funded through Kickstarter, where it arrived already on the strength of a certain notoriety given the success of the initial chapter Nelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy! project at the time freeware and amateur, which at this point we will hardly see on mobile devices. Even with the inevitable limits of a title developed ~in the garage~ still clearly naive, the progenitor had already demonstrated the makings of Alasdair Beckett-King and his inclination for storytelling through adventure, and the potential was fully expressed in this second chapter that, thanks also to the collaboration with the publisher Application Systems, has managed to pack a complete graphic adventure in every sector, perhaps a little short but still perfectly within the more classic canon of the point and click genre. Nelly Cootalot is a pirate who has decided to stand up as a champion of birds, apparently, and for this reason she finds herself involved in a series of rather crazy situations. After the conclusion of the first chapter with the apparent defeat of the fearsome Baron Broadbeard, Nelly has returned to a more or less normal life, but could the reassuring and boring routine of a postboat employee never keep an indomitable spirit like hers at bay, with an eye patch? Absolutely not, and in fact the appearance of the spirit of Captain Barbarossa, her mentor, quickly distracts her from daily commitments to launch her into a new series of pirate adventures. Passionate about graphic adventures and iOS users? Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is for you! Birds for diabetics The matter is that Baron Barbalarga is far from defeated, and has set up a plan to take possession of the treasure of Barbarossa, of which it seems he is also a brother, in a twist worthy of George Lucas. Obviously within all this there are also birds, in this case a flock of partridges trained by the evil genius to carry out his machinations. In short, the story, as you will have understood, is not exactly endowed with great depth but it is played on a succession of strange and hilarious situations in which the immediacy of the dialogues and the charisma of the characters takes over the narrative substrate. Despite the humorous and caricatured atmosphere, the puzzles, in principle, are constructed in a rather logical way, and this on the one hand helps to make the solution always at hand, without breaking the thread of the conversation too much, but on the other hand another significantly lowers the level of challenge. Experienced adventurers will not find very stimulating puzzles, if they are used to the standards of classic titles or other productions more set on this canon, but having accepted this level of affordable challenge, Nelly's story flows away lightly and pleasantly, capturing us in its fairy-tale world up to the end. Despite the use of not very high-profile means, the aspect of the game inspires sympathy and charm in abundance, with this particular characterization that strongly recalls an illustrated book for children, however the humor that pervades it, apparently simple, hides different reading levels. The interface, derived directly from the PC one, makes good use of the touch screen and once again demonstrates how point-and-click adventures are a genre practically inherent to this type of device.", "date": "2017-02-23", "grade": "8.5"}
