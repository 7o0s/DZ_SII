So here we are trying not to set ourselves on fire and not to blow up entire cities, engaged in a race with ourselves to produce something beautiful, good and virtuous, even if it is very expensive. After all, as gamers, don't we spend hours shooting fireballs at the sky or on YouTube, hoping that they will make more and more spectacular barrels? Why not continue forever, but trying to give the spirit something to meditate on, on which to concentrate the fullness of the world's deep sigh, the very idea of infinity? This isn't Fireworks Simulator, but it might as well be just one more beer. Pure simulation Fireworks Simulator does exactly what it says: it simulates fireworks. More precisely, it simulates their choreography, since there is no trace of economic or other management in the title of Reality Twist. Let's anticipate the question: it has nothing to do with Fantavision for PlayStation 2, which was a puzzle game (remember it? It was one of the console's launch titles). The choreography editor looks like a video editing program The player must therefore choose one of the two included scenarios where to perform a fireworks display, then place the various batteries of fireworks available (there are no cost constraints) on barges, rotating them as needed. After the placement, which will determine the point from which the fires will explode, you can open the composer screen and decide the piece of music to use as background (there are two included, but you can import any music file from your library), then arrange the batteries in an editor very similar to a video editing application, to decide when to turn them on, synchronizing them with each other and with the music. The editor is divided into levels, in the manner of Adobe Premiere and similar to clarify, so as to allow the composition of contemporary launches knowing their duration at a glance. There is also the possibility of varying the shots on the show, in order to create a real video montage on the scene in search of maximum spectacularity. The color of each battery of fires can be identified at a glance (shown in the icon) and it is possible to have a quick preview of the effect it will produce (projected on a black background). The more enthusiasts will also have access to a drum editor that will allow them to compose their own, with the desired effects and colors. Having made all the decisions deemed necessary, all that remains is to start the show and watch. When it's finished, the game will give us an opinion on our work and allow us to save what we've done, perhaps to share it with friends or to record it and put it online. For the rest... there is no rest, in the sense that Fireworks Simulator is all here. Let the show begin!
