{"name": "SINoALICE", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sinoalice-recensione.html", "text": "Writing the SINoALICE review implies a compartmentalized reasoning, given that the new project directed by Yoko Taro for iOS and Android devices is characterized by two different souls. On the one hand we have the artistic component of the production, the one signed by the director of NiER: Automata, which shows us a tremendously fascinating lore, in which the characters of the most famous fairy tales are reworked in a dark and disturbing version to form the starting point for the events that are told in the game. In the magical world of the Library, controlled by the two puppets who welcome us once the application has started (entertaining us pleasantly even while we carry out the traditional preliminary update and joking if the download takes too long), the protagonists of the fairy tales must in fact fight to survive , aware that succeeding in this will imply the death of someone else. The downside is represented by the actual gameplay, which unfortunately turns out to be the most classic of gachas, not particularly linked to this specific aspect (the ~fishing~ of objects , in fact, which are actually distributed with a certain generosity from the beginning) but without depth and extremely repetitive in the mechanics. History As mentioned, the story of SINoALICE stands as a reinterpretation of classic fairy tales, it is no coincidence that at the beginning of the game we are asked which character we want to control between Alice, Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood and Pinocchio. However, these are very alternative versions of the figures we know, just think for example that Collodi's puppet in the game becomes a boy armed with a wooden stick that reproduces his original features, but is endowed with his own conscience and continually seeks the clash, blood. The fight for the survival of each of these characters takes place in the context of a campaign with eight paths and five chapters, each composed of ten battles, in turn divided mainly into three waves (apart from the fifth chapter, where they become four) with a final boss fight. Proceeding through the levels, the development of the protagonists is told with images and texts recited in Japanese: the atmosphere is not lacking, thanks to a solid interpretation and an absolutely splendid soundtrack. Gameplay After that, as mentioned, there is the actual gameplay, which if on the one hand does not reveal itself as dependent on the microtransactions and the gacha element as we feared it would be, on the contrary it appears more elastic and permissive than many other similar productions, on the other it does not it can certainly count on strategic mechanics of depth or in any case capable of guaranteeing a minimum of variety. The opposite is true: the typical dynamics of the genre are applied in a scholastic way by the in-game action of SINoALICE, with the inevitable ~materials~ ( fire, water, wind) to be considered to emphasize the effectiveness of the various weapons, drawn from the deck we created previously and which must be renewed from time to time using our character's action points. This type of approach, which naturally provides for the possibility of enhancing the various tools by spending the virtual currency and the loot collected up to that point, inevitably ends up creating a big balancing problem: maintaining the same enhanced character with which we arrived at the final chapters , playing the other courses turns out to be extremely trivial on the challenge front. It is a pity that there has not been a jolt of creativity in practice, because on the technical and above all artistic front SINoALICE boasts an excellent realization, with extraordinarily characterized characters, a good variety of monsters and, as mentioned, a splendid soundtrack, capable of creating a great atmosphere while we try not to get bored in the midst of battles that are always the same.", "date": "2020-07-08", "grade": "7.0"}
