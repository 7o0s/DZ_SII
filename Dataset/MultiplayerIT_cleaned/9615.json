This is due to the extraordinary similarity between the protagonist of the game and the terrible Jason Voorhees of the series ~Friday the 13th~, as well as the obvious references to the plot of ~La Casa~ (~The Evil Dead~) by Sam Raimi. Rick and Jennifer, a young couple of university students, find refuge in the West Mansion during a storm, a mansion nicknamed by the people ~Splatterhouse~ because of the crazy experiments that were conducted within its walls by the former owner, Doctor West. Inside the house, the two boys are attacked by demonic creatures who take Jennifer away and leave Rick dying. The blood from his wounds, which came into contact with an ancient Mayan mask, awakens a dark and powerful force that takes possession of his body, giving him superhuman strength but devouring his soul at the same time. If it will save his girlfriend, however, Rick is willing to pay the price. For the making of the remake, the plot has been enriched in many ways: Jennifer has to interview Dr. West for the school newspaper and is accompanied to the appointment by Rick, her boyfriend. However, the invitation to the West Mansion turns out to be a trap: the doctor has made a pact with the ancient gods described by Lovecraft in his writings, he is secretly collecting sacrificial victims to bring his deceased wife back to life and Jen's body will be the perfect container for his newfound soul. Rick is mortally wounded by some creatures, but his blood awakens the power of a sentient Mayan mask, who makes a pact with him: by wearing it, the boy will come back to life stronger than ever and will have the power to save Jen, but he he will pledge in exchange to satisfy the demon's thirst for blood. And blood, in Splatterhouse, will really flow in rivers. Ffffffffbummery! After a controversial first phase of development by BottleRocket, the game was entrusted by Namco Bandai to the internal team already responsible for the discreet Afro Samurai, which to complete the work made use of the collaboration of some of the programmers previously relieved of the task. The result is a title capable of taking us by surprise, which moves between the ups and downs of a sometimes crazy game design while boasting a large number of valuable elements. The art direction is excellent, and manages to have its say despite the scenarios being full of predetermined paths and invisible barriers. Once the mask is worn, the protagonist is transformed (in a violent way) into a sinewy monster full of muscles, perpetually forced to live with pain and capable of healing from wounds by feeding on the blood of his enemies. Rick's polygonal model is really well done, has an excellent set of animations and above all it can be ~detached~ on several levels: some opponents can tear off his flesh and expose his bones, others are even able to detach his arms, with obvious consequences also on a practical level. Fortunately, in addition to the classic energy bar, the character has an additional indicator which must be filled with the blood of his victims, and which allows him in the first instance to recover his strength even when he is in desperate conditions, as well as to draw on this source of power to perform a series of attack maneuvers as spectacular as they are effective. Furthermore, when the measure is full, by pressing the L2 backbone you can witness an additional transformation of Rick, which is then completely similar to the one seen in the third episode of the original series: the boy becomes even bigger and his bones expand, protruding from the flesh like sharp blades. In this condition, which lasts no more than a handful of seconds, the protagonist can virtually get the better of any opponent, without accusing the blows. The Devil's Mask We said earlier that Splatterhouse is a title capable of taking us by surprise, and the reason is obvious: playing at the intermediate difficulty level you will most likely not be able to pass the first battle with the creatures under Doctor West's orders unscathed. In fact, our opponents manage to inflict enormous damage on us, and we must quickly learn to use parrying and dodging (placed by default on the R2 backbone, an at least questionable choice) to survive their furious assaults. There is a great lack of effective combos: the classic ~quick attack, afast attack and slow attack~ in fact does not exist, and the ways to knock down enemies or drive them away are very few. The result is a continuous siege, from which it is urgent to escape quickly in order to then carry out one's attacks lucidly. By pressing the key Select accesses an upgrade menu that allows us, through the use of the experience points earned, to buy new moves, new combos, the very important improvement for the energy bar and the possibility of making weapons last up to 50 % more time than normal. The weapons, in fact: Rick will find spiked axes, cleavers, chainsaws, pipes and even shotguns along his way, all tools with a devastating and curiously realistic impact: the monsters will literally be sliced by our blows, continuing to drag themselves on the ground until to die in a pool of blood. And as we have said, there is an industrial quantity of blood in Splatterhouse: the ~fatalities~ that we can perform on weakened enemies, according to the classic rules of quick time events, see Rick tear off arms, crush heads or even perform a manual removal of the rectum, to the great amusement of the demon in his mask. In the twelve stages that make up the story we will meet all sorts of horrible creatures, we will have to solve simple puzzles based on the activation of switches and confront opponents of different physical strength, resistance and offensive capabilities. There will also be references to the original 1988 game, in the form of two-dimensional sections that stand out for the terrible frustration they are able to trigger, with their ~sudden deaths~ and the presence of at least wicked choices on the part of the developers. In its version for PlayStation 3, Splatterhouse does not require installation, but we would have really preferred otherwise in the face of loading times: it will happen, in some particularly complicated situations, to play only for a few seconds before incurring a ruthless game over. Well, to continue the game it will take from sixteen to twenty-two seconds ... to add insult to injury. It would be interesting to understand how the game behaves on Xbox 360, especially once installed on the hard disk. Playstation 3 trophies Also counting the platinum award, there are fifty-one unlockable trophies in Splatterhouse. As usual, to get bronze trophies you need to complete individual stages or eliminate a certain number of enemies, while for silver trophies you switch to multiple kills with a given attack. The gold trophies are finally conquered by completing the game, especially on the highest difficulty level (which in turn must be unlocked). Note that the PS3 version includes an exclusive extra mask. Involuntary blood donors The ~story~ mode is accompanied by six different ~survival arenas~ which, as the name suggests, offer us endless fights against ever more numerous waves of enemies. Even in this situation it is possible to collect extra objects, in this case a series of fragments that make up sexy photographs of Jennifer and the possibility of unlocking the three original episodes of Splatterhouse, present in the complete version and perfectly emulated. In the context of the technical realization, the sound sector certainly stands out, composed of rather pumped and engaging metal songs, accompanied by good effects and well-acted English dialogues (subtitled in Italian, although not always impeccably). As far as the graphics are concerned, in addition to the excellent work done for Rick's polygonal model and the effective use of cel shading, it must be said that the enemies' bestiary is extremely rich and imaginative, with gruesome and far from anonymous creatures: each monster has its own reason, both from an aesthetic and a practical point of view. The scenarios are also excellent, starting from the gloomy atmosphere of the West Mansion and then opening up to apocalyptic locations (just to mention once again ~La Casa~ by Raimi, the protagonist of Splatterhouse often ends up in space-time passages during the story), guaranteeing always an excellent artistic vein. Too bad for the aforementioned invisible barriers and for the lack of interactivity, which is rather sterile when proposed: destroying crates to find nothing inside returns very little satisfaction. The graphics engine used by the game takes advantage of the good old Havok, and beyond the excellent visual detail (see Rick's muscles, rendered very well) unfortunately it does not guarantee a frame rate up to par, with constant drops below the threshold of thirty frames per second (like InFamous, to be clear) in some really problematic situations.", "date": "2010-11-25", "grade": "7.5"}
