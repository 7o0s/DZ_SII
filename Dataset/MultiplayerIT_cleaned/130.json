{"name": "Need for Speed Carbon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/need-for-speed-carbon_a.html", "text": "Coal for the bad guys Introduced by a sufficiently tamarro menu and background music of the same tenor, Need for Speed Carbon puts the player in the role of a certain Jason without making the slightest effort to explain who he is and why he is in this context: you simply get to know of our trusted mechanic to then buy the first car and hit the road for apparently no reason. Not that racing games need a plot, for heaven's sake, but even a trivial justification of a mode called ~career~ could also be there. In any case, the path to follow in Need for Speed Carbon is slavishly classic: you face a race aiming for first place and you win money to spend on improvements for your car. These are divided into the categories engine, tyres, chassis and aesthetics: however, it doesn't take much to understand the absolute uselessness of the last three, with only the upgrade in terms of speed really counting on the track. Too bad that as soon as the engines are turned on, Need for Speed Carbon definitely doesn't live up to the name it bears. The game is characterized by a cubed and poorly defined 3D graphics, debased by a completely unfortunate color palette and by only two nocturnal settings (city and canyon) which reserve little or nothing for cosmetic pleasure. Although the product moves with a sufficient frame rate overall, the rough aspects of its technical realization are all too evident: over the distance the elements ~mix~ together in an indefinable tangle of polygons, the collision system is approximate to say the least, and so on. With a sensational ingenuity on the part of the programmers, then, every time an opponent is passed or reached, a sentence from the latter appears on the screen which for a couple of seconds completely blocks the vision of the road. Lastly, the sound is absent (unjustified), the contribution of which is limited to the aforementioned background music of the menu. As is evident, Need for Speed Carbon is a technically sub-standard product, which is also a shame considering how the gameplay of the EA title turns out to be not without potential. First of all, the control system is good: the acceleration of the car is automatic, while steering, braking, drifting and boost are managed directly by the user using as many keys. These last two functions are undoubtedly the ones that we find ourselves using more often: the sideslip must be exploited with impunity in every corner (since it also leads to a bonus in monetary terms), while the boost appears indispensable in disadvantaged situations, and during the game it can be enriched with parallel power-ups. Need for Speed Carbon would essentially be a pretty fun title, if it weren't debased by the previously described technical deficiencies: in terms of gameplay, these manifest themselves especially in the low AI of the opponents and in the already mentioned confusion of the distant elements of the scenario, which prevent, for example, the sighting of traffic on the road in time.
