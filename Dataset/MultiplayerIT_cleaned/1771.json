{"name": "Unreal 2: The Awakening", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unreal-2-the-awakening-2.html", "text": "The tailgate that kills A scene, reminiscent of the past, returns: a hatch ajar, with someone below (or behind? The quote is only sketchy!) screaming and being killed by ~something~. Something? The doubts dissolve soon enough, with a couple of passages of cinematic quality, which the splendid graphics help to make even more engaging. Commander on the bridge The Atlantis, the spaceship with which we will cross the galaxy of Unreal 2, will be our home, headquarters and more than once a godsend. The first time you go up to your new videogame home you will surely be struck by the details and the profound characterization of this ship: starting from the accurate docking animations of the dropship (the small shuttle you will use to reach the planets on which to carry out your missions ), continuing the visit through the corridors and rooms of the various crew members. You will probably be attracted like me by the characterization of the rooms, each reconstructed according to the characteristics of the crew member to which it is assigned, starting from the room of the engineer on board, perpetually messy and full of strange electronic devices, then moving on to that of the shapeshifting android Escori, pilot of the Atlantis, who tries to learn the language of his travel companions by watching vhs dating back to the twentieth century and using an improbable English course. The character present on our spaceship with whom we will find ourselves talking the most will be Aida, the mysterious girl who aroused a lot of curiosity from the first screenshots released by the developers: it will be her job to illustrate the missions to be performed, while it will be the job of the on-board engineer Isaak supply ourselves with weapons that are always different and suitably modified according to the use they will have to face on a mission. The communication system used to dialogue with companions or with other soldiers is similar to that of an RPG, naturally very simplified and whose greatest utility is to shorten conversation times or organize the soldiers with whom we will find ourselves interacting during the game. Dodge or not Dodge? At least one note must certainly be made to the Legend guys: the dodge, one of the symbolic features of the title, has been adapted... becoming a trivial jump, perhaps only slightly faster. This is understandable from a certain point of view, because the original dodge would have been a bit problematic on some rough terrain of the game, but it is certainly something that disappoints us, because little changes compared to a jump, if not Nothing. Ready for the massacre As in the best tradition of first-person shooters, the ~real~ game moments are represented by the more or less demanding firefights that we find ourselves facing along our way, and which naturally must be accompanied by a good arsenal capable of eliminating any possible threat to our Health Points. The weapons that we will have at our disposal at the beginning of the game will already be familiar to us, thanks to the tutorial that can be carried out during the introduction of the game, and will vary from the classic laser rifle to the more dangerous but less accurate grenade launcher. As the missions alternate, our arsenal will change, and the fire modes will be modified with a touch of sadistic satisfaction by our on-board engineer, to make them even more lethal. We will give a particular look to the flamethrower, an authentic jewel and visual show as regards the effect of the fire generated which certainly makes it the most realistic flamethrower made so far, whose only defect is that of having limited and short-lasting refills . Another of the novelties presented by Unreal 2 which may recall the artificial intelligence of the marines of Halo, is that of being able to organize small companies of soldiers, in order to garrison and defend the strategic points of the level, with the help of energy barriers and sentry gun freely positioned in the perimeter to be safeguarded. Perhaps the introduction of this new concept of gameplay has removed the space for those ~puzzles~ that the player found himself facing to continue in the course of the game: in fact you will hardly be stuck for a long time in a level, which actually contributes to make the game short-lived and too linear, as I will be able to deal with at a later time. Unreal discovers Alien I wanted to deepen this aspect of the game in as we cannot overlook the trend in vogue in recent years among the developers of subjective singleplayer odysseys, to insert elements covertly or in some cases explicitly connected with the xenomorphic saga which sees as the protagonist the fascinating and disturbing creature escaped from the china by H.R. giger. One cannot fail to notice how the dark, futuristic and claustrophobic style of this artist has also influenced many productions of the virtual world that we are used to interpreting in first person. There are several references in Unreal 2, starting from the Atlantis, whose model deeply recalls the appearance of the interstellar cargo carrier Nostromo, which was the backdrop to the first film of the series, to then move on to levels infested by genetically modified spiders (that come out of ~fucking walls~) whose life cycle closely resembles that of the cute little creature crushing skulls and unscrupulous mercenary armies reminiscent of megacorporations such as Weiland-Yutani. Unreal mentions Half-Life Depending on the points of view, this could be the point in favor or against the second chapter of Unreal: it really seems that the developers have taken the title of mother Valve as a reference, a title that willy-nilly more than four years ago set the new way to conceive the adventure alone. First there was Doom: kill everything in sight and pass the level. Then came Half-Life and even the FPS were equipped with a story worthy of a film, in which the protagonist was you and not your weapons or the enemies who fell to your feet. If there are many similarities between Unreal 2 and the Alien Saga, surely those that exist with Valve Software's long-lived masterpiece are a multitude. As you may have read in our previous preview, there are several levels with large areas and scripted sequences similar to those encountered in Half-Life: the reproduction of the generator that in Half-Life we had to climb by jumping on the various rotating elements is obvious, and which in Unreal 2 we will have to go back down instead. Simple but immersive In terms of simple difficulty, this game can be easily compared to a good book: a gameplay that is not too demanding, but certainly immersive and enriched by the spectacular nature of many environments. At higher difficulty levels, the tactical component assumes ever greater importance: the study of the best method of approaching a place or the choice of the most suitable weapon for a particular enemy, for example, represent an important component, perhaps even more than in the predecessor . Technology The introduction of the Unreal Tournament 2003 graphics engine allowed Legend's level designers to develop very detailed environments, with a very high geometric level (just think of the keyboards that can be found in Isaak's room on the Atlantis or the generator of the first game level where the polycount touches record values) and with the ability to view vast open spaces that outclass those already seen in action on the progenitor UT2k3. The use of DirectX 8.1 and the instructions for controlling the vertex and pixel shader units of the latest generation cards has also allowed the inclusion of a good number of environmental and particle effects that help to involve us more in the surrounding environment. Particular attention was given, as expected, to the models of the characters, cared for down to the smallest detail, even if I noticed a certain plasticity in the movements of the Atlantis crew, plasticity which is instead more suited to the soldiers who wear several quintals of armour. The animations of the first aliens we will meet are very reminiscent of the frenetic style of the first Unreal, complete with a dodge (lateral dodge) that will put your aim to the test. If the character models can be defined as excellent, the same cannot be said of the weapon models, still rather angular and with approximate skins that perhaps wanted to give a shabby look of a lived-in weapon, but which are rather grotesque instead. The HUD used to display your health status and the conditions of your arsenal on the screen is very essential and quite easy to read, although not immediate; the slots that contain the various weapons are divided into categories as it was for Half-Life and allow you to quickly choose the most suitable weapon for the case without getting lost in the midst of the vast paraphernalia. However, all this goodness comes at a price, in fact the graphics engine, weighed down by wider scenarios, many characters and environmental effects has more requisitesinimi higher than those of UT2003, as I could see on my machine (a Pentium 4 2.4 Ghz with 512 Mb of RAM and a Radeon 9700PRO) the frame rate with 1280x960 resolution and maximum details stands at an average of 55-60fps with peaks of 120 and 30, the slowdowns can be seen above all with the entry of some characters on the scene, making me think of a probable responsibility of the routines that manage the artificial intelligence, rather than an excess number of polygons to render. However, the game is always fluid and playable even with low frame rates, without forgetting the high scalability of the graphics engine. A small post scriptum for those who have this question: Unreal 2 does not have a multiplayer mode, this is only available by purchasing Unreal Tournament 2003 separately. Final thoughts Before closing I would like to make a note on the alleged battle that video games seem to virtually fight nowadays: graphics versus playability. At first, the problem didn't seem to me to exist, in fact the two things could coexist at the same time, they weren't mutually exclusive. Playing Unreal 2, however, the problem came back to me and this time in a more evident way: yes, the game is graphically impressive, even a plot and a game mode that is similar to Half-Life and Aliens Vs Predator 2 makes it a truly unmissable title... but it's short, and not short because I played it in one go to set the hourly record, actually I tried to keep it as long-lived as possible, but it wasn't enough. This is not due to the authors' lack of imagination or lack of commitment, on the contrary. The heavy level design work, to search for the most engaging architectures possible, has probably taken away the physical time for the creation of further levels: it is unthinkable to be able to churn out a product with such a graphic level and a longevity equal to that of the first Unreal or other more ~dated~ titles, without doubling the development time. Pros Cutting-edge graphics Interesting and fun gameplay Good localization Cons Too short and linear storyline Quite high hardware requirements A real Unreal The return of Unreal, anxiously awaited by the most ardent fans of pure singleplayer, will perhaps leave lovers of the first episode a little disoriented due to the total restyling not only in terms of graphics, but also in terms of gameplay (perhaps underestimated in this era of graphics cards that grind tens of millions of polygons and make more noise than a spinning washing machine). The lover of the old Unreal who once found himself facing hordes of fantastic beings in an equally psychedelic planet, will now have to deal with supersoldiers belonging to megacorporations as well as the usual aliens. Everything seems more based on a sci-fi world  la Aliens, rather than on the predominantly fantasy world of the first episode: a down-to-earth Unreal in short. It is no coincidence that I have mentioned the famous saga that totally or only partially inspired the majority of shooters with a sci-fi setting released in recent years, which in Unreal 2 is expressly mentioned in many game levels as we will see later. Now let's move on to action.", "date": "2003-02-06", "grade": null}
