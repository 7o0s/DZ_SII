In the East it is even considered almost on a par, at least as a ~guarantee mark~, of a FF, and can count on a large number of fans. Born on PC back in 1986, the series, with the conversion of the very first episode, Ancient Ys: Vanished Omens on the main consoles of the time, namely Nes, SEGA Master System and PC Engine has grown year after year, enjoying ever greater success , moving from one platform to another up to the present day and this latest chapter, ~The Ark of Napishtim~, which we already had the opportunity to play on Ps2 more than a year ago and which now makes its debut, converted, on the portable Playstation. In the world of Estreria, in the Canaan archipelago, a remote agglomeration of semi-unknown islets, the likeable red-haired swordsman, Adol Christin, embarks on a pirate ship owned by his friend Terra's father, together with the inseparable adventure companion, Dogi, to escape capture by some soldiers who had surprised them in a tavern. The two cronies thus decide to take advantage of the situation to go to the ~Vortex of Canaan~, where it is rumored that there are hidden treasures of inestimable value. But once they arrive on the spot, their ship is attacked by soldiers of the Romun empire and poor Adol, hit by a cannonball, is thrown into the sea ending up sucked into the huge marine Maelstrom which transports him to an ~other world~. , on a mysterious island inhabited by the Rehda tribe, whose appearance is characterized by long ears and the presence of a tail. Jump, punch, level up Ys is a traditional action-RPG and its game system does not differ at all from its predecessors or other similar products. Adol is the only character that you will be able to control throughout the adventure, and with his ~guide~ you will have to explore not excessively large areas, fighting the enemies visible on the screen in real time like a normal adventure, and perform a whole series of actions very similar to those that can be performed in a platform (jump, attack with the weapon provided by performing combos and air attacks, etc.) with the analog stick of the PSP, in order to overcome the various ~levels~ up to the boss fight on duty. By defeating the monsters you will earn experience points, money and items that you can use for the most varied purposes, such as Emel, a key substance, necessary to enhance the magical weapons that Adol will find during the adventure. In the game, in fact, there are three different types of swords, each of which is linked to a specific element that characterizes them (wind, lightning and fire), called ~Emelas Swords~. These weapons, in addition to allowing the execution of spectacular and effective magic, can be upgraded thanks to a level-up system which is based on the collection of the same elements that make up the swords on the battlefield. Each enemy killed leaves Emelas in place as well as other Items, and once the right amount of useful material has been recovered, it becomes possible to upgrade them. The dear, old, old style As for the technical aspect, nothing to complain about the conversion from Ps2 to PsP. Apart from some inevitable slight differences, the style of the original Ys 2D excellently reworked in a 3D key (we are talking about the scenarios) by the graphics for the Monolith, has been reported without problems on the Sony ~console~, thus managing to keep all those visual elements unchanged that make up scenarios and characters, very pleasant to look at and very colorful, even if not very detailed. In particular, the artworks that characterize the various characters and that appear in the dialogue boxes, as well as the enemies and the bosses at the end of the dungeon, are splendid. The same goes for the few key sequences made in anime style: beautiful and perfect for a game of this type. The audio sector, on the other hand, has ups and downs in this portable version: while the music is all in all well-made, old-style, the same as the original, the dubbing present in the Ps2 version has been unexpectedly eliminated. Conclusions Ys: The Ark of Napishtim is an action-RPG along the lines of Alundra, which will especially appeal to lovers of the so-called old school. However, an ideal title for retrogamers of the Sony portable console, looking for immediate fun and without excessive frills, even if it must be emphasized that compared to the home counterpart, this version should first be well evaluated by the potential buyer, as it could prove to be partly disappointing due to two not indifferent problems: excessive frequenza and duration of loading between one scenario and another, and a save system not suitable for a PsP user. In our opinion, the very nature of these consoles is to allow us to play or do other things while traveling on trains, buses, perhaps on the way between home and work/school, etc., in short, to have fun in otherwise often boring moments. However, since the bus driver or the circumstances cannot allow us to complete a scenario between one stop and another, we need to have the possibility in a ~portable~ game to be able to save when we want. In Ys it is not possible, since the only way to save the position reached is at the completion of some scenario... Pros: Very fun to play. Very nice characters. Exclusive extra contents such as minigames and mediaplayers. Cons: There is no option to save whenever you want. Short lived. Uploads too slow. Zelda teach By suitably enhancing these weapons, our Pg will be able not only to do more damage to the enemies on the screen, but also to unleash increasingly devastating magical attacks. In fact, Ys TAoN has implemented a series of combos to be performed with the continuous or alternating pressure of the various controller keys. For example, by pressing the ~attack~ key immediately after the ~jump~ key, Adol can perform two types of aerial shots: if the attack is performed while the Pg is making an upward jump, we will have a ~rotating~ attack , while if it is performed after the leap (therefore in the descending phase, let's say so) we will have a downward ~cutting~ blow. Furthermore, as in the old Zelda titles, there are locations to be revisited several times as they need new special objects to allow Adol to reach initially inaccessible areas. And numerous dungeons. In The Ark of Napishtim they are the ones who dominate. In addition to increasing an otherwise not very high longevity, dungeons can offer the gamer in many cases some of the funniest battles of the whole game, as well as help to acquire many Exp points. At the end of each of them, in fact, there is a boss of level to face, and this phase, despite the limits imposed by the very structure of the Nihon Falcom title, which causes the enemies to attack according to predefined patterns, is characterized by a degree of difficulty and fun that should not be underestimated. From what you have read, you will certainly understand that it is a gameplay that is anything but complicated, but not for this boring or unsatisfactory, on the contrary. We would say that this simplicity of play allows Ys to be enjoyed to the fullest, offering great fun at least for a few hours.", "date": "2007-02-26", "grade": null}
