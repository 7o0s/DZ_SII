{"name": "Aeon Drive", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/aeon-drive-recensione.html", "text": "Jackelyne is a space ranger from another dimension. While she is trying to get home, she ends up crashing her spaceship in the middle of the city of Neo Barcelona. The local authorities don't take it well and imprison her without too many compliments. Unfortunately, the troubles do not end with the escape, because if Jackelyne wants to prevent the city from being destroyed and not being able to go home anymore, he will have to find the activation cores of his spaceship within thirty-second time loops. In short, he will have to run like crazy, without ever stopping to reflect on his life and without being able to ask anyone to cook him some tapas. It lasts the life of dimension travelers, as you will find out in the Aeon Drive review. Game mechanics In Aeon Drive is running wild Jackelyne is not completely unarmed in her mission: in addition to her agility, which allows her to take advantage of the walls to make large jumps and to slide along the narrowest passages, ours can count on a powerful sword, which kills every enemy on the spot , and on a particular dagger, which allows her to teleport. The latter is the key element of the entire gameplay, which is only apparently that of a traditional 2D platformer with a beautiful, but not wonderful, pixel art graphics, but which in reality is something completely different. But let's not rush too much, even if, given the game, it wouldn't be so wrong to do so. The objective of each of the maps of the ten scenarios in which Neo Barcellona is divided is to reach the end in the shortest possible time. Basically Jackelyne has thirty seconds to finish each level, which can be increased by collecting and using cores scattered around the scenarios. In any case, forget to stop and start collecting cores to take a look around, because the pace of the game is ultra-frantic and doesn't give you a moment to breathe, except in the breaks between one level and another. In her run, the protagonist will have to overcome laser barriers, rotating blades, angry robots, turrets and countless other dangers that will make her waste time or, if hit, make her start the mission again (one shot is enough to eliminate her). Once familiar with the control system, Aeon Drive becomes all about running wildly and throwing the knife everywhere to accelerate as much as possible. It soon becomes clear that the thirty seconds are even too much for what is the true nature of the game, which remains a normal pixel art platformer only on paper. Gameplay Jackelyne, the protagonist of the game Aeon Drive is all about speed. The game itself only makes sense if you conceive it in a competitive way and enjoy it as such, otherwise it becomes a bland and short platform game that doesn't have much to offer in terms of variety and quantity of content. The gameplay is not only to exploit the agility of the protagonist to get to the end of the current level, but to do it as quickly as possible to climb the positions of the global ranking, and then replay the same level infinite times by studying a path that allows you to touch the goal in an even shorter time. Really, only if it is conceived in this way then the title of 2Awesome Studio takes on a certain value and begins to circulate in the blood of the player, who ends up being almost obsessed with it, there are so many possibilities for improvement offered, between shortcuts, precision passages and the continuous improvement of character mastery, which prompts you to attempt the unthinkable when you have arrived at a near perfect knowledge of a level. The rest is completely irrelevant: the story and the scenario are simple pretexts that form the backdrop for the action and give the race a context. Not for nothing is it easy to forget the narrative side, especially when you are hopelessly involved in the action. There are many obstacles to overcome Having said this, it shouldn't surprise you that all the game modes have been designed in a competitive key, starting from the campaign which is linked to global rankings and which can be played alone or cooperatively (up to four players, with the screen expands dramatically when necessary to keep all characters on the game screen at all times). If desired, it is possible to play online, comparing oneself directly with other players. The only concession to exploration for its own sake is the presence of collectibles scattered around the maps, which can make it interesting to go to previously unvisited places, regardless of the final time (which becomes secondary for once). Not that you have much room to find the extras, but this possibility will certainly give a few more hours of play to the completists.", "date": "2021-09-30", "grade": "7.0"}
