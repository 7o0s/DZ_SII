SEGA Presents: Touch Darts -this is the name of the game- is nothing more than a darts simulator from a small English developer (probably the real motherland of this game), which mixes a cartoony and colorful graphic style with a both intuitive and technical. The main mode of the game is obviously dedicated to the darts world championship: by building your own virtual alter-ego by choosing the name, face and type of dart, you begin your career as a thrower from the lowest category -rookie, beginner- within typically home settings and without public such as bedrooms and cellar rooms. As opponents are beaten and steps towards professionalism are made, the player is given the opportunity to take part in national and world level competitions in renowned venues which, thanks to a convincing soundtrack, allow the player to feeling part of the challenge, with shouts of shouts, phrases of approval and applause in the case of particularly successful shots. The game rules of the championship are the classic ones linked to the world of darts with competitions of 301 (beginner) or 501 (professional); the player challenges his opponent to score, throwing darts and climbing the points obtained from the maximum remaining. To make it even simpler, the two players start from a maximum score (301 or 501) and as they score points these are subtracted from the total, the first to reach zero wins a round. Getting to win the game, however, is not as simple as it seems, because the player's obligation is to reach a split score of zero by throwing all his darts, and moreover by using the external double-score band to do so. However, to continue in one's career and make great strides towards professionalism, the first obstacle is represented by one of the two macro defects of the game: the AI of the opponents. As you may have guessed from the few lines above, being able to reach a precise 0 as a score is not an easy job at all, especially considering that you have to reach it with double score boxes, in addition to this type of ballistic difficulty, unfortunately, the fact must be added that the computer-controlled opponents, despite having a decidedly more relaxed pace (it will rarely happen that they start hitting a series of perfect hits in a row) have the innate ability to practically always get the decisive shots right, making the games sometimes frustrating and strongly ruled by luck. The art of flying The best thing about this Touch Dart, however, remains the control system which - albeit minimally - manages to emulate the tactile sensation linked to the launch of a dart very well. To make your throw on Ds you need to point the stylus at a particular part of the screen, slide the tip downwards loading the shot and release the dart making one last upward movement. The sum of the starting position, the load movement and the release thrust actually composes the final shot and its result. Due to the presence of a load and release trajectory, it is up to the player to throw darts with more force (and therefore basically straight) or with less power and a more parabolic trajectory. Obviously at the launch it will also be possible to give a direction (otherwise it would have been the least simulative darts game in the world). The modalities that complete the game are represented by a series of mini-games based on as many modalities of the real world of darts or simply based on some card games to be carried on anyway by throwing them. The multiplayer mode closes the circle which in fact represents the second macro defect of the game, not giving the player the possibility to play in wi-fi but only and only by 'spin' the DS from player to player and so until the end of the game . The art of flying The game, as previously mentioned, has a decidedly cartoonish graphic design, with a character style that closely resembles the one used by codemasters for its MicroMachines. The game screen during the matches is divided into three fundamental parts: in the upper left corner the declining score is indicated, in the upper right corner a television shows continuous replays of the best shots and obviously in the lower screen the game target is represented and used for throwing darts. Musically quite dull (repetitive music and very 16bit-style), Touch Darts saves itself above all for what concerns the related sectorto the sound effects, on some occasions really capable of making you feel like you are part of a glorious darts competition! Touch Darts is actually a surprise. With a good dose of technicality mixed with a decidedly captivating interface that doesn't take itself very seriously, this darts game far surpasses its other -semi-competitor present in 42 timeless classics, demonstrating once again that touch screen if used with precision and intelligence can easily represent an excellent springboard for sports and competitions not exactly born to be housewives. Unfortunately, the shortcomings in the multiplayer phase and the bad calibration of the difficulty in single player remain evident. Pros: The sensation of playing darts, there is Suitable and light graphic representation Definitely long-lived Cons: Bad calibration of the AI Music not always up to the situation Unjustified absence of Wi-fi If there is a sport (or rather a competition) that has probably always been the antithesis of the video game, it is certainly represented by the game of darts. As in practically every bar/pub in the world, the air when playing darts is heavy, brimming with the most varied aromas coming from the many pints of beer that hang over the tables of the participants; not too far the billiard table surrounded by a halo of smoke and the smell of chalk. As we said just before, the natural environment of the dartboard is the furthest thing from a comfortable living room equipped with a cabinet with display case and LCD attached to the wall. However, Sega wanted to make an attempt to be able to bring this pastime into the homes - or rather into the DS - of all gamers in the world, and you know what? They nailed it the first time!", "date": "2007-09-04", "grade": null}
