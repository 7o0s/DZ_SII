Solving many of the problems that had marred the still beautiful Battlefield 3 and 4, games that took months and months to work properly. Battlefield 1 may have been a superficial chapter, with its imbalances and killer snipers, but it was also the cleanest Battlefield ever, graphically and technically, from day one or almost. Battlefield V lacked the ecstasy of war and had a few more problems than its predecessor, but still nothing reminiscent of the dramatic dayones of the past. These improvements foreshadowed a great future: it would have been enough for DICE to get the formula right again and, in all probability, we would have had the best Battlefield ever: bad and deep again, plus it even worked. As we will try to explain to you throughout this Battlefield 2042 review, things didn't go quite as we had hoped. Dirty as war Specialists don't spoil the game as many feared, but their presence only really makes sense in the Hazard Zone mode This Battlefield 2042 is undoubtedly bad: it is the baddest and dirtiest, in the sense that it makes you feel the dust and blood between your teeth, for several years now. The graphics are also less focused than the previous two Battlefields, but it is clearly a desired effect, useful for giving the player an image stained by adrenaline, amplified by fear. And we admit that we like it, even if it will drive crazy those looking for a shooter that is anything but. On the other hand, everything is still to be understood on depth: weapons and means are so unbalanced, the aim is sometimes so inconsistent that, when things don't seem to go as they should, it's really difficult to understand where the problem is hidden. It would then be a problem among problems, just like that hovercraft that in the last game we saw climbing a vertical wall of a building and then mowing down two entire platoons from the roof. Amazon offer Battlefield 2042 - Playstation 4 69.99 62.99 See Offer There is still a lot, a lot to work on to bring out the enormous potential that Battlefield 2042 seems to have anyway. We also dreamed of the Battlefield of the future as perfectly functional and from this point of view the situation of Battlefield 2042 is not so dramatic: the problems are there, but at least you can play and considering everything it is not a foregone conclusion. The state of Battlefield 2042 surprises and embitters us because the game system deserves a very different shell, and frankly without a campaign mode to steal your time away, with Hazard Zone developed by another team, there are not many excuses left. Empty trenches Are you stuck in the middle of nowhere or are you looking for company? With the special menu you can have your robo-quadruped or an agile bulletproof jeep sent by air Plus what doesn't work, this time the trouble is what's missing, the many essential functions that have disappeared. All things we noticed along the way, impossible to discover during the official review session, such as the impossibility of changing teams, the absence of a voice chat, the lack of support for launching mouse and keyboard on nextgen consoles that now it's good to take for granted, especially in an FPS with crossplay mode (disabled by DICE after a day and currently still out of use). Even the usual statistics during and after the game are missing: the scoreboard is stupidly reduced to the bone, completely insufficient to understand how we are behaving in the ongoing battle. The menus are unclear, they make the most basic mistakes: there is not enough zoom on the map and sometimes it is difficult to come back to life in the right place, in some cases the ~cancel~ works like the ~continue~, you are not asked confirm if you press ~exit~ and in two situations we have involuntarily, with a clumsy click, abandoned the game. Some will say that Battlefield has always been like this, but that's not entirely true, and even if it were, it would be one more reason to complain, after all, in many cases it was enough to do what DICE had already done, take what was already there . We are talking about features already present in recent Battlefields and, mind you, those that we have long taken for granted in a high-budget, high-priced video game. 128 warriors We don't want to appear poisonous, yet we are sure we did. It is that thinking about Battlefield 2042 makes us want to play, but then all the reasons why it would be better to load another game come to mind. As always,as soon as you land on the battlefield you are overwhelmed by wonder, the maps are different than usual and then we'll talk about it, the graphics have undergone some changes, not all of them positive and that's true, but the glance is once again one of those that leave the sign. The 128 players naturally affect the gameplay, as well as the general atmosphere, the credibility of the conflict: dozens of soldiers flying over the hill, helicopter gunships flying low, tanks and jeeps in pursuit, real platoons making their way among the dunes, they help each other, push back and advance, disappear in the mist. And you're there in the front row, if you have a quick trigger, at a distance if accuracy is what sets you apart, or you're a doctor if you're poor at everything else. The important thing is the overall vision, rather than the performance of the individual; even if it doesn't seem like there's room for everyone in Battlefield, just understand a few simple rules and be smart in respawning. Sand and ice Portal is a bomb: the modes offered are already many and the old re-proposed maps are just as beautiful as we remembered them. Perhaps the most innovative aspect of Battlefield 2042, where we can find the most marked differences compared to the other games in the series, is in the level design. These new and huge maps, often characterized by large spaces that make mechanized infantry more important than ever, have been designed to give greater order to the action, and to work well enough with all the present modes. If the first objective can be said to have been achieved, the second does not seem to be. Extremely spectacular as always, Battlefield 2042's maps at the moment seem too extensive to guarantee the right pace for the conquest mode (but some might not mind and I am among them), and decidedly ill-calibrated for a breakthrough mode that allows the same opportunities victory for defenders and attackers. It is equally true that the user is still learning to play, things should improve, even if looking at what happens in the vast majority of matches in maps like Breakaway, without substantial changes it is difficult to happen. In Battlefield 3 the same maps had multiple versions, just to enhance each mode; here -probably- they should have done the same. In some cases, the Battlefield 2042 maps appear too flat, in the middle without unique structures, interesting covers. This is particularly visible in Renewal, the Egyptian map, very similar in structure to the old Caspian Border (here present in Portal mode) but much less interesting and dynamic, much less rich in details and changes of scenery, covers. Kaleidoscope is instead very suggestive, but much of the action takes place in a sort of Korean Central Park. Hourglass, Discarded and Manifest are currently the ones in which we found ourselves better, and where the choice to replace the dramatic events of the old ~Levolution~ with atmospheric cataclysms makes it better. Steal and run The hovercraft is a cursed vehicle: taking it down is tough also because it is extremely agile and fast. If you're not careful it puts you under in an instant and due to some bugs at the moment it's also able to climb some walls. Almost demonic stuff! There's one mode where every map works like a charm, and that's the new Hazard Zone. This sort of mini ~Escape for Tarkov~ seems to be made for the new maps of Battlefield 2042, even if it is more correct to say the exact opposite: it is the new maps that are built in this way precisely to make room for the Hazard Zone. The synergy between level design and Harzard Zone is in fact total: the length of the maps and the way in which their focal points are located allows movements that have the breath of an epic journey; here finally this persistent feeling of rarefaction that permeates the battlefields of Battlefield 2042 really makes sense. In Hazard Zone, where you have to contend with other rival teams for the satellite chips and the two extraction points that allow the final victory, it is also where the new ~specialists~ and their unique skills definitely find a place In Battlefield 2042, as you may know, the old class system has been replaced by more captivating specialists, each with two particular skills, an exclusive set of skins and whatever else it takes to push additional content. In the two classic modes, the specialists don't change things much, but it's still nice to choose the character that best suits the situation, returning to war with Sundance for his wingsuit or with Boris for his automatic turret. In a mode like Hazard Zone, where four soldiers have to work together so closely, these skills can change altogetherlmente the progress of a match. Dedicating so much importance to Hazard Zone was a courageous choice, a pity that even in this case the final finishing touch that makes the difference is missing. Specifically, Hazard Zone has no sense of progression and what is there is totally screwed; instead, specific rewards would be needed, anything to keep interest alive in a mode that seems to get the best out of Battle Royale, but without the Battle Royale rules that many have never liked. Hazard Zone deserves more. Camouflage magic portals The total destruction of the previous Battlefields is irreplaceable, but the extreme weather events present in Battlefield 2042 are no less. Couldn't you have both at the same time? And finally, here is Battlefield Portal, the magical portal where Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 1942 come back to life, with their unique rules and characteristics, or totally rearranged through the web editor with which it is even possible to create new modes from scratch, and in one click see them work within Battlefield 2042. Portal is already a success, the public seems to love this creative pot where the best Battlefields stand out from the past, moreover together with six unforgettable maps rebuilt here for the opportunity to make the most of the new technical possibilities. It should be noted that each map exploits the originally allowed levels of destruction: the Noshahr Canal antenna falls as you remember, and you can still make a clean sweep of Harica Harbor as in Bad Company 2. Many of the respective weapons and weapons return from these historical chapters most war vehicles. Returning to fight in 1942 in El Alamein, with this graphic, or flying over the slums of Valparaiso, in full ray tracing, is irresistible to say the least. And it's irresistible to browse through all the gamer inventions already available, often full of people zapping with the pad in search of the most outlandish and, in some cases, extraordinarily fun ideas. Portal is a mode that must survive within all upcoming Battlefields and considering its potential future growth, for some it could soon become worth the price of admission alone. Bullet in barrel A sandstorm engulfs the game map Hourglass, set in Qatar. It's also one of our favourites! Weapon in hand everything looks okay, hit registration is of good quality most of the time and the ballistics are top notch, with sublime and quite realistic bullet drop in range. There's a lot to balance out, however, from the bone-breaking .50 caliber to the SMGs that seem to dominate any short- to medium-range fight. The good thing is that at best Battlefield 2042 is just a good game, it excites you and it works, it performs well, it's just bloody messy in every aspect. The balance problems will be largely resolved, and we are sure that much will be changed and added over time, even to the point of making this Battlefield another great Battlefield to remember. 2042 has this type of potential, especially if the next maps move towards new dimensions, expanding a selection that at present is a bit too narrow and monotonous, to the point of limiting a gameplay that could instead afford everything. Naturally we are not referring to the maps of the old Battlefields present in Portal, tastefully chosen and renewed with love.", "date": "2021-11-16", "grade": "7.8"}
