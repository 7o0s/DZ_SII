However, this is not the place to make certain speeches, so it's better to focus on the subject of the article and tell you about how the Overkill Software guys took an intriguing idea like the one on which Payday: The Heist was based, in which a team of four robbers had to deal with six different types of hit, and they were able to improve it from (almost) all points of view. The reference is not only to numbers and quantity, although the thirty (they say) missions present in Payday 2 guarantee a much greater variety than in the first episode, also and above all due to their peculiarities (see those that take place over several days instead of just one). No, we're talking about a substantial renovation here, like in those TV shows where they take a dilapidated apartment and turn it into a high-class home; with the difference that here the apartment was already very nice and it was also cheap, now it's a f*super penthouse and the price is still quite low (29.99 on Steam). Welcome to my home In Payday 2 we find Dallas, Hoxton, Chains and Wolf, the characters of the first episode, grappling with a new, shrewd employer: Bain. Once the game has started, we are invited to discover our secret lair, an underground apartment that can only be accessed by moving the arms of a statue, equipped with security systems that monitor the surroundings and even a vault where we can store the money we get after each shot. The location is fundamentally dedicated to self-celebration, customization and practice, thanks to the target shooting templates and some paths to be tackled by picking locks. From a PC located in the central part of the hideout, you can access Crime.net, basically the Internet of criminals, present in both online and offline versions. We believe the difference is clear, but we'll explain it to you anyway: in the first case we will be able to access missions created by other players or by ourselves, in the second case we will play alone or by accepting that the CPU controls our snack companions. So let's open a nice parenthesis, let's remove the tooth and face the age-old question of artificial intelligence, which in Payday 2 is actually not very intelligent. Indeed, it is very little, and the serious thing is that it is a defect that Overkill Software carries with it, as it is, from the first episode. In practice it happens that, having left for a shot, our comrades remain chatting amiably outside the jewelry store that we should theoretically rob, without intervening. They don't help us collect the loot, much less they stoop to carry the heavy sacks of stolen goods towards the van which should then rescue us. They shoot well, it must be said, and firefights in their company are always fun, but they have no idea what is actually going on around them. In fact, if our character gets too many bullets and falls to the ground, the other members of the team go to help him, but without first eliminating any policemen a few meters away, with the result that they too remain on the ground, generating an ocean of frustration and a particularly painful game over (since your assets are confiscated). To this we must also add that artificial intelligence tends to ~disengage~, it starts shooting at everyone, it does not want to leave the scene of the crime (not even when you beg it on your knees, calling it loudly from the van); or sometimes it literally ~nails~ itself: for example, one of your companions stands still in front of a wall, completely passive, while everything and more happens around him. In short, we have news for you: if you want to buy Payday 2 to play it offline, avoid it. Parenthesis closed Well, if instead you have understood the definition of ~four-player co-op shooter~ and you have an internet connection (hardly so, if you want to buy the game on Steam...), you will be able to access the proper version of Crime.net and browse users' matches to join their team, or create a new contract yourself and take advantage of the role of host to fine-tune room access rules, for example limiting free entry and reserving space for friends. It is precisely together with ~trusted~ people, as with any product of this kind, that Payday 2 gives its bestit is and lets you discover its many facets. Indeed, to be honest, it is practically a must to enjoy a certain harmony with one's companions to successfully complete the missions at the highest degree of difficulty (ranging from ~normal~ to ~overkill~, and the prizes are multiplied both in terms of money and experience), as well as to venture into the arduous path of stealth. Why yes, it is possible to hit a bank without (almost) anyone discovering you, promptly silencing the guards and disabling the security systems in good time, then entering with guns blazing and tying up the employees so they don't raise the alarm, but the more articulated the shot is, the more complex it becomes to obtain this kind of result, so much so that often we have to settle for carrying out a portion of the stage in a ~silent~ way, to then put on the mask, take out the weapons and collect everything money as possible while ever more numerous and trained groups of policemen arrive on the spot to take you out. Payday 2 is a different shooter with lots of missions, skills, weapons and customizations Ok, but specifically? The skills and the arsenal constitute the real element of progression of Payday 2, which at least initially does not rattle off who knows how many different missions and instead remakes itself in the long run, making new types appear in the Crime.net interface, as if by magic suddenly. And let's see them, these missions, so we can get an idea. One of the first operations available is the theft in jewelry, which corresponds precisely to its description: you go to a chic shop, shout ~everyone on the ground!~, steal the jewels, wait for the arrival of the van and get away. Simple, isn't it? Then there are various types of bank robbery, which change according to the main objective: they can be simple money, they can be safe deposit boxes or even gold. Who knows what we'll find in that vault? The point is that it will take quite a while to open it and the policemen won't wait to break into the building, but we will be able to thin its ranks if necessary by climbing onto the roof and hitting them in a very dishonest way. We are criminals, after all. As mentioned at the beginning, operations lasting several days are the most articulated and complex ones, and which therefore provide greater satisfaction if we manage to complete them in the best way. In one of them we will have to recover a certain amount of methamphetamine (let's not miss anything), once we arrive on the spot, however, we will notice that there are only corpses to cook it and we will therefore have to remember how the protagonists of ~Breaking Bad~ managed to get those crystals so pure, without possibly blowing everything up. There is no shortage of ~caciarone~ situations, the ones that our meth expert Matteo Santicchia likes, such as when we are chased by the police and the only way to convince them to change their minds is to kill everyone, or at least try. What else? Ah, the punitive trip to the mall, where you have to rack up $50,000 in damages to convince the owner that maybe he should pay protection money. Better, more In the case of Payday 2 we cannot speak of a mere graphic upgrade compared to the first episode, because it would mean not doing full justice to the extraordinary work done by the developers. We are not dealing with the most spectacular PC shooter ever seen and there are some elements in the level design that needed to be done differently (how is it possible to still encounter invisible walls?, but we have gone from a ~console-centric~ production ~ to one that was born instead on a personal computer, and the difference is in practice ~generational~. In the sense that we also briefly tried the console version of the game (Xbox 360, for the record) and the technical downgrade was so evident as to be frightening, with an incredible drop in detail, in the quality of the surfaces and even in the animations of the policemen, which they moved jerkily. On the Windows platform, everything runs smoothly, the amount of options for adjusting the graphics is quite numerous and there is even a blocking factor for the frame rate, so as to avoid the increases and decreases that PC users are subject to. always used to. On the test configuration we blocked everything at 60 FPS without ever experiencing the slightest slowdown, so much so that probably even a 120 frame block would have worked with the same effectiveness, always keeping all the effects at maximum and the resolution at the traditional value of 1920x1080 pixels. What about sound? The music presses a lot on the bass, in some cases it flows right into the most vulgar ~tunz tunz~, even if the thing is justified by the fact of being in a disco. The effects are cconvincing, as well as the phrases that our characters shout at civilians when they have to stay down without saying a word, and for online communication you can choose between voice chat (if you play with the Xbox 360 controller, perfectly supported) and textual (if you play with mouse and keyboard, but this does not exclude any microphone).", "date": "2013-08-13", "grade": "8.3"}
