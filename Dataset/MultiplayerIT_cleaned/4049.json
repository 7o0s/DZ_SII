{"name": "Scribblenauts Mega Pack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scribblenauts-mega-pack-recensione-mega-pacchetto.html", "text": "If one day someone came along and asked us ~what was the video game that surprised you the most when it was released?~ the writer would answer without thinking twice ~damn, Scribblenauts~. A series that is no longer so young, given that its debut dates back to about ten years ago: the first chapter landed on Nintendo DS developed by the brilliant mind of 5th Cell. The idea that revolves around Scribblenauts has always been basically a : use the words of your own language to materialize the corresponding objects in the game world, thus solving a series of funny and imaginative situations. Here, ~imagination~ is probably the word that best describes Scribblenauts, together with ~brilliance~. So let's find out in our review what this Scribblenauts Mega Pack is that quietly arrives these days on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. Two adventures for the price of one Scribblenauts Mega Pack must have learned from the ~mistakes~ of the equally recent Scribblenauts Showdown, reviewed here: no more minigames, no more focusing on online and offline multiplayer, in short, back to the origins of the series. In fact, you may say, ~Scribblenauts disappears for years, and then two games come out within four months?~. This is not exactly the case, because Scribblenauts Mega Pack again has little or nothing: it is quite simply a super package containing two of the most successful episodes of the entire franchise, namely Scribblenauts Unlimited and Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure. It's a re-release that makes sense for several reasons: not only are they the high points of the series, but also the big absentees on current-gen consoles. If PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch have already received Scribblenauts Showdown, which takes up only the basic mechanics of the franchise, why shouldn't they have also welcomed the main, as well as the best, episodes on Maxwell's adventures? And this time you just can't turn up your nose on the contents: Scribblenauts Unlimited is a real little masterpiece, it hides secrets, collectibles, a fairly long-lived main adventure and many, but really many things to do pen and paper in hand. It was also the episode that laid the foundations for Maxwell's ~story~, telling his origins, showing his family members and his adventure to save his little sister imprisoned by a spell. But beyond the frame, it is the ideal starting point for learning the basic mechanics of Scribblenauts and the functioning of its few (but very valid) ideas. Maxwell has a magical notebook and globe that allows him to travel the world, visiting so many different and insanely featured worlds. The goal of the player (and Maxwell) is to help the funny characters of the levels to be... happy! Is there a kitten stuck in a tree? Notebook in hand, just write (or rather, type) the words ~electric saw~, ~ladder~, ~fireman~, trampoline~, and much more, for always different and amusing solutions to the same basic problem. The task is only one, that is to help those present, and thus solve the improbable puzzles and mini-games scattered along the way; in this way the Starites (the stars of happiness) or their fragments are obtained (ten fragments make up a Starite), and new levels are gradually unlocked. Scribblenauts Unlimited at the time added some features that later became essential and always re-proposed: the enrichment of adjectives to words, the customization of the avatar, larger puzzles organized in successive phases, larger worlds. The fundamental difference with the second proposed content, Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure, is that the latter is a title made under license from the DC world. Here Maxwell finds himself carrying out the same feats, but accompanied by DC heroes, busy fighting DC enemies, making objects clearly from DC appear on the screen, in short, it is all very DC. A spin-off that deserves a chance and that will simply make lovers of Batman, Superman, Joker and company go crazy with joy. Playstation 4 trophies Scribblenauts Mega Pack offers its players a sparkling Platinum Trophy, but it will take a while to get it: you have to complete all the levels of the two titles taken individually, unlock the various additional characters, materialize many, many words in Maxwell's shoes. However, the level of challenge is decidedly low, so obtaining all the trophies will simply be a matter of time. Winning gameplay, but there are a few problems Scribblenauts Mega Pack is generally a title that we recommend, if only because it includes the insupe insiderato Scribblenauts Unlimited, but this does not mean that the production does not suffer from a few too many problems. Let's put aside the brilliant ideas behind the franchise for a moment: those are not discussed. Do you remember where the Scribblenauts series was published so far? On Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U and PC. Have you ever wondered why? We tell you: among other things, for the possibility of using a stylus or a keyboard. Writing many, many words on the screen is not easy with a DualShock 4 in hand: to remedy the problem, the developers have introduced the Sunflower System already seen on Scribblenauts Showdown. The composition of the words is thus entrusted to wheels, each of which has four letters of the alphabet assigned to the four main keys of the controller. Skilled fingers, a little practice, and the automatic suggestion in the composition of words helps to realize the precise term we are thinking of in human times: but of course with direct typing using a stylus or a keyboard everything is more comfortable, fast and functional. There will also be a reason why the series was born on Nintendo DS and not on PlayStation 2. Patience, probably a better system than the one designed for Scribblenauts Showdown and Scribblenauts Mega Pack on fixed consoles does not currently exist, but the fact remains that the experience as a whole suffers a bit, especially for those who have enjoyed the franchise on other consoles in the past. For the rest, the optimization on PlayStation 4 seemed excellent to us, perhaps the graphic detail of the titles has also been improved, the fluidity and loading times are impeccable and there is also some bonus content, a handful of more levels, that never hurts.", "date": "2018-09-26", "grade": "7.5"}
