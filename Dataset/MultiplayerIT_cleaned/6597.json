When something works, both from a technical point of view and from a practical point of view (and the number of enthusiasts on iOS, Android and even Windows Phone bears witness to this), it is clear that we try to exploit it to the fullest, and that's exactly how it is that saturation is reached which then leads developers and users to migrate to other shores. However, The Witcher Battle Arena escapes this practice by choosing a different approach, which focuses on a much more ~synthetic~ experience than what multiplayer online battle arenas have accustomed us to. The matches with the title produced by CD Projekt RED are in fact short, lasting less than ten minutes, they do not have the usual hordes of minions to be knocked down or the towers to be destroyed with the aim of annihilating the opposing team's base camp, but a the only territorial mode (at least for the moment) in which two teams, each made up of three elements, have the task of capturing three monoliths and thus obtaining the points necessary to achieve victory. Of course, in reality the score does not increase but decreases: each team starts with 500 points and sees this value drop more or less rapidly based on the positions conquered, with the physical elimination of the opponents which therefore arises as an accessory element and not essential. CD Projekt RED offers its own vision of MOBAs, and so Geralt of Rivia also descends into the arena Let's do it soon The choices made for The Witcher Battle Arena are undoubtedly courageous and hide the desire to experience something different from the usual, a gameplay that can marry with the mobile context and with its reduced times, thus opening up to a more casual user than that who is willing to commit half an hour at a time with titles such as the aforementioned Vainglory or Fates Forever, Solstice Arena and so on. Furthermore, the freemium mechanisms appear anything but limiting, with a roster that currently has nine characters and which makes three free available, in rotation every week, but with the possibility of definitively buying warriors using the virtual currency, bestowed in a fairly generous way during matches. For example, during our tests the free characters were Zoltan, Golem and Eithne, but it was enough to play a few hours to get the credits needed to permanently unlock Geralt of Rivia. They also seem to lack ~pay to win~ logic, given that character maximization is relatively rapid and the bulk of progression takes place during single matches, as in any other MOBA: as time passes, the amount of gold increases and you can buy upgrades for attack or defense, or rings that improve both of these factors. As for the classes, we are limited to three types: warrior, archer and mage. Each has strengths and weaknesses, just as each individual character has three skills that are enhanced over the course of the games and which can make the difference in combat. Positioned on the left side of the screen, the icons responsible for activating them allow, for example, Eithne to capture enemies by making roots come out of the ground, launch a flaming arrow at them from above or a powerful charged shot, while instead Golem uses his mass to create devastating shockwaves, launch incandescent lapilli or trap opponents in an explosive vortex. Works? The lack of generously sized maps, minions and towers makes The Witcher Battle Arena experience very different from that of traditional MOBAs, certainly less oriented towards strategy and exploration, even if a minimum of organization in the team is necessary. obligation to be able to impose its territorial control. The number of characters at the moment is good and it is very important to be able to unlock them without necessarily having to dip into your wallet, but at the same time the only two scenarios and, above all, the only mode (although playable offline against the artificial intelligence , in online co-op against the CPU or in true three-on-three multiplayer) cut the legs of the long-term gameplay a bit. In short, the real risk is that you get tired of capturing the monoliths very quickly, lacking thicker alternatives, precisely those that could attract true fans of multiplayer online battle arena. And then there are some edges in the controls, which work RTS-style and therefore offer great immediacy, butthey do not provide sufficient precision when executing special moves, which therefore often fail. At the netcode and matchmaking level, things work fairly well, the matches are found quickly, there are many users and the episodes of lag do not appear particularly frequent. Finally, on the technical front, we have well-designed and animated characters, and substantially differentiated scenarios (after all, there are only two), but on the smartphone screen, the zoom is missing, which makes everything a little too ~small~. In short, given the choice, it is certainly better to play The Witcher Battle Arena on a tablet.", "date": "2015-01-31", "grade": "7.0"}
