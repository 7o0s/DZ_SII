{"name": "Ford Racing Evolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ford-racing-evolution.html", "text": "On the track! The game immediately appears immediate and direct. It is immediately evident that the will of the developers and probably of the Ford brand in general is to focus the player's attention on the great availability of vehicles present in this title. Just consider that, counting prototypes, vintage vehicles and absolute novelties, 32 different cars are listed, equipped with completely different characteristics. To these must then be added numerous other ~secret~ cars, unlockable by winning races and championships. The Quick Race mode immediately offers a biting taste of what the title is capable of offering. No selection menu, no choice of track or car, the game will choose for us, and we immediately get on the track to cause damage. In this way, the watchful eye can already grasp all the information necessary to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a game like this. The action is not long in coming, a short loading is enough to project us behind the wheel of the car. From the ~in-car~ view we immediately understand some very important things, such as the set-up of the car (lowered or raised like that of an off-road vehicle), a tap on the accelerator to hear the engine singing and a glance at the strictly customized engine for each vehicle, then, they will complete the initial inspection. Before even getting to the heart of the action, however, we can already appreciate some not entirely exciting details. First of all, the graphics are a bit lacking, and this immediately catches the eye. The car models are a bit poor in polygons, the light effects are not too realistic and certainly not even the setting, the theater of the race, makes a very good impression. To tell the truth, it really seems to have remained a little behind in time, which is certainly not very pleasant. But before jumping to hasty conclusions, it's worth starting the race and seeing how things turn out. Foot on the accelerator... The car starts roaring and we take the wheels off the starting line in no time at all. The smoke rising from the ground indicates that the hasty departure of the opponents is already putting us on the ropes. Immediately, controls in hand, the car tells us much more than we can imagine. By testing more cars, one immediately realizes how much they have tried to invest as much as possible in the physics of control and in the vehicle's response to maneuvers on the track. A tall car, set up on large shock absorbers, such as an off-road vehicle or a dune buggy, reacts more plastically to the lateral stresses produced by a steep curve compared to a sedan, which is less manageable. So as regards the response to the physical model of the world in which we move, nothing to object. On the other hand, some doubts arise at the first collision with another car or with a prop. The reaction to this type of collision is not always realistic, and the car, rather than a system made up of several parts, seems to react like a brick in the grip of the madness of some crazed hand determined to hurl it against a wall. The cars, one might say ~just as was to be expected~ do not show any signs of a collision, or dents of any kind. And this is another age-old problem that often afflicts titles of this kind (see also the very famous titles in the Gran Turismo series). In fact, many car manufacturers, while wishing to see their creations darting in some nice shiny video game, do not look favorably on the choice of making sure that they can be presented to the public all dented and half-destroyed. I personally believe that this is a serious lack of awareness of what a gamer in general wants to see in a good title: it is often about realism. After all, Ford Racing 2 also falls into the category of simulations, and therefore it should be clear that in a self-respecting simulation you have to go all the way. I will certainly not be the only one to argue that the maximum pleasure playing Collie McRae is seeing the bonnet of the car fly away due to too many stresses Give me more! The game modes are very often everything, and also in this case all the strength of the title lies precisely in the vast offer provided by the most varieddifferent game modes. The most classic of challenges is pleasantly accompanied by numerous other offers. The ~duel~ mode allows your car to compete directly with another on a track of your choice for a fixed number of laps. ~drafting~ introduces a pleasant variation to the usual competitions: it is a question of demonstrating one's ability to follow another car attached to its bumper. The adversary starts, on a track of his choice, with a certain advantage; the aim is to reach it and stay glued to its bumper for a certain (very short) period. A bar will indicate how much is left to complete the session, after which the opposing car, disappearing, will make way for another car which, having materialized a little further on, will constitute the new target. By choosing ~Racing Line~ instead we will be able to try one of the more classic training sessions as a professional driver, i.e. we will have to try to finish a track by always following the imaginary line (drawn on the track for the occasion) which indicates the best route to follow to set the best time ; I can assure you that it is something really tough, but absolutely worth trying (at least to realize how difficult it is!). The ~Time Trials~ shouldn't need any introduction, but we might as well remember that it is the very classic time trial, in which the aim is to beat the set result. Finally comes the ~Elimination~ mode which allows the player to enter a particular race, which excludes the cars in the last two places of the standings at each lap, relegating the task of establishing, in a duel at the last corner, to the last lap. which of the first two cars is the best (absolutely adrenaline-pumping). Before concluding it is worth mentioning the soundtrack, truly deserving and gritty; as often happens it alone is worth almost the price of the game itself. Checkered flag In conclusion, what does Ford Racing 2 Evolution offer to players? Well, first of all a huge fleet of cars, and of the most varied. The range is complete and includes all the series produced in recent years plus the prototypes, capable of guaranteeing a unique gaming experience. The tracks are well made and have quite a few settings. It goes from the rocky mountains, to the high speed circuit to a race in the middle of an upscale residential area. After all, the game modes do not leave much room for boredom, and the possibility of even racing with vintage cars and in tracks reserved for specific classes of cars will certainly not fail to add some spice to the game. Finally, the multiplayer, while not presenting substantial innovations, will certainly make every challenge more fun. Too bad for the graphics, definitely not up to the last titles seen in this period. In general, however, Ford Racing Evolution will not fail to give you good emotions and some pleasant moments of light-heartedness, and in the end video games are also for this. Pros: Lots of cars Great variety of game modes Numerous tracks and secret bonuses Cons: Poor graphics Cars don't take damage Response to crashes isn't always believable Ford is a name that has dominated the automotive sector since the dawn of time, or since the principles of the internal combustion engine began, at the beginning of the last century, to forcefully break into the international market. It is therefore legitimate that a large house like this wanted to present its own automotive title that would entice players of all ages by offering them the opportunity to experience, albeit virtually, the thrill of being behind the wheel of the team's top seeds. Retracing the history of the last 50 years of Ford motoring, this title will allow you to ride the glories of the past decades such as the F-100, the '56 pickup and the legendary '68 Mustang GT, passing through the most bizarre and innovative prototypes which reflect not only the grandeur of this brand, but also the perennial and constant desire to impose innovation and revolutionary design on the market.", "date": "2003-10-16", "grade": null}
