{"name": "Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kane-amp-lynch-dead-men-recensione.html", "text": "Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, directly from the darkest recesses of the minds of the guys at IO Interactive, makers of Hitman and the underrated Freedom Fighters, is a difficult and uncomfortable title to evaluate. Difficult because it's full of good ideas, unfortunately not always well done, uncomfortable because in these times of censorship and witch hunts, it's a game that does everything to be singled out as amoral and violent. Stuff to make any GTA pale. If Tommy Vercetti or Carl Johnson could be nice in their city raids, Kane & Lynch on the contrary are the classic anti-heroes, two shady sadistic and ruthless figures who in any other video game or film would have been perfect antagonists. There is nothing heroic about them, there is no possibility that a minimum of empathy towards the two hardened criminals will be triggered. In addition, they hate and loathe each other and do nothing to hide it: their continuous foul language is there to prove it. Remorseless killers and robbers, killing machines bent on slaughter with no regard for anyone. The beginning of the story is fulminant. The two find themselves, as perfect strangers, on the bus that takes them to death row when they are freed by a commando belonging to the gang called ~The Seven~. Kane, accused of stealing their money, will have a few days to bring it back to them, otherwise his family will be killed. As if that weren't enough, they are joined by Lynch, a drugged schizophrenic with slight self-control problems, to supervise him and help him in the impossible mission From now on everything that moves, especially if it wears a blue uniform and a star on its chest, is shot down without regard. You travel between California and Japan, assaulting banks, skyscrapers and even making your way into a crowded disco, all told by their voices and by interlude scenes created with the game engine, with an exquisitely cinematic cut. Covers in the open and aim lopsided Kane & Lynch's desire for cinema is expressed in a classic third-person action game, now the standard when you have an automatic rifle in hand. As in many illustrious predecessors, the whole game is a continuous movement between one cover and another, between an encirclement maneuver and the ordered fire on the companions, also thanks to the excellent level design that pushes not to jump head-on into the fray low, to advance with a rifle leveled towards the enemies. After the first minutes of the game, however, the imperfect realization of these mechanics is noticed, due to a series of serious critical issues that undermine the heart of the title. First of all, taking cover takes place automatically, ~just~ simply leaning against a wall to ensure a shield from enemy bullets. However, you don't always enter cover promptly, with the result of remaining in the open at the mercy of enemy fire. Compounding this is a problem when aiming accurately using the L2 button. Many times during a cover we continue to pierce the wall on which we are leaning rather than the policeman who is two meters in front of us. Even the artificial intelligence of the enemies does not help or indeed affects too much in the most agitated moments. If sometimes we see excellent concerted movements of the enemies, more often than not we see policemen who remain planted in the middle of the street shooting, or what is even more serious, who take cover leaving almost the whole body visible. Luckily the weapons in our possession, afflicted by the watering can syndrome, are decidedly inaccurate, or rather they are when they want it, with the result that while sometimes an enemy is shot down with a single pistol shot from 30 meters, more often it will be necessary to empty a clip on him, even at close range. Covers in the open and aim lopsided Furthermore, the simple commands that can be given to your companions using the front keys of the pad do not seem to have been implemented to perfection. We can simply order it to follow us, to take cover or to attack a certain target. You never get the impression of being the leader of the team, partly because the orders are ~maximum~, at the limit of tactical depth, partly because you only remember having them around when they get stuck somewhere, or when it is decided to use them as cannon fodder in the most agitated situations. In practice, they are only used to unlock checkpoints, to start the scripted parts of the action that need their presence. The shootings quickly become rather repetitive, bordering on monotony, and it becomes almost superfluous to try to coordinate one's companions, effectively leaving them agire on their own and taking care of them when necessary. On the other hand, the trick used to remedy the lack of the number of lives remaining on the screen is functional, and also in keeping with the decidedly strong tone of the game. After a number of shots taken, Kane goes down and everything fades to white, until Lynch, or one of his team, gives him a good shot of adrenaline. After three times, however, Kane will overdose, forcing us to reload the last autosave. Busy micettes and discos Even the graphic impact of the game is not without flaws. The polygonal construction of the characters and more generally also of the play areas does not shine for the quality of the construction. The excellent character design and the color palette chosen to give the game an apt realistic look clash with a general reconstruction unfortunately poor in detail. Furthermore, all that sampling of special effects that now represent the minimum wage in a modern production is missing. Explosions are emblematic of this situation: hand grenades leave a nice white puff, while hitting an armored car with an RPG gratifies the player with a faint flame with no sign of an explosion on the bodywork. The only graphic delicacy present is the only blurring of the view that occurs during the tear gas launches by the police forces. A small plus that tries to make the title stand up from the general cosmetic mediocrity is the almost complete destructibility of the environments, which serves as a graphic counterpart to the cover game during firefights. Stained glass, columns, balustrades, windows, everything can be punctured and destroyed by firearms. Too bad then that the policemen or the men of the gang of Seven let themselves be shot in balls like thrushes, showing their heads and legs in plain sight. Busy micettes and discos Comment Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is a title that if it had benefited from more time available for a refining and fine-tuning process could have become a small classic. The adult air of the narrative, the charisma of the two main protagonists, the variety of settings and the general excellent design of the levels fail to hide major structural problems. What is the heart of the title does not work, in fact heavily affecting the pillars on which the game mechanics are based. If we add to this a barely sufficient graphic quality and a short-lived single player campaign, a rather negative picture emerges. Unfortunately what was supposed to be a decidedly interesting production turns out to be a game that gets lost in the mass, which cannot compete with any of the heavyweights released in recent times. Only the two jailbirds remain, Kane and Lynch, two scoundrels who definitely deserve better treatment.
