Your only aim is to find plants, study them and thanks to the notes left scattered in the various shelters installed on this piece of land, pack a cure. Can such a concept be fun? The brothers Joe and Bob Johnson believed in it all the way and thanks to the support of the Steam community expressed through the Greenlight service, their project has finally seen the light these days. Sick and Cast Away In Miasmata you will play Robert Hughes, a scientist afflicted by a lethal disease. His only hope lies on a mysterious island, where a group of colleagues has settled and is conducting experiments exploiting the particular indigenous flora. Landed on the coast, it will take little to realize how something went horribly wrong: the scientists are dead and only a few traces of their studies remain, in the form of notes scattered throughout the territory. Your weapons will be a diary to take notes on, the different research stations, a map, watch, water bottle, lighter and compass. Miasmata is not an easy title to classify, the view is in first person, but you will never shoot, on the contrary, apart from a creature similar to a large tiger that will occasionally emerge from the darkest corners of the forest, you will find nothing against which to vent your anger. your violent disposition. The real enemy is the island itself, which will put your survival skills to the test. Miasmata is therefore a survival, not much horror, but not for this reason unable to keep the tension high and terrify the player. Late night walking through the forest equals one of the most terrifying experiences of the year. Lost the path, trying to recover the road to the refuge, lighting the way with one's lighter does not help in the slightest and a false step can represent certain death, falling to the ground from a height impossible for a sick protagonist to bear. In the IonFX title it is better to plan one's travels, get up early in the morning, consult one's notes and, following the map, head towards the area that scientists indicate as the host of the next plant needed to carry out our cure. This requires different elements, to be combined with each other, but it won't be the only ingredient that can be recreated in the laboratory. Flowers and mushrooms of various kinds, once found and placed under the microscope in the special huts equipped for research, can be used to synthesize various elements, from simple pills to keep fever under control, to tonics to temporarily increase Robert's abilities , up to syringes that can permanently increase one of the three parameters between Strength, Resistance and Perception. We must bear in mind that the protagonist of Miasmata is not a handsome young man, much less a professional soldier, so even a short run is already enough to exhaust him, while walking uphill means slowing down considerably. Conversely, going down a cliff can be a risky operation if not done slowly, trying to balance the tendency to slide downwards, so as not to pick up too much speed, risking tripping and crashing on the ground. Such a blow, or getting excessively tired for example by swimming in the water, increases the fever, forcing Robert to treat himself with medicine. It will not be necessary to worry about eating (a pity) but the water bottle will be kept full to drink frequently. Pursued by the Creature The survival of our alter ego will always hang by a thread, so saving at every possibility, represented by lanterns and candles to light, will be a useful practice given the lack of checkpoints. If that weren't enough to keep the tension high, the island is home to a rich and totally harmless fauna, as well as a mysterious and lethal creature. This sort of large feline will haunt Robert whenever it senses its presence, betrayed by the sound of a broken branch or a step too fast. The pulsations of the protagonist's heart will become audible and their rhythm will indicate the proximity of the creature. Direct confrontation is to be avoided, escape is better, even if it is not easy to lose the pursuer, while it is advisable to find a good hiding place where to wait for him to stop looking for us and move away. Miasmata can be scary, the real one. Badly planning an excursion and finding yourself in the heart of the forest in the late evening, while the sun disappears on the horizon, wrapped only in darkness which you can move around with only a lighter, creates an almost unique tension, without needing assorted monstrosities want our skin. Of against the creature, after the primeet me, will no longer inspire so much fear, revealing itself almost as a nuisance, due to an aesthetic aspect that is not particularly refined or disturbing and above all to an artificial intelligence that ~gets stuck~ too often. Too bad, because this feature would have been the icing on the cake for a hard and pure survival experience. I do everything myself From a technical point of view, the guys at IonFX wanted to do things big, packaging a brand new graphics engine, curiously very close to Valve's Source as a rendering style. The result is really positive, despite several elements underlining the independent and low-budget nature of the project. The forest is rendered on the screen with great care and richness of detail, filling the game world with leaves, trunks, roots, ferns, grasses, flowers and so on. The reproduction of the day-night cycle is also very convincing, thanks to a precise and atmospheric lighting system, complete with variable weather conditions and clouds that move in real time. The same goes for the water, with the sea surrounding the island reflecting the sunlight at sunset, turning red. On the other hand, the animals scattered around the game environment are modeled with few polygons, just as the arms of our alter ego do not excel. And the same is unfortunately true for the creature, which deserved more attention. From a technical point of view, the graphics engine is also not particularly optimized, capable of tiring performing systems although it is certainly not at the level of other productions, loading the elements on the screen with a certain delay and causing pop-ups of textures, shadows and various details. Little to complain about the sound component, with rarefied and quite spot on music (albeit not very original and distinctive) and discreet effects.", "date": "2012-12-21", "grade": "8.0"}
