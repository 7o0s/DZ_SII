Having left behind the ocher shape of Tallon IV, the very blonde Samus returns to hide her graces inside the legendary metal exoskeleton, called once again to the rescue of a handful of unfortunate soldiers of the Galactic Federation, missing during a military expedition on the planet Aether. Just enough time to locate the celestial body and trace the coordinates of the allies, and here is the shuttle penetrate the unstable purple atmosphere and make a crash landing. Outside the cockpit of the aircraft, jingles of order and acrobatic jump for the sake of tradition: let's begin. The first peek at the map gives a thrill to those who really loved Metroid Prime and its predecessors; at the sight of that small orange area which is the landing area, isolated in the three-dimensional void of the holographic map, one thinks of the immensity of the worlds explored on Tallon, of the arid semi-technological desolation of the Chozo Ruins, of the ivory frost of Phendrana, to the perennial thunderstorms of vegetated surfaces. Outside the cockpit of the aircraft, jingles of order and acrobatic jump for the sake of tradition: let's begin. Step into the Gravity Suit... again. Before Samus' eyes, which by natural empathy soon become ours, a new world is now opening up to explore, other atmospheres to breathe, epic battles to face. At the sight of the first tiny portion of the map, the hope is to deal with the incipit of an equally engaging adventure, the hope is to play a title capable of bringing new elements and developing ideas and proven game mechanics. Metroid Prime 2 Echoes reveals its potential little by little, it begins cautiously by introducing what will be the fulcrum of its structure: two worlds in one, a world in two dimensions, one the mimesis of the other. Two superimposed worlds in two parallel dimensions, dominated by Light and Darkness. The exploration therefore develops in new directions, it goes beyond the cardinal coordinates to embrace the space-time ones. In this way, a place and an ~other place~ coexist, accessible through the use of special interdimensional portals. The two superimposed dimensions have equal importance, they exist as a function of each other. What you see around you is not everything, and above all it is not enough to continue exploring the worlds. The adventure develops according to a challenging and rewarding crossing of actions carried out in one world to enjoy the reactions on the other. The exploration therefore develops in new directions, it goes beyond the cardinal coordinates to embrace the space-time ones. Step into the Gravity Suit... again. The possibilities for reaching an inaccessible area seem to multiply, and the player is invited to explore more roads, prompted to interrogate the map more frequently and with greater attention. The map itself, necessarily split in two, acquires an even more important role than what happened in Metroid Prime, especially if you decide to deactivate the hint system and rely on the fruits of your own reasoning (a highly recommended choice). We soon realize that the only way to get to grips with the occasional stasis situations is to switch between the light and dark map, observe the connections and position of the portals, grasp the solution in the small differences between the worlds represented. In a nutshell, the map is more than ever your first ally. [C] Evocative landscapes A portal to the world of Light Consulting the map is essential. of vital importance [/C] This of the two parallel dimensions is therefore the main novelty brought by the developers, to evolve MP2 with respect to the game that preceded it. And the result can be said to be centred. MP2 Echoes is more complex and more demanding: the structure of the levels, already exemplary and revolutionary in the prequel, reaches heights never reached by any 3D production. True admirers of the Metroid saga have something to lick their chops. Clearly MP2 also carries new suits, new weapons and new visors. In addition to this, in this new episode all the special devices of Samus' Gravity Suit have taken a greater role, and others have been resurrected from the 2D productions. The map is more than ever your first ally. Step into the Gravity Suit... again. The morphosphere now enjoys greater dignity, both in the exploration phase and in the offensive phase; different enemy creatures can be faced and defeated only thanks to the orb and its exclusive attacks. The same is true for the arachnosphere and, to a lesser extent, the hook ray. The ~metroid~ factor has skyrocketed consideringnally, the game offers countless things to do and solve, now standing, now rolling, now grappling. More than once you will find yourself playing for five or ten minutes along tunnels and magnetic rails, convoluted paths that will test your ability with the peculiarities of the mechanical suit, having fun even just to be able to take a simple missile expansion. The control layout has not undergone any changes, except for a target locking system that is slightly less sensitive to peripheral elements than the center of the viewfinder. The control of the morphosphere is simple and intuitive, also in reference to the innovations introduced. The already excellent jumping system is further highlighted by some sections of the game that wink at the platform genre. No problem even with the use of the hook ray, while the Vine attack, one of the new skills inherited from Super Metroid, requires a few minutes of practice. Ultimately we would like to say that the 3D transposition of the Metroid saga could not enjoy a better control system than this. The longevity of Metroid Prime 2 Echoes is out of the ordinary. There is talk of at least 30-35 hours of play (whatever the save timer says), overall of difficulty similar to Metroid Prime, but with less pronounced upward peaks. With some exceptions, the difficulty level of the various bosses, cross and delight of the previous episode, has in fact dropped significantly. In our opinion this is a reason for regret, but not everyone could feel the same way. Let me be clear, the duels are once again exciting, long and demanding but, one way or another, it is now easier to recover energy during the battle. Out of this world The atmosphere that made the Metroid saga unforgettable, that feeling of loneliness and perdition in an alien world, is also masterfully revived in this new chapter, with a darker and cursed meaning now. The visual impact offered by the game is remarkable: beyond the setting of the worlds and the chromatic choices, which can be appreciated or not in a completely subjective way, what appears objectively worthy is the care placed in the three-dimensional modeling of the environments. Simply manic. Opening a new door and accessing an unexplored area for the first time is always a reason for admiring amazement. Whether it's a barren desert landscape or a hyper-technological laboratory, the marvel is the same. Cracks in the rocks, small shrubs, stones and bricks, grates, plants and so on. And still metallic elements, stained glass, lights and sparks. Elaborate alien constructions rise majestically in the sky, real mechanical cathedrals and full-screen organic delirium: it goes without saying that the sense of gratification you feel by violating a virgin area is truly consistent and satisfying. The polygonal models of the enemies are sufficiently complex and well animated. Many of the beings that populate the worlds of Metroid constitute a dark reinterpretation of what was seen two years ago, a factor that could induce a feeling of dejavu in more than one person. Add to this a bouquet of sound effects that is almost unchanged, but still of excellent workmanship. The quality of the textures is certainly very good, new graphic effects have been implemented and the lack of bump mapping is not felt that much, well compensated by the aforementioned hyper-detail of the environments and by a fluidity that stands at the notorious 60fps. It is also true that in some situations later in the game, Retro Studios seem to have trodden their hand with detail, transparency and various graphic effects, with the consequence that the graphics engine in some circumstances shows the side with sporadically even marked slowdowns. However, these are isolated episodes that occur only in a few areas of the game and in circumstances of overcrowding with enemies. Overall, the graphics sector remains of undisputed quality. Entering an unexplored area for the first time is always a reason for admiring amazement. Out of this world On the audio side, the master Kenji Yamamoto, author of the stupendous soundtrack that accompanied Metroid Prime, once again manages to provide a coherent and atmospheric musical accompaniment throughout the adventure, although orphaned of songs capable of standing out for their evocative power. The brand new multiplayer mode deserves no more than a few closing remarks. Very banal and incapable of bringing any kind of fresh idea as a dowry, the option for multiple players ends up being an unsuccessful addition that was really not needed. In the presence of a counterparty ssingle player imposing and gluttonous, the choice to take the multiplayer path appears quite inexplicable, not so much for the historical roots of the Metroid brand as a solitary adventure, but rather for the way in which it was created. The usual arenas and VS game modes typical of any FPS. But FPS Metroid really has nothing, and just wanting to open up the ~Metroid~ experience to more players, why not try the way of cooperation? More complex, longer lasting, more reasoned, equally demanding and equally engaging. Compared to its illustrious predecessor, Metroid Prime 2 Echoes manages not to disfigure and indeed collects and intelligently develops the aspects that made the three-dimensional debut of the saga unforgettable. The idea of two parallel worlds has been developed ingeniously and pays off in terms of fun and increased complexity. From a purely playful point of view MP2 Echoes surpasses MP for many reasons: there is much more to do, the game offers new abilities and makes better use of those already present in the prequel. He can only regret arriving later. Even with some uncertainty in the frame rate, technically the title confirms its absolute value. A game that requires commitment and dedication to be completed, offering in return dozens and dozens of hours of exciting fun, touches of class and goodies that will amaze you. Together with Metroid Prime, it represents the cream of the toy library available on the Nintendo console. One of the best single player experiences ever. Pros Complex and challenging Commendable longevity Excellent graphics and audio Cons Occasional slowdowns Outdated multiplayer The Retro Studios, a software house in Austin, Texas, founded at the end of 1999 and made up, among others, by former ID, Valve and Iguana programmers, deserve special praise. Nintendo in 2000 entrusted them with a brand that risked being forgotten after missing the appointment with N64, and Retro Studios first invent a hybrid genre that fits them perfectly, then develop and enrich it, even managing to improve themselves. Skilled programmers, inspired art directors and above all custodians of the art of level design, Retro Studios deliver two wonderful titles to us gamers, and in the hands of Nintendo a reinvigorated brand of absolute appeal in a future key. Just two years after the release of the surprising Metroid Prime, Samus Aran once again takes on the role of the galactic bounty hunter, intent on writing a new chapter in her legendary story. Although Retro Studios' first work had been received by audiences and critics with more than justified bursts of enthusiasm, an aura of cautious prudence seemed to have fallen on Metroid Prime 2 Echoes; not everyone seemed ready to swear that this new episode of the glorious saga, daughter of Gunpei Yokoi, would soon rise to the status of Masterpiece for the same merits that had honored the prequel. Rightly or wrongly, the reasons that fueled this hesitation are soon explained: for the second time in this generation of consoles, Nintendo breaks a historical publishing tradition and decides to publish two titles of the same brand on GameCube, moreover at a distance quite close in time. The specters of wild sequelization hovered over MP2's rump, making the task of the Austin Texans even more difficult, called to repeat themselves on levels of excellence avoiding the danger of repetitiveness, and please excuse the pun.", "date": "2004-12-08", "grade": null}
