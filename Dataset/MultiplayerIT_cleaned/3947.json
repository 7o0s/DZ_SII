{"name": "Epic Seven", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/epic-seven-la-recensione.html", "text": "We have now learned well how oriental-inspired RPGs work on mobile platforms, also because they represent a real genre apart. The problem is that the mass production, which characterizes this market segment in particular, is also reflected in the minimal variations that the different titles of this type show at this point: it's not like moving within the rather wide confines of a videogame genre standard, in this case we are often faced with titles that follow the same canvas in an absolutely slavish way, without making any substantial variation. What can these games focus on then, if the gameplay is so predefined? On the construction of the game world, on the artistic work behind the graphic layout and on the characterization of the characters. On the other hand, to stimulate the gacha dynamic it is necessary at least to have a large and pleasing cast, possibly filled with ~waifu~ or charismatic characters. It is no coincidence that the games that manage to stand out in this genre come from very large caliber productions such as Fire Emblem Heroes and Dragalia Lost. In all of this, Epic Seven decides to focus above all on graphics to impress users and stand out from the mass of games that are in all respects similar. Indeed, Epic Seven is a game packaged with impressive care in every sector: leaving out the interface which, as per tradition for this type of title, is always rather complex and cumbersome, the extreme care in the realization shines through in the graphics at each level, from the scenarios to the characters up to the anime-style sequences that also abound during the clashes, making them particularly spectacular in this way. Fights and lottery The structure, we said, is typical of an oriental-style RPG with gacha elements and to get an idea of how it works we can refer you directly to the reviews of Brave Frontier, Knight Chronicle or the recent Grancrest War, just to mention the latest arrivals. because the basis is the same. It is a question of tackling quests which are essentially progressive clashes against waves of enemies up to an end-of-level boss, here with a minimal possibility of exploration given by the presence of some crossroads or portals towards alternative scenario elements but always channeled within a sequence of fights. In essence, we are witnessing narrative parts that take place through dialogues (or sometimes with animated interlude sequences) and battle phases where the combat takes place in turns, according to a typical JRPG approach. Also present here are the distinctive elements of the sub-genre such as elemental powers that determine power relationships (the classic rock-paper-scissors) a cross-bonus system depending on the party's disposition and obviously a complex management of the characters which is the real and own engine of the whole game. It must be said that the fights are really pleasant to look at and this is good, considering that grinding is a recurring element and auto-play becomes almost necessary in the long run, so at least it is possible to enjoy a good show. in particular with the 2D animations that fit perfectly with the standard graphics of the game during the special moves (which can be activated through the accumulation and expenditure of soul during the clashes) and give a remarkable dynamism to the scenes. As often happens in games that focus entirely on the continuous evolution of the characters, rather than resorting to any strategy, it is sufficient to simply constantly upgrade the protagonists to be successful and build the best possible party. This obviously includes the gacha dynamics of the summoning lottery, which by spending a certain amount of bookmarks (obviously also purchasable with real money) allow you to draw new more or less rare and powerful characters or artifacts to be used in the evolution of fighters and weapons. Also in this case, in short, we spend most of the time between the menus for the construction and evolution of the characters, which however turns out to be rather complex, with the need to use particular more or less rare and powerful materials on which to base the evolutions with obviously different effects.", "date": "2018-11-16", "grade": "7.5"}
