Even with ups and downs, the titles of the Japanese software house have continued to gather followers, with such a number of downloads as to push us to continue straight on the same path without particular innovations or upheavals. Pocket League Story arises precisely in the wake of this philosophy, which however within the borders of our peninsula still deserves greater interest given the subject matter: we are obviously talking about the national sport par excellence, football. The net swells Approaching Pocket League Story thinking of being faced with a kind of classic Football Manager would be a big mistake; on the contrary, knowing the previous productions of Kairosoft it is possible to understand the type of approach adopted by the Japanese game designers, evidently focused on some elements and instead much more superficial, if not incomplete, with others. Although the desire to find a compromise between accessibility and depth is clear, with a development that involves without intimidating the players, it is however obvious how Pocket League Story is ultimately a title unable to place itself on the same levels as the best Kairosoft games. The only setting, apart from that of the stadium during matches, is related to the training campus, in which various types of structures (markets, gyms, swimming pools, athletics tracks) can be purchased and upgraded; the key component remains linked to the need to collect - mainly through the above structures - points, divided into four categories: strength, tactics, idea, and hearts. These can then be spent on sponsorship research, special training management and fan development. In this sense, those who have had experience with the previous ~Stories~ will find both the organization of the objectives and that of the menus immediately familiar, not to mention the 8-bit graphic style. The biggest problem of Pocket League Story, however, is the enormous disparity between the managerial-economic component of the ~outline~, linear but all in all satisfactory, and that instead of the team and during the games; a heavy lack of balance, which mortifies the ambitions and potential of the game. During the matches, which among other things must necessarily be attended without the possibility of jumping to the final result, the player practically becomes a passive spectator, unable to act on anything except for the activation of the aura (a kind of momentary superpower) and the - rather unhelpful - attitude management of the team. The absolute absence of a lot of elements that characterize real football (fouls, free kicks, penalties, injuries, yellow cards and expulsions, added time, substitutions except at half time and so on) worsen the situation making the show soon decidedly boring and repetitive. Another disappointing factor is the management of the transfer market, with players of any quality level, including superstars, who can be signed simply by putting their hands on their wallet regardless of the quality of their team. And there is not even competition with other teams, since no one will disturb any negotiations in progress, nor will they make offers to their top players trying to snatch them from the club, nor will the players themselves or the coach ask for contract adjustments. There are so many, too many things that Pocket League Story is missing in order to be taken seriously in the long run, and in fact the fun soon ends as soon as you realize the extreme linearity of the progression, totally devoid of surprises, setbacks or problems to be solved. Once your team is consolidated, the challenge factor is completely missing, a decidedly unforgivable mistake for such a title.
