What emerges is a game in which we fight a lot (are we or are we not Yakuza of a higher rank?), with almost old-school dynamics, and we grind out kilometers on foot up and down the two cities of the game, spending long time collecting side missions, or dedicating himself to the everyday life of a quiet citizen of the Rising Sun, between ramen, arcades, karaoke, ufo catcher, colossal hangovers, gambling and more generally dozens of other things to Do. All but one though. The story, the real strength of the game, tells us the story of the Dragon of the Dojima, Kazuma Kiryu who decided to make a change in his life, abandoning his family and retiring to Okinawa to open an orphanage. Everyday life The starting point and the development of the first hours of the game is almost like a Neapolitan drama, all too melodramatic. Kazuma, or rather Uncle Kaz as the nine children of the orphanage by the sea call him, is all busy raising the orphans, between the preparation of lunches and dinners, episodes of bullying, daily shopping and small love affairs. It would seem an idyllic picture, and the sunsets by the ocean are, pity that the land where the orphanage is located is targeted by a small local mafia family, which as we will discover later is involved in a colossal building speculation , which involves the other spheres of government, given that the expansion of the American military base is at stake, complete with an anti-missile shield and the birth of a mega tourist village. As reality teaches us, the mafia goes hand in hand with public procurement, and such is the extent of the profits at stake that the entire order within the Yakuza families of Tokyo is called into question. It will therefore be up to Kazuma to save his family and at the same time ensure a future for his boys. These are the main events in brief, but it is only the tip of the iceberg of what Sega wanted to tell about the new life of the Dragon of the Dojima. The story is very complex and articulated, alongside the main events there are many stories that revolve around the dozens of characters that make up the vast fresco of the game. Each character is not a simple puppet staged with the mere function of triggering a reaction in our Kazuma, but a real person with a background (and many side missions to complete). The game follows the everyday life of Kazuma and the other characters in a way that is different from almost all video games that share its setting. The main storyline not only leads us to do ~important~ missions, where we fight and which perhaps make a decisive leap to the plot, but in an organic and homogeneous way it tells us about everyday life with almost trivial ~objectives~ we could say, but which only few times they clash or weigh down the unfolding of events. In addition to duels with the other Yakuza patriarchs, especially in the early hours of the game you have to do the most disparate things, like finding (and then feeding) the puppy of one of the orphanage girls, playing baseball with the boys or saving the goddaughter of one of the local mobsters. To link the great writing work, the developers have decided to use beautiful cutscenes, to underline the most important moments, dramatic and otherwise, or using the actual game engine for scenes in which the dialogues are written with the characters still in the manner of the most classic JRPGs. However, the full-bodied and well-done screenplay work brings with it two major problems. The first concerns the localization of the game. Yakuza 3 is spoken in Japanese and subtitled in English, Italian, including menus is completely absent. Given the very long dialogues and the complexity of the story, not knowing or knowing little about the Albion language could be a significant obstacle to fully understanding the game in all its details and nuances. Secondly, dwelling for a long time on events that may only appear to be unimportant (especially in the first part of the game), almost trivial as written above, could be boring and not very intriguing to many, also in light of the ~English problem~. It never gets boring, but the pace isn't exactly Yakuza 3's best quality. Punches in the face Going to tighten, how the action is organized in Yakuza3? The heart is that of a fighting game, however grafted onto a free roaming body in which, like in a Japanese school role-playing game, our wandering through the city is very often interrupted, like random fights, by groups of bad guys who want us beating and robbing for not bowing first, or much more prosaically to take the money needed to go to a brothel or to have a beer. In these cases the action on foot stops, a small group of people forms a sort of ring in which to start the fight. The many moves available and the constant use of objects found around, from bottles to bicycles, through planters, sofas and tables make the clashes decidedly fun. Unfortunately, although they are useful for gaining experience and various objects, in the long run they become too frustrating and boring, as every four or five meters there will always be someone willing to fight. Given that all of the missions, both main and secondary, involve us in long walks up and down the city, more than the difficulty is the continual interruption of this ~usual routine~ which gets boring, and the pace, already per se fluctuating it does not make money, on the contrary it weighs down a lot, causing the rate of repetitiveness to rise dangerously. But what makes Kazuma Kyriu a formidable fighter? The development of the character takes place through a simple and ingenious experience system, as the levels go up it is possible to spend the points earned to buy new attack and defense moves, from simple ground counterattacks to long combos, through grappling and projections and more general a whole series of passive bonuses to the characteristics of the character, both physical and ~technical~. In addition there are the revelations, or further new moves, which are obtained after having photographed with the mobile phone and posted on one's blog some random movements of ordinary citizens. What we like most about the fights, and which is obviously sublimated in the long fights between the bosses with multiple attack patterns, are the special moves and the final ones (bloody but not lethal fatalities) that are performed when our heat bar is full. With the blue heat indicator at its maximum (which rises with our successful shots) we can use the environment and the objects that we find around the ~rings~ for choreographed special attacks, such as simple headbutts on the walls, or among the thousand possibility, use a bicycle to quickly knock out opponents. Carrying out these moves does not require particular skill, just simply push the triangle button when it appears at the top right, always do it, as well as giving experience points, it limits the exit times from random fights, something that should not be underestimated given the many encounters that take place they do in the city. Then, in the presence of the bosses, when their last energy bar has dropped below half, it is possible to perform the final moves, an enhanced version of the special ones, even more devastating and choreographic, but with an extra quick time event to perform. Sword blows to the contents The localization work done to bring Yakuza 3 to Europe and the United States has left some small aftermath, in the form of some quests and mini-games that have been completely canceled for the western release (there are 101 secondary ones out of 123 total). In some cases it is a matter of little things, with frankly forgettable cuts such as Japanese checkers or history quizzes, and others that are decidedly more interesting such as Mahjong and the various sub stories dedicated to hostess clubs and cabaret bars, decidedly spicy but nothing particularly shocking and sinful. Obviously all this eliminates several trophies, and it is a mystery how much these cuts can affect the development and acquisition of experience points of the character. Karaoke or Yakuza Hunt? The music doesn't change, but it gets more interesting when weapons are in play. First of all, weapons, whether they are the canonical ones or the simple things found around, have their own energy and break with use, consequently deciding when to use them, whether to use them immediately or when we can perform special attacks is already a first variant to consider. The same care can be applied with those of ours bought on the black market, which however can be adjusted or modified later. There's a bit of everything around, swords, tasers, telescopic stirrups, nunchucks, daggers, brass knuckles and pistols, plus a whole series of ~secret~ weapons that can be built by bringing the materials and projects to the craftsmen. The combat phases gain a lot from the inclusion of weapons, especially in variety and tactics, and redeem the game from phasescombat which, although they work, are plagued by a certain button mashing and rather wooden and dated mechanics and animations. Suffice it to say that having started a combo, Kazuma will continue undaunted to strike in one direction only, without the possibility of blocking the movement in progress, exposing himself to opponents' blows from behind, furthermore the one-way parry is decidedly uncomfortable, the simple retreat or dodging are much more functional and effective. Between one fight and another and the many secondary missions that are given to us by the people we meet (among these important are those of hitman, as a hitman in Tokyo) it is possible to experience the city and dedicate ourselves to multiple activities in which to spend our hard-earned savings. At this juncture Yakuza 3 excels and stands on a higher step than the American competition. Basically, either during the course of the missions or in some situations free from commitments we can really do what we want, and explore the buildings of the city in search of more or less licit entertainment. In some cases these are mini games, which are not so mini anyway given the complexity and depth of golf, darts or fishing. There is a bit of everything, Karaoke, arcades, bars, restaurants, gambling dens, shops and much more, the buildings are not concrete blocks designed to delimit the playing area, but many of them contain the most disparate activities where you can spend as long as you like. The longevity of the game is therefore very high, between main and secondary missions, various mini-games and objects to find, you'll lose your head, and it's not uncommon to complete the twelve chapters of the game in about fifteen hours, and then find out by seeing the statistics of having stopped at a poor ten percent total of the possibilities that Yakuza 3 offers! In the end, the whole menu offered by Sega, between ups and downs, succeeds in entertaining the western player, the feared excess of ~Japaneseness~ is certainly not something insurmountable even if the first housewives hours could make someone turn up their noses. What I like least about Yakuza 3 is that it has remained too much the same, with mechanics that work, but which linger too much on repetition and which in the long run, also given the imbalances in rhythm, could get boring. Fortunately, freedom of action comes to our rescue, decidedly more accentuated in the free moments of daily life, compared to the linear ones of the main story, and which guarantee a sumptuous plus to the longevity of the game. Playstation 3 trophies There are 45 trophies of the original 50 in the game and they are split between 36 bronze, 5 silver, 3 gold and one platinum. Almost all of them are obtained with the simple progression in the game, defeating the various bosses and dedicating yourself to the completion of the various substories. The more challenging ones concern completing all the mini games or finding all the keys to the lockers, while some lead us to find all the garbage on Asagao beach or to order the most expensive dishes in the various restaurants of the two cities. Few textures, lots of reality Yakuza 3 is certainly an outdated game, both in purely polygonal terms and in terms of texture and animation detail, but all this takes a back seat to the great work done to give credibility, but above all personality to the game world and the characters who inhabit it . From this point of view, Tokyo and Okinawa manage to transport us to Japan thanks to the extreme fidelity with which they are reproduced. The two cities are teeming with busy people on the move, tourists, salary men in dour gray suits, colorful street gangs or simple students lounging around. Although the game is not striking for special effects, dynamic lights or detail, it is the one that is most successful in recreating living cities, and with an almost maniacal attention to detail, just check the real hole of the two model areas on the net, the red light district of Kabukicho in Tokyo, Kamurocho in the game and Ryukyugai digital version of downtown Naha, Okinawa Prefecture. What is most striking is that as previously written, the buildings are not simple decorative elements given that in many of them it is possible to enter to access the shops, from simple supermarkets to clandestine gambling dens, Karaoke, Sega arcades, McDonald's, fish markets and trendy venues. Obviously all this wealth is limited to a very small area compared to the vastness of a Liberty City, in fact they are only ~small~ neighborhoods that can be easily crossed on foot (contrary to GTA in Yakuza there are no vehicles to drive), but the impression of being there is tangible, and when one of the protagonists", "date": "2010-03-17", "grade": "8.2"}
