{"name": "Fifa 2005", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-2005.html", "text": "But is that really FIFA? If Fifa has become a good football game, however, it is also thanks to Winning Eleven, from which it has copied  not to say plagiarized  many of the fundamental aspects of the new formula. The control system is practically identical to that of the Konami series: with A you pass the ball, with B you shoot, with Y you make the through ball, with X you cross, with Z you feint, with R you run and with L you make the moves in combination with the other buttons. The same moves made up of pressing several buttons are identical to Winning Eleven, such as the tense cross that is made by double-clicking X, or the high filter or the lob with L+Y and L+B. The absence of the one two is unexpected, the presence of the low shot by pressing B twice is surprising. The most original and innovative thing about the controls is certainly the use of the C stick, used for feints  both when stationary and while running  and, above all, the so-called First Touch, an unprecedented function that allows you to establish the direction in which the player blocks the ball. In addition to being spectacular, it proves to be extremely useful, especially in counter-attack actions in which it is necessary to waste as little time as possible. Volley handling is also incredibly good, it works even better than in Winning Eleven. The intervention of the players is timely, as soon as you press the button they will pounce on the ball, and will not wait for the most opportune moment to do so as they often do in the Konami game: it will be up to you to decide when to have them kick, and they will do it as soon as you command them . The physics of the ball is also good, although there are still some problems that reside in the DNA of the series: unrealistic ball bounce during ground passes, exaggerated speed of the ball in shots, especially in free-kicks. The general speed of the game, the main flaw of FIFA 2004 in which there was a continuous hit and hit, has fortunately been decreased and now stands at acceptable levels; it is possible to slow it down further from the options, but we advise you not to do it because it would affect the fluidity of the game. Unfortunately, although the attack phases have been significantly improved and are now much more realistic and harmonious, the same cannot be said of the defensive ones, which are pervaded by a very often frustrating sense of impotence. Many tactics have been introduced, but they still don't affect game action as much as they should, and stealing the ball is harder than it should be. The movement of the defenders is not realistic, and the only efficient way to get the ball back is to steal it in a one-on-one. The only positive thing from this point of view is the introduction of doubling, also inherited from Winning Eleven, which is done by pressing L and B simultaneously. EA will certainly have to work a lot on the behavior of the team in its defensive movements to improve even more his series. The other flaws of the game reside in the set pieces: with free kicks, once you understand the mechanism, it's too easy to score even from the most unthinkable positions, while corner kicks are extremely schematized, you'll even have to choose the type of cross to make from a small menu. Overall, however, one certainly cannot complain about the game, the progress made has been many. Yes, it's him! This unexpected leap in quality adds up to all those aspects that made FIFA the success we all know, such as the license of many club teams. There are almost all the European championships and all the second divisions of the most important ones, therefore also the Italian Serie B. The names of the players themselves, of course, are the real ones, as well as those of the stadiums. There is also a well-kept Career mode in which you will have to impersonate a coach and, at the same time (if you want), play your team's games. You will have to do the shopping campaign, choose the type and quantity of workouts, do the training, keep an eye on the budget and so on. You will start with a low category team, from Serie B if you choose to participate in the Italian championship, and by doing well with this formation you can then be hired by more important clubs or even get your successes with the same starting team. Your adventure will last fifteen years, and in these fifteen years you will have to participate and try to win every competition that exists in reality, apart from the Champions League which unfortunately has not been included in the game. In the Play Station 2 and Xbox versions there is also an excellent Online mode, always important in a football game, both for downloading updatesments and above all to challenge other people as experienced as you. The graphics behave quite well and alternate great things, such as stadiums or the ball, with other incredibly wrong ones, such as the proportions of the players or their color. Broadly speaking, the overall technical aspect is very similar between the three platforms, with Xbox taking the top spot on the podium for texture cleanliness and loading speed. Almost all the most famous players closely resemble their real-life counterparts, even in details, while the less famous ones have nothing in common with the footballers they represent. The sound does its duty, the chants of the fans are limited, but on the other hand there is the hilarious commentary of Longhi and Galli, the latter always ready to offend every element of your team even after a positive action. Comment FIFA 2005 is a good football game, and that's the best compliment you can pay it. Although it is undeniable that it has copied many things from Winning Eleven, the final result is excellent, and the series with this new episode takes a further step forward after the discreet Fifa 2004. The title has improved in the playful part, so where it needed most , while it has remained intact in the outline aspects that already worked well in past years. Subtract half a vote from the GameCube version of the game, which lacks the all-important Online mode. Pros: Great career mode It's a soccer game! Licenses, licenses, licenses Volleys Against: Set pieces Defensive actions The FIFA series was born more than a decade ago, and since then it has appeared annually on almost every console on the market. While it was never the best soccer game around because of Konami, FIFA was still a respectable title in its early days, as were its early polygonal versions. Precisely in the years of the end of the millennium the series reached the pinnacle of success, but, if on the one hand this goal satisfied the top management of EA, it also corresponded with the beginning of the decline of FIFA. Since it was the best-selling soccer game and there was apparently no one to bother with its domain, why try to improve it when you could happily update it regularly with new names every year? Never was a more serious mistake; at that time the Winning Eleven phenomenon was born, which would soon have infected the whole world, not because it had all the licenses in the world, but because it was a real football simulation. Thus, when the masses began to notice Winning Eleven and its amazing realism, FIFA lost part of its audience; today the Konami saga is almost more sold than the EA one. This reversal has had a positive effect on Electonics Arts which, since the last edition, has finally begun to improve the playful aspect of its series, trying to make it more similar to football also in substance as well as in form. But, if in the previous episode there were still many defects inherited from the old games, this FIFA 2005 finally seems able to be at least compared to Pro Evolution Soccer.", "date": "2004-11-01", "grade": null}
