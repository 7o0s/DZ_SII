{"name": "Desperados 2: Cooper's Revenge - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/desperados-2-coopers-revenge-recensione.html", "text": "Wild Wild West Completely avoiding any mention of the plot, which is worth following to the end thanks to some excellent choices in the evolution of the story, let's go directly to analyze the gameplay: the first change visible right from the options consists in the possibility to choose between 2 different levels of difficulty, something that will certainly be appreciated by everyone since one of the criticisms leveled at the first Desperados was precisely the high level of difficulty which made it a game not suitable for all types of gamers, given that sometimes you ended up fall into real frustration due to the umpteenth attempt to complete an action. Although some steps in this direction have therefore been made for Desperados 2, do not expect such an abysmal difference in terms of difficulty with the predecessor, as even the easy mode will put a strain on the skills of the most hardened player, while in the event that have you ever had the opportunity to play the first chapter of the series know ~simply~ that Desperados 2 will give you a hard time, sometimes remaining frustrated but still glued in front of the monitor to try to complete an action rehearsed over and over again, to not to mention the sense of satisfaction offered by the successful completion of a mission, which more than once has also led me to celebrate with rash gestures. As for the variety of levels, we can certainly pinpoint one of the first positive notes of this game : in fact we will find ourselves attacking without sparing bullets as well as defending ourselves together with innocent civilians, entering areas without being noticed and with the obligation not to kill anyone, acting alone and cooperating with the other protagonists , and so on. [C] Cooper drags them, Kate ties them up Hiding bodies is easy. fundamental and sometimes it is not enough The noise and visibility indicators appear on the left. of our character [/C] The Wild Bunch Having made the due premise on the commitment required by this game, we can move on to carrying out the various missions: that the gameplay of the title released in 2001 was already excellent in itself is certainly not a mystery either for the group of fans of the western series nor for the developers, who have been able to intervene surgically by fixing all the imperfections that were present, obviously adding the extra part that justifies the name below to the detriment of the expansion one. The most important of the innovations introduced consists in the new game engine, completely 3D, which could not have been otherwise given that if 5 years ago an isometric 2D with some optical tricks was acceptable, nowadays it would have practically been suicide for Desperados 2 By postponing the discussion on the quality of the graphics engine to the appropriate paragraph, let's stop and analyze what are the elements that thanks to it are introduced into the game system: first of all we have the new subjective view (in third person), which allows us to It is necessary to take close control of a certain character by making him move as if he were practically a 3D action, running, walking, crawling and shooting at will. The Wild Bunch I assure you that in some junctures of the game this new aspect will literally fall like cheese on macaroni, simplifying your life if not even removing you from problems, but woe to make the mistake of using only the subjective view since we are still talking about one real-time strategy where the 6 characters must necessarily cooperate with each other to successfully complete the objectives proposed by the game: the player's skill, now as always, therefore lies in the ability to make the protagonists interact using this new tool available. The enemies for their part do not make life easy in the slightest, since they can enjoy an AI rarely seen previously, also collaborating in a sometimes surprising way in order to knock out our team of bounty hunters. In addition to natural opponents, however, it is also necessary to pay attention to civilians, endowed with a behavior that is not at all predictable and therefore attributable to a kind of diversification even among their characters: a superficial person seeing one of our characters perform some strange action will no longer worry about a lot, while maybe someone else will get suspicious just seeing us run. Given that, as mentioned ad nauseam, the interaction between the 6 is a must, there is the possibility of programming their actions to develop complex strategies, assisting the unfolding of the etwenty or completely from outside or by intervening by taking control of the character you want to keep out of the automated movements, which can be started by pressing the enter key for a maximum of 5 different actions. [C] The stealth is in some cases it is; All Cooper and Sanchez split enemies An example of a planned action [/C] the good, the bad and the ugly The characters available to us are practically the same as in the first chapter, except for the sixth component now made up of a native American, commonly called an Indian, called Hawkeye (Eagle Eye) and chief of the White Wolves tribe. But let's go and see the protagonists of the game one by one: Cooper He is the protagonist of the story, as well as the head of the company. A very skilled gunslinger, he also has a knife to silently kill his enemies and a clock that he uses to distract them by making noise. Kate The femme fatale of the group, she knows her charms and uses it to dupe anyone who comes within range, enemies included: she feigns fainting, stuns with powder and seduces men and then kicks them right in the right place (that's right, right there). He can also shoot but that's not his forte. Doc Probably the most charismatic character in the game, completely dressed in black and able to solve the most complicated issues by himself: he is a skilled gunslinger but he is especially lethal with a sniper rifle, he can disable enemies with a powerful poison and cure their wounded comrades. Sam A very nice black boy, he is also skilled with firearms but his specialty is explosions: he is in fact expert in handling sticks of dynamite and preparing traps with a bang for enemies. Sanchez The Mexican of the group, a character very close to the classic ~all muscles and little brain~: he has an impressive automatic machine gun on his side and thanks to his own strength he can knock out enemies by throwing large stones at their heads. He can also set traps of various types, even causing opponents to fight over a sip of tequila. Hawkeye As already mentioned, he is the new entry of the group: as a good Indian he knows how to hunt very well and therefore he is both lethal and absolutely silent, given that he uses all weapons that do not make the slightest noise. It is also the only one that can overcome obstacles such as rivers and other natural rocks. Finally 3D The 5 years of distance between the two Desperados have given Spellbound the opportunity to think calmly about a new graphics engine, which obviously was in step with the times. As we well know, given that 3D now belongs to practically all the games on the market, what makes the difference is the attention to detail and increasingly physics, which determines the degree of realism of a video game. Also from these points of view Desperados 2 proves to fully know its stuff, with a maniacal care of the backdrops as well as the realizations of the various characters, both protagonists and non-protagonists, on whose animations a lot of work has been dedicated to improve what was one of the shortcomings of the first in the series. As far as physics is concerned, it is surprising to see the calculation of the trajectory in the event that a stick of dynamite or a stone is thrown, complete with the calculation of the rebounds based on what one is going to throw. The sound consists of an excellent soundtrack (which does its job admirably by giving its contribution to the western setting), quite standard effects and a respectable dubbing in Italian, to be the envy of the vast majority of stocks on the market. Desperados 2 constitutes an experience that a gamer who wants to define himself as such must sooner or later do Final comment If the first Desperados was a videogame gem, Desperados 2 constitutes an experience that a gamer who wants to define himself as such must sooner or later do, provided he obviously loves the genre to which it belongs, within which the last chapters of Commandos they struggled and no other particularly noteworthy games are seen. The only comment that can be made to this new Spellbound effort is that it is excessively difficult even at an easy level, which constitutes a paradox even stopping at the simple linguistic level: the introduction of a ~normal~ mode together with the two present would probably have fixed things, but unfortunately it is not present and therefore I find myself having to warn those who think they can easily get discouraged in front of the repetition of something that can in rare cases even reach a dozen times. For the rest, after arming yourself with patience for slightly slower-than-average loads, Desperados 2 isa game that can easily be promoted with full marks, hoping not to have to wait another 5 years for a possible Desperados 3.Pro New 3D engine Engaging storyline Entertaining at the right point Cons Above average difficulty Slow loading The return of Cooper When the first Desperados was released in 2001, it was immediately labeled by many as a Commandos clone, probably because the title of Pyro was decisively on the crest of the wave at that time. This unfair comparison is also testified by some hands-on impressions from specialized magazines and more or less well-founded opinions around the web, which Desperados however largely managed to deny by demonstrating to everyone that they share the only genre with Commandos, thanks to aspects such as characterization, plot and gameplay of decidedly high level. Spellbound was so successful that fans of the first chapter hoped for a sequel for 5 long years, however seeing the only, disputed Chicago 1930 delivered by the German development team, while Pyro churned out two new titles, albeit between ups and downs from the Command series. 2006 is therefore the year in which John Cooper fans can finally return to handling the revolver wearing the cowboy hat, since after having long awaited his return, Tex Willer's distant cousin is finally back and, as says the title of Desperados 2, he's angrier than ever.
