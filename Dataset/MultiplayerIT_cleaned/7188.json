But now it's up to PlayStation Vita, with a ~simplified~ version that starts from one of the modes present in the reference management on PC, precisely the Classic mode. In short, Football Manager Classic 2014 accepts the challenge of the new platform and its peculiarities, in particular the touch screen controls, to deliver us an experience that promises, on the one hand, to guarantee the realism and accuracy that have always characterized the franchise, from on the other hand, a more streamlined structure, which lends itself better to impromptu and/or mobile use. All this is accompanied by a useful cross-save function that allows you to export the save to continue your career even on a personal computer. Proposals that have been implemented in the best way or not? Let's find out together. Football Manager Classic 2014 brings the many contents of the series to PS Vita, but there are problems Football Manager is not arguing... As per tradition, the initial setup procedure of Football Manager Classic 2014 sees us enter a series of information to create our manager, then choose a team to manage and embark on a new adventure. Depending on the team's category and reputation, the seasonal objectives can change considerably: you may want to fight for promotion or for salvation, aim for the Scudetto or the European cups, reach a certain position in the final standings and so on. It's up to us to choose what we think could be a feasible goal and to indicate it clearly, also trying to motivate our choices even in the face of the inevitable questions from the press and any pressure from the president of the company. When we start dancing, a thousand different gears will begin to move around us that simulate the progress of the transfer market, the interest of the other teams in some of our players (who may be asked to loan us) and a calendar that obviously includes some friendly matches, essential to test the condition of the team and quickly make the tactical changes necessary to start the championship in the best way. The options available to us, despite the simplification deriving from the Classic mode, are extremely numerous and in the same way there are many elements of the experience that we can decide to take care of in person or deputize to our deputies, such as training. Purists will not fail to take care of these tasks too, trying to draw the picture of a solid team down to the smallest detail, with very few weak points, ready to fight for every ball and to change attitude suddenly if the situation requires it. The synthesis of all this work is crowned by the simulation of the match, in practice a long replay that we can view at normal or accelerated speed (acting on some indicators), which alternates between a standard view of the action and diagrams indicating the areas of the field in which most movements occur. We are obviously given the possibility of making changes, modifying the team's approach (moving from a purely defensive mentality to something much more open-minded, through various intermediate levels) and also the module, if we were to realize that we need a defender or an extra midfielder to block the sorties of our opponents. In short, the contents are those that every Football Manager fan knows well, including of course the presence of various unofficial names and symbols. PSVita trophies There are sixty-two Trophies contained in Football Manager Classic 2014, and to obtain them it is necessary to unlock the various advanced functions, win every single competition and complete certain actions for the first time, such as signing a player, obtaining recognition as coach and so on. ...the PlayStation Vita version does It is important to clarify that, from a structural point of view, we are dealing with an excellent reduction of the managerial experience of Football Manager. Of course, the only alternative mode to the standard one are the ~challenges~, or rather a number of pre-set scenarios in which we are asked, for example, to overturn a result in progressively more difficult conditions. However, the contents, the depth, the attention to detail and the simulation context appear intact, perhaps together with some small bugs that you will inevitably see appear in the middle of the season. Yes,this too is part of the tradition of such a multifaceted product. Well, what we unfortunately didn't like about Football Manager Classic 2014 is the conversion work. Indeed, let's be clearer: we didn't like it at all. The first thing that catches the eye are in fact the long and frequent uploads necessary for even the slightest advancement in the career, which break up the action excessively and sometimes force unjustifiably long waits. It is clear that the software calculates a whole series of situations in the background, nobody doubts it, but the fact remains that subjecting users to so many and such dead moments does not seem to us the best way to promote a portable management experience like this. The second thing that catches the eye, much more serious, concerns the behavior of the interface with respect to our inputs. You know when you try to run a game at 1080p and with all effects turned on on an old PC? This is the feeling that Football Manager Classic 2014 returns: it seems that the software is too heavy for PlayStation Vita to be able to handle it in a decent way, and so from the touch of a button to the appearance of a menu even two seconds pass, scrolling is slow and not very reactive, in short, the game makes a filthy effort to run and visually all this is absolutely unjustified, given that we are mostly talking about text screens. Another problem, which goes hand in hand with the weight of the code, is the sheer inadequacy of the interface for touch controls. We have often seen games that on PlayStation Vita offered a different interface, redesigned with very large buttons, to meet the needs of the touch screen; but in the case of FMC2014 this did not happen, the buttons and writings are tiny, suitable for a mouse pointer rather than a fingertip, and this often results in wrong selections. Finally we have the match simulation, which is also far below expectations. In the end, it is an extra compared to the managerial structure, but the fact remains that the graphics are decidedly ~old gen~, with the players sliding on the field, mediocre animations and in the same way a completely inadequate sound, however the It's the only one you'll hear since, as you know, Sports Interactive's software is completely devoid of musical accompaniment. It may seem like a detail, but even here it would have been appropriate to opt for a different solution to make the game more digestible for PlayStation Vita owners, and the fact that this was not thought of speaks volumes about the attention dedicated to the creation of the product .", "date": "2014-04-15", "grade": "6.0"}
