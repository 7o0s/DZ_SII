{"name": "Recensione Transformers: The Game", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-transformers-the-game.html", "text": "From the now cleared mists of time the Transformers re-emerge, inhabitants of that universe so limited yet vast, a universe where bad guys and good guys have defined personalities and change their minds by subverting the immobile stereotypes of long-standing cartoons. The Tranformers have populated a rather complex and dynamic imaginary, where power and survival overlap, linking it to the wonder effect that the mechanisms, especially the mechanisms of the great ones suitable for the interpretative game of the models, arouse in the little ones. Good Vs Bad The Transformers thus return in great visual dust, as well as other childhood heroes, but like the other heroes they lose complexity by giving everything to the spectacular and the inevitable tie-in that follows the cinematic event can only match the filmic counterpart. We therefore find two factions: Autobots against Decepticons engaged in the search for the classic device capable of subverting the fate of the universe. The first are the good guys, led by the robust Optimus Prime also known as Commander and are particularly sensitive to the needs of fragile human beings. On the other side of the barricade the Decepticons look out, eager for power, revenge, revenge and so on and heedless of the earth's population. The gameplay of Transformers: The Game is almost exclusively based on this guideline. In fact, we have two campaigns at our disposal that lead us through the plot of the film from the relative points of view and allow us to play all the most important sequences of the film whose objectives, obviously, are based on the attitudes of the two sides. Trans Missions Transformers: The Game is therefore structured in missions that have a specific objective but are set in a freely explorable map. With the Autobots we have the task of saving humans and defeating the Decepticons while with the latter, in the vast majority of cases, we are called to destroy something. Some Decepticon missions are specifically geared towards senseless destruction of land that reacts to powerful weapons by shattering and giving some thrill. Almost all the elements of the map are in fact destructible and in some situations it is quite exciting to unleash the two weapons we have available on the surrounding environment, causing the buildings to collapse and the vehicles that populate the city to take off. Some missions instead exploit the ability to transform into air and land vehicles but are almost exclusively chases or races against time, marked by a series of checkpoints. In this regard, the only mission that offers a minimum of challenge is precisely that of the first chase, even if part of the difficulty derives from the poor driveability of the vehicles. The map, in addition to the destruction of the structures, does not offer any type of diversion and both campaigns are rather short so that if you are a regular player it is likely that you will complete the game the same day you bought it. As the only addition to a rather meager panorama, some secondary missions appear that unlock a series of secrets dedicated to fans, among which the possibility of playing using the cartoon models stands out. Self gameplay From time to time there are also the agonized fights between Transformers, who, to decide the fate of the war, are called to unleash their arsenal in an attempt to overwhelm the opponent. Unfortunately all the weapons of our beloved robots are thwarted by an energy shield of unknown origin and the only way to defeat the opponent is to reach him and beat him up the old-fashioned way. But there is a further problem, the hand-to-hand combat is in fact limited to a single combo which makes combat with white weapons too frustrating, not to mention that during the fights the map shrinks considerably, delimiting an ~action zone~ from which it is impossible to exit, otherwise the mission will fail. Even from the point of view of the vehicles, at least when it comes to piloting them and not destroying the surrounding environment, the situation is not the most rosy. Next Gen? The destructible landscape and the excellent care placed in the robotic models of the Transformers give some satisfaction, especially in the missions in which we are called to destroy what surrounds us. The animations are not bad and the transformation from vehicle to robot is beautifully done, allowing us to recover some of that feeling hidden by the game's flaws. There are even welcome additions such as Blackout, the Decepticon helicopter, which uses its blades as a sword and we are given the opportunity to flit around the map on the immense Megatron. Of withThe impossibility of transforming into a jump with land vehicles is a discreet blow to the spectacular nature of the action. The destructibility of the environment is welcome, but it is a backdrop poor in details and above all regulated by unconvincing physical laws. The nextgen rate of Transformer is not very high, with real disappointments represented by artificial intelligence and physics engine. Luckily the sound effects come directly from the film and the voice acting of Hollywood actors manages to keep the atmosphere of the film alive. Comment Transformers: The Game is a tie-in to the classic ones, and that's not entirely a compliment. It is a title created to take advantage of the contemporary release of the film without too much creativity both from a playful and technological point of view. Fortunately, the Decepticon missions revive the fortunes of a game that may not fully convince at first glance. On the other hand, secrets and models of the Transformers can tickle the palate of the wildest fans of the series, guaranteeing the game the appeal of a collector's item for fans. Pros: models and animations return faithful Transformers the environment is destructible some gems dedicated to fans Cons: technically not cutting edge the map is explorable, but empty flaws in terms of playability Goals 360 Completing the campaign is very easy and gives 50 points per faction while the more substantial objective consists of collecting all the energy cubes hidden in the territory. The other objectives are linked to the completion of secondary missions and to particular or repeated actions such as achieving 500 transformations.", "date": "2007-07-20", "grade": null}
