{"name": "The House of the Dead 2 &amp; 3 Return - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-house-of-the-dead-2-amp-3-return-recensione.html", "text": "Episodes 2 and 3 The House of the Dead 2, released in arcades in 1998, was ported to the Dreamcast and PC. On the console SEGA has played an important role, characterizing the initial lineup and pushing sales of the lightgun together with the (mediocre, actually) conversion of Virtua Cop. The structure is identical to that of the first episode, with two characters who find themselves facing hordes of zombies and monsters, which for the occasion have escaped from any control and have invaded an entire city. The setting, therefore, is completely different from what we have seen previously, with monsters coming out of houses or water, chasing terrified people that we will have to try to save. On more than one occasion we will have to choose which path to take, an expedient that actually increases the longevity of the game: several games and different tests are needed to see everything. The transition from one stage to another is marked by the clash with the bosses, always huge and always equipped with a weak point, which is indicated to us by a sort of ~monster encyclopedia~ before taking action. The House of the Dead 3 arrived in theaters in 2002, in a very particular period for SEGA, engaged only on the software front. Converted for Xbox and PC, the game moves the series into the future, precisely in the year 2019. Following the incidents narrated in the first two episodes, civilization has suffered a bad blow and the entire planet has become unlivable, infested with terrible creatures and menacing. However, there are always those who try to set things right, in this case Lisa (the daughter of Thomas Rogan) and good old ~G~, who together try to infiltrate a structure within which it seems hold the key to the annihilation of all beings created by Dr. Curien. The use of crossroads and alternative roads is always present, and playing in two you often find yourself having to help your partner from the attack of enemies. Otherwise, the gameplay remains unchanged... Shoot what happens to you Whether you choose the second or third episode of the series, the gameplay remains basically the same: with the characters moving on rails, just like in Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles, we'll have to shoot all the enemies that appear on the screen, as well as the objects that will be thrown at us. On more than one occasion we will have to try to be precise, placing aimed shots at the heads of the monsters to eliminate them quickly, especially when they are about to grab a passer-by or when they are on top of our partner. Although alternative weapons to the starting one are completely missing, the control system on Wii (based solely on the Wii-mote, possibly equipped with the Wii Zapper adapter) proves to be more precise than ever. To make a comparison with the aforementioned The Umbrella Chronicles, the latter is certainly more varied but has a much less precise aiming management. To play we have to point the Wii-mote at the screen, move the crosshairs and fire the B trigger. To reload the weapon, just point the controller off the screen for a moment, which surprisingly doesn't cause too much ~lost~. when the viewfinder reappears. As in any pistol shooter, it is clear that playing in two makes things much easier: hitting the same enemy together has devastating effects, as if using a machine gun. In this sense, the game has always been very generous, with the various zombies accusing the blows where they are hit, ~dismantling~ as a result. Alongside the main game modes, there are a couple of interesting alternatives: in the case of The House of the Dead 2, we have an original mode that shuffles the tables a bit, while the third episode has an ~extreme~ mode , to be faced if we want an even greater level of challenge. Technical realization We are dealing with a small collection of ~classics~, since the two games are conversions from Dreamcast (HOTD2) and Xbox (HOTD3). No changes of any kind were made for the publication on the Wii, so the graphics have remained exactly as fans of the series well remember. The second episode is perhaps the most ~inspired~ as far as enemies and settings are concerned, but it makes a fine show of really simple polygonal models, especially for the protagonists and their companions. It is normal that the attention is entirely directed to the undead, present in large numbers and in different types, all well characterized. The third episode is a little more sophisticated in terms of graphics but less brilliant in ideas, which however remain average for the series. The sound sector, in both cases, is full of short phrases in English (sometimes tragicomic, veof the first boss of The House of the Dead 2), some effective music and effects that give a good idea of the power of the weapons. The control system has already been discussed: although moving a crosshair on the screen is profoundly different from aiming with a lightgun, the behavior of the Wii-mote is exceptional in terms of precision and reliability. Comment The House of the Dead 2 & 3 Return on the one hand presents itself as a product for nostalgics (which on the console of casual gamers it is not known how warmly it can be received), on the other it offers the same type of action present in the excellent Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles, perhaps even with an extra pinch of frenzy and with the presence of forks and alternative modes that add a minimum of thickness (where the presence of a single non-upgradeable weapon serves the opposite purpose). Technically it is what it is, a 1998 game alongside a 2002 one, and using the Wii-mote instead of a classic lightgun transforms the experience in a major way, bringing it closer to the PC (where the mouse is used) conversions more than those for Dreamcast and Xbox. In any case, the action is not lacking and it is fun for two: if you are looking for a shooter with a pistol and already own RE: The Umbrella Chronicles, this SEGA collection is definitely for you. Pros: Accurate and reliable targeting Fast-paced action for one or two players Two games in one... Cons: ...but both are getting older Technically outdated Would have been better with a lightgun", "date": "2008-04-16", "grade": null}
