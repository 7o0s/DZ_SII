{"name": "TMNT: Mutant Madness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tmnt-mutant-madness-recensione.html", "text": "We were curious to try our hand at the review of TMNT: Mutant Madness, after all the Ninja Turtles have been a constant presence in the world of video games since the 80s, protagonists of some brilliant and even iconic titles but perhaps less valued than other brands in the the well-known revival that involved productions dating back almost forty years ago. We all know the story of Donatello, Leonardo, Raphael and Michelangelo, the four little turtles transformed into anthropomorphic creatures together with their master rodent, Splinter, who decide to protect the city by the Foot Clan, controlled by the evil and powerful Shredder. The clash between the two factions is precisely represented again in this mobile game by Kongregate, but not in the best way. Gameplay The gameplay of TMNT: Mutant Madness is typical of the most limited gachas, in which a series of automatisms control everything that happens on the screen and the player's intervention is really reduced to a minimum. In this case, our task will be to compose the team of five characters who will fight from time to time and to activate the special moves of each individual unit when the relative indicator is charged, but we will not be able to do anything else in practice. It goes without saying how this type of approach emphasizes the freemium dynamics that we know well, in which the value of the team is the only thing that matters and it is impossible to win the match against stronger opponents, given that our intervention is so limited that it can't make any difference. Paywalls and microtransactions It is therefore no coincidence that the paywalls show up punctually after just an hour of play, starting to offer more difficult duels to overcome when you do not proceed to use all the credits and objects collected for the enhancement of the characters and the Assigning earned weapons to their respective loadouts. And if those solutions aren't enough, the remaining options are special events and of course microtransactions. The problem with this fully automated approach, as also underlined in the One-Punch Man: Road to Hero 2.0 review, is that the experience immediately becomes very repetitive. A real shame, given the undoubted popularity of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles license and the possibility of using traditional strategic mechanisms to bring home a certainly more interesting product. Technical realization Unfortunately, the technical realization does not think about saving goat and cabbage: if in a product like Disney Mirrorverse one could count not only on a more interactive gameplay but also and above all on remarkable graphics, in the case of TMNT: Mutant Madness not even this aspect drives you crazy due to a fairly anonymous graphic style. Even the roster of characters, while fairly rich, contributes to the repetitiveness of the situations, even leading to the villains being forfeited to the team in order to increase the number. Furthermore, the scenarios and animations both leave something to be desired, as do the music that accompanies the action.", "date": "2020-09-25", "grade": "4.5"}
