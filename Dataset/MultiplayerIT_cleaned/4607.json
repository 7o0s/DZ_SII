In the role of a survivor, our task in the game was to escape (or at least try to do so) by running at breakneck speed between prairies and farms, in an open field, dribbling past the living dead who literally emerged from everywhere and aiming to reach the maximum distance in a single game. Along the way it was possible to collect weapons that allowed to break through the hordes of enemies, with the constant, however, of a very limited number of ammunition. With the new episode, Into the Dead 2, PikPok wanted to revolutionize the original formula and enrich it from every point of view, giving us a real plot that develops over seven chapters, each divided into stages based on the distance to travel . Therefore, no longer an endless experience as an end in itself, but a title of greater depth, which also introduces numerous facets on the equipment front, considering firearms a fixed point of the gameplay rather than an extemporaneous factor. The protagonist of this new adventure is a man who tries to return home to his wife and daughter as soon as he notices the invasion of zombies, but due to an accident he destroys the van in which he travels and is therefore forced to walk the kilometers that still separate him from his loved ones. Will he be able to arrive in time? Escape from the nightmare In terms of gameplay, those who have had the opportunity to play with the first Into the Dead will have no problem trying their hand at this sequel. The default control system is probably the one that best suits the new approach of the PikPok title, with an invisible virtual stick on the left side of the screen that influences the direction in which we run and pressing the right side to fire the equipped weapon, where of course you have ammunition. It is still possible to choose two other layouts, but as mentioned, the solution identified by the developers provides greater guarantees in terms of precision, responsiveness and immediacy, given that this time we will have to shoot a lot. Each stage includes a series of challenges that can be completed to obtain coins, components, grenades, knives (the latter useful for obtaining a way out if you are grabbed by a zombie, an eventuality that in all other cases translates into the game over), there are some nice variations on the theme (see the fixed machine gun) and, in general, an excellent job has been done to characterize each area in a different way, both in terms of color tones and in the construction of the locations: we pass from wastelands to farms, from hay bales to cornfields, really insidious because it is difficult to identify the presence of zombies among the plants. After a few chapters, a secondary mode is also unlocked based on online comparison between users, called to travel longer and longer journeys and to score as many eliminations as possible. All this is visually represented in a truly excellent way, with graphics that manage to combine detail, effects and fluidity in a single solution, cleverly masking any limits of polygonal modeling. Into the Dead 2 can be downloaded for free from the App Store and Google Play, and the freemium setting obviously doesn't go unnoticed: every now and then an offer pops up that allows you to buy very powerful weapons to be able to proceed in complete tranquility, but the approach to monetization is quite permissive and already watching advertising trailers allows you to get extra loot. The action energy needed to try the game is not consumed too quickly, but starting from the second chapter, the need to do some grinding to make the weapons more effective is evident. Fortunately, it is also a pleasure to replay the missions already completed, perhaps to unlock all the challenges, so this factor weighs only in a very limited way and does not detract from the extraordinary quality of the experience.", "date": "2017-10-18", "grade": "8.8"}
