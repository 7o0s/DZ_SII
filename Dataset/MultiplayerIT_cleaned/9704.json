Her fiercest rival answers to the name of Justice Kreel, and this time she has in mind a not exactly nice prank: stealing Kit's data to complete her last mission, then blowing up her spacecraft to keep her stuck on the planet Hollow Wish. This is the incipit of Blade Kitten, the ~two and a half dimensions~ action game recently released on the PlayStation Store. In the role of the clever Kit, who thanks to her hybrid human-feline nature can count on uncommon physical abilities, we will therefore have to chase Justice and recover the chip necessary to meet our employers, clearly with the aim of completing it quickly, earn a nice nest egg and set off on a new adventure. However, things don't go quite like that: after spending some time on Hollow Wish, the bounty hunter with the cat's ears and tail realizes that things are not going well for the inhabitants of the planet, subjected to an army of less than friendly space soldiers. Between one phase and another of the chase, therefore, we will find ourselves taking sides with prisoners and peasants in their struggle for liberation, facing not only the soldiers mentioned above but also the dangerous dinosaurs that inhabit the subsoil, mysterious carnivorous aliens and a bizarre invasion of robotic warriors. To deal with all these threats we will be able to count on Blade (a faithful sentient sword that floats in mid-air and follows us wherever we go), on the small and pestiferous Skiffy (a sort of strange flying squirrel) and on the nice Noots (a reptile that we can ride in some stages). Platforms, what a passion! Having exhausted the numerous animated cutscenes, which are entrusted with the task of narrating most of the implications of the plot (albeit simplistic), Blade Kitten turns out to be basically a platformer, whose development often follows vertical rather than horizontal paths. In each of the nineteen stages that make up the Krome Studios product, in fact, our goal is not so much to eliminate the enemies, but rather to reach the exit. Unfortunately, the level design doesn't help much in this sense: the constant references to a three-dimensional scenario, visible but not interactable, only make the structure of the locations confusing, which on some occasions require a few moments of reflection to be able to identify the direction to move in. However, it must be said that Kit has a rather complete repertoire of movements, which includes almost all the maneuvers seen in the platformers of the last twenty years: the double jump, the ability to ~bounce~ from one wall to another, the low slide (also usable for offensive purposes), the ~magnetic~ jump on small surfaces (stones, beams, etc.) and last but not least the possibility of using the feline claws to adhere to most of the walls present. In this sense, the unusual use of the sword, which remains suspended in mid-air and does not need to be brandished even during combat (both at close range and from afar), and the fact of being able to stick it into the ground to resist any gusts of air. The combat system turns out to be extremely simple and devoid of particular depth: most of the opponents are eliminated by a single blow, while the toughest enemies require a greater effort but their blows can be parried without too many problems. In this regard, the barrier activation command is at least questionable, which appears by holding down the attack button and which is therefore ineffective when a sudden blow arrives and we have little energy. The speech extends to the boss fights: some ideas are interesting (see the pursuit by the giant creature), others much less (the clash with the robot, for example). Playstation 3 trophies Blade Kitten contains twelve trophies. The seven bronze trophies are obtained by completing objectives such as defeating one hundred enemies, purchasing all four available swords, dying nine times in a stage, etc. The four silver trophies revolve around more complex feats: you have to complete a stage without taking damage, finish the first two acts of the game and find all the treasure chests. The gold trophy is obtained by defeating as many as five thousand enemies: it will take some time to unlock it... The cat goes to the lard anyway... Between double jumps, climbing and a few sword strokes, Blade Kitten's stages slip away morequickly and without proposing a challenge up to expectations. The presence of the few puzzles based on switches to be activated (even using the little Skiffy) and the ~fast~ sections on the back of Noots make the action a little more varied, but the feeling of being faced with a product that requires an adaptation by the player and not vice versa, also due to an annoyingly ~inertial~ control system afflicted by some annoying limits (Kit cannot stoop, he ~obviously suffers from Megaman's disease~...), which does the pair with the general lack of depth and with an artistic direction characterized by ups and downs. The graphics, for example, make ample display of extremely fluid animations which however are not then well ~connected~ to each other, returning a contrasting visual result. The use of cel shading in some situations is pleasant, in others not, and the cutscenes are a great example of this. The stages are well differentiated from each other, but within the same location the background elements are repeated too many times, helping to increase the sense of confusion we mentioned above. In some situations, then, there are heavy slowdowns that would have no reason to be. As far as the sound sector is concerned, the dialogues are at least nice and fairly well recited (in English, with not always precise Italian subtitles), but as far as the music is concerned, we are just not there.", "date": "2010-10-25", "grade": "6.8"}
