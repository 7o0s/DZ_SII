{"name": "Yoku's Island Express", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yokus-island-express-recensione.html", "text": "Let's take advantage of his return to the scene with the inclusion in the Xbox Game with Gold catalog of May 2022 for a review of Yoku's Island Express, thus recovering a pearl that risks being submerged by new releases, but still represents one of the most original expressions of the platform metroidvania, if we can define it that way. For a few years now, the hybrid between platform, action RPG and adventure has gradually codified into what is defined with this strange neologism, which however contains a considerable variety of experiences, all more or less related to the 2D setting and the presence of a base that alternatively leans more towards the platform or more towards the action (RPG or not). Yoku's Island Express follows its own path that has not been followed by anyone else and not even by the Villa Gorilla team itself, since it has never created a sequel, despite the good success achieved. This is because the strange mix underlying the gameplay is difficult to change and has probably already expressed its full potential in this unique and unrepeatable game, which inserts the typical pinball dynamics into the middle of a done and finished Metroidvania platform, with an incredibly harmonious result . The vicissitudes of the postman-beetle grappling with the many problems of the island of Mokumana are built on a remarkable level design work, which is based above all on the action broken up into single ~flipper~ sections rather than on a progression within a complex map, but backtracking and the discovery of new paths, constant progression and the discovery of secrets are not lacking here either. It's a bizarre and rare encounter between disparate gameplay elements, but they manage to give rise to a fresh and very good experience, one that is worth discovering in case you haven't already done so in the past. A heroic postman Yoku's Island Express: Yoku meets the old postman of the island When Yoku receives a new assignment as the new postmaster on the island paradise of Mokumana, he enthusiastically launches into his new job without realizing that it hides a series of significant problems. On the other hand, some suspicion emerges as soon as he arrives on the island and discovers that the old postman is strangely eager to leave as soon as possible and leave the hot potato in the hands of the little beetle (hands already busy rolling his personal ball , it must be a skua). A few sentences of circumstance and then the vague warning about an impending threat on the island, for which the old pterodactyl (or whatever) is happy to see a fresh young man take his old job: within a few seconds we are already amidst the chaos. The island of Mokumana is in fact a paradise on earth, but has recently been attacked by a dark threat that aims to destabilize the balance by eliminating the ancient deities that regulate its life, and the mission to put everything right falls right on head of the local Post Office, strangely. In the typical metroidvania style, the progression of Yoku's Island Express is based on discovering new parts of the map and carrying out the various missions proposed by the inhabitants of the island, as well as having to solve situations and problems that suddenly emerge along the way. However, the basic mechanics of the gameplay are decidedly outside the more traditional canon of the genre, focused on what is the distinctive feature of Yoku: the fact of always carrying one's ball with one, which becomes an interaction tool as well as a real vehicle for travel, according to the particular physics present in the game. Gameplay between metroidvania and pinball Yoku's Island Express, one of the ~pinball~ moments in the game In the classic movement phases we directly control Yoku, who is able to walk in the two directions of the two-dimensional plane and roll the sphere in front of him, but most of the movements derive from the activation of mobile platforms and paddles that work precisely like the pinball bumpers: associated with the two triggers, these can launch the ball - and consequently Yoku, tied to it in every situation - at various angles depending on the angle at which it is hit. The result is a strange platform in which jumps and fast movements are delegated to the use of these elements of the scenario, which open up rather particular situations. In some cases we are dealing with moving platforms to be unlocked by spending a certain amount of fruit collected around the levels, with these switches actually allowing you to jump, since Yoku can't do it, and take us to new parts of the scenario. In many cases, however, it entersreal pinball phases, with Yoku and the ball ending up being the protagonists of quick sessions that work just like a typical game of the famous arcade game. Everything behaves exactly as you would expect: with the left trigger the left paddles move, with the right trigger the right ones and you have to try to prevent the ball from falling into the space between them. At the same time we can launch Yoku in daring and intricate paths in search of bonuses, triggering various rebounds and reactions that can open new paths and take us to other areas of the map. Yoku's Island Express, a moment of exploration of the island It is a very original system, perhaps more superficial and simpler than the typical metroidvania mechanics based on combat or movement skill, but which also entertains by virtue of its freshness and novelty, at least as long as Yoku's journey lasts up to the conclusion of the game. There are also other elements that enrich the interaction with scenarios and characters, expanding the game situations: objects and supports that are discovered along the way and deepen the gameplay a bit, but in general the basic dynamics always remain that of the platform-pinball machine, with the positive and negative aspects of an approach entirely based on the speed and immediacy of the action. Between beauty and strangeness Yoku's Island Express, a scene from the game The general strangeness of Yoku's Island Express is also reflected in its graphics, characterized by a drawn 2D style that alternates a great pleasure in the overall view of the natural settings in which we move to some almost disturbing details, in the creation of the creatures that populate the 'island. Everything contributes to giving a very original aspect to the game, which is thus confirmed as a truly unique work in every respect, even on the audio front where all rather nice sound effects increase the charisma of this particular world. In terms of richness and graphic luxuriance we are a bit far from the peaks of Ori and the Will of the Wisps, but despite placing itself in an area close to the Moon Studios masterpiece, this Villa Gorilla title still manages to stand out thanks to its character and to the sympathy that is able to spring. In all this feast of colors and speed, perhaps the design of the map is a bit sacrificed in the end: given the particular structure of the game, the construction of the paths is a little less whimsical than is often seen in other metroidvanias and the fact of necessarily having to go through the pinball phases to take some paths makes backtracking, which is obviously present as a must for this type of game, more frustrating than usual. However, these are modest defects that result as inevitable consequences of such a peculiar mechanic.", "date": "2022-05-10", "grade": "8.4"}
