Starting by analyzing the first, or the season or career mode, we are faced with the possibility of creating our own rider, being able to customize it with all the clothing of the most famous brands in motocross, from Shoei helmets to Axo boots just to name a few. some. After choosing the make of the bike and your name and jersey number, you can start playing, following a path in stages decided by the computer according to a hypothetical calendar. The idea of the career mode is very nice, with the possibility of switching categories and so on, if it weren't for the rather approximate technical realization of the graphic and playful aspect. The first thing that annoys is the poor performance of the vehicle physics which is anything but realistic, with jerky and imprecise as well as awkward movements of your alter ego. Just to mention the grossest aspect, while skipping a ~panettone~ you can move the bike back and forth with extreme ease, as if gravity did not exist, in spite of reality! For Ricky Carmichael fans The difficulty of the product is also too unbalanced, with an initial tournament that even my 7-year-old cousin finished without too many problems and a national tournament that gave me a hard time, an aspect which, however, should not be confused with the concept of enjoyment or challenge, but with needless frustration. Well, that's the right term, it's a frustrating game, with no artificial intelligence and opponents who do everything to throw you off the road (nice sportsmanship!), with the result that one fall is enough to see an entire race compromised, since perhaps only with a perfect continuation can you be able to win. Incidentally, avoid any trick in the race because if you fall, goodbye podium! The graphics are not up to the Ps2 hardware, especially after seeing ATV Offroad (without wanting to bother with the wonderful Gt3), with just enough depths and the bike that seems to skate rather than grip the terrain of the various circuits. The sensation of speed is then practically absent and this makes everything very boring and flat. Switching to the other mode, or freestyle, the situation improves albeit slightly. In this case we are only asked to choose a pilot (perhaps the one already created in the career mode) and indulge ourselves in evolutions that can be performed through the combination of several keys. The aim is to score the highest number of points because the computer will evaluate each of our jumps with a score depending on the difficulty of the trick and style, as well as the landing, which is fundamental, because maybe you made a scary jump but landed while falling, so 0 points! At first everything turns out to be a lot of fun, especially if played against a friend in split-screen, but once you learn all the combinations, the challenges become boring and repetitive with the achievement of stratospheric scores. The only thing that is saved is the soundtrack with a really tough soundtrack that blends well with the spirit of the game and that gives the product that extra pinch of ~malice~ that doesn't hurt. Ultimately we are faced with a mediocre product that I recommend only to fans of the genre and fans of Ricky Carmicheal! Pros: Soundtrack 2 player Freestyle .it's Ricky Carmicheal Cons: Physics of movement Longevity Playability Motorcycle, overalls, helmet and lots of mud! A few months after the release of the excellent ATV Offroad we are faced with another title that proposes racing with off-road vehicles as a concept, even if this time on two wheels. The game tries to present itself as the consul's alter ego of the pc-istic Motocross Madness, proposing all the features that made the Microsoft title famous. In fact, we have both the classic season with successive races and the more spectacular freestyle. Unfortunately, however, what is spectacular is only the presentation, in which incredible images of tricks performed by real tightrope walkers of this fascinating sport are shown. With this beginning, the hype created in the gamer is very high but, on the contrary, once you pick up the dualshock and start playing, you immediately get the impression that something is not right. Before passing to any judgment it must be stated that the game must be evaluated by dividing it into two distinct parts and more precisely according to the aforementioned methods.", "date": "2001-10-08", "grade": null}
