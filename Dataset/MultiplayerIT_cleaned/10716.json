{"name": "Boom Blox 2: La Vendetta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/boom-blox-2-la-vendetta.html", "text": "History teaches us that the forays of show business personalities into the world of videogames are unlikely to result in qualitatively impeccable products, but last year Boom Blox was able to constitute a very pleasant exception to the rule: conceived by Steven Spielberg, the game obtained an excellent critical success and good support from the public, confirming the validity of the playful intuitions of the famous director. Now comes a second chapter which, as per tradition, promises to be ~bigger and better~. Two is better than uan It is evident how Spielberg drew inspiration for the Boom Blox concept by thinking of one of the most ancestral and rooted sources of entertainment in the human soul: the destruction of existing structures for the sole purpose of being demolished. Anyone who has dealt with the first chapter knows that the sensations it gives are comparable to those felt as children, when a building was razed to the ground (be it a sand castle or a house made with LEGO) for the just the fun of it. This is basically what the user is called upon to do in the EA product, and which this Smash Party only multiplies to the nth degree. The game is divided into different stages for setting, characteristics and objectives, but united however by the need to destroy - in one way or another - the agglomeration of blocks on the screen. This is possible by taking advantage of a series of tools that vary according to the occasion: you can therefore find yourself tearing apart a structure by throwing bowling balls, collapsing blocks with baseballs or throwing bombs in an attempt to give rise to devastating explosions. Going into more detail, Boom Blox Smash Party offers the beauty of over 400 levels and a greater amount of playful variables than its illustrious predecessor. First of all, there are new tools that guarantee an even more marked variety of action: worthy of mention are the slingshot, with which you can select a block of the structure and launch it in the desired direction, and the so-called ~virus balls~, which allow you to infect the neutral elements adjacent to the point of impact causing their disintegration. There are even striking cases in which the use of a particular tool leads to types of gameplay so different as to seem to belong to another title: this is the case of the paint balls, which allow you to change the color of a block, thus putting the user in the condition of aligning three or more of the same color in order to make them disappear from the screen, in full match'em up style. Still, it is worth noting the return with great pomp of methods inherited from the first chapter, above all a sort of Jenga clone where it is necessary to extract the parallelepipeds from a structure without causing the collapse of the malus blocks, suitably placed in strategic areas. Long live physics As it is easy to guess from the facts described so far, Boom Blox Smash Party is not a mere data disk with an avalanche of levels more than the original, but it enriches an already particularly inviting dish with new elements, without forgetting to improve the existing ones. The physics that regulates the game scenarios must be included under this last category, made even more convincing and useful for playful purposes: seeing a complex structure of blocks probably collapse to the ground after a well-aimed blow is a real pleasure, especially when it is considered that, in the real world, the effects would have been very similar. The control system, on the other hand, is confirmed in its exceptional simplicity, requiring the user only to aim at the desired target, press the A key and move the Remote to perform the action proper to the instrument being used. On the novelty front, the new scenarios that act as an ~active~ side dish to the action make a good impression: therefore, the levels set in space will force the player to destroy blocks in the absence of gravity, while those with a submarine setting will pave the way to new objectives, such as that of bringing back to the surface as many pieces as possible. The subtitle Smash Party is then confirmed in a multiplayer mode enhanced in all respects compared to the counterpart of the prequel: there are many internships that can be tackled in cooperative or competitive sauce, and for an immediate game like Boom Blox this is certainly not a fact to be underestimated . As if the amount of content described so far weren't enough, EA has finally revived the level editor, making it leaner and more intuitive and allowing users to put their creations online and share them with other senno more having to go through the hassle of Friend Codes. If the software house then confirms its intentions to constantly update the product with new downloadable levels, we have a potentially infinite puzzle game on our hands.", "date": "2009-05-21", "grade": "8.9"}
