The long single player campaign puts the player in the role of a king, committed to ending the chaos unleashed by barbarians and enemy kingdoms, who impose heavy tributes on small defenseless villages. Before starting the individual missions, it will be necessary to choose one of the two heroes available, while others will be added as the story continues. Each of these, in addition to being in fact the only unit that can be moved freely (therefore essential for exploring the map and being assigned new missions), has a passive and an active ability. For example, Alandra can heal units, while Elias can benefit the economy. The typical campaign mission initially involves developing a robust economy by constructing buildings near resources. Some of these such as wood or wheat (obtainable through the fields) are not highlighted on the map, while others such as game, fish and mineral resources are recognizable by special icons. Each building can be upgraded by increasing the number of floors and the resulting workforce. Each of the 10 basic resources, once stored, can be used in different ways depending on the availability of the moment. For example, wood can be used not only to build and upgrade buildings, but also to make brooms, arches, benches, while from the carcasses of hunted animals it is possible to obtain skins, soap bars and sausages. One of a kind gameplay To boost the economy or keep it on certain levels when some resources run out, it will be necessary to conquer the surrounding territories, provided of course that these have not already been occupied. In fact, each map is divided into regions, and establishing an outpost allows you to collect its resources, preventing your opponents from doing the same. At the beginning only a few buildings are available, but upon reaching specific conditions, our hero will be promoted to a higher rank, allowing the construction of new structures and providing new actions such as the possibility of organizing parties and lents useful for improving the conditions of the city. The objectives during the missions represent a point in favor of the title, given the great variety of tasks that it will be necessary to complete also to better learn the mechanics of the game. As complex as these may appear, the perfectly calibrated learning curve and extremely complete interface allow you to always keep everything under control over a few missions. As for the battles, these provide in addition to the hero, only three types of combat units, namely foot soldiers, archers and siege engines. Although the game focuses entirely on the management of the empire, a little more was to be expected in terms of variety. On the online front, the matches are affected by the management of resources thus developed, with the consequence that at least 20-30 minutes of play will be needed before setting up an army worthy of the name. While on the one hand this may appear irritating in the eyes of online strategy enthusiasts, it must also be said that managing one's economy well, exploring the map and exchanging resources with neutral units, constitutes a dish that is not at all despicable for those looking for something less frantic. Fairytale landscapes The graphics engine of The Settlers: Rise of an Empire proves equal to the situation from all points of view. Units and buildings are well done, even if in the long run they can be difficult to distinguish from each other. The deliberately classic style will make fans of the series feel immediately at home, even if compared to the first four episodes there is a greater ~seriousness~ of characters and structures. The fully 3D map allows you to zoom with the mouse wheel to frame the individual units. Although the test configuration is beyond the recommended requirements, the graphics system proves to be quite heavy and sometimes a little slow. The landscapes, although they don't make a miracle cry, vary over the seasons and are quite rich in details such as ruins and animals of various kinds. The audio is all in English, but perfectly subtitled in our language, as are the menus and the manual. The background music is all in all pleasant, even if in the long run it is a bit repetitive. System requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: 2 GHz Pentium IV or AMD equivalent RAM: 512 MB Video Card: GeForce or Radeon with 128 MB of memory (256 MB for Windows Vista) Free Spacesco: 3 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.66 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: Geforce 7300 with 256 MB memory Comment The Settlers: Rise of an Empire distances itself from most real-time strategy games with deep resource management and somewhat slow but not tactically invalid gameplay. Fans of the saga will find exactly what they are looking for in this episode, that is the classic medieval world where the likeable protagonists think first of prospering and then of fighting, exactly the opposite compared to the other RTS. On the technical front, audio and graphics are quite good even if at times the latter proves heavy. Pros Great graphics Wide variety of missions Well designed interface Cons Slow gameplay Few military units Map a bit heavy The Settlers: Rise of an Empire is available for PC. The Settlers saga is one of the longest-running real-time strategy games. From the first episode dating back to 1993, a lot of water has passed under the bridge, and the series has taken particular directions related to gameplay over the course of the various chapters. The Settlers traditionally has a deliberately slow gameplay, where the collection of resources and the needs of individuals play a decidedly important role. If in the strategic classics it is enough to have cultivated fields to have a ready-to-use resource, in The Settlers the wheat obtained must be taken to the mill to obtain flour and then to the baker to transform it into bread. In the fifth episode entitled Heritage of Kings, there had been a change of course, given the simplified economic phase in favor of the war phase and the introduction of heroes. This sixth chapter entitled The Birth of an Empire, represents a return to the origins of the saga, given the over 30 buildings available, the 10 resources and 18 types of goods.", "date": "2007-10-09", "grade": null}
