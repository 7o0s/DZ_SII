Let's find out in the fun endless-style action platform developed by Everplay Interactive and available on the App Store for free, in the traditional freemium format. The game, which comes with nice pixel art-style graphics, colorful and lively, is a ~run & gun~ to all intents and purposes, since it asks us to proceed rapidly towards the right side of the screen but not in an automatic context , but by moving freely, as in a normal platformer, and opening fire on the aliens who block our way. The point is that at the top of the screen there is a timer that we must take care to ~flesh out~ by collecting certain objects, because when the time runs out, a spaceship will arrive which, using a tractor beam, will take us away from the scenario, triggering the game over. A far from simple situation, but one that an action movie star like Bill Killem - who in the intentions of the developers is a bit like saying Chuck Norris or, more consistently, Duke Nukem - doesn't fear in any way, and who decides to face abandoning his vacation in Las Vegas to rush back to Los Angeles, the scene of the sudden invasion. Bill Killem is a cute and fun endless-style action platformer, but a little too difficult Kill Bill The platforms are the masters in Bill Killem, and fortunately the touch control system (equipped with an essential layout: two arrows and two buttons) proves to be precise and reactive enough to allow us to take normal or double leaps to go from a roof to a container, from a scaffolding to the arm of a crane, all while hordes of aliens come towards us armed to the teeth, or descend from the sky in their most annoying variant, that is, the one that in case of contact causes the instantaneous death of the our character. However, the arsenal available to Bill is particularly large and changes according to the objects we collect during the crossing: from the machine gun to the rocket launcher, from the laser to the flamethrower, from the shotgun to the double pistol, there is no shortage of instruments of death and the hero does not hold back whenever he has the opportunity to dispense it, perhaps by shooting in advance or on the fly to avoid dangerous pauses and not lose the rhythm. The presence of cunning and dangerous traps, such as bombing from above, represents an extra headache for our distance record, but in the end the mechanisms that traditionally characterize endless productions come into play and we therefore pass from one game to another another in rapid succession, with the constant of an experience level that grows as we complete the achievements, as well as a quantity of gold coins with which to buy alternative costumes or an upgrade that gives extra speed to our shots. Too bad that the other upgrades are paid only, and that in the same way the possibility of continuing after the game over soon requires a quantity of coins that only an in-app purchase could guarantee us. Small limitations in the general picture of a fun and carefree product, but which inevitably loses its charm in the long run due to the survival structure and a too ~hasty~ difficulty balance.", "date": "2014-05-29", "grade": "7.2"}
