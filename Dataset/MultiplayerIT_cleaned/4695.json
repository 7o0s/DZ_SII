The interesting thing is that structurally the experience alternates a strategic phase, in which we move our units within a map divided into sectors, trying to conquer strategic areas and to replenish the divisions before carrying out our offensive; and an action phase, which is represented on the screen in a very similar way to the most famous third person shooters for PC and console. As a further substrate there is the freemium element, which through the release of gold bars and supply crates allows you to enhance not only the soldiers but also the strongholds, the last bulwark against the enemy. In short, we are talking about a very multifaceted and, as mentioned, ambitious product, equipped with well-made graphics and relatively varied scenarios. Have the developers therefore been able to pack a solid experience in all its aspects? Not exactly. War ennobles A tutorial guides us through the early stages of Noblemen: 1896, and it's fortunate since there are many mechanisms to understand and you need to do a little practice before assimilating all the concepts that revolve around the experience. As mentioned, the battles alternate between a strategic phase and an action phase: during the first we will have to position ourselves in the points of interest to acquire a tactical advantage, for example by occupying a supply base, to then move towards the enemy position and attack it from a distance, with a jet of bullets, or open face. In that case we move on to the third person shooter phase, with a soldier that we control directly and who, moving on fairly sized but generally bare maps, must identify and eliminate enemy units in collaboration with his companions. There are ambushes to be exploited to avoid exposing yourself directly to hostile fire, and from there lean out to aim and shoot at your opponents, but in these situations, the most important, the experience of Noblemen: 1896 proves to be a bit too chaotic and approximate; also due to an artificial intelligence that leaves much to be desired, with enemies that move around without noticing us and a general cumbersome gameplay. Coming to terms with the limits of the game you have fun, also and above all thanks to the strategic substrate and a rather rich structure, with two main methods to be exploited for the inevitable grinding, but in principle the vision of Foursaken Media is probably not been implemented in the best possible way and with the next updates it will be necessary to sharply file the edges.", "date": "2017-09-06", "grade": "7.0"}
