The number of enthusiasts, bewitched by the refined physical-dynamic model of the simulator, has continued to grow - and still continues today - not only thanks to simple players, but also to insiders in the automotive world, as confirmed several times by the developers. Interviewing the co-founder and chief programmer Stefano Casillo, we discovered that the Porsche engineers are among the most enthusiastic about their work, and it was precisely this great interest in Assetto Corsa that prompted the prestigious Stuttgart company to approach Marco Massarutto (the other boss of Kunos Simulazioni) during a sector fair. In short, it is yet another source of pride for the Italian team, also in light of the exclusivity of the Porsche brand within driving simulators. The rest is a love story with a happy ending that blossomed with a very solid partnership, culminating in the DLC deal and a spectacular joint press event - manager Sebastian Hornungh was present for Porsche - which we attended last November 18 with the support of 505 Games, the publishing division of the Digital Bros group. To understand how close the bond has become between the companies, just think that Porsche brought three legendary cars to Vallelunga on display in the official museum in Stuttgart; the marvelous 918 Spyder which broke the stratospheric time of 6:57 minutes at the Nurburgring and two successful sports prototypes at the 24H of Le Mans, namely the historic 962C Long Tail driven by Bell, Stuck and Holbert and the 2015 919 Hybrid, this 'last still marked by dirt and scratches ~conquered~ in the race. In addition, we were able to take to the track with a platoon of 911 Carrera 4S and 2S to further evaluate the proximity between the cars of the German brand and those reproduced in the simulator, present in force with various PC stations (equipped with Nvidia 1080 ) and PlayStation 4. Not only that, in the box where the 919 Hybrid was parked there were also a couple of official Porsche simulators, also modeled on the Assetto Corsa code. The event, in which Sparco also participated as official partner, allowed us to test some models of the Porsche Pack 2 after the numerous home tests; before diving into the analysis of the DLC, as always accompanied by updates and code fixes, we remind you that the excellent Porsche Pack 1 reviewed a few weeks ago on PC will be released on November 29th also on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The Porsche Pack 2 brings some of the most iconic and desired racing cars of the German company to Assetto Corsa Jewels on four wheels The first Stuttgart racing car to end up under our magnifying glass is a car quite loved and known by players, having also been the absolute protagonist of a good racing game released about twenty years ago on the first PlayStation. We are talking about the Porsche Challenge and of course the Porsche Boxster, a roadster so called due to the fusion between the name of the engine equipped (the boxer with opposed cylinders) and that of the category it belongs to. In Assetto Corsa's Porsche Pack 2 we don't find the original 1996 series, but the latest proposal in two variants, namely the 718 Boxster S with manual gearbox and the one with the iconic seven-speed PDK. The car is practically the ~open~ twin sister of the 718 Cayman S, a model that we have already analyzed in the excellent Porsche Pack 1. The numbers and performance are there to prove it: top speed of 285 km/h, 0-100 km/h in 4.6 seconds (4.2 with the Sport Chrono Package), 350 horsepower and 420 Nm of torque. Easy to drive, balanced and with extremely efficient brakes, it is a very pleasant car and capable of giving great satisfaction on Assetto Corsa, also thanks to the roar of the engine which begins to roar around 180 km/h. The polygonal model looks stunning both indoors and outdoors. The second road version linked to the Porsche Pack 2 update and made free for everyone is a car which, when it was announced, struggled a lot to be accepted by enthusiasts of the brand, even though it quickly turned into a commercial success. We are talking about the Cayenne SUV, the first for Porsche, which has been traveling the roads and dirt roads around the world since 2003. Made in collaboration with Volkswagen, the Cayenne reached the second series in 2010 after some restyling, and last year it was newmind passed by the ~cosmetic surgeon~ for the final touch up. In Assetto Corsa it is present with the powerful Turbo S version with 570 horsepower, 800 Nm of torque, a maximum speed of 284 km/h and acceleration almost worthy of a 911 Carrera, being capable of detaching 0-100 km/h in just 4, 1 seconds. The beast, equipped with huge rims and very elegant leather interiors (splendid with the Palladium livery), weighs a good 2,235 kilograms and this is reflected in grip, balance and brakes, which, although very good, cannot be compared with those of a sports car of race. The polygonal model is excellent and the only flaws are some shadows cast by the mirrors and aliasing on the rear window, even in 4K. Finally, the sound of the engine is very nasty and is enhanced from third gear upwards. The package also includes the Cayman GT4, the road version of the Cayman GT4 Clubsport already analyzed in the first Porsche Pack. The car, cleaned up of purely racing elements such as the tubular reinforcement frame and the digital display in the center of the dashboard, looks very similar to the trackday model in behavior, while losing something in terms of performance due to the less rigid setting and other details. Overall it is an excellent vehicle, very balanced and which can be pushed to the limit without too much effort. Gorgeous polygonal model. We close the overview on road cars with one of the queens of the Porsche Pack 2, the marvelous 911 GT3 RS, a wicked version of the iconic 911 Carrera. All it takes is a glance to fall in love with it, and once you hit the track, perhaps on the Nurburgring Nordschleife, you will never want to take your hands off the wheel. The numbers, moreover, are a real attack on the coronary: 500 horsepower, 310 km/h top speed and an exceptional 0-100 km/h in just 3.1 seconds. If that weren't enough for you, what makes it extraordinary on Assetto Corsa is its behavior on the track; for stability, precision, effectiveness on mixed terrain and explosiveness over the long run it has practically no equal in the same category, furthermore the brakes are very efficient. The polygonal model is superb both in the exterior and in the very sporty interior, and the sound is also sampled beautifully. It is one of the most exciting cars ever reproduced in a simulator and one of the best racing cars featured in the work Kunos Simulazioni. Track lord If road-going Porsches are among the sports cars most loved by motorists (even by those who generally snub the category), racing cars include real motorsport legends. The first included in Porsche Pack 2 is none other than the 718 RS, built between the late 1950s and early 1960s and translated from the famous 550 Spyder. The 718 name that stands out on the very modern Cayman and Boxster is a tribute to this model, and in particular to its four-cylinder engine. With 150 horsepower, 148 Nm of torque and a weight of just 580 kilograms, the 718 RS 60 reaches a top speed of 230 km/h. On Assetto Corsa it is a rather simple historic car to drive compared to the others, and only when you have too heavy a foot does it start to give some nervousness and oversteer problems. The polygonal model is absolutely splendid, especially in the interiors where several peculiar details can be seen; for example, the wear and tear caused by time can be seen behind the distinctive circular analog gauges. The exteriors are only marred by a flickering effect on the large rear grilles, while the engine performs its task very well. From the small 718 RS 60 we move on to the very fast 911 GT1 '98, a classic Sport Prototype built to participate in endurance races and in particular in the famous 24H of Le Mans. Derived from a 1995 project, the 1998 version was particularly important for Porsche, as thanks to its reliability it managed to establish itself in the famous French race, to the detriment of more listed opponents on paper. With its 600 horsepower, 950 kilograms of weight and a maximum speed of 350 km/h it is naturally an extreme car, however Assetto Corsa is not only a pleasure to drive and great fun, but it can be pushed to the limit without being excessively frustrating learning curve. The polygonal model, excellent like those of the other Porsches, manages to amaze above all for the interiors; the dashboard is a sort of vertical wall (branded IBM) crammed with levers and buttons, while the mustard-colored digital display shows huge numbers to be easily seen by the pilot. The passenger compartment, unlike those of other sports prototypes, has excellent visibility and for this reason too the 911 GT1 '98 is particularlyinteresting mind to drive. The sound of the engine is splendid, whose sinister hiss emitted when the car is stationary promises sparks; the sound effects of squeaks and metal clutches heard in the race are also spectacular, dramatically increasing the level of involvement and realism. From an aesthetic point of view, we point out the presence of the characteristic (and not exactly loved by purists) drop-shaped headlights, linked to the 911 Carreras of that period. With a slight leap back in time we get on board the 962C developed in the second half of the 80s, another Sport Prototype present on Assetto Corsa in the ~Long Tail~ and ~Short Tail~ variants, names linked to the peculiar rear aerodynamics. These cars boast an incredible series of successes in endurance races (24H of Le Mans, 24H of Daytona, 12H of Sebring etc etc) and are among the most victorious of the Stuttgart company; being able to admire a Long Tail with your own eyes at the Vallelunga event was a magnificent surprise, as well as further confirmation of the excellent work done by the Kunos Simulazioni graphics in recreating the models, both inside and out. With 780 horsepower, 900 kilograms of weight and 710 Nm of torque, the 962C is the most complex car of the package to drive, also due to the absence of ABS and TCS and the tendency to oversteer, although it is not in the least difficulties touched by the monstrous 917/30 present in the Porsche Pack 1. The 1987 Long Tail version, in addition to presenting white rims by BBS and peculiar interiors by Bosch, has a behavior similar but not identical to that of the Short Tail due to the different aerodynamics, moreover it has more sensitive brakes which block the wheels in advance . Very good but not extraordinary sampling of the engine. We close our analysis with the magnificent 2015 919 Hybrid, also brought to the Vallelunga racetrack to celebrate the event. The car, introduced in 2014, is the direct heir of the 911 GT1 '98, given that the German company had not participated in the premier class of endurance racing (now LM-P1) since the withdrawal of the previous and victorious racing car. The return to the track was truly explosive and in the new ~FIA World Endurance Championship~ the 919 took some prestigious victories, in particular the 24H of Le Mans in 2015. Powered by a 2.0 L aluminum (supercharged) engine capable of unleashing 500 horsepower and an electric unit (MGU) which brings the total calculation of horses to 900, the car manages to detach the 0-100 km/h in just 2.2 seconds. On Assetto Corsa, the model is perfectly replicated from a technological and aesthetic point of view, as we were able to see for ourselves while admiring the car parked at the racetrack. Characterized by an enormous ~dorsal fin~ and purely racing interiors, where curiously the design of the Le Mans circuit can be seen, the car drives superbly, however requiring great attention in the management of the technology. Among other things, by not equipping the ABS, it is necessary to pay close attention to braking at 300 km/h. The sound of the hybrid heart is also excellent, characterized by a curious buzz mixed with a really bad hiss. Too bad I couldn't listen to it also in Vallelunga.", "date": "2016-11-22", "grade": null}
