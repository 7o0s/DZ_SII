In this we are simply explained the basic controls of the game, but we are also given an idea of where the whole project wants to go. To provide us with explanations on the various movements and actions that can be performed is David Cage, the game designer of Fahrenheit who presents himself, without too many preambles, as director. The setting in which the tutorial takes place is a film studio (a Hollywood-style shed, in short) and the controlled character (only in this situation) is a crash test dummy (you know the puppets that are used in the crash tests of car?). From this preliminary phase it is possible to understand how elaborate the control system is but, at the same time, simple and intuitive in order to be functional and impeccable even during the most agitated phases of the game: with four keys the character moves while with the mouse interacts with the environment. The four directions of the X and Y axes of the mouse are assigned different interactions each time, so that they are always contextual to the action (for example, if a door is to the right of the character, the interaction to open it will be linked to the ~right~ movement). Two other keys are used to: rotate the view, perform actions under effort and perform other actions of various kinds (determined from time to time by the context). The actions under effort consist in an alternating pressure of the two keys to be performed as quickly as possible (do you know Combat School or, better, Track'n'Field?). Finally there are the so-called PAR sequences in which, in the middle of the screen, two circles divided into four segments will appear: the left circle is linked to the movement keys, the right circle to the interaction keys; to correctly pass these sequences, all you have to do is perform the movements corresponding to the segments that will gradually light up. Said like this it seems complicated but, especially if you have a joypad with two analog sticks (console owners are all included in the latter category), you will find that we are facing one of the most ingenious control interfaces born in recent years . Studio stuff Angelo Badalamenti How not to dedicate a box to Angelo Badalamenti, author of the Fahrenheit soundtrack? Most will know him for having composed the soundtrack of some recent films (Evilenko and Cabin Fever to name a couple) but others will certainly remember him for the importance that his orchestrations have had in the making of the most important films by David Lynch, one of the greatest living directors (for those who have never heard of him. How can we forget the splendid music of Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, A True Story, Wild Heart, Lost Roads?) Even in Fahrenheit his signature is unmistakable and the music of Accompaniments play an essential role in giving the game its appeal. Do we call the Cahiers du cinema? Since the opening sequence, Quantic Dream's ambition to produce something anomalous compared to what the market has had to offer up to now is evident, even if the fear of being faced with a promise that will result in the usual clichs still looms large videogames. The idea one gets when observing the flight of the crow through the snow, while the virtual camera describes an overview of Manhattan, is that one is faced with a possible interactive film, with all the positive and negative that this can entail . Even the opening credits have a strongly cinematographic flavor (especially the ticking of Angelo Badalamenti's name among the others gives the illusion of being inside a cinema for a moment ... read the box dedicated to him to find out more) as do the various shots and background music. Nothing particularly strange or innovative, however. Unfortunately, especially in recent years, the excellent initial impressions have often given way to bitter disappointments with proceeding inside the limbs of various video games ... but let's not digress. Lucas Kane is in the bathroom of a diner where, in a trance, he kills a man by stabbing him three times. During this altered state she has vivid visions of another hooded man and a little girl. Once he wakes up, he immediately becomes aware of what he has done. He will therefore have to, guided by the player, be able to hide as much evidence as possible before a policeman, sitting inside the diner, gets up to come to the bathroom. This scene (the game is divided into several more or less long chapters), which is also that of the demo, immediately highlights aSome of the main characteristics of Fahrenheit: the possibility of carrying out different actions which determine a different development of minimal events and the presence of a precise direction which, in a skilful and studied way, describes the elements of the game without weighing down the narration and without interfering too much with the 'action. However, a myth must be immediately dispelled; it is true that some events change in relation to the actions performed or not by the player, but these are always details that do not modify the unfolding of the plot (they often serve, very simplistically, to raise or lower the stress of the characters, a feature we will talk about subsequently), which nonetheless follows its own rigid and well-defined line. For example, it is true that Lucas in the first sequence can perform various actions that have repercussions in the following one (for one thing, he can choose whether to take the taxi or the subway to escape from the crime scene, giving the investigators Carla and Tyler, two other controllable characters which we will talk about later, one more or less test to discover his identity) but it is equally true that the story does not actually change one iota and that, in any case, the major events and the main narrative turning points will always take place in the same scenes and in the manner desired by the ~direction~. Speaking of directing, it is impossible not to notice how Fahrenheit has broken through some doors as regards the language of narrative video games (also thanks to the collaboration of the developers with the Center National de la Cinematographie). Not only is each shot studied in detail, with insertions of windows and divisions of the screen (which are very reminiscent of the language of comics) designed to show essential elements (such as the policeman approaching the bathroom in the first sequence or the arrival of police cars at the scene of another crime in a later scene of the game) which give strong drama to the action; but there is also a narrative thought from which the desire to convey a personal vision through the playful medium emerges. The Official Strategy Guide of Multiplayer.it! Fahrenheit is a game with surprising qualities that deserves to be explored so as not to miss any detail. The Official Strategy Guide is valid for all versions of the game and can also be purchased at our Shopping. The Fahrenheit paradox We now need to talk about one of the key elements of the game. In the second scene we will take control of the other two protagonists of the story; the aforementioned Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles. Carla is an investigator of Italian origin operating in the NYPD, while Tyler, a black American who grew up in the decay of the Bronx, is her assistant. The two will have to inspect the diner in search of testimonies and clues that lead them to discover the identity of the murderer. Thinking about it, it seems that there is something not right and that leads us to ask ourselves some questions: but how, in the previous sequence, did we struggle to hide the evidence of Lucas' act as best we could, and in this one we must be able to find it? So which side is the player on? The Fahrenheit paradox It is in this paradox that most of the game's narrative charm lies, in this dual role in which we know much more than the characters, even though we don't know everything, and we control them in their partial unconsciousness, guiding them towards the unveiling of the mystery. In Fahrenheit we are called to carry out a double investigation, a double path that leads to a single point. The more you go on, the more the plot thickens; the more the elements available to the player multiply, the more one realizes that this doubling of identification is one of the most fascinating and involving elements of the entire production. A perfect cocktail? As you progress through the game, you become aware of other interesting and beautifully crafted elements. Let's start with a fact: Fahrenheit is a fully narrated video game. However, unlike other areas in which the narration has been entrusted to very long filmed or dialogue sequences, in which the player is nothing more than an inert sack in front of the screen, a simple passive spectator who does not intervene at all in what he watches, here there are no cinematic and/or dialogue sequences in which one is left without doing anything. Another brilliant idea that the guys from Quantic Dream had is to insert ~action~ within more properly narrative sequences. Let's take for example a dialogue like (forgive me if I avoid quoting most of the scenes in a precise way, but I don't want to reveal anything about the plot of the game so as not to risk spoiling the many twists and turns): Carladialogue with the Coroner; during the dialogue she is called to perform PAR sequences to be able to guess details that otherwise would escape her. This involves two things: the first is that, based on his skill, the player can obtain additional narrative elements (which in any case do not compromise the progress of the game, if they did compromise it you would have the inevitable game over); the second is that you never stay still for too long watching something alien move on the screen, but you are always and in any case attentive to the evolution of events in order to be able to intervene where required. Thus, even the most frenetic and spectacular action sequences, which other designers would have made into just nice movies to watch with popcorn in hand, here become spectacular interactive sequences, beautifully shot and accompanied by excellent music. The stress system and other gameplay elements functional to the action There is also a character stress system within Fahrenheit. A vertical bar at the bottom right indicates how much the character we are controlling is more or less stressed. Many of the actions performed during the different scenes will increase or decrease this stress. If the bar drops too much we risk seeing the characters go mad or, worse, commit suicide. The importance of this simple feature lies in the narrative function (for a change) that it assumes in the economy of the action. First, not all interactions that provide us with information are good for our characters' mental health. For example, in the third scene, Lucas can look at a photo on his desk; by doing so you get an interesting detail of his life, but also an increase in his stress. It soon turns out that many of the interactions available in the different scenarios serve precisely to increase or decrease this stress. Apparently secondary actions such as urinating, drinking a glass of water, listening to a song, can be a panacea following a particularly stressful event. Continuing to talk about gameplay elements functional to the action, one cannot fail to notice how the developers have taken care to make many ~advertisements~ designed to develop some themes and some characters. For example, in a scene set in a narrow dungeon, we will learn that one of the characters suffers from claustrophobia. This translates into having to control their breathing, represented by a swaying bar, in order not to make them suffer panic attacks. But this is just one example of the numerous advertisements in the game, the others I leave to you the pleasure of discovering them. Technically speaking From a technical point of view, Fahrenheit stands out above all thanks to the accuracy and richness of the animations and the beauty of the more frenetic animated sequences (shot with rare skill). On a purely visual level we are on excellent levels (at least by PS2 and Xbox standards), with small settings full of details and with very good quality textures. Some touches, which are part of the peculiar style of the whole production, are real gems: for example the grain that covers the screen for most of the game (which can be deactivated anyway) or some dream sequences created in a simple but very suggestive. Obviously, if we take into consideration the PC version, a platform with technical standards now much higher than the current generation of consoles, the judgment gets worse, but not too much and, understanding that the technique in this case lies not only in what you see but even in how it is shown (I'm talking about the direction that determines the composition of the different elements), it can be deferred and still considered a work well done and superior to many other more glittering but less accurate productions. Then, one can only spend words of praise on the soundtrack of the game: the music is wonderful (we hope that the CD with the soundtrack comes out) and every single sound effect present contributes to creating a unique atmosphere. Extra We also dedicate a small box to the unlockable extras in the game. To activate them you have to buy them by spending points that are assigned by hidden cards in the game (some, however, are unlocked only by passing certain chapters). Don't worry if you can't find them: finishing the adventure gives you many bonus points, enough to buy all the available extras. Among these, in addition to the classic artwork and sketches, there are also some videos of the making of, the possibility of listening to songs from the soundtrack and some extra interactive sequences (such as a skating competition between Carla and Tyler or an erotic dance performed by Sam, the rag", "date": "2005-09-15", "grade": null}
