{"name": "Haven", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/haven-recensione.html", "text": "With a change of course worthy of the best glide, The Game Bakers changes register and after the interesting Furi (you can read our review here) choose to slow down your times and commit yourself to telling a love story: it cannot be defined in no other way is the one between Yu and Kay, the two protagonists of Haven who, alone on an uninhabited planet, will try to build that life together that the Beehive wants to prevent them. That video games have accepted their potential by becoming the vehicle of exciting and multifaceted stories has been known for years, however the intensity with which The Game Bakers stages the pure and uncontaminated love of the two boys, so much so as to integrate it into the game mechanics , is something new. Everything revolves around Yu and Kay as they make their way in a hostile but not too hostile planet, alone with their feelings but also with the fear that they may be found, forced back into the midst of the society they have abandoned and separated forever. In spite of some flaws, the developers have not ridden the wave of Furi's success with a predictable second chapter, choosing rather to throw their hearts over the obstacle and try their hand at something totally different both in terms of timing and mechanics. So let's follow Yu and Kay on their intense journey with our review of Haven. History As we anticipated, Yu and Kay are two inhabitants of the Arnia, what we could define as a space colony where humanity has taken refuge in which life is governed by the Council and regulated by a so-called matchmaker: this device deals with pairing between their people, choosing on the basis of infallible calculations the ideal partner without obviously taking feelings into account. The practice is so consolidated that no one dares to challenge the decisions of the matchmaker, also because he would be forced to follow them in any case, but Yu and Kay can't bear the idea of having to give up their love on the basis of cold logic. Thus they choose to escape from the Beehive with a small space shuttle and, against all odds, they succeed in their intent by ending up on an unknown planet thousands of lumsecs away. These are more or less the basis of the narrative that you can know before starting the game, only if you read the synopsis on the purchase page. The captivating aspect of Haven in fact is to really put ourselves in the shoes of Yu and Kay while observing them with an outside eye, therefore not making any premise of the events and letting the two boys explain it to us through their dialogues: the developers have thus managed to mask flawlessly what could have been a textual explanation or a long narrative premise with the daily chatter of its protagonists. Between casual comments, reflections on the Matchmaker and life at the Beehive or just observations on what their life was and will be, Yu and Kay offer us a picture of the situation piece by piece, painting it for us. And this is precisely the beauty of Haven's storytelling: discovering it step by step, adding a brushstroke of color every time and giving shape to the story conceived by The Game Bakers. Not only that, through small glimpses of daily life, which go from sweet idleness in bed to a banal shower up to chats lying on the sofa, the deep relationship between Yu and Kay unfolds before our eyes with all the nuances that can animate a married life: the complicity, the quarrels, the doubts about the relationship, the ~spiciest~ moments (which are not spared and are genuinely funny) and the deep love that binds them to each other make the two protagonists alive and believable. It is difficult not to smile in front of their exchanges, or to recognize each other in some dynamics, and it is equally pleasant to see how their bond is also expressed through gameplay when the two embrace or kiss if left inactive for too long - thus recovering some points life. The gameplay When we talk about smudges in Haven we mean them from a playful point of view. They are due to an all-encompassing narrative towards the relationship between Yu and Kay, it is true, but where the story proceeds almost smoothly it is the changing objective of the game that leaves one moment confused: the progression often turns the tables, which from a certain point of view it makes sense if we consider that the boys live from day to day and do not have a clear idea of what to do once they have succeeded in their escape plan. They are interested in being together, any problems they will deal with as they arise. If from the point of view of the story it can work, on the gameplay side it leaves you bewildered for a moment to understand that the aim we were aiming for is not actually the main one: the basis of the game is the exploration of Fonte (the name of the planet on whichwe are) and this brings with it possible changes of course based on the difficulty facing Yu and Kay, however the excessive dispersal of the title in the long run could lead to boredom, unfortunately precisely towards the final bars. real mechanics, there are four key points: explore, collect resources, purify areas and fight. Fonte is divided into more or less large areas, most of them contaminated by a mysterious substance called rust which corrupts not only the environment but also the creatures that inhabit it, making them highly hostile towards us. To purify them it is necessary to always be full of flow, the energy that allows the functioning of the bridges that connect the various areas and is scattered almost everywhere, and to dissipate the points where the rust gathers with greater intensity until it takes shape solid. This allows both to collect useful resources to repair our ship or build new objects, and to allow fast travel: in fact, it is not possible to move to areas that are still contaminated. The developers have therefore managed to merge together a secondary aspect such as the total exploration with playful needs such as rapid movement, prompting the player not to leave any blind spots. In the long run it is a system that could get boring and one could complain about the absence of a minimap to understand where and how to proceed, however it must be recognized that Yu and Kay know nothing about Source: give them a detailed map of the area without them having the means to scan it would have been unlikely to be credible. This does not mean that sometimes, especially in larger areas, we feel suffocated by the need to completely purify them in case we were forced to return to the ship or were defeated in combat (and therefore brought back to the last resting point). Hour after hour, Haven adds new details that deepen both the game world and the interaction, unlocking features that, while not feeling indispensable, can come in handy in some moments: from the kitchen, already present at the start of the game, to the synthesis of healing and non-healing objects From gardening to gardening, Yu and Kay grow one step at a time, becoming more aware of the world around them and figuring out how to make the most of what it has to offer. This does not mean that the lack of a real objective, or rather its constant change, often leads to aimlessly wandering one area after another until the kinematics are activated in which we are told how to continue - except then change broken once again. Wanting to see it in depth, this continuous change of perspective reflects the very disorientation of the protagonists, tormented by the prospect that they can trace them from the Arnia and bring them back, however on a practical level and above all considering the extension of Fonte we cannot deny its occasional confusion. The feeling is that of a game that wants to do a lot but doesn't have a clear idea of which aspect is better to focus more on. As for the combat, it's the most satisfying mechanic of the whole game. Both because it leaves us with a clean interface (like all of Haven), and because it takes time to evolve and to be mastered in order to get the most out of it. In itself it is quite simple, Yu and Kay are controlled at the same time via the directional pad for him and the four buttons for her in an ATB system that makes battles a continuous strategy: the creatures corrupted by rust must not be killed but pacified once once we have knocked them out, yet they are able to bounce back if we ignore them for too long. Recovery times vary from enemy to enemy, some have it instantaneous and the only way to pacify them is to load the command and wait for our partner to score the final blow. We therefore find ourselves involved in a continuous choreography, which can change during the work also based on the actions of the enemies and does not limit the player in its development: this means that even if we have loaded a command, we are free to cancel it and move on to another if we realize we were wrong. Fluidity of action is the cornerstone of these clashes, as well as the search for a perfect synergy between Yu and Kay who will very often find themselves overwhelmed by the number of hostile creatures and will rely on us to emerge victorious in the least traumatic way possible. The variety of enemies is remarkable and their patterns, especially when combined with those of others, make each encounter different from the next. The substantial difference of Haven is that it is not possible to heal the characters, nor feed them, when you are in the open field: you must necessarily find a camp or go back toship to put them back together, at least until we unlock the ability to create items to use during exploration (and even then, these are palliatives). This means that the management of fights is essential in order not to have to go back and forth from a safe point every time, also considering that in the camps we cannot synthesize treatments but only use those in our possession, the quantity of which is limited by the reduced space in our backpack - which in turn can only be managed in the Nest. A final remark concerns the level up. Also in this case Haven behaves differently from any RPG and links the progression of the characters to a bond indicator, to be filled both by fighting and by interacting with the partner in the various skits that can be proposed during the game. Once full, you return to the nest to toast in honor of the time spent on Fonte and, in essence, you level up: the parameters are very few and their increase is managed automatically by the game. There's not much progression to be made, so this lack of management freedom makes perfect sense. Summing up, Haven's gameplay is undoubtedly rich and multifaceted but clashes with a continuous change of direction as regards the protagonists' goal and, having reached over ten hours of play, it begins to suffer from a certain repetitiveness above all due to a good or bad world that is always the same, to which is added a certain difficulty of moving in the narrowest spaces due to the interesting but at times awkward glide system. The interactions between Yu and Kay, the dynamics of their suffered love and all that follows are certainly keeping the game alive. Technical aspect Visually, the style of Haven is very reminiscent of games like Gravity Rush and although at a closer look Yu and Kay may seem very sketchy, overall it all works very well. Especially since the focus immediately shifts to the hand-drawn models whenever the two interact with each other or with the game world. Played on PS5, we had two different graphics modes available: once to preserve the aesthetic aspect and the other to enhance performance. Although Fonte is a colorful and visually intriguing world, net of the repetitiveness of its areas, focusing on graphics to increase the resolution and the amount of detail on the screen inevitably leads to a sharp drop in performance. Given the need to move with the use of glide, which often requires running maneuvers and sudden changes of course, our choice immediately fell on performance at the cost of sacrificing the graphic beauty of the game a little. After all, the compromise is very subtle and hardly noticeable. As far as the DualSense is concerned, the haptic feedback is not called too much into question and although it makes itself felt in some cases (especially when the characters are hungry and therefore find it more difficult to perform certain actions) one cannot speak of a use even close to that of Astro's Playroom.", "date": "2020-12-08", "grade": "7.8"}
