{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 3: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer-9.html", "text": "Scenario: late 80s, Europe. Once upon a time there was western football: Sensibile Soccer, Kick Off and Emlyn Hughes Soccer were all the rage on the Commodores and Amigas of the time, positioning themselves as milestones of the genre for many years to come and occupying entire afternoons of those who, no longer young, has a marked, as prehistoric, memory. Time went by, the advent of Japanese consoles became pressing even in the Bel Paese, but no title suited to the timeless myths above managed to dent its legendary fame. Year 1994: a triptych of games arrives on the market that will make a splash. The Fifa International Soccer series was born at Electronic Arts and two Japanese software houses of the caliber of Capcom and Konami took up the challenge, venturing onto the Super Famicom with their J-League and Perfect Eleven. It is the beginning of a challenge that is still open after ten years, but for many there is only one winner... Only one will remain If, as perhaps someone remembers, the Captive Communication adventure ends shortly thereafter, the Konami series will suffer a considerably better fate, even going so far as to split into two distinct strands (the Perfect Striker / ISS Pro by Major A / Studio KCEO and the here present Winning Eleven / Pro Evolution by KCET). The videogame trinity will therefore come down to us with the apex of the KCEO title in the never forgotten Millenium edition on Nintendo64 and then collapse, disastrously, with the arrival of the 128bit generation. From here on, having assimilated the EA technique based on a continuous and slight annual refinement, Winning Eleven will rise to the title of REAL simulator always ~dribbled~ by Perfect Striker. Because, as in a triangle, the three sagas have always split the critics: statistics, actions as spectacular as ~made in cpu~ and meager input from the gamer for Fifa, graphic care and a realism gradually pursued by W.E., with ISS median between the two, an ideal combination between the needs of the fan and the novice in football. After a long period of exclusive persistence on the console market, here comes the ~Real Soccer Simulator~ par excellence on our monitors too, in the wake of a flourishing policy implemented by Konami, with the conversions of the best titles originally produced for Ps2 arriving on pc. After an all in all small outlay (about 700MB) for the installation, you will find yourself in front of what could be defined as a ~photocopy~ of the original version, with all the pros and cons that it entails. Same menus, interface, even key configuration, with a nice Dual Shock immortalized in the background: for once, in fact, you won't have to assign a key to an action (run -> A key), but shape your peripheral on duty to another and the functions it performs (run -> R1 -> A key). Perfect for those who have a USB adapter for Sony pads and just need to double-check the mapping, a little less for everyone else. Monitor vs Television Graphically, the title can boast an excellent shape: the Renderware middlesoft used for the original version had allowed the developers to make an impact despite not having ~worked on the metal of the Ps2~. In particular the players and in general everything that treaded the playing field were presented in a splendid form, endowed with an excellent characterization so as to allow their identity to be clearly recognized both from the movements and from the features. The transposition on PC, with a maximum resolution of 1280*1024 has done nothing but highlight the work of the modelers, making the vision even cleaner and more pleasant, both during the game and in close-up actions where the details jump more to the eye. Another not indifferent point for the genre to which PES belongs concerns the general fluidity: while the Sony version still ~limps~ a bit in this sense, the Windows release is impeccable, stable and without indecisions (apart from the detail to which I will mention in the hardware box) even if I don't have a ninja pc. Sure, we're far from reaching the capabilities promised by the current generation of hardware, but given the other benchmarks, we can't complain. On the other hand, the reproduction of the public can be improved, which has always been a bit neglected, but which in the presentation shots of the stadiums is embellished by the play of light and the direction which, with dutiful malice, always points the camera in positions with an extremely satisfying and television cut (FIFA Docet). On the technical side, the major criticisms can come from the quality of the conversion and from the sound sector: the commentary, enriched in expressions and globally improved, seems to intervene with a slight delay. Very good tone of voiceand commentators, such as not to make the single recorded phrases seem almost randomly chosen by the CPU and the same applies to the choirs present; on the other hand, the exploitation of PC technology in the field could be improved, such as a compatibility with EAX extensions and the like that has been completely ignored for now. Technology increases the quality of life Never a title so appropriate. We all remember the acrobatic and spectacular animations present in the various FIFAs but, once again, we know very well how these are not dictated by precise player choices but by a kind of conscience proper to the software, almost as if to reward our particular fast or valuable plays. Videogame choreography (or simple sop) we would say. In PES 3 the exact opposite occurs: the new animations inserted arise from the need for realism, they are put at the service of the action and playability allowing us, as in the case of the ~veronica~, to get away from situations that are not easy and which previously required, for example, thoughtful or particularly lucky dribbles. Technology at the service of (virtual) reality as a means for greater identification in the role; of course, the early adapters will not memorize and steal these tactics, based on the simplest ~run, discard and hope that you jump~ but, as in Ikaruga, the game can offer different levels of use depending on what ours is willingness to assimilate and understand it. Would you like a simulation or an arcade for dinner? Turning instead to the purely playful side, the title, as already mentioned and for those who have never experienced it, is light years away from the FIFA series, almost being able to be compared as a philosophy to the old Kick Offs where, the search for perfection, necessarily clashed with the frustration of the newbie. So don't expect to take the pad in hand and win at the first opportunity. No No. PES 3 requires respect, a desire to assimilate its (digital) football philosophy and its rules: don't dream of crossing the field alone starting from the back, the opposing defense will certainly not be stunned to look at you as at EA's house. The through ball, soul of the old Perfect Striker, which with a minimum of malice allowed you to mock crowds of opposing defenders, has been re-evaluated here and implemented in a more permissive way after the continuous advances of the previous W.E. . Of course, we are still far from the cuts in midfield granted by ISS, but that's another story in another place... A rather long learning curve, which perhaps has its main flaw in balancing the level of difficulty: finding a middle ground from easy to difficult is subjectively impossible, making it quite simple to punch the goalkeepers up to the second obstacle, to see the net inexorably closed from the third onwards. A greater compromise would have been preferable, although compared to previous episodes the last defender has a (unrealistic?) less tendency to hold the ball, making your life easier on the rebounds. Beginners now know where to hit, unless the defense isn't your own... The important thing is to always improve The new rules of hand ball and advantage have been inserted in a more than good way: the severity of the match director in case of aggressive play will not allow you to often see the advantage icon light up, especially if you play hard , forcing you to consider as imprudent as risky slips on the opponent's ankles, but players of previous releases will already be used to this. So far we have certainly listed a series of small defects, but then is PES3 the Holy Grail we were waiting for? Surely. Beyond the quibbles that an editor must necessarily go looking for, the rest is Heaven for those who normally fail to make three consecutive dribbles: dribbling, headers and a general refinement of ball control are supported by a chorus of tactics, statistics (many of which are now real, thanks to the FIFPro license) and delights that make the eyes of the most savvy football player as well as the beginner shine, who will find a pleasant and lasting challenge in the Konami title. The Master mode, the cornerstone of the further refined game, is flanked by the now standard choices such as the quick game, the Championship, Cup, Training and Edit sections, in which it is possible to edit the names of the Clubs and players present, bridging the defects that the FIFPro license achieves. Last lines for the excellent multiplayer: up to eight players can simultaneously battle it out on the field, without the need for LAN or Network connections, guaranteeing a level of challenge and funor hallucinating. So you can finally reuse the old pads on the MIDI port that have been buried in the closet since time immemorial and occupy the thousand USB ports that current motherboards offer, perhaps without first demonstrating any apparent utility... Hardware and Compatibility Tested on an Intel Pentium 4 @ 2.533 Ghz, 512 MB of Ram DDR400, GeForce Ti4200 and XP Professional/Windows2000 Professional operating system, the game didn't show the slightest sign of slowdown even at maximum detail/resolution. Trying to replace the P4 with a much less performing Celeron @ 2.4 Ghz there were no problems, demonstrating how light the game is despite the amount of data. Testing it on a high-end system, equipped with Athlon XP 3200+, 512 MB of Ram, Ati All in Wonder 9700 Pro and XP Professional, the game behaved very well even with FSAA and asinotropic filter respectively at 4x and 8x, with sporadic and sudden slowdowns, which cannot be explained by particular overloads. Related to this phenomenon, numerous problems have been encountered on the compatibility side: the game suffers from a high degree of ~pickyness~, having had many problems running on the first tested PC and on several others equipped with Nvidia video cards, a symptom of how the conversion (of an otherwise excellent title) was not as meticulous as a brand of this magnitude required. A patch is already available on the official website that should fix a few bugs here and there, weighing about 10 MB but which, personally, didn't help much. Comment PES 3 is the F355 of football games: real, damned difficult but incredibly satisfying once assimilated, cared for in every detail and polished with painstaking care by mom KCET at each release. The arrival on PC, despite the mediocre conversion, only reduces the list of reasons why you should buy a PlayStation2. If sweaty action isn't your forte, but low engagement and strong choreographed delivery, kick elsewhere. This is no joke. Pros: it's the best soccer simulation available for PC excellent tactical section incredibly playable Cons: some teams' licenses are missing it's a conversion .. and it shows you can't play online Master League at facelift The Master mode has been refreshed for the occasion: for those unaware of it, let's remember that the task of player will be joined here by that of manager and coach. Starting from the classic team of brocchi you will have to climb the paths of success, finding budding young talents to make them grow in football and, little by little, reach the maximum trophy. The number of teams participating has increased (now reached sixty) divided into four main groups, ready to battle it out in various sub-categories regulated by relegations/promotions and, above all, the collection of round points has been introduced which is so fashionable lately. In a similar way to that seen in F-Zero GX for GameCube, for each tournament won or training mode completed, you will receive virtual points to spend in the newly created ~shop~ section which includes, among other things, new choirs, teams, hidden players, and a testosterone ~turbo boost~ for action, ready to double the speed of the game as in the latest versions of Street Fighter. Pretty, adrenaline-pumping, but in the end a bit confusing...", "date": "2004-02-06", "grade": null}
