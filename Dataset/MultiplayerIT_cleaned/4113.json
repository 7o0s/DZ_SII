{"name": "Dead Cells", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-cells-recensione.html", "text": "Dead Cells fits perfectly into a vein that is popular on the independent videogame scene, that of the metroidvania. In recent years, many high quality films have come out, so much so that we can say that the genre has never been so well represented. Guacamelee, Hollow Knight, Owlboy, Axiom Verge, but also the more recent Iconoclasts, La-Mulana 2, Chasm and the forthcoming Death's Gambit and Guacamelee 2, just to name a few, have enriched and evolved the formula canonized by Metroids for Super Nintendo and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, giving fans plenty to play. In such a crowded scenario it is really difficult to stand out, but the game of the French Motion Twin not only does not fear the competition, but also manages to carve out a leading role for itself. Let's try to understand how and why. Plot Available since mid-2017 in the Early Access section of Steam, Dead Cells is the most successful attempt to merge the mechanics of the metroidvania with those of the roguelikes (eg Rogue Legacy, Enter the Gungeon, Spelunky). The result is so satisfying that it has produced a real sub-genre, that of roguevania, which contradicts all those who considered it impossible to mix two such different design philosophies. Initially the story that is the background to the game is really labile. The very short introduction, which is repeated after each death, shows a bunch of cells that take humanoid form inside a dank and cramped dungeon. Playing we will have to answer the classic questions that haunt heroes with no memory: who are we? Where are we? Why do we keep reincarnating? To find out, all we have to do is explore the thirteen levels that make up the gigantic castle of which we are prisoners from top to bottom. Among the novelties added to the final version of Dead Cells, some contents relating to the narrative side stand out, i.e. new rooms in which there are messages written on the walls, corpses, closed cells, diaries and anything else which, if examined, help to understand the background of our condition. Obviously, there is still the possibility of talking to the various characters who meet during the adventure, i.e. the traders of objects or souls, who give brief hints of our past, while never revealing too much. In this sense the narrative is conducted in a similar way to what was seen in the Souls series, with the player having to add up the information and fill in the holes to reconstruct a series of facts that are never fully explained. In the end, don't expect anything very original, although some events are quite intriguing. Gameplay Over the months the gameplay of Dead Cells has changed a lot. Remembering in particular the first version that we have had the opportunity to analyse, to which we dedicated a Proof dating back more than a year ago, it is surprising how everything has remained similar, but at the same time has changed enormously. Dead Cells is perhaps one of the titles that most enjoyed Early Access and the relationship born between the community and the developers, with the latter very ready to implement the advice received and change direction when deemed necessary. Now, making a list of the differences between the various published versions would be quite useless. Just know that Dead Cells was a great game then and is a masterpiece today. The first weapons are found in the dungeon where the nameless and faceless hero awakens, representing at the same time three different game philosophies and as many main characteristics of the character. The player can choose between a melee weapon (e.g. swords, maces), a ranged weapon (e.g. bows, spells) or a shield. The equipment that can be found by exploring is completely random, chosen from what has been discovered and unlocked during the previous games, by spending the souls of the enemies from the merchant who is found in the intermediate areas of the levels. All available items are shown inside some hanging ampoules in the starting area. The Soul Trader Empty vessels represent items or powers not yet found. The choice of equipment, which also includes bombs, turrets and abilities that can be activated, and that of assigning bonuses to characteristics (brutality, tactics and survival) through scrolls, also scattered throughout the levels, is essential for defining one's style of game. For example, we can face an archer by blocking his blows with a shield, and then kill him with a blow, or we can roll behind him to give him a lethal stab, or we can still sit comfortably on a raised platform leavingwhether it is a turret powered by our energy that does the dirty work for us, or we can still hit it from afar with our bow, or we can throw a frozen bomb at it and then finish it off with a sword. In short, depending on the equipment owned we can choose completely different approaches to dangers. The fact that the objects are randomly assigned and that you can invest in those possessed to improve them (always in the aforementioned interlude areas), makes it advisable to specialize in several different styles, so as to never find yourself in difficulty, i.e. with only things we don't know how to use. This adds a huge variety to the gameplay, which makes the levels approachable in an often very different way from game to game. Variety enriched by a set of other powers and characteristics that determine the possibility of intervening on the character in a profound and articulated way, despite the fact that the growth system is really simple to understand and use, thanks to an agile and always very clear interface. The enemies of them do the rest, equipped as they are with unique attack patterns and powers and capable of putting more or less difficulty based on their combinations. For example, the aforementioned archer does not represent an essential challenge if taken alone, but try adding the Bastion sorcerers or the deep sewer mushrooms to him and you will see that they will become much more dangerous. Be that as it may, in total there are about forty common enemies, plus four bosses, with the latter having dedicated levels and which are quite varied, although not very difficult to beat, apart from the final one. Levels The progression of the levels itself is not linear, in the sense that by finding some runes that give additional powers, such as breaking through some floors or jumping on walls, it is possible to follow different branches. Let's say that in each game of Dead Cells, assuming you get to the end, you can face six or seven levels of increasing difficulty plus three bosses. To discover all the secrets and unlock all the objects, you will still need to play several times and overcome them all, even repeating them where necessary. In total, it takes almost sixty hours to get all the content (but consider that it takes much less to defeat the last boss, with the time varying depending on the player's skill). In any case, the random generation of the scenarios, even if subject to precise stylistic and map design constraints (for example the level of the ramparts will always be built horizontally, while the clock tower is always built vertically), helps to avoid never feel the sense of repetitiveness that can be found in other roguelikes. Moreover, the very rapid pace of the action, with the protagonist running, rolling, climbing walls and so on, always makes exploration interesting and dynamic, even when you begin to recognize some precise patterns that regulate the algorithm. The numerous secrets of which the levels are full of, also different from game to game, also help us. Finally, if all this were not enough, there is the possibility of facing daily challenges through which to compete against other players to whoever scores the most points in a single random level, the same for everyone, in the shortest possible time. If desired, we can also mention the speed run mode, i.e. the presence in some levels of doors that close if you let too much time pass. To open them and get the items they protect, including some weapon and skill blueprints, you literally have to dash through the levels, avoiding enemies instead of fighting them. Graphics and sound From a technical point of view Dead Cells is a feast for the eyes and ears. The beautiful pixel art of the creatures and scenery doesn't reach the sophistication of an Owlboy, but it always feels adequate and perfectly animated. There are also objects and scenarios of great beauty, including giant guardians, bells, ponds that reflect the surrounding landscape. Also noteworthy is the use of the color palette, varied, rich, but dosed in such a way as to never be annoying and to keep the dark atmosphere which pervades the entire game unchanged. In short, we are faced with what overall we can consider an excellent job, above all by virtue of the fact that the levels are not fixed but randomly generated. A note of merit also goes to the excellent soundtrack, made up of spot-on and well-played songs, which accompany the action in an excellent way, but which at the same time manage to emerge at the right moments without ever being redundant or out of place. Ditto for the sound effects which, together with the beautiful animations, make the feed perfectlyback of the action you are performing, whether it is simply running or hitting enemies with your sword. mod The PC version of Dead Cells has one more point than the others: mod support. In the Steam workshop there are already many to download, but others will surely arrive with the final version of the game. In particular, we point out some mods designed to increase the already high level of challenge, which can come in handy when the game is over.", "date": "2018-08-06", "grade": "9.2"}
