Three other episodes of the franchise were being converted for the Nintendo console, but the choice to produce an unreleased episode directly for the portable market had left fans at least perplexed. The revelation, then, that the game would focus primarily on the multiplayer experience, was a real shock. One of the most loved JRPG series in the world was in danger of a real metamorphosis, moving away from the traditional structure that had characterized the franchise for more than a decade. Now, finally, a year after the stratospheric success of the Japanese release, all the knots have come home to roost. Story of a fallen angel The narrative component has never been the main element in the various episodes of the Dragon Quest saga: in this case most fans expected a plot reduced to a minimum, but we can disprove these fears since there is a story, and also good, albeit not invasive as in most of today's JRPGs. But let's start from the beginning: this time we play a sort of angel who watches over human beings, secretly helping them with their daily problems and then collecting the energy of their gratitude, called Wellbeing. This resource is then donated to the sacred tree Ygdrasil: however something goes wrong and we will find ourselves in the land of humans, the Protectorate, visible and devoid of almost all our powers. At this point we will only have to do good deeds to attract the attention of the deity, while looking for the scattered fruits of Ygdrasil. From now on the plot is composed of a mosaic of short stories concerning the various countries we will visit and their inhabitants: while not as solid as, for example, the plot of Dragon Quest V: Bride of Destiny, the mini-plots in which we will be involved are enjoyable and well written, often giving rather intense moments, as in the case of the Shadow Knight or the plague of Malazia. What is missing in Dragon Quest IX: The Sentinels of the Sky is probably a more epic and choral plot, which emerges only towards the last bars of the main-quest, but the absence of companions characterized all in all weighs less on the narrative evolution than it feared, thanks to well-characterized NPCs and a game system that makes our party more of a ~tool~ than a narrative element. Sincere praise deserves the Italian adaptation, probably one of the best ever made for our gaming market: not only the puns for characters, objects and settings have been respected and adapted with skill, but the various texts and dialogues have enjoyed an excellent translation, resulting in fact flowing, enjoyable and natural. Space for imagination An interesting slogan dominates the back of the box: create and customize your hero! This is in fact one of the most important features of Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Sky, even if at first glance it seems the weakest: the player can in fact choose between various hairstyles and facial expressions, a pity that they are explicitly recycled from Dragon Ball and other manga by Akira Toriyama, historic character designer of the franchise, also at work in this ninth incarnation. After creating our alter-ego, the editor becomes accessible once we reach the city of Stornland, where it will be possible to create our party members, who will silently follow us on our wanderings, ready to be replaced at any time. In fact, the aforementioned customization becomes evident when you start finding the various items that make up the equipment: Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Sky offers literally hundreds of graphically different weapons and armor that modify the appearance of our characters, both in combat and during exploration, even created through the Alchemical combination, and the variety of combinations is such that it soon becomes more a matter of aesthetic taste than performance. The Level 5's ability has been severely tested, but technically we are dealing with a truly flawless product: the quality and detail of the settings and objects is incredible, such as to make us forgive those frequent but slight slowdowns that occur while exploring cities. To lighten the 3D engine, the development team also had the good idea of making only our most important characters and supporting characters three-dimensional, while the most common NPCs are proposed through traditionalonal two-dimensional sprites. The skill of Level 5 extends also and above all to the fights: as in Dragon Quest VIII, also in this case the entire party is visible, the typical first person view is in fact abandoned in favor of more dynamic clashes against the great variety of enemies that we will face, from traditional slimes to much larger and more disturbing creatures, but always in that funny and cartoonish spirit that will elicit more than a smile. Perhaps, the only weak element of the excellent technical sector lies in the soundtrack by Kichi Sugiyama: the quality of the tracks is above average, but the variety leaves a lot to be desired. The ultimate Dragon Quest? As already mentioned, (Square) Enix has always concentrated its efforts on a rather traditional structure but always filed to perfection, proposed from episode to episode with the additions of the case. This new iteration is a bit the sum of the whole saga and offers the various features that we have come to love from Dragon Quest III onwards. Then the distribution of points earned at level up returns, which allows you to acquire bonuses and skills in various sectors, such as the use of the various weapons that can be used. The possibility of changing class to our characters also returns: we will start from Clown but once we reach the Mutationis Abbey we will be able to change class and become Warrior, Priest, Magician, Thief or Fighter. The game also offers more than a hundred side-quests scattered throughout the world, some of which will unlock new classes, such as Explorer, Arms Master or Gladiator. We are therefore encouraged to experiment, frequently changing class to obtain different skills or perhaps just to acquire other points, to be kept for the classes that interest us most. This obviously requires a good dose of grinding, which is never heavy thanks to the excellent balance of the clashes, and above all it is not necessary at all to continue the adventure, becoming an optional element for all players who want to fully dissect the cartridge or customize your party to your liking. However, Dragon Quest IX: The Sentinels of the Sky is not an easy game, be careful, and it frequently requires a wise use of enhancement or depowering spells and coups de grace, special techniques, even combinable, which become available only at certain times of the battle . Thanks to the visibility of the enemies on the screen and therefore the absence of random encounters, the experience is exceptionally enjoyable, without ever becoming frustrating or boring. Multiplayer mode So here we are talking about the most important feature, the one that terrified the fans, especially when Square Enix said it wanted to develop the game around it. In reality, the multiplayer mode is completely ancillary and really well thought out. Everything always starts from the Stornland inn: there it is possible to connect to the Nintendo Wi-Fi service to download new quests or NPCs who will stay in the rooms of the building, occasionally giving us new objects. But in the same inn it is also possible to ~enter~ the world of another player nearby and in that case we will have various possibilities: we will be able to mind our own business, roaming around the world at will, but he can request our help at any time and it will be up to us to decide whether to give him a hand in a fight or ignore him altogether. It is important to underline that only the host player will be able to proceed in the story, at the end of the game in fact the guests will keep the experience points, objects and money earned, but will not share the host's progress. The multiplayer mode is therefore less effective than Square Enix would have you believe, its greatest usefulness lies in the possibility of exchanging Treasure Maps, which can be acquired during the solo adventure, and which mainly represent the final contents of the game. A map will vaguely indicate the location of a ~cave~ and if we can find it we will be able to access a special dungeon that offers very rare creatures, bosses and objects. Through Treasure Maps, you can acquire excellent equipment and fight additional bosses. In the light of these considerations, it is a real pity that it is not possible to play online and that the multiplayer experience is limited to the connection of physically close Nintendo DSs, but it goes without saying that if you have one or more friends with consoles and cartridge the longevity of the title multiplies exponentially.", "date": "2010-07-29", "grade": "9.1"}
