Imagine if waking up, instead of a single individual, were an entire people, moreover not really well disposed towards the other species and races that inhabit the universe. The attempted massacre would be assured. The Necrons, because we were talking about them, are ancient and fearsome, living corpses with mighty metal bodies, with which we enjoyed bringing death and destruction, so that we could write the review of Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector - Necrons. The Necrons The necrons aren't exactly sympathetic to the universe Battlesector has been accused by more than one player of offering little content, so the developers have started to make up for it with DLC. That of the Necrons is the first to offer a complete faction, since the others had limited themselves to enriching the two factions already available with units. In this case, therefore, we are faced with what we can consider a major downloadable content. Let's see what it has to offer. The Necrons are a faction with unique characteristics, capable of substantially modifying the player's battle strategies, accustomed to the more traditional Blood Angels and Tyranids. Most interesting of all is the regenerative ability of the units, which can effectively recover from all but the most serious wounds. This makes them particularly difficult in the phases of confrontation where there is a substantial balance between the forces in the field, but makes them slightly slower in the advanced ones, because we tend to give the troops time to recover, when possible. In total, the DLC adds fourteen new units, new heroes and new abilities. The new heroes are the Overlord Necron, basically a support unit that enhances other units, and the Plasmancer, a really powerful combat unit that causes high damage and has unique abilities related to direct confrontation. The normal units, on the other hand, are the ones known and loved by Warhammer 40,000 fans. We therefore have Necroguardie, Praetorians of the Triarchy, Warriors, Necrosnipers, Heavy Destroyers Lokhust, The Scythe of the Night and the Annihilation Vessel, just to name a few. Update The Necrons take effect In conjunction with the launch of the DLC dedicated to the Necrons, Black Lab Games has also distributed a maxi free update of the base game which adds the Supremacy campaign, essentially a war between three factions to conquer a planet, in which to win you have to eliminate the bases of enemies, placed on procedurally generated maps. The functioning of Supremacy is very simple and sees a continuous confrontation with the opponents to reach the resources useful for enhancing one's army, so as to be able to overcome the others. In total, the new campaign is made up of a dozen missions, unfortunately not linked to each other by a strong narrative component. This is evidently an endgame content, excellent in particular with the Necrons, which cannot be integrated into the main campaign. Let's say it's the best way to take advantage of the new faction, normal skirmishes aside. The Necrons Faction Pack is certainly attractive to all fans of the game. After all, that's exactly what they've been asking for since launch: new factions to use in battle. Having said that, there is a bit of a lack of a dedicated narrative campaign that magnifies its characteristics and exploits its mythology in a more profound way. Necron units are very versatile on the battlefield Basically we're talking about a Warhammer 40,000 game, where the epic is also born from the knowledge of the millenary history of the individual factions and their relationships through the ages. True that there is the Supremacy campaign, but this one is more dedicated to pure combat and much less to the knowledge of the forces in the field. Having said that, there is no doubt that Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector - Necrons works and is essential for fans of the game looking for more content. Of course, you can see almost everything it has to offer in just a few hours, but basically we are always talking about a strategic one, so what matters is the yield on the battlefield and the possibility of perfecting your knowledge of the individual factions, game after game .", "date": "2022-04-24", "grade": null}
