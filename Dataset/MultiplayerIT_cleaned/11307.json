{"name": "I-play Bowling", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/i-play-bowling.html", "text": "If bowling is a ~niche~ sport, practiced in most cases extemporaneously, the same can be said of the video games dedicated to it. Fans of this discipline have always had to deal with a general shortage of titles, very often mediocre and almost always characterized by a rather limited structure. On mobile phones it's a different story: bowling lends itself very well to quick and occasional use, and the joystick of any terminal is enough to design a precise and effective control system (despite the difficulties encountered for the more videogame genres complex). From the point of view of the I-play catalog, bowling represents, moreover, a new element, which becomes part of a squad made up mostly of billiard simulations. Is it a first-time hit? The game basically has two modes: training and tournament. In the first case we will be able to familiarize ourselves with the control system, as well as with the structure that characterizes the shooting phases: at first we will have to position the ball horizontally on the track, then block an arrow which determines the direction of launch, finally stop at the right moment the shot power indicator. Once this is done, the ball starts along the course, but we can still influence its progress by pressing the joystick left or right as needed. The tournament sees us face three different cups (bronze, silver and gold) that are unlocked as we complete them, each with an increasing number of opponents to beat, increasingly skilled and capable of putting us in difficulty. The structure of the matches is of the classic type: we will have ten attempts available and we will have to score more points than the other party to win. The strikes and spares are accompanied by graphic effects that highlight their importance, while it is possible to completely skip the opponents' turn. Our character is not anonymous nor do we have to choose him from a short list, but we can create him from scratch using a simple editor at the start, changing his gender, skin color, physiognomy, hair and name. As per I-play tradition, the game presents a list of objectives to be achieved, which together with the victories in the cups can unlock new elements for customizing our alter ego or a new set of balls. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, unfortunately there isn't much to get excited about: the graphics offer a mix of photorealistic elements (the track, the pins, the board) and drawn elements (our character or his opponents) that are anything but succeeded. The drawing style of the players leaves much to be desired, with its solid colors and thick strokes, and animations are completely missing. The movement of the ball on the track is not always easy to read, and for this reason we end up piloting the effect of the shot incorrectly, avoiding the impact with the surviving pins. The latter are framed at the moment the ball arrives, but sometimes end up entering one inside the other, denoting a collision detection that defining ~approximate~ is an understatement. The sound doesn't do any better, but at least it offers a decent mix of sampled music and effects. Finally, nothing to say about the control system, which always proves to be precise and responds promptly to inputs. PRO The personalized alter ego idea is nice Precise control system Numerous extra objectives AGAINST Mediocre graphics Limited and repetitive Short lived", "date": "2008-07-09", "grade": "S.V."}
