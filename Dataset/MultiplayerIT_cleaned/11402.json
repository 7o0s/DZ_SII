{"name": "Haze - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/haze-recensione.html", "text": "I want more nectar! The story, at least initially, revolves around the Mantel Corporation, a paramilitary organization hired to quell some rebels led by ~Leather Jacket~, and which at least initially seem to be the bad guys of the moment. You are Shane Carpenter and you are part of this organization, which makes available to its militants a sort of powered suit and above all the ~nectar~, a substance of natural/chemical derivation which is injected to increase physical characteristics, such as resistance to blows. The events of Carpenter start from here, but he will soon realize that the situation is not as outlined and clear as it seems, that nectar is like a drug that also modifies the ability to discern what is right and what is wrong, and that the rebels have a precise justification for their behavior. In any case, the first levels are all in the ranks of the soldiers, through which it is possible to appreciate the first ideas introduced by Free Radicals, the developer of the game. The basic control system is quite classic as a configuration, with the analogs delegated to movement and aiming, R1 to shoot, L1 to throw grenades, X to jump, circle to change weapons, triangle to reload, R3 to crosshair closer and more accurate. With L2, on the other hand, it is possible to inject nectar, indicated by a bar on the left side of the screen, and which allows access to the enhanced characteristics of the soldiers, which mainly translate into improved speed and enhanced vision. In fact, in this mode, the enemies are enveloped in a sort of phosphorescent light, which allows them to be identified more easily even at great distances or between elements of the scenario that could confuse the player. However, the nectar injection is not definitive but tends to fade after a certain amount of time (it is also available in some limited vials, which are refilled over time or by taking them from one's teammates), in case of excessive dosage Carpenter will also go overdosed, shooting wildly without continuity and distinction between teammates and opponents. This last situation actually occurs very rarely, while it must also be said that the injection of nectar adds a too marked advantage over artificial intelligence, which despite the high level of difficulty (among the three available, which become four once brought at the end of the game) seemed quite flat to us, with enemies often exposed to enemy fire and with very little cover or encirclement maneuvers. Towards the rebels At a certain point of the adventure and after some very specific events, Carpenter will find himself changing sides and military in the rebels, in this case there are several changes also from the point of view of the gameplay and the characteristics possessed by the player. No more enhanced senses thanks to the nectar, but above all the possibility of pretending to be dead when hit repeatedly (in fact, the Mantel soldiers are unable to discriminate between the two things, one of the side effects of the nectar), that of creating bombs made of nectar to send overdose enemy soldiers, to build bullets for their weapon starting from any released by the fallen in combat, up to melee clashes, with the ability to steal the weapon from the opposing counterpart. A good inversion of gameplay therefore, which adds variety and several original ideas, which however collide with a fairly flat level design and with the aforementioned artificial intelligence, which in the end lead to using them very rarely and to proceed in the classic way, addressing the various levels in sequence and completing the objectives, often represented by reaching a certain point and nothing more. Fortunately, there are also positive aspects, starting from the possibility of driving some heavy vehicles equipped with machine guns, with an honest physical model that breaks up the action on foot, and above all from the presence, in many situations, of three teammates, who in campaign mode they are controlled by the cpu, but which make it better thanks to the possibility of playing the adventure in coop, both in splitscreen up to two players and above all online up to 4 players, seasoned with voice chat, and which represents the real point of strength of Ubisoft production, as it adds that extra bit of strategy and fun needed to better enjoy the game campaign. ... possibility of playing a coop both in splitscreen for up to two players and above all online for up to 4 players, seasoned with voice chat, and which represents the real strength of Ubisoft's production... Towards the rebelsthe The rest of the multiplayer component is entrusted to three modes, with the classic deathmatch and team deathmatch, which need no explanation, and with the one called ~Team Assault~, where in each of the 6 available maps, which refer to glimpses of the single player, both teams in the field have some objectives to accomplish. In one, for example, the rebel team must take over an outpost, appoint their own commander and make him reach the extraction point, where a helicopter will take him to flight. Obviously, the opposing team of soldiers will have to prevent all of this from happening by garrisoning the outpost and taking command of it. The options are the standard and classic ones, with the possibility of choosing the rotation of the maps, the respawn time, the number of players (up to 16) and so on. Above all, the soldier / rebel dualism works well, but we would certainly have liked a greater number of modes and maps available. And the technique? The same vicissitudes of the gameplay seem to be experienced by the technical sector, which unfortunately fails to properly exploit the peculiar characteristics of PlayStation 3. In the positive factors we certainly find an excellent fluidity of the action for most of the time, a poorly marked aliasing and good light effects and visual depth. On the other side of the fence, however, there are generally anonymous textures, a certainly not high quantity of polygons and above all little use of graphic and particle effects, which are the ones that contribute most in an impact that is not exactly memorable and with a few glimpses that leave the eyes of the satisfied player. From the sound point of view the music is generally valid and integrated with the setting, the dubbing is also entirely in Italian, with good interpretation as regards the main protagonists, a little less for the supporting actors. Comment The Free Radicals are certainly not nave, but unfortunately Haze largely represents a missed opportunity, sacrificed on the altar of only hinted original ideas and a decidedly revisable artificial intelligence. The diversification between soldiers and rebels is very marked and interesting, but in the end it has little impact on the development of the adventure and in the memorable moments for the gamer, who is faced with a main campaign without infamy or praise. The technical sector, with few exceptions, is only average, fortunately the game acquires greater dignity in the 4-player online coop, which does its duty well, and in the fact that it comes out in an arid period of FPS. However, the fact remains that, in a possible qualitative clash with the other exponents of the genre, it comes out defeated with a good part of those already present on PlayStation 3 and in other shores.Pros Excellent control system Coop online Several original ideas...
