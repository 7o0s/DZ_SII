Although not always supported by a correct proportion, the gap is clear: more installations, more sales potential. A guideline not new to the leadership of the new CEO Matsuda, committed to constant support between mobile and older generation devices. Twelve months after the first, excellent remastered compilation Nomura therefore presents the second effort of Square Enix Osaka, and we gladly anticipate the drum roll: albeit with some small criticisms, the team has once again hit the target. Part of the glory - it must be said - goes to the intrinsic quality of the products examined: the ability of Kingdom Hearts II to still remain today a magnificent exponent of action jRPGs is an enviable added value, which further raises the scope of what that end of 2006 peeped out on the European market. A more modest applause goes instead to the Birth By Sleep, and not for its demerit: the team has unfortunately put aside the restoration hypothesis, opting for a direct laptop porting that satisfies, but sometimes leaves a bad taste in the mouth solely for a potentially broader gameplay vision of the PlayStation Portable chapter but unfortunately - on balance - unexpressed. Is that a problem? No, just a pity given the opportunity presented itself. To conclude the work the inevitable sequence of films taken from minor episodes, in this case the Coded for mobile phones, obviously remodulated in the dubbing and in the graphic engine. On the march, the kingdom awaits us. Two of the best episodes of Kingdom Hearts finally arrive in high definition! Old friends More than 8 years have passed, yet nothing can shake Kingdom Hearts 2 from that fairytale air so dear to Squaresoft of the 90s. Colors, narration, stylistic choices, characters, music and atmospheres are an indelible trademark, unique only to the Japanese company. The arrival of the high definition title is objectively painless: the increase in resolution to 720p and the implementation of an MSAA filter return an almost perfect cleaning, capable of intelligently masking a polygonal mass stopped at the starting tape. The result is worth the candle, especially in the OtherWorld sections, where the alchemy between the lighting filters and the platforms with the motifs of the setting imprinted on them gives an overall picture capable of showing the adventure from the very beginning. Excellent upscaling job. Square's commitment does not stop there: albeit in a less perceptible way, the team has made some improvements to the engine that moves the interlude sequences, showing a detail of features and faces which, thanks to the greater number of pixels on the screen, keeps the production level of the remaster. The transition to DualShock 3 has not brought about changes in terms of controls: the structure of commands and analogs has been transposed in an absolutely identical way. And this factor, in Kingdom Hearts 2, we confirm as a positive element: the combat system is fluid, dynamic and still fun today, able to give unexpected satisfactions thanks to the rather ~cinematic~ additions entrusted to the QTEs inserted at the time by Nomura. So get ready for an epic adventure between Heartless and Nobody, in which Sora will start to learn the secrets of Organization XIII, but not only. Drawing from the Final Mix + version, expect even more cutscenes, weapons, sections, chests and much more: a certainly enticing package that manages to excite newcomers and respectfully caress the memories of historical fans, despite a now rather archaic narrative style. The trio has grown It was a rather turbulent time when Square Enix kept adding name after name to the list of portable iterations of Kingdom Hearts. The Japanese house, caught between the grip of troubled developments and the need to monetize quickly with minor projects, let itself go to a rather substantial set of projects intended for everything except home consoles. Birth by Sleep, fortunately, turned out to be a worthy spin-off, capable of adding settings, characters and even splendid new tracks by Yoko Shimomura: in retrospect, Square Enix treated the PSP episode with a degree of attention quite tall. For this reason, picking up today what - we remember - is the Final Mix version of the title, performs well on a technical level. The transposition is faithful, sometimes even too much: Square chooses to update the resolution, leaving the playful content almost unchanged andsive of the game landscape. The artistic richness of the environments, capable of making an excellent impression on a laptop, is unfortunately slightly sparse on PlayStation 3. Clearly filling map sections will not be rare, in which a rather low environmental detail blends with the portable nature of the level design therefore - necessarily - limited in ambition. We reiterate that it is not a defect - the game on PSP was and remains so - but simply a raised eyelash towards an unfortunately unexplored potential of unimplemented additions. The discussion continues for commands and direction: the menu and inventory interface remains identical, then the navigation between the inputs in battle is used with the directional and the triggers, while the camera is exactly like on the PSP, therefore very close to the character. By comparison with Kingdom Hearts 2's wide field of view, it's a shame that Square has stuck so diligently to a port rather than a job capable of ironing out those camera and vision flaws already noted on the PSP. The adventures of Terra, Aqua and Ventus balance the limited portable legacy by offering a trio of very interesting stories, thus increasing replayability and the charm of the plot twists. Also in this case, the Final Mix version brings new unions, episodes and methods to stimulate those who already illo tempore exhausted the product offer. Inside the code As expected, the third block of this remaster is represented by a long mix of cutscenes and static lines of text. In 2009, Square chose to explore the mobile market by applying an episodic formula: Kingdom Hearts RE: Coded was born from that experiment. Despite its 2011 Western retail arrival on the Nintendo DS, Nomura has taken what is effectively the only remaining episode capable of filling the collection's cinematic slot, giving it an updated graphics engine, additional paragraphs and voiceovers recorded for the occasion. Two hours of content out of three are completely new, finally providing an official bridge for the connections between Coded and Dream Drop Distance, which remains at this point the only Kingdom Hearts that, barring some upheavals, will not see the light on PlayStation 3. That of the Coded is an entry of Kingdom Hearts into the digital world - made up of Bugs and personal computers - decidedly atypical for the tone of the saga, which has always drawn its strength from the lack of direct connections with the real world; the work done is still interesting to analyze and enjoy by pressing play, perhaps between one session with the main chapters and another. Square Enix therefore maintains its current flagship brand at high levels, guaranteeing an experience suitable for newbies and veterans. A final aspect that remains at least curious to point out is that relating to loading times: unexpectedly, the time that the transition between gameplay and cutscenes takes is quite a lot. An apparently paradoxical yet real element: there will be cases in which it will be necessary to wait several seconds to load new parts of the map or to go back to pressing keys after a kinematic. Obviously the anti-aliasing algorithms and the updating of the scenarios weigh on the loading of the map, even if we don't report texture pop-in phenomena.", "date": "2014-12-01", "grade": "8.8"}
