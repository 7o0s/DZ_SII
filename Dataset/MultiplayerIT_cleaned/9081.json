{"name": "Madden NFL 2012", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93122-madden-nfl-12-pronti-ad-un-altro-touchdown.html", "text": "Tested version: Xbox 360As we well know in Italy there have been problems with the start of the football championship but also the American football season has been at great risk due to the lack of agreement between the players and the NFL on the collective agreement. The problem was averted and in July the signature arrived which silenced any possible problem. and which should guarantee at least for the next 10 years of regular championships and without delays. However, EA was not found unprepared having undertaken the development of Madden NFL 2012 for some time, ready and now available in stores, so here is how the game seemed to us after our in-depth test. Will there be only one left? Yes, it has already happened. A first and necessary clarification is right to make it immediately, American football has been orphaned for some time now of an important example from a gaming point of view, the 2K series in fact no longer exists thanks to the exclusive agreement between the NFL and Electronic Arts . It is therefore clear that the only American football game that you will find in circulation will be only the one developed by EA Tiburon, hoping that it will be able to please all touchdown lovers. The beginning of Madden NFL 2012 immediately makes it clear to us that the choice was to always make the game better from the point of view of spectacularity. It starts with a cinematic intro, which continues at the beginning of each match, and is capable of perfectly recreating the thrill of experiencing the match live. From the first minutes, the graphic improvement of the series is immediately evident, not only where it was legitimate to expect it but also in everything that surrounds the actual match, from stadiums to cheerleaders, from cameramen to flag-wavers. The players are perfect both in their movements and in their physical appearance but above all, thanks to the new engine that manages the physics, the clashes are absolutely realistic even if obviously devoted to spectacularity. In fact, the plays are not always ~believable~, with the artificial intelligence making the defenders make astonishing movements to intercept perfect pitches aimed at receivers on the run. It is clear that the EA title is like this, it is not a ~monster~ in realism but tries to make every aspect of the match fun. Runs or Passes? The game of the so-called ~races~ works well thanks to the new collision system which guarantees a true, at least from a visual point of view, reproduction of what happens on the pitch. Thus it is very difficult to see the players blocked against each other, with the attacker ~blocked~ against the defender without the possibility of seeing him advance in any way, except in the case in which the bodies of the athletes are actually in contact. One of the elements to take into consideration when judging a sports title, complex in its way, such as Madden NFL 2012, is certainly the attitude of artificial intelligence. Compared to the previous chapter we must admit that progress has been made and without a doubt the EA game has improved, while remaining in the shadows. From the point of view of the attack phases, the cpu behaves quite well even if the offensive line opens the way for the opposing defenders a little too often, a problem that is not insignificant and which sometimes makes the success of the blitzes too simple. The management of the defensive phase, especially playing at the higher difficulty levels, is a bit strange given that it alternates effective and very spectacular plays with colossal sleep by the defenders, who remain ~dazed~ not by pressing on the receiver or keeping the area but disinterested until too much of the opponents. It is clear that these are important problems that affect the games but it must also be said that the multiplayer both online and offline allows, in part, to compensate for these defects thanks to the player's intervention. Xbox 360 goals The 1000 points available are divided into 36 goals and as always in a sports title with the depth of Madden 12 it will take several months to get them all. It is necessary to successfully tackle all modes, from creating a Super Star to making at least 225 yards with a receiver or completing a season in Franchise mode, but these are just some examples, give it to us! Many...many modes! One of the most interesting novelties of this Madden NFL 12 is certainly the good implementation of the dynamic / behavioral system of the athletes. In essence, it is a question of inserting routines that re-propose the players' tendency to make one play rather than another, but also their psychological strength and how their attitude changes depending on the success or otherwise of the actions put on the field. It is clear that after a touchdown therunner is for example very motivated but also simply after successfully running several yards with the ball in his hands. It is clear that there is also the reverse of the medal and therefore also cases of sudden lowering of the state of ~form~ after having failed numerous actions. The system works well, we haven't noticed any particular flaws except sometimes a little exaggeration in both directions. All the modes present in Madden's last appearance on the shelves have been reconfirmed, so both Ultimate Team and Be an NFL Superstar and of course Franchise reappear. If the Franchise mode is probably the most used by players from all over the world, thanks to its depth and longevity, it must be said that the two options mentioned above allow good diversions to the ~standard~ game. In Franchise it is possible to manage the team in all respects and in Madden NFL 12 there have been several additions, now in fact there are new rules for the athlete market, with free agents and the entire betting phase. It is also possible to modify the playbooks and the roles for the athletes have been introduced, a fundamental feature for being able to choose not only the rooster but also the offensive/defensive screens. Apart from the slightly too long loading times, between server connections, statistics recovery (not to mention the background simulations of the games) the waiting minutes are really too many, the Franchise mode works really well and the desire to improve your team leads to playing endlessly or almost. We are in the presence of a truly realistic development of the seasons, which leads to even greater satisfaction in case of success. Be an NFL Superstar is the classic option that puts us in the shoes of a single athlete, this mode has practically not changed compared to Madden 11 and in a few moments it is possible to play surrounded by successful champions, always on the field and it doesn't matter if in the our role there would be better alternatives on the bench... better for us! In Ultimate Team , the card game that has been delighting us for some years and making EA sports titles even more interesting, two excellent features have been added: the possibility of exchanging cards directly with other players without credits involved and the introduction of twenty-seven cards dedicated to the legends of American football, all characterized by a ranking of 99. The inserted community allows you to find players with our same characteristics in an instant, and above all with similar tastes in setting up challenges. We close by confirming that the commentary of the challenges has been entrusted to the Johnson-Collinsworth duo again this year and we must admit that it is nothing exciting.", "date": "2011-09-19", "grade": "7.9"}
