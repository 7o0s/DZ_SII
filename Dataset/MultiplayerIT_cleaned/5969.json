The main stages of this growth are systematically linked to the launch of the so-called ~Packs~, additional content - both paid and free - accompanied by substantial updates which, in addition to adding a number to the code build, significantly raise the bar of production values of Italian opera. Together with the first Dream Pack released about seven months ago, Assetto Corsa jumped to version 1.1 which inaugurated the weather conditions and introduced various technical improvements, while with the Bonus Pack, launched for free this summer, the simulator reached build 1.2 which collimated with a substantial evolution of Artificial Intelligence. The spectacular Dream Pack 2, the object of our analysis, in addition to the usual excellent contents and an enviable quality-price ratio, marks the arrival of version 1.3, whose full-bodied changelog conceals some notable innovations. Seven cars and the Catalunya circuit in Laserscan in the new Assetto Corsa Dream Pack Tire change The main (but not the only) ingredient that has driven Assetto Corsa to success is undoubtedly the delightful physical-dynamic model shaped by Kunos Simulazioni, so refined as to offer a driving pleasure practically comparable to the real one, when of course you use it with a good dedicated peripheral. With the 1.3 update, the gap between real and virtual driving has been further reduced thanks to some sensitive interventions on the core engine and on the physics engine, whose tangible effects have made the Force Feedback, the flagship of the production, even more solid and accurate. The Italian title now natively supports 64-bit, moreover the physics of the cars is fully calculated in multi-thread, exploiting the power of modern processors more effectively. In a nutshell, this translates into a higher accuracy of the physical model, to the full benefit of the superb Force Feedback effect. If we add to this detail the implementation of a renewed dynamic model for the tyres, simply called ~Tire Model 5~ by the developers, it becomes clear how much the new update impacts on the fundamental aspects that have brought prestige to the work. The result obtained by Kunos Simulazioni is overall exceptional, and its best qualities are exemplified by the handling of the BMW M4 introduced with Dream Pack 2. We will elaborate on this issue in the next paragraph. The new tire model is much more sensitive to temperature variations, furthermore the response of grip and rolling resistance, as well as the effects relating to consumption, have been taken to a higher level. The need to warm up the tires in the first few laps of a race is even more evident, while the behavior of the cars based on speed has been made more natural and realistic. Unfortunately at the moment the Tire Model 5 has not been implemented for all cars, and it will be some time before it is translated to the entire garage. In support of the renewed dynamic model, the behavior of the ABS has also been reworked, which varies according to the generation and type, with a braking response that is even more faithful to the original counterpart. Another aspect significantly retouched in the 1.3 version of Assetto Corsa is the audio sector, which has always been one of Kunos Simulazioni's strong points, thanks to a vigorous and exciting rendering of the engines. For the occasion, the Italian developers made use of the collaboration with the famous Slovenian company Akrapovic, known above all for the production of motorcycle exhaust systems but which has also recently landed in the world of four wheels. The aforementioned BMW 4 was built side by side with the technicians of Ivancna Gorica, and the roar of its engine is truly exceptional. Even a second variant has been prepared (called Akrapovic) with an even more spectacular and original sound. Among the other interventions introduced with the latest update we find new shots at the start of the session focused on glimpses of the track rather than on the cars, a new animation dedicated to closing the door before the race, improved rendering for some objects, refined shaders and more defined. In version 1.3 there are also shadows on the windshield, better optimization of the servers accompanied by new configuration options, interventions to the ksEditor, some new algorithms and fixes of various kinds. All in allit is therefore an important update and finishing work, which highlights the value of the Italian work even more, further fueling the curiosity for the highly anticipated PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions scheduled for next year. Belts fastened Purchasable for around ten Euros on Steam, Dream Pack 2 follows the path of the paid content of the same name released on March 11 of this year, offering a valid selection of cars, new special events and a circuit created in Laserscan, in the specifically the famous Catalunya of Barcelona. There are seven cars in all, but for a couple of them, namely the BMW M4 and RUF RT12 R, a second variant has been prepared with some peculiar characteristics. The other racing cars are the splendid Lamborghini Countach 5000 QuattroValvole, the 2014 Audi R8 Ultra, the legendary Ford GT40 MKI, the Lamborghini Huracan GT3 and the very special Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus SCG003, an exclusive car from the Assetto Corsa garage as well as the RUF RT12 A. Let's start our analysis with what we believe to be the best of the lot and, most likely, of the entire simulator as well, namely the seductive BMW M4. Presented by the Bavarian company in 2013, the heir to the M3 drives wonderfully, and its mind-boggling performance, catalysed by the 3.0-litre twin-turbo six-cylinder engine with over 425 horsepower, is accompanied by dynamic and aggressive but never particularly punitive track behavior , allowing the player to manage the ~tail hits~ with incredible naturalness for the total benefit of the fun. The effects of the renewed tire model, aboard the German coup, are immediately perceptible when facing a drifting curve. The polygonal model is splendid and the sound of the engine, as already underlined, simply incredible in terms of power and realism, the vigor of which is appreciable both in the race and during replays. Another ninety piece present in the Dream Pack 2 is the very fast Audi R8 LMS Ultra, which adds another piece in the selection of racing cars present in Italian racing. The car, highly sought after by GT car enthusiasts, as well as being biting is extremely precise and balanced, always ready to unleash its 570 horsepower with brutal violence on the asphalt. Heir to the Audi R8 LMS, winner of the 2012 Nurburgring 24 Hours, the Ultra version has a superbly sampled engine, which exalts the player especially at gear changes and at high revs. The very fast GT from Ingolstadt is paired with the splendid Lamborghini Huracan GT3, a four-wheeled missile derived from the cover car of the excellent Forza Horizon 2. Driven by a powerful 5.2-litre V10 and 600 horsepower, the green lightning of Sant' Agata Bolognese is not as ~electrifying~ as the R8, nevertheless it lets itself be driven with pleasure and has a particularly gritty appearance on its side, especially in the rear with military jet aerodynamic appendages. Another model signed by the house of the bull is the legendary Lamborghini Countach 5000 QuattroValvole, a car that got full marks during the web survey proposed by Kunos Simulazioni to indicate the cars to be included in the Dream Packs. Produced between 1974 and 1990 , the Countach is one of the Emilian manufacturer's most iconic models, and in Assetto Corsa it is present with the most fascinating and aggressive 1985 version, enriched by the rear spoiler which, as also underlined by the Lamborghini engineers, was only for aesthetic purposes. Equipped with a 440 horsepower 5.2-litre engine, the car reaches a top speed of 295 kilometers per hour and does 0-100 kilometers per hour in 5.6 seconds. The polygonal model is faithfully reproduced as well as the behavior on the track, rather nervous since it is not assisted by the latest technological discoveries. The huge tires still offer a fair amount of stability and maximum fun is obtained by launching it into a drift, although the Countach tends to widen the trajectories a little too much and its brakes are not exactly efficient, limits that require a lot of experience to push it to the limit. The other classic of the group is the Ford GT40 MKI, a car that became a legend thanks to the four victories in a row obtained at the 24 Hours of Le Mans (from 1964 to 1969) and the indisputable charm of its line, recalled in the recent Ford GT models produced by the American house. The car is characterized by a wonderful polygonal model, especially as regards the rendering of the interior, while the sound of the 4.2-litre V8 is a little less vigorous than one would expect from a classic of the genre, even making her look good during replays. As expected, this is a rather complex model to tame from hereonly the most skilled virtual pilots will be able to bring out the best. Present in the double AWD and 4WD version, the RUF RT12 R is the second model on Assetto Corsa signed by the German developer specialized in the transformation of Porsches; the first, the legendary CRT Yellow Bird, was a gift from Kunos Simulazioni for last year's Christmas holidays. Although fast, pleasant to drive (especially on winding circuits) and equipped with an excellent polygonal model, the RT12 R unfortunately does not dispense particular emotions as happens with other cars in the Italian simulator. The 730 horsepower of the 3.8-litre bi-turbo boxer pushes the German racing car to over 370 kilometers per hour, making it one of Assetto Corsa's fastest in any case. The most curious car in Dream Pack 2 is undoubtedly the Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus SCG003, a ~mechanical monster~ with a camouflage livery that looks like a cross between a batmobile, a Le Mans Series prototype and a Ferrari Enzo. Heir to the P4/5 Competizione, also present exclusively in the Assetto Corsa garage, the SCG003 was born to compete in the SP-X class at the 2015 Nurburgring 24 Hours, and on the track it shows its muscles thanks to the 530 horsepower of its engine and a truly exceptional braking system. Among the most interesting features are the continuous squeaks caused by the very rigid suspension and the original interior, with a profusion of carbon fiber elements. The seven cars are accompanied by the beautiful Barcelona ~Catalunya~ circuit, one of the most loved by enthusiasts and translated into practically all games and driving simulators. In Assetto Corsa it is present in the GP and Moto variants and has been digitized with Lasercan technology at a resolution of just two centimetres, a detail that makes it practically identical to the real one thanks to the reproduction of every slightest roughness and irregularity of the asphalt. It took Kunos Simulazioni nine months of work to develop it.", "date": "2015-10-16", "grade": null}
