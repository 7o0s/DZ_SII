For the rest there's not too much to worry about, because it's the same game as always, in which you have to take on the role of an agricultural entrepreneur and try to earn money by cultivating and selling the products obtained from the land. In reality, as any good Farming Simulator player knows, the real purpose is to buy agricultural vehicles, made particularly attractive in this edition precisely because of the technological improvements. The pleasure of creating a stable of plowing ~bolides~ is incomparable, but let's not say it too loudly. The basic mechanics therefore remain intact, i.e. having to wander from building to building to manage the various aspects of the company, and having to learn to use all the means available to achieve a good harvest, starting from the tillage of the land, passing through sowing, spraying, reaping, rapeseed harvesting and so on. Among the most relevant innovations of this edition, the introduction of an unprecedented activity stands out: cutting wood, actually the subject of another simulator that has probably been abandoned. This is an addition of some importance, especially for the introduction of new vehicles, even if it can be difficult due to some problems due to the complexity of the maneuvers to be performed. Being able to cut down a tree is not very complicated, but grabbing a log and loading it on the truck for transport can prove to be a real feat, especially at the beginning. Not bad, one might say, after all it's a simulator, not an arcade. Agricultural improvements The major improvements introduced in Farming Simulator 15 concern the graphics and the game interface. From a visual point of view, not only are there models of vehicles that are more beautiful and detailed than in the past, with the usual attention to detail that will make agricultural machinery lovers happy, but now it is also possible to frame the action from the dashboard and check that All is well using the rear view mirrors. Of course, in some cases it is not a very useful option, given that the classic shots outside the vehicles are much more useful for following the work, but it is still a well done addition, which perhaps can be used to try to work the fields from a new perspective and which allows you to better admire the three-dimensional models of the equipment. Another small improvement is the dirt that accumulates on the vehicles while working. Nothing transcendental, but it is at least shown that working in the fields is not something for those who don't want to get their hands dirty. However, the most important news concerns the game interface, finally made modern. Mind you that the options of past editions are all there, but now they are better presented and clearer, thanks above all to new indicators that allow you to better manage what you are doing and well-studied keyboard shortcuts that shorten the selection. We have reviewed Farming Simulator 15: let's find out if it's time to move to the countryside Fruit pecked by birds Unfortunately Farming Simulator 15 also has some problems, not solved with the latest patch. First, the driving model of some vehicles isn't great, as well as being unrealistic. Let's take the tractors that on the one hand can go far too fast compared to reality, making jumps that not even in Forza Horizon 2, but on the other hand they can't climb slopes that a real tractor would climb without drama (after all they also serve This). The same goes for the steering, which is far too ~racing~, i.e. with some vehicles which, even at low speeds, struggle to give a realistic response to stresses and waste a little petrol. Of course, it must be said that these problems emerge above all in extreme situations, i.e. when you want to waste some time. During the normal activities foreseen by the game they are not felt very much. However, the biggest flaw, the one that Giants Software doesn't care to address from edition to edition, is the lack of a sensible tutorial for the economic management of the farm, which organically describes the different buildings with their functions, perhaps contextualizing them in general activity. If you are an old player of the series, not bad, in the sense that the game system has remained almost unchanged over the course of the editions and you should know what you need to do. The problem arises for new players who, after trying all the vehicles in the dedicated tutorials, yesfind themselves grappling with a mysterious world where no one bothers to give them the basics of the trade. Some explanations appear on the screen, but it is little compared to the complexity of the agricultural activity that we are managing. That is, what must be done is clear, it is the how that remains hidden until a lot of practice has been done, or until you decide to go online to take advantage of the precious advice of the community. In short, budding farmers know that they will need a certain amount of patience to start fully managing the virtual farm, since Farming Simulator 15 is not Farmville. When they succeed, they will still have great satisfaction.", "date": "2014-11-19", "grade": "8.0"}
