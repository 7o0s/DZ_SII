The World, Castle Crashers or Dragon's Crown), but never really making a comeback. This is especially true when looking at the mobile market, despite its natural predisposition to look to the past for inspiration for its products. However, the developers of Lucky Kat were not intimidated by this negative trend, and with the present Beat Street they try to find the right keystone to give new life to the genre. Little streets of little rage The greatest merits of Beat Street certainly do not reside in the setting, which is the most basic imaginable: the user can take on the role of one of the six heroes present (only one made available from the beginning, while the others go progressively unlocked during the adventure) and is called upon to clean up the streets of the fictional city of Toko from the gangs of anthropomorphic animals that populate its slums. Fortunately, Lucky Kat immediately redeems himself by showing off a very personal style, which works above all because it is in extreme contrast with the subject matter: we are still talking about people who lead themselves, and seeing all this translated into colorful, lively and with super deformed protagonists produces an effect that is both surprising and pleasant at the same time. However, a self-respecting beat'em up does not live only on cuteness (indeed), and in terms of gameplay Beat Street proves to be surprisingly capable, starting from a control system that - while requiring the use of only one finger of the player - performs even better than many virtual key solutions experienced by other products in the past. Swiping on the screen moves the character, while the standard blows are delivered by performing rapid taps: a swipe vertically or horizontally then allows you to produce respectively a flying kick or a running attack, while maintaining pressure on the display releases a powerful loaded attack and the range of moves is completed by the inevitable possibility of approaching an opponent to hold him in a grip and then fill him with punches by tapping on the screen or throw him away by dragging his finger in the desired direction. The classic special ability is not missing either, in this case it can be activated after filling a special indicator with combos, which results in a series of hits capable of inflicting a lot of damage on a single opponent. In short, Beat Street has carefully studied the teachings of the masters of the past and has translated them into an absolutely perfect model of use for mobile gaming, and the result is a really amusing scrolling fighting game, certainly not technical or particularly demanding (at least standard difficulty level) but certainly capable of giving a few smiles to both newbies and those nostalgic for the 90s. That Lucky Kat didn't just do her homework can also be understood from the surrounding elements to the actual action: from the main menu it is in fact possible to enhance the characters with the emblems and coins obtained by playing, as well as assign a maximum of two statuettes that guarantee permanent bonuses and as many consumable items to be used in case of need. The monetization component elaborated by the developers is also linked to these factors, which however does not prove to be oppressive as in many other cases. If it is therefore true that there is an energy system that limits the user's possibilities of playing continuously and that the enhancement of the protagonists is much easier by using the credit card, it must also be emphasized that the software is quite generous in granting rewards on a daily basis or focused on challenges and objectives; furthermore being able to support itself thanks to short advertising screens, Beat Street does not feel the urgency to constantly propose the offers of its in-game shop, to the full advantage of the pleasantness of the experience. A mention to Lucky Kat is due also for the attempt to get around the obstacle of repetitiveness, inevitable in products of this kind: the internships can therefore be tackled again at higher levels of difficulty (with an adequate increase in rewards) and there is even a two-player online co-op mode.", "date": "2017-11-25", "grade": "9.0"}
