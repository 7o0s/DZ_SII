But the real ~monster~ of the American software house is undoubtedly Bejeweled, a puzzle game truly capable of giving life to an entire genre, that of ~match three~ to understand each other, and capable of reaching the crazy figure of over 150 million copies placed. This time let's avoid any explanation and digression on the game, since it really is impossible not to know Bejeweled or at least to have played one of its many clones; After 8 years of glory which began with the first flash version and passed through numerous conversions especially on mobile phones, PopCap has decided to renew such a tested formula by proposing a variant, subtitled Twist, and currently available for Java compatible terminals. Let's Twist again At first glance it really seems that nothing has changed, and perhaps even at a second glance: the action takes place once again on a grid populated by various types of gems, and the task remains to place at least 3 of the same size side by side to see them disappear and thus earn points. But if until now the movements took place with a single gem to be moved on the horizontal or vertical line, in Twist a cursor is controlled which encloses a square of four jewels, 2x2 therefore, whose position rotates clockwise each time the 5 key of its own is pressed. mobile phone. Therefore, although the end remains the same as its predecessor, the ~means~ are different, as is the approach to be adopted. Unlike before, in fact, it is possible to move even if these do not immediately produce a set, perhaps thus preparing the field for a chain reaction. On the other hand, the game rewards those who are able to continue with three of a kind for each move, creating combos that obviously multiply the score in their favor. There is no shortage of bonus gems, such as the explosive one for aligning four of the same, or the lightning one for an L alignment, which eliminates all those present in the same row and column. Or the bomb gem, to be taken out before the timer reaches zero. The overall picture is that of a very traditional product, as it obviously is; on the other hand we have been playing this type of product for practically a decade, and it is frankly difficult to be amazed by yet another variant. Having said that, Bejeweled Twist remains a title of excellent depth, capable of perfectly filling every empty moment, and recommended for lovers of the genre.", "date": "2009-05-27", "grade": "S.V."}
