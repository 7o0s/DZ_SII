Although he was tormented by them, he was somehow necessarily tied to them, aware of having to confront them. In the sleeping posture, his arms do not try to protect themselves, his hands do not cover his neck left uncovered. Although the nightmare looms, the painter continues to sleep, without waving his arms or withdrawing into a deaf refusal. Even if the absence of reason has transformed fantastic visions into monsters, they are inextricably part of us. It is with this acceptance that we let the frost and humanity inside Cryostasis fascinate us, harass us, and no matter how much we try to turn around and resist, we end up offering him our most delicate and least visible part. And like the Spanish painter, enveloped in a swarm of assailants, we embody an unbearable sense of loneliness. The Drama of the North Wind Year 1981. We immerse ourselves in the soul of the Russian meteorologist Alexander Nesterov, who left from the POLO 21 station with the task of discovering what happened to the crew of the Soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker ~Vento Del Nord~, which was stranded in 1968 after the ramming of a icebergs crossing the Arctic. We almost barely reach the vessel: we suffer a serious accident running into the detachment of the ice crust on which we were proceeding with the sled, and we find refuge in the ship, following the barking of the dogs through the blizzard. Already in the last meters we have collected pages from the captain's diary, which we hold in hand without having to open any inventory, as happens with every object we collect: an inclusive and unfortunately very underestimated technique, which goes perfectly with the choice of practically not abandoning never our subjective. An ode to realism. The content seems to reveal an afflicted author, a proud veteran who, after leaving reason to sleep, seems to succumb to the demons that now assault him even during the day. Each sheet reveals words of discouragement and reflections on nature and humanity, and in parallel crosses with an illustrated copying of a story by playwright Maksim Gorky, ~Danko's heart~, with which the protagonist seems to identify. He is the first member of a large crew of psychologically well-defined characters in a linear, dramatic and coherent story. Put the papers in your pocket, when the hatch closes behind your back, in an unbearable silence, the feeble murmur of the wind mixes with the crackles of the struggle between ice and metal. The use of sound, in the creation of a real and credible place, of an oppressive and at the same time solemn atmosphere given the immensity of the natural and artificial elements present, is simply magnificent, a more unique than rare example. Sounds such as the progress of a freight elevator, the ignition of a generator or a blowtorch, up to the exhalation of our breath, are carefully chosen, well made, so deep that hearing them is even satisfying, and significantly increase the immersion and the tension. The dubbing, performed discreetly in the Italian version, is nothing short of excellent in the Russian version. The music in turn enters the experience only if it is internal to the world itself (a gramophone, a radio) and, with the few tracks accompanying the credits and menus, they are effective and exciting. The North Wind is a fascinating place, more disturbing than frightening, more ambiguously exciting than frightening. He has his breath - listening is just as important as acting - and his voice has a lot to tell. Absolute cold Meanwhile, the cold continues to envelop us, keeping us on the edge between life and death. The feeling of imminent freezing is conveyed by a vast series of details capable of working in unison, graphics and sound, and we can identify them according to the way they act on us. Some are related to the first-person point of view: as the temperature drops, the sides of the screen freeze, we shiver, and our breathing turns into bronchial spasms. Others surround us: on the one hand, moving in an artistically elegant and graphically swinging scenography between the expressive and the obsolete, everything is crystallized, ice cones hang from the ceiling, the rifle is covered in snow dust, and a particle rain of sleet floats in the air; on the other, immersed in a sphere of sound, we perceive the settling of the iceberg, the invasion of the wind from the cracks. Finally, a very essential hud measures how much certain conditions affect us through a sort of pressure gauge, capable of reporting the temperature of the stationnza, our body temperature (which becomes the equivalent of our energy), and fatigue. Yet, frost reigns supreme but not unchallenged: our constant priority is to find sources of heat, put them into operation, and use them to warm up, bringing our health back to an acceptable level. The more intense the source, and the closer we are to it, the more energy we recover - some of them, such as generators, will even be able to defrost the entire room, triggering a suggestive liquefaction effect on every surface. The feeling of turning on a source after a long and nervous peregrination on the verge of collapse is comforting, and returns more than the satisfying awareness of no longer being an easy prey to the threats looming in the ship. A system, this of the representation of the cold, still to be perfected, but finally it also marks a goal, since it is certainly the most inexorable. Surrounded by Presences, Yet So Alone From the very beginning we discover that we possess the ability to be able to relive the last seconds of life of the men who lie lifeless in the rooms we pass through. By touching their body, a ~mental echo~ transports us inside them, directly into the events that caused their death, with the possibility of being able to reconfirm the conditions of death, thus giving rise to a constant repetition of the fact, or to change them, saving his life and changing the future for both of them. To the echoes are then added some real, non-linear hallucinations, activated by just being in some rooms, or circumstances, in particular. And not only do we get to know some details of the plot by living them instead of hearing or reading them, but each ~echo~ becomes a situation to be solved, a story within a story, an enigma within an enigma, and the drama of the scenes imbues moments that at a pure level of game mechanics they essentially function as puzzles. Both of these moments are graphically treated with great artistic creativity (like everything else, even the main menu is well designed and contextualised), with an excellent use of effects and filters, lights, and colours, acid and saturated, often juxtaposed by contrast. It seems that only those who have died with no hard feelings, either in an accident or as a result of violence from others, have the privilege of not having come back to attack us. The others, gripped by the resentment that keeps them standing in some form of violent vitality, retain their role as executioners. As much as their A.I. is almost non-existent (and perhaps this also reflects how they were in life) and the behaviors are often scripted, their aggressiveness is directed only frontally, therefore it remains contextualized and disguises its clumsiness, given that in the narrow corridors it could do nothing but lash out against our. Realism can be found in the choice of weapons, makeshift objects (a padlock, a gear) and old firearms (a manual repeater mosin-nagant, an old signal pistol, a Shpagin submachine gun), and in the sole use of 'iron sight to aim. The clashes are not very incisive and often insipid both in the short run and over the distance, perhaps ending up taking on only one meaning: as we help those who died as victims by reliving their past, so we help these brainless horrors to find the humanity they had lost by giving them death . The fact is that, in no uncertain terms, the design of the creatures is one of the best ever conceived. A hope for the future Proceeding in the crystallized corridors, puffing frantically for hours, however much the desire to discover what lies beyond never abandons us, nor does the sensation of being inside ever diminish, we find an elementary and obsolete level design. Cryostasis is a long corridor (unsuspectingly, about 12-13 hours) to be traversed without freedom, with a few poorly defined objects and little interaction with the environment, at a decidedly slow pace, where progress often corresponds to cleaning a room from the presences hostile and pressing a button. But we must also add that with such a setting, inside a ship with little possibility of being able to go outside, it was not easy to offer a variety that despite everything is present in the form of events (above all with the ~echoes~) and places (cabins , prison, medical bays, engine rooms, reactor, some external such as the helipad and side walkways). The constraint never falls out of context because it is an integral part of the context itself, the objects are not many but this icebreaker is true, and the motivations to continue are very different from the search for the firefight, which rather than adrenaline, is considerable (and I would finally say,in a title with such premises) as a violent necessity. These are the reasons why intrigue remains hot and doubt suspended. At the same time, for these same reasons, of which to be proud, Cryostasis imposes too many limits on itself which in the long run risk alienating even a part of the public which is attracted by them, because in a certain way they weigh. They weigh like an opportunity only realized up to a certain point. They weigh like the engine that supports them, little optimized. Trying to get it to work on a single core configuration is like running a square wheel of marble on a rough field. Yet, in the end it turns, and above all thanks to the artistic quality, it does not lead us to abandonment. It would have been a real shame not to have opened that steel hatch, just because we were discouraged by its heaviness. Comment Cryostasis is not for everyone (and finally). It is nice and squeaky like an old handmade wooden mechanism. It's heavy, glamorous, obsolete in some ways, innovative in others. It is a reflection on freedom, on human action, on our ecosystem, on the perception of solitude. An experience that enriches, that to give needs to take, a race against time, a complex and emotional drama that consistently answers every question it raises. The development is linear, sufficiently interactable, entrusted to an elementary but suggestive and credible level design, always experienced in the first person, face to face with the humanity that exudes. Every shot that is fired is an assassination. It's an exhausting and tiring experience, slow, rusty, limited, but also believable, deep, visceral, ruthless, wonderfully witty, coherent, believable and sincere. Undoubtedly, it is memorable.Pro Plot deep and well scripted, artistically excellent Enveloping atmosphere Remarkable quality of sound effects Against The opposing AI leaves something to be desired Level Design a little too linear Little optimized game engine, some bugs PC - System Requirements Minimum requirements Processor: 2.4 GHz Intel Pentium 4 or equivalent RAM: 1GB Video Card: 256MB video memory with Pixel Shader 3.0 support (GeForce 7800 or ATI X1800 or better) DirectX: 9.0c or higher Hard Drive: 6GB Sound card: DirectX 9.0c compatible Test configuration Processor: Intel Core Duo E8400 at 2.66GHz RAM: 2GB DDR3 Video Card: GeForce 9800 GTX Operating System: Windows XP", "date": "2009-03-10", "grade": null}
