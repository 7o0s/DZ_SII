{"name": "Ferrari Challenge - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ferrari-challenge-recensione.html", "text": "The marriage between the Italian Prancing Horse and the world of video games is now ancient and witnesses the great titles that have made the history of racing, both in arcades and on consoles. The mind quickly brings us back to two masterpieces of the genre: the first is definitely that OutRun that was so crazy as a coin-op many years ago, and that marked Arcade games forever. The second is one of the cornerstones of driving simulators and is obviously that jewel of SEGA's F355 Challenge, which appeared both in theaters and on Dreamcast and Playstation 2. Today on the shelves of our trusted store we find a new game: it's Ferrari Challenge, developed by the British System3, already authors of old glories such as Myth, Last Ninja and the sequel to International Karate. Experience is certainly not lacking, even if the English guys were missing from the videogame scene that has been counting for a long, too long time. Let's find out together how they handled the Nintendo DS hardware. If you can dream it, then you can do it. ~First of all, you have to dream about a car~, said Enzo Ferrari. And this is why ~Trofeo Pirelli~ enjoys all the official licenses that have allowed the developers to be able to recreate the design, assets and road behavior of the cars in the most realistic way possible. Or rather, they would have allowed. Ferrari Challenge is a driving simulator created together with the real Maranello team and Bruno Senna, grandson of the champion Ayrton and a driver in the GP2 series since 2007. The System3 team has in fact made use of every possible information and suggestion directly from the prancing horse's technicians. However, the ambitions of researching realism stop on the excellent brochure that illustrates the strengths of the game: Ferrari Challenge, in terms of simulation, has very little. First, you have to dream about a car If you can dream it, then you can do it. The roaring sound of the engines heard in the first preview video for Playstation 3 has here been replaced with an artificial whimper not unlike that of a small modified kart that runs on diesel, while the behavior of the cars on the track is decidedly too permissive. The heart of the game is obviously the championship, a long series of races that lead us to the conquest of the coveted Pirelli Trophy, battling against seven antagonistic cars through Italian, French and German circuits. After a short tutorial, which teaches us how to dose the accelerator and brake using the now famous ~colored footprints~ on the asphalt (green means accelerating, red means braking), we can start with the actual race. The camera is subjective, or with an external view, which can be modified at will at any moment of the game by pressing the select button, while the type of gear, automatic or manual, must be selected before the start. Where did the famous roar go? What immediately catches the eye is that our car, while slamming violent doors against opponents, not only does it not break, but it does not even suffer a recoil proportionate to the blow. More than a Ferrari simulator, therefore, it seems to be playing a funfair racing title. The artificial intelligence of the other cars is not very developed, this can be seen when, stopping in the middle of the lane after having gone off the road, they pounce on us without even trying to avoid us, generating a train of accidents that would otherwise (and in reality) certainly have been avoided . The difference between the easy and the hard level seems to be only their top speed. The graphics sector is fluctuating. The car models are decidedly good, full of details and particulars, but the general solidity is somewhat perplexing: there are many artifacts and problems of all sorts. It starts with the frequent pop-ups and clipping, due to the length of some stretches of track that are excessive to calculate, as well as the disappearance of the competing cars after a few hundred meters after they have overtaken us. The car models are decidedly good, full of details and particulars, but the general solidity is somewhat perplexing Where did the famous roar go? The polygonal mass managed by the graphics engine set up by the System3 is certainly not incredible, yet the detail of the Ferraris tends to decrease before our eyes as they move away from the camera, causing a decidedly inelegant deconstruction effect to behold. The worst part, however, is to be found in the audio sector: setting aside the excellent initial music that accompanies the menu with a rocking theme, the noises of Ferrari Challenge are disappointing and too simplistic. The dull and high-pitched rumble of the Reds, fundamental for a licensed game that is heavily based on verlikeness, it should be the minimum wage; instead they were replaced with a flat, unrealistic sound. Skidding with the car and going off the track does not cause any particular noise, much less driving on grass. Crashing into a guardrail or into another car is ultimately the same thing - the result is a nasty cacophonous and poorly sampled noise, which repeated many times could cause you to throw the little game cartridge out the window. During replays, then, no sound is heard until the car passes right by the camera, moreover without any nuance from a distance. Comment Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli for Nintendo DS is not an Arcade game, but neither can it be a simulation. It therefore fits into a not well-defined groove, and in this sense it struggles to give satisfaction to the user. The graphic sector shows good cars but a fairly long list of polygonal engine problems. The enemy AI is not very developed and the sound, especially in the effects, could have been much better. The very old card game, included as a bonus, is fun against a friend and manages to make anyone with less hair smile; the multiplayer wireless mode is always captivating, but remains a title intended for super fans of the Prancing Horse. So too little for a game that should represent a brand of excellence like Ferrari. Pros Car modeling Card game Wireless multiplayer Cons Music and sound effects Graphical issues Opposing AI The dear old card game is an evergreen If driving a Ferrari can get tired after a while, we can still fall back on a mini-game included in the main menu. It's about those old card games about cars, which were very popular in the late 80's almost everywhere. The rules are few and well known by now to everyone: to start you need to create your own deck of Ferraris made up of cards on which details regarding top speed, number of valves, year of release, price and so on appear. In turn, the player must choose a characteristic of the machine that he considers interesting and compare it with an opponent's card: whoever has the highest value wins the card and the hand. Multiplayer is via Wireless locally and can be done with a single game card or with two The dear old card game is an evergreen By managing to take away all the cards from our enemy, whether it is the CPU or our friend, we obtain the final victory. Multiplayer is via Wireless locally and can be done with a single game card or with two: in this case all the tracks and all the Ferraris will be selectable. The game against a friend is fun because it doesn't have too many simulation pretensions, and it certainly represents the best way to pass the time with ~Trofeo Pirelli~. Finally, all our data and the times of the tracks are saved in the ~Record~ section, a factor that ensures a good longevity to the game.", "date": "2008-01-25", "grade": null}
