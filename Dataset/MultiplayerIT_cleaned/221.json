{"name": "Wii Play", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wii-play.html", "text": "Pointing and Rotation! Predictably the results are mixed, some games are nice in multiplayer, some solo, some in both and still others in neither. Before going into the presentation of each part of the game it is necessary to immediately say that the multiplayer mode is limited to only two participants, a real shame given the nature of Wii Play. To tell you about the individual sections, we will follow the order chosen by the designers, given that it has its own precise logic and is identified by a progressive increase in the variety and complexity of the movements to be performed - that is, it does not mean that it is also accompanied by an equal ascent on the level qualitative. The first three minigames were made to teach how to point correctly at the screen and move the cursor with ease. Wii Play starts off strong right away, proposing a sort of Duck Hunt from 2006 as its first game: divided into six sections, this ~shooting range~ (as it was baptized by Nintendo) is certainly one of the greatest peaks of Wii Play. Through the remote control you will move the viewfinder on the screen, and every time you will have to try, hitting (or avoiding) various types of targets, to improve your score. It goes without saying that in this case, although the six sections into which the game is divided always remain the same, the race for the ~best score~ is a valid incentive to immediately start shooting again, as it is moreover obvious that in two increases not a little the frenzy and fun that this evergreen can give. Immediate, easy and additive, it is certainly on the podium of the best Wii Sports games. The same cannot be said of ~TrovaMii~, which despite the appreciable language game will most likely not be able to capture your attention for more than five minutes. The game is divided into various levels, each of which will show more or less crowded places, and your task will be to find the Mii repeated twice, the one that looks like the other, the one that behaves differently or, more generally , the one that will match the description that will be given to you just before starting. In two players it is certainly nicer, but it still fails to be exciting and moreover it does not add anything new compared to the previous one. The third, ~Table tennis~, is also on the podium: it requires the execution speed of the Duck Hunt double, but also more precision, because the duck can be shot twice, while the ball must be caught the first time. You move the racket by moving the cursor on the screen, and the shots will be automatic once you come into contact with the small ball, which you can however direct as you like based on the way and speed with which you swing the racket. In single it ends soon, just as your run-up to the record will end too soon (you will soon reach the maximum score), while in multiplayer it radically changes face: the games in this case are frenetic and exciting, and will end only when one of the two players has reached eleven points. The fourth and fifth minigames are all about controller rotation, and the former is kind of an introduction to the latter. ~PlaceMii~ is divided into various stages, each of which will present various bubbles that will fall from the top to the bottom of the screen, bubbles containing a space to be filled by moving your Mii over it. There are three different positions to assume (through the use of the buttons), so as to vary the game a bit, but above all you will have to angle your character in the way indicated by the bubble, which will explode if you complete it through your figure. The game immediately loses momentum, even in two the fun will not last long. Once you have learned to rotate the remote control you will be able to fully enjoy ~Hockey Laser~, the playful transposition of table hockey, a classic from arcades. Each participant will have to act on their own half of the pitch and defend their goal, trying to throw the ball into the other's: although the concept may be intriguing, the realization is not particularly successful, due to the too slow pace that fails to convey the frenzy present in reality. Fun during the first few games, both in single and in multiplayer, it doesn't hold up in the long run due to the excessive duration of the clashes and the chronic slowness of the ball. Z axis The last four games are all based on the Wiimote's ability to detect the depth of movements as well. The sixth minigame, the ~Billiards~, is undoubtedly among the best three. Fun in both single and multi, the only reason you might not like it is your personal aversion to this discipline. You can schey the direction to be assigned to the sphere and the precise point of impact, but above all the intensity of the blow you will have to establish yourself by moving the wiimote exactly as if it were a cue. It will entertain fans for a long time, despite its simplicity. The seventh minigame is pretty bad, although it can be useful for learning certain movements. Peach Colored looks a lot like those toy ponds for children, where you have to put the bait inside the fish's mouth, so it's very interesting to test the movements of the wiimote both horizontally and vertically, but beyond that it doesn't goes, and even with a friend you will soon get bored. The eighth minigame, ~Carica!~, is the only one to require (or show, depending on your point of view) the horizontal handle of the remote control. By tilting it forwards, backwards to the right or left you will direct the movements of a mad cow with the aim of knocking down as many scarecrows as possible in your path: it is not very good either in single or in multiplayer, but it is fun to make the quadruped jump by moving the wiimote towards the 'high. The last game, ~Attack!~, is definitely the most complex in terms of controls. You will have to move a tank using the d-pad or nunchuk (obviously the second option is preferable) and simultaneously shoot enemies with the pointer. A great exercise, and it's also quite fun, especially in multiplayer. To conclude, it would be fair to say something about graphics and sound, but they are so simple that talking about them would be trivial: as you can see from the photos, the visual behavior ranges from minimalist (at best) to simplistic (at worst). It stands to reason that if you weren't able to pass over such a graphic you shouldn't consider Wii Play. Comment Don't be fooled by the rating, ours is by no means a rejection of Wii Play. As mentioned at the beginning, it is not a game with a remote control attached, but a remote control with a ten euro game attached. Our job was to tell you about the features of the title, but it's also our duty to tell you that Wii Play is worth all the money it asks for: it doesn't deserve more, it doesn't deserve less. Alone it is a good tutorial but it will end very soon, in multiplayer it will last longer and will give life, through some well-made minigames, to fun challenges. Pros Costs ten euros, plus the price of the wiimote Good tutorial for the new controller Some minigames are great fun Cons Game quality fluctuates Multiplayer limited to two players How to rate Wii Play? We must certainly start from the assumption that it is not a game with a telepad included, but a telepad with an attached game, costing ten euros. Many consider Wii Sports a sort of tutorial to learn the movements of the new remote control, but this belief turns out to be wrong in the light of Wii Play, the real game used for this purpose. In Sports, the various disciplines are simple, it is true, but each has different modalities and a sort of constant evolution, it is an immediate experience but destined to last quite a long time. Wii Play for its part offers nine minigames that always remain the same, designed to show precisely, step by step, all the features of the wiimote to the player.", "date": "2006-12-13", "grade": null}
