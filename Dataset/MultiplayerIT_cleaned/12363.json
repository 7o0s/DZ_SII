{"name": "Marvel: La Grande Alleanza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/marvel-la-grande-alleanza-5.html", "text": "Unfortunately the term colossal, which is well suited to the contents, clashes with the playable part of the title. The playability is in fact affected, both in single and in multiplayer, by some problems. Before examining the defects, however, it is necessary to illustrate what La Grande Alleanza brings into play. It starts being able to use Captain America, Thor, Spider-Man and Wolverine to get first to 18 superheroes and finally to 25. Each character has a certain number of characteristic moves and to be used in groups made up of four elements, which allows you to build a team that possesses the optimal characteristics to overcome a certain mission, a certain end-of-level boss or to quickly eliminate enemies with particular vulnerabilities to the elements. The Human Torch, for example, is capable of generating a large continuous flame to hit multiple targets, while the Iceman can freeze opponents. By making a quick count between the powers initially available and those unlockable by continuing in the game, you arrive at an exorbitant number of moves. between the initially available powers and the unlockable ones, there is an exorbitant number of moves Each move faithfully reflects the abilities and movements of the relative character and consumes a certain amount of energy, represented with the canonical blue bar next to the red one which represents health. The basic moves are the grip, the standard blow and the loaded but slightly slower one and pressed in combination they generate three different combos that end one with a sweep, one with an uppercut and one with a kick. To select the characters during the game, just click on the directional cross and by pressing the R2 key plus the front keys we can decide which attitude, from defensive to aggressive, the characters not used directly will have to keep. By calling up the menu it is possible to upgrade the characters of the team during the action, spending the coins collected up to that moment, while to change or resurrect the team members it is necessary to be at the point intended for saving the game. Finally, it is a must to mention the cooperative mode which allows, even online, to command a team of four using a superhero each but adds nothing notable except the irreplaceable added value of playing in company. So far the hack & slash recipe is respected to the millimeter and the number of characters, multiplied by the number of moves, guarantees an absolutely enviable variety. Paradoxically, this is precisely the point where The Great Alliance shows the side since many moves are almost useless, while some are practically identical from one character to another and simply vary in the aesthetic component. On the other hand, seeing Wolverine slicing an opponent or Storm summoning lightning retains its emotional charm and also a functional task considering that we are talking about a title that makes its strong point the possibility of impersonating superheroes already established in the collective imagination. In detail The great Alliance is a very rich title and offers extras, characters and moves in quantity without counting a long series of missions dedicated to the past life of each of the available superheroes. Characters grow in classic hack and slash style with ROG elements. Initially only one special move is available, then, continuing in the game, new ones are gradually unlocked, which can be upgraded by collecting the coins that splash copious from numerous destructible furnishings. Furthermore, by killing monsters of all kinds and bosses, you get permanent boosts to the characteristics and useful objects that can increase the various characteristics and abilities. A peculiar feature of the PS3 version is the possibility of exploiting the peculiar characteristics of the Sixaxis to complete particular events, such as bombs to be defused or particularly pissed off bosses, where sequences of movements appear on the screen to be imitated with the pad, to bring healthy skin home and save. Unfortunately this type of event, which has resurfaced forcefully from the past, despite being united with all the aforementioned wealth, fail to give depth to the title. The responsibility for this superficiality is not attributable to the structuring of the characters or to the gameplay but rather it can be traced back to the enemies, real dumbasses devoid of any initiative. The bosses themselves, equipped with special moves and spins in the best tradition of the genre, are blocked by simply letting our hero leave the room, or they get stuck. Best case scenario they just run, perform their flagship move and go back to running or flying dependingof the current supervillain. Certainly in hack & slash we tend to forgive artificial intelligence which does not represent, at least in most cases, one of the strengths of the genre, but this lack stands out much less in various other titles of the same genre, thanks to greater planning of the opponent's attacks and their abilities. A concrete example of what I mean comes directly from the use of a potentially very interesting one. When the opponents are equipped with a shield or other weapons, it is possible to snatch them from their hand by quickly pressing the key intended for grappling. The problem arises when we find hordes of enemies equipped with shields and the only way to get rid of them quickly is to remove their shields or quickly switch characters to catch them from behind, which results in the continuous pressing of one of the two keys to rather long periods. From a technical point of view, La Grande Alleanza offers a graphic sector with few highs and many lows, while enjoying a quantity of luminous and particle effects, but not getting close enough to the next generation standard and denoting various frame rate problems in more than one 'occasion. Beyond the mere technicality what tires the eye is the monotony of the settings which is inversely proportional to the variety. In fact, the title takes us to almost all the environments familiar to Marvel superheroes but these environments are recreated with a few repeated textures, crates or vases in industrial quantities, and some sporadic variations when objects intended for puzzles appear. On the other hand, the characters are more than recognizable, including enemies, guest stars and end-of-level bosses, and the animations help recreate the illusion of having a team of authentic Marvel superheroes in your hands. On the other hand, especially in the first levels, we find legions of photocopy enemies that differ only in color or size. The soundtrack exploits and recombines the 50 minutes of signature symphony available, literally embracing every game situation The sound reflects the imagery that movies, cartoons and predecessors have created around superheroes, their voices and the effects of their powers. The soundtrack itself, of high quality, exploits and recombines the 50 minutes of auteur symphony available, literally embracing every game situation as happens in the most famous superhero movie at the box office. Finally, without infamy praise the online cooperative mode, which works quite well but which occasionally, due to the not exactly impeccable netcode, introduces a certainly not negligible latency. Comment Another great little universe also arrives on PlayStation 3. We are faced with a title clearly dedicated to fans of the ~super~ genre, but which enjoys a production of a higher level than that to which transposition operations of this type have accustomed us in the past years. Despite this, the difference in terms of design and fun with other hack and slash representatives is felt and can be quite heavy for those who have been chewing them for some time. Surely, due to the incredible number of characters, the care in the realization and the stories that populate it, The Great Alliance is recommended for Marvel fans, but also for those who particularly appreciate this genre. Pros: A real crowd of superheroes and super villains... ...and super moves Cinematic soundtrack Cons: Trivial situations mortify the abundance of moves Poor level design Online mode with ups and downs During our youth, many of us followed the exploits of the Marvel heroes who have characterized the history of American comics in recent years, who describe the exploits of superheroes who, from book to book, have faced every imaginable historical and science fiction catastrophe, scourged by terribly human feelings and from family tragedies worthy of the worst war biographies. With a lighter and more suitable tenor for the occasion Marvel: The Great Alliance offers a story that, while bringing up dozens of superheroes and super villains, in addition to the 25 usable ones, seems to remain in full agreement with the paper plots and with the universe original Marvel. This statement is to be taken with a grain of salt, especially by avid fans, because it could be the result of cultural flaws and above all of the huge quantity of characters involved in this videogame colossal.", "date": "2007-04-12", "grade": null}
