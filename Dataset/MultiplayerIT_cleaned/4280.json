Now that we have been able to try the final version of the game, we confess that we would have expected something more. With this we do not mean that Battletech is a bad game or that it has completely disappointed us, but only that some aspects have not convinced us. But let's go in order. The complexity is only apparent, because the game system is really simple The action is set in the early years of the fourth millennium, with the galaxies dominated by noble feudal houses, equipped with highly advanced war technologies: mechs, combat robots guided by specialized pilots called mechwarriors. In the videogame Battletech, essentially a turn-based strategy game with a large managerial part, the player plays the role of a mercenary mechwarrior, previously a member of the army of a branch of a now decayed noble family. We won't tell you anything else about the plot because there are twists from the first mission. However, let's try to understand how the narrative side of the game works, which dictates a large part of the structure of the same. Nobles at war The main campaign of Battletech is divided into a series of linear missions that serve not only to tell the story, but also to manage the progression, both of the knowledge of our travel companions, with whom we can talk between one mission and another, and the growth of units. The level of difficulty of the secondary missions is in fact linked to the story: to unlock the most difficult ones, which however give greater rewards, including the strongest mechs, one must inevitably advance in the campaign. Space travel requires the (automatic) use of these stations In this way, imbalances in the missions of the same are avoided, which you never end up facing with more advanced teams than those required. If we want, the same goes for individual mechwarriors, which require the spending of increasingly large amounts of experience points to unlock the advanced skills of their four fundamental characteristics. From this point of view, the system created by Harebrained Schemes works well, although there is a certain disconnect between what is the work activity of our character, the mercenary, and what are the requests made during the main campaign, much more political . There is also another issue to clarify that some may turn up their noses: the protagonist, i.e. the player's avatar (customizable at the start of the campaign) is actually the secondary character of a story that is not his. Don't get me wrong, because the plot is actually very interesting and well told, thanks largely to the use that is made of the setting, but it remains someone else's story in which we play a supporting role, so to speak, and in which we are not called to make any decisions. We carry out the orders and watch the events unfold until the very end. The life of mercenaries The role in which we are most active is that of commanders of a group of mercenaries in very bad financial conditions. Our predecessor ran into a large debt with the banks and it is up to us to find the work to do to pay it off, while taking into account the costs of the enterprise (salaries, maintenance of mechs, basic necessities, etc.) and the related needs to the expansion of our mech fleet. In the management menu, essentially the bridge of our ship, we have access to different areas, which represent as many sectors of our activity. For example we can consult the list of job offers, travel between systems using the star map and, above all, we can manage the mechs: not only repair them, sell them or move them to stock, but also modify them as we please, taking into account different factors, including weight, armor of individual parts, mobility and overheating. Thus, for example, all the cooling modules can be removed from a mech to increase the number of weapons carried, however increasing the risk that excess heat will damage it in battle, going so far as to make it shut down or, in the most desperate cases to make it explode. We can also bet everything on mobility, however limiting the attack options to melee only. What the best choices are suggested by experience and the next mission to face, as well as the role we want to give to the single mech once they take the field. In some cases it makes sense to equip mechs so that they do as much damage as possible with a singleI attack it, while in others you can also try to dilute the fight, remaining more on the defensive. The main campaign missions are the best At the beginning we can only keep six mechs active, but by improving the warehouse we get up to eighteen. If they seem too many to you, given that a maximum of four can be carried on a mission, you have to consider that as their difficulty increases, having valid reserves becomes essential, as well as having a larger crew than the initial one (the pilots may be wounded and must be healed before returning to battle). Going to savings you risk having to spend a lot of time on maintenance, without being able to do practically anything, apart from paying the bank and salaries. From this you should have understood that every action in Battletech takes time to perform: not only repairs and modifications to mechs can eat up entire weeks of game time, but also going in search of missions among the stars requires some planning . For this reason, for example, it is advisable to carry out all the missions available in a certain system, before going elsewhere, in order to optimize. On the battlefield From an exquisitely strategic point of view, Battletech has only partially succeeded. Let's try to understand why. On the battlefield, the mechs move one at a time, first in search of objectives, then to fight. The interface works very well and, even if we are not at the levels of that of an XCOM 2 for clarity and usability, it is undeniable that Harebrained Schemes has done a very meticulous job in trying to refine it as much as possible, thanks to the many indicators of different shapes that make useful information immediately accessible. The user interface works well In the movement phase, for example, we can check with a glance not only the distance we will cover, but also the direction in which to turn the mech and if the enemies will return to our line of fire, while in the attack phase we will always have the skills under our eyes available, the probabilities of our shots to hit and when necessary we will be able to deactivate some weapons with a click (useful in case of risk of overheating or if you do not want to waste ammunition on a target that is now almost shot down). Their mechs can walk (the distance traveled is minimal, but after that you can continue shooting), run (the distance traveled is greater, but ends the turn) and leaps (they allow you to reach high positions, they do not end the turn , but they can generate some heat), with the latter making sense of the irregular landforms of some maps, increasing the player's tactical options. Too many overheated units Unfortunately, some design choices and a not exactly smart artificial intelligence make the fights quite repetitive, especially in the secondary missions. In battle, Battletech's turn-based system works like this: the faster, light units move first, then the slower, heavy units. On paper, the model followed is impeccable and consistent: the more agile units have greater initiative and should be used as scouts to track down enemies and help the others in positioning. Their contribution during actual combat is limited, especially in the second half of the game when tougher enemies are encountered, but their tactical utility is undoubted. Unfortunately, the artificial intelligence fails to make the most of these mechanics and the different speed of the units ends up disadvantagening it in a decisive way. Often, to win, all you have to do is position yourself and wait for the arrival of smaller and faster enemy troops, such as tanks and light mechs, to immediately get rid of them. So you can devote yourself calmly to the bigger opponents, who usually arrive after a turn or two. By betting everything on long-range weapons and off-field unit tracking (a skill that is unlocked with experience points), many units can be destroyed, or heavily damaged, even before they have a chance to fire a shot. On the planets you can buy weapons, spare parts and you can hire new members of the crew In short, the CPU is unable to manage its units in a choral way and always uses its speed to the maximum, effectively putting itself at a disadvantage that a shrewd player can exploit without mercy. Above all, he can try to replicate the same tactics from mission to mission, knowing that they will certainly work. Metal reflections Fortunately, not all mission types allow you to use these cheats. For example those of tracking require a co approachcompletely different, as are most of the main campaign missions, which have a fixed design, capable of creating interesting and challenging situations that make the most of the game system. Especially the advanced ones offer a significant challenge and allow you to put everything you have learned before into practice. Too bad that most of the time is spent carrying out secondary missions, necessary, as we have seen, to upgrade and pay the crew's salaries; missions that often simply require you to fight against more or less large groups of opponents. The substance is that Battletech shines in the campaign, exciting and well studied, the only one capable of giving prestige to the game system, but is weaker in many of the filler contents, which in any case occupy most of the player's time. This is the classic case in which the side dish ends up watering down the main course a little, highlighting defects that otherwise would not have been noticed. We hope that with future updates other mission types will be added and the artificial intelligence will be refined, because only in this way can the title of Harebrained Schemes be able to really take flight. Another area where the Battletech game system performs particularly well is in multiplayer skirmishes (playable when needed even against the CPU). During the creation of the game it is possible to select one of the twelve maps on which to battle, also altering some environmental conditions to add a little variety. In short, playing against other humans it is necessary to necessarily develop more refined tactics, which playing alone had never been considered. Finally, speaking briefly of strictly technical issues, it must be said that Battletech does its thing and nothing more: the mechs are well made, as are the different effects of the various weapons, which manage to underline the different power even by eye. The scenarios, on the other hand, are quite bare; the best is seen in the missions of the main campaign, but in general even here they don't make a miracle cry. The interlude films deserve a separate note, made in a simple and very effective style, which do not make us regret too much richer and more complex productions. It should also be emphasized that many of the problems encountered at launch (instability, bugs and various glitches) have been resolved with various updates. Finally, the soundtrack is excellent, composed of accompanying songs that blend perfectly with the scenario, which deserve to be listened to separately, and a rich sample of effects, which increase the involvement in the fights.", "date": "2018-05-04", "grade": "7.7"}
