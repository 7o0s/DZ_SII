{"name": "Dark Summit PAL", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dark-summit-pal.html", "text": "History... Given that the game in question is based on a complex and articulated plot, it is worth wasting some time to make everyone understand what it is about. At the beginning of the game you will play Naya, your attractive heroine in snowboard and boots and you will have to deal with the despotic Chief O'Leary and his equally fearsome henchmen on skis from the beginning who will try in every way to drive away both you and everyone the other snowboarders from the slopes of Mt Garrick. To what? What will the mountain hide so secret? Why is the army present on site? And above all, what are those pools of greenish slime that can be seen in some areas of the route? To Naya and her friends (or rather to you) the arduous task of challenging O'Leary and trying to solve the intricate mystery that hides Mount Garrick. Will you be able to solve it and restore the slopes to the snowboarders? This depends only on you and your ability to perform stunning chains of tricks and achieve the entrusted objectives during the various missions. Good luck! Lots of good ideas... And how will you carry out the missions that will be entrusted to you? Your tasks will vary as the plot unravels and you will go from timed challenges to having to collect a fair number of points up to the destruction of particular ~objectives~; with the continuation of the adventure you will make the acquaintance of new individuals who you will have to impersonate at times; by achieving your goals as well as unlocking new characters and boards, you will considerably expand your tricks and evolution park until you get to perform stunts to the limit of human imagination. Particular mention must certainly be made to the multiplayer section which winds through various modes and which will keep the game alive even when you have finished the single-player mode or have simply abandoned it due to the frustration that some particular missions can send you, playing with your friends will be always fun and not only because in this mode there is the possibility of impersonating even the villains of the moment or for the fact that one of the main modes of the game for two has as its ultimate objective the destruction of most of the objects that you have the possibility of observe in the landscape, but as fun and well structured in terms of competition. Unfortunately, all that glitters is not gold, read on... ...unfortunately a little wasted. In fact, all the good ideas and interesting premises are almost completely broken when your greedy hands grab the joypad and try to play a game; in fact, it is practically immediately noticeable how imprecise and user-unfriendly the game controls are (especially as regards the decision to hold down the relative button to perform a grind) and how the physics of the characters is imprecise and too unrealistic; in other words, the game stops halfway between the claim to be realistic, or ~simulation~ we would say, and its distinctly Arcade component; Furthermore, this imprecision in the commands and in the physics leads to frustrating errors that force the player to repeat the same passage of a mission over and over again in order to be able to solve it and be able to continue in his adventure; which inevitably, at times, leads the gamer himself to frustration; Another sore point is related to the graphic and sound sector; the first largely below the capabilities of the machine and above all sparse and mediocre, also filled with poor animations, widespread jerkiness and long and annoying loading during the game; the second monotonous and without depth or personality whatsoever with repetitive drum'en base according to myself poorly matched. Summing up: A good game then? Or a game to avoid like the plague? Neither one nor the other unfortunately. Dark Summit belongs to those titles which, despite excellent premises, original ideas and sometimes exciting realization, tend, due to not exactly negligible defects, to lapse into the most absolute mediocrity, without particular infamy but not even any praise. Excellent ideas such as the insertion of the plot lead to a structure with missions (which could be an excellent solution and a breath of fresh air in the genre) which unfortunately expire, sometimes resulting in monotonous or as already said even worse frustrating . The presence of so many characters and a massive variety of tricks is wasted due to an unfortunate traposition of physical models in general. All this to underline how the defects that undermine the game, being basic and fundamental, affect the enjoyment of the player who, as we all know, is the fundamental component of the game itself. Concluding As you will have understood by now from what has been written so far, the game deserves a rejection, but honestly I don't feel like giving it full marks; after all, there is a lot of irons in the fire and overall within the game there are plenty of good and more than interesting ideas. Too bad for the poor technical realization, another good wasted opportunity, too bad... Pros: The presence of a storyline. Wide interaction with the scenery. The multiplayer modes Cons: Sometimes bad graphics Unreal and unrealistic physics Bad controls Materials: Tips Review of the US version Preview Sport or Adventure? As we previously anticipated, with this title THQ intends to give a clear turn to the genre of snowboarding games. Precisely for this reason, the game, developed by Radical Entertainment, has attracted the attention of the videogame world and myself ever since its development for the new generation consoles was announced. The interest was high on how the Canadian developers, already authors of the mediocre Simpson: Road Rage, would have managed to bring together two apparently so different genres, and in retrospect it can be said that certainly within the game there are very interesting ideas unfortunately not make the most of it. Moving away from the tide of titles that crowd the gaming market in recent years, Dark Summit offers Snowboarding by approaching it from a point of view that other games have never touched before; pillar and element of distinction of Dark Summit from the crowd is the fact of being based on a complex and articulated plot that follows the player from the beginning of the adventure until its natural conclusion unfolding not without some twists during the adventure.", "date": "2002-04-27", "grade": null}
