{"name": "La recensione di Kohan 2: Kings of War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-recensione-di-kohan-2-kings-of-war.html", "text": "From the very first missions it is clear that we are faced with a decidedly innovative game structure: in fact, the usual accumulation of raw materials to be transformed into soldiers and weapons in the shortest possible time will not be at the center of our thoughts. The economic aspect is substantially automatic with resources increasing progressively over time but which in any case can be increased exponentially through the ~colonization~ of mines or other enemy villages (of which we could also acquire troops and form mixed-race armies... although this is not really new) and by the construction of structures used to increase productivity. From the very first missions it is clear that we are dealing with a decidedly innovative game structure Even from a logistical point of view, there was an expression of surprise on my face when I realized that I had no way of deciding the location of the various structures: once the construction was decided, in fact, it will be automatically placed in a placement not determined by the player. The same can be said for the village walls which, after having ~upgraded~ the central core, will be placed automatically by our men. Furthermore, the establishment of a new village will only be possible in certain predetermined points. The only freely buildable structures are outposts, very useful for defending positions thanks to foot soldiers and archers (and other militias depending on the race) but also very expensive in terms of resources to be allocated to their maintenance. Clearly all these choices do not have only an aesthetic value: the predetermined size of the villages (although for each structure there will be various possibilities of ~upgrade~) also means that our armies will not be able to grow dramatically and indefinitely. We will therefore have to use the resources available in the best way to build the most suitable army to counter the enemy. So here is a feature taken (albeit modified) from the first Kohan and which can be considered a standard trademark: the troops, from the moment of their ~birth~, will already be composed of militias made up of a leader (some of which may be inevitable ~heroes~ with their superpowers to be exploited necessarily to get the better of the enemy) and by various combat units (with possible other supports). To the combinations already present we will then be able to edit the composition of these teams to our complete liking, thus assuming the responsibility of creating balanced groups capable of facing the pitfalls of our antagonists in the best possible way. So let's go down to the battlefield The general feeling received by Kohan 2 is that the Timegate programmers wanted to sacrifice some of the players' free will in favor of reasoning, balance (even in gameplay) and order. This feedback becomes even stronger when it comes to challenging my enemies to single tenso. In fact, it does not usually happen to see troops withdraw autonomously in an RTS (always if they have the possibility) when they perceive that they have no chance of victory or decide to make a clean sweep of the defenses before hitting the opponent's structures despite being this was my order. We are faced with a very precise choice which will undoubtedly cause the typical decomposition into two classes of thought between those in favor and against this attitude. The clear-cut choices made by the programmers will undoubtedly cause the typical decomposition into two classes of thinking between for and against However, it is undeniable the fact that in a strategic it is impossible even just to visualize all the outbreaks of war and this greater independence (reasonable) of the troops collects my complete favor also because the AI of our troops and those of the opponents is really of a good level so much so that concluding the decidedly long-lived 25 missions present (which unfortunately, however, sometimes present some decidedly recurring situations) will not be exactly a walk in the park. Finally, it is worth mentioning the possibility of supplying the troops with energy and fresh men through proximity to friendly settlements: an element absolutely to be taken into consideration in the war strategy that we would like to adopt. The Kings of War in company As it was legitimate to expect, Kohan 2 presents a massive component dedicated to multiplayer gaming both via the local LAN and with the services made available by Gamespy where you can easily locate your own gaming room or enter a an already existing one. There will be 8 players (in addition to 4 spectators for a total of 12 people involved) who will be able to take part in the battles readtruly customizable in all their aspects. In addition to the maps to choose from among those generated randomly by the CPU and among ours created with the excellent editor, in addition to the 30 armies present (5 factions for each of the 6 races), the most interesting and peculiar aspect is the total customization of parties (maximum 4) on the field: in practice we can for example choose to create an alliance between three players (probably newbies) against an expert king of war and two mid-level players. Clearly there will be the opportunity to engage in chaotic ~all vs all~ sessions which in the case of FPS, we would have called deathmatch ... Aesthetic plagiarism? Finally, moving on to the technical side, the GameBryo 3D Engine is appreciated for its ability to manage many characters on the screen and the discreet creation of weather and light effects, even if the number of polygons on the screen cannot be said to be considerably high, especially if we take term of comparison the sublime Ground Control 2, but all in all we are certainly dealing with a discreet product and well above the average compared to the genre to which it belongs. We cannot remain silent about the almost embarrassing aesthetic resemblance to Warcraft 3 However, we cannot keep silent about the almost embarrassing aesthetic similarity with Warcraft 3: from the golems that look like ~enforced~ versions of the ~mobile~ trees of WC3 to the same clothing of many units present, the term plagiarism would almost come into play but if we then think that the same authors of the Blizzard masterpiece were strongly inspired by the cornerstones of fantasy literature, a dangerous circle of ~quotation calls for quotation~ could be opened (a bit like Max Payne's bullet time, which closely resembled what was seen in The Matrix in a cinematic key: did ETM then plagiarize the work of Remedy or was it the legitimate ~owner~ of the effect? But perhaps these questions are only for me...). The sound component, on the other hand, is exhilarating: a name is enough, Jeremy Soule (Morrowind, Unreal 2 and Neverwinter Nights to name the most striking names of his recent productions) to guarantee you an epic sound accompaniment at the right point (albeit a bit repetitive in the long run) for the battles of the kings of war and also the excellent voices and interpretations of the actors during the cut scenes (made with the same engine as the game) are so state of the art that the choice to localize them in Italian only with subtitles was decidedly spot on. The first thing you have to do to take Kohan 2 from the right perspective is not to consider it a clone of Warcraft 3 since, excluding the aesthetic component (this is very similar, bordering on the embarrassing though similar), the Timegate Studios title has to offer you a decidedly innovative and tantalizing approach to RTS for strategy lovers. The watchwords of Kings of War are ~severe~ limits on the number of units and structures available, focusing attention on the war-tactical component and therefore making resource management almost automatic. The cocktail with an original flavor can be said to be fully successful and even if some will feel their free will limited, Kohan 2 puts us in the position of having to play with strategy and intelligence, excluding the typical operation of a huge collection of troops and a foregone conclusion. As a side dish there is a satisfactory but not excellent graphic level (unlike the sound which reaches high peaks), a decidedly long-lasting but in some points repetitive main campaign, an excellent map editor and a customizable multiplayer in every aspect. If you want to breathe a breath of originality in the field of RTS (a genre that badly needs it), you absolutely cannot miss it. Pros: Excellent and original strategic component Customizable multiplayer throughout Definitely long-lived Cons: Main campaign a bit repetitive Graphically not excellent Its originality may not appeal to everyone When I drafted the preview of Kohan 2 about a month ago, I was wondering if the title created by the programmers of Timegate Studios had what it takes to stand out in the crowded arena of RTS that never need a breath of innovation and originality. Anticipating what I'm going to write in the final comment, Kings of War manages to achieve both objectives and if you overcome the impasse for an aesthetic component bordering on plagiarism compared to Warcraft 3, you will be able to appreciate the programmers' effort to create a blend truly original and reasoning for this genre. But let's not burn too fast ... Passing over the narrative component that moves on the classic canvas of the fantasy genre with the usual melting pot of civil wars, epochal upheavals, forces of eviland, wizards and witches, traitors and unexpected allies, I immediately launch myself into the main game campaign which presents 25 missions divided into chapters with which we will get acquainted (and practice for the next multiplayer to which I have dedicated a separate box) of the 6 races (further divided into 5 different factions for a total of 30 armies) present in the game which obviously can boast unique characteristics and peculiarities to make the most of to obtain the final victory.", "date": "2004-10-27", "grade": null}
