These are irrelevant elements on a narrative level, if not on that strictly personal level which concerns the perception of one's avatar, but fundamental for determining, through a series of bonuses and maluses linked to each choice, the characteristics of the character that will be used by the game , to determine the outcome of the actions taken. The same characteristics also concern the 15 henchmen who will join us in the rise to power and who we will be able to use in the field so as not to risk our necks ourselves. The Kings of Atlantic City Omerta: City of Gangsters is a mix between a criminal management and a turn-based strategy set in the Atlantic City of Prohibition. The missions are, of course, of a criminal nature with eliminations, thefts and shootings and there is also a reputation system that manages relations with neighbors, such as the beer merchants that we find ourselves cleaning up some cases of alcohol to create the base of our turnover. Unfortunately, one of the major flaws of the title immediately emerges, namely the automatism linked to management missions. In fact, a large part of the managerial gameplay is limited to sending our boss, or one of his henchmen, to carry out certain jobs passively waiting for the result. The possible objectives are numerous and range from interrogating informants, which is essential for discovering what is interesting in the city, to intimidating opponents, but the impact on gameplay is minimal with the management component limited almost exclusively to the choice of type of mission and the best men to carry it out. Some collateral activities, such as the production of illegal goods and interactions of various kinds with the police and with important figures in the area, could give greater depth to the formula, but there is no real dynamic system of social relationships and the he economics of the title is dramatically simple. In fact, this depends almost exclusively on how much we decide to spend on corruption and on the illegal goods we sell or sell off in an emergency. Fortunately, to balance the shortcomings of the management component, there is turn-based combat which refers to the great classics of the genre such as XCOM and Jagged Alliance. As in any self-respecting RPG / strategy, the characteristics are important and determine who acts first, the probability that a character has of hitting a target and, obviously, the resistance. Then there are the covers, levels and skills that allow you to add status modifiers to the damage ranging from crippling to head trauma and which allow you to slow down, stun or bleed an enemy. To top it all off, and here we are on XCOM-beaten ground, combatants can fall victim to panic or rage by suddenly overturning a seemingly resolved situation. Unfortunately the artificial intelligence is not flawless and the balance is certainly not that of the titles we have just mentioned. Especially since getting rich in the management part of the title is extremely simple and when it becomes possible to buy weapons and grenades in profusion, the degree of challenge of the compaction is also compromised. To make the situation even worse, multiplayer takes care of it even if in this case the problem is certainly not represented by artificial intelligence but by the lack of a matchmaking system which, in combination with the possibility of leveling up, leads too often to face matches you learn. To the rhythm of Jazz The world of management has often exploited the complex economic system that characterized the era of American gangsters. A distorted American dream, with a thousand chances of success constantly kept open by a market almost devoid of rules, fragmented by violence and therefore capable of elevating even the latest arrival if he showed he knows how to seize the opportunity. Cinema has further magnified the exploits of gangsters and mafiosi transplanted to America, creating heroes and anti-heroes of a frontier placed in the middle of the most flourishing American cities. All elements capable of creating genuine tension in a panorama made up of negative and dramatic heroes but at the same time fascinating and capable of acts of courage and violence so extreme as to become legendary. Omerta: City of Gangsters partly follows the path traced by the successful fiction but, sadly, fails to embodythe drama of the context in which it leads us. The climb to power obviously passes through the family structure of the underworld, and we don't miss the trusted personal adviser to guide us, but the narrative component slips through the loose meshes of a few textual windows and from interludes often poor in pathos. In any case, the title is full of information that helps us to characterize the characters and offer our imagination all the cues necessary to independently fill the narrative gaps. Furthermore, the atmosphere is not lacking which in Omerta: City of Gangsters is supported by a good level graphic component, well-finished animations and respectable dubbing, at least in English (the Italian version is entirely localized but we do not guarantee the quality of the voices). Unfortunately the Atlantic City that forms the background to the title is too geometric and too little varied to actually reach the heights of realism promised by the developers, but the care reserved for the aesthetic sector is evident in the detail of the models and graphic effects that give the city wet from the rain a magical look. Furthermore, in the case of the soundtrack, which already welcomes us powerfully starting from the menus, the quality leaves us speechless. Classy jazz and vintage melodies mix with splendid piano solos and ambient sound composed of extremely evocative samples.", "date": "2013-02-07", "grade": "6.5"}
