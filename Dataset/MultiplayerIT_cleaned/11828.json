{"name": "Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-z-budokai-tenkaichi-3-recensione.html", "text": "We thought all was said and done for the Dragon Ball games on PlayStation 2, yet the latest installment in the Budokai Tenkaichi series debunks that assumption with more characters and modes available. The exceptional numbers already shown previously are further fleshed out in this case, reaching record figures: over one hundred and sixty characters (variants included), four different modes, more than thirty locations... There really is enough material to make the many enthusiastic fans of the series, who will now be able to relive any fight seen in the cartoon as well as in the feature films. Game mode The start screen of Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 allows you to access the various game modes. The first, of course, is the ~Story of the Dragon~: it is an episodic story mode, in which each phase of the anime is translated into a fight and progresses as the battles are successfully completed. We won't have to follow a single track, but we will be able to move from the ~normal~ history of DBZ to that of the films, possibly passing through the ~what if~ saga in which we will find Trunks and Gohan from the alternate reality in which androids have conquered the world. In total there are fifty fights to face (not many, in relation to the length of the story), with more than one surprise: in some cases we will find ourselves leading the ~bad guys~ and our victory will serve to make the events proceed in a that respect the original plot. The second mode is ~Battle Ultimate~, which contains four distinct modes: ~Dragon Sim~, ~Mission 100~, a mystery mode (which turns out to be a classic survival mode), and ~Disk Merge~. The latter asks us to insert the discs of the first two DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi to be able to access special battles with a series of opponents, while ~Dragon Sim~ is perhaps the most original gimmick, as it sees us select one of the characters available for then make him train, face trials, explore the world looking for items and finally fight to level up. It is a sort of ~career~, however designed to be used only once (it is not possible to save progress), a bit like a challenge to those who go the furthest. Finally, ~Mission 100~ is a set of tests (one hundred in total) to be faced in the way we deem most appropriate, and which translate into fighting against certain opponents in various circumstances, perhaps with the obligation to achieve objectives to win. The ~World Dragon Tour~ mode replaces the simple ~World Tournament~ of previous Budokai Tenkaichi episodes, giving us the opportunity to try our hand not only with the classic Tenkaichi Tournament, but also with its five variants (the ~Grand World Tournament~, the ~Game of Cell~, the ~Tournament of the Afterlife~ and the ~Game of Yamcha~). The ~Duel~ mode, ~Z Evolution~ (to buy items and create customized warriors), ~Supreme Training~ (to practice the combat system), ~Data Center~ (where you can enter a password to recover a character created from scratch, check the ones already saved as well as look at archived replays) and ~Character Reference~ (i.e. a comprehensive encyclopedia on all the characters that appear in the game). At the beginning it is also a must to enter the options screen, where we can select the Japanese spoken instead of the English one (highly recommended choice), manage the saves, customize the controls and select the type of view we prefer. Unfortunately the game does not support widescreen mode or progressive scan. Basically... You don't live by numbers alone, and although the numbers of Budokai Tenkaichi 3 are staggering, it is clear that the focus is mainly on the game itself and any changes made to the combat system. Well, from this point of view things have actually changed, and for the better: the developers have ~polished~ some aspects that made the experience potentially cumbersome and repetitive, improving the artificial intelligence of the opponents and automating some procedures that could have been very limiting, especially during the first few games. This third episode of the series is by far the most playable and probably corresponds to the idea that Namco Bandai wanted to translate on the screen from the beginning: a series of clashes governed by speed and entertainment, which reproduce as faithfully as possible what was seen in the cartoon animated. The ~classic~ strengths of the game are all there, some controls have been modified to be faster and more natural, while the move execution system special and spiritual energy management remained unchanged. During the first fights we will be able to tear apart the opponents with ease, resorting to all kinds of offensive maneuvers, but as we proceed we will see the enemies become much more cunning and faster, and launching very powerful empty attacks will become a dangerous habit. The stages have maintained their original setting, therefore they boast a sufficient extension to contain any strategic escapes and are widely interactable: throwing the enemy against a building and seeing it explode is still one of the funnest things you can do, even if it is of a practice that shows the limits of a well designed and convincing scenario, but which cannot shine for the amount of polygons. Technical realization While retaining the bulk of the work done for Budokai Tenkaichi 2, this third episode of the series does not skimp on important additions in the form of new characters and new scenarios, trying to improve wherever possible without the graphics engine suffering. In terms of fluidity, in fact, the game is impeccable: even in the busiest situations (and we are talking about buildings collapsing between huge explosions), the frame rate remains constant and there is no slowdown. The characters are characterized by a cel shading that makes them extremely similar to their counterparts in the anime, and the lack of a high level of detail is compensated by textures that change according to the hits suffered and do so through multiple stages. The special effects are brilliant, especially when the warriors charge up with spirit energy and you can see their aura flapping until they almost explode. We are probably faced with one of the best compromises between speed, detail and effects that have ever been seen on PlayStation 2, and the safe transition to next-gen platforms can only produce something absolutely extraordinary, especially as regards interaction with scenarios. The sound is decidedly more ~conservative~, consisting of the usual selection of not very engaging music, accompanied however by excellent effects. The game is fully translated into Italian in the screen texts.", "date": "2007-11-15", "grade": "8.5"}
