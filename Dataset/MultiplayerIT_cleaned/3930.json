On one thing, however, those fans tend to always agree: Shoji Meguro, the composer of the soundtracks in all three games, is untouchable. Music has always had the lion's share in Persona, so it's no wonder that some time ago Atlus decided to take the cast of Persona 4 - the most popular, thanks also to the animated series and Arc System Works fighting games - and catapult him into a rhythm game, Persona 4: Dancing All Night, especially after the good success that experiments such as Square Enix's Theathrhythm Final Fantasy had had. A few years later, therefore, even a kind of double-version sequel arrives, dedicated to Persona 3 and Persona 5. Unfortunately, however, something has been lost along the way. A story that doesn't exist First of all, let's get a simple concept straight away. Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight and Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight are two practically specular titles, a bit like two different versions of Pokmon. Atlus had this, uh, happy idea of duplicating the same game, changing the cast, dialogue and music, of course, while keeping the exact same structure. And this time there is no real story to justify the performances of the protagonists. Persona 4: Dancing All Night in a certain sense also overdid it, in an attempt to tell a surreal adventure through a kind of visual novel at the limits of the plausible which nevertheless respected the vaguely thriller atmospheres of the original JRPG. In Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight and Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight there is no visual novel and the premise is identical in both games: the protagonists find themselves in the Velvet Room to dance to demonstrate their fortitude, both it's just a kind of dream they'll forget the next day. In short, it's not even a Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth-style ~what if~ situation, because the casts of the two games will never meet and the story is encapsulated so that it cannot influence the plots of the original JRPGs even in retrospect . In fact, the prologue takes place within a couple of minutes and then we immediately move on to playing, but there is still an absolutely secondary narrative component - and indeed quite superficial - that the Japanese developer dedicates to the most avid Persona fans. By completing certain objectives (which change according to the character but in the end are exactly the same both in one game and in the other) dialogue skits are unlocked, called Socials, which deepen the bonds between the characters, letting us know them a little ' Better. They are actually quite impromptu dialogues that don't add much in terms of narrative, but which unlock new songs, costumes, accessories and options useful for customizing games and performances. Furthermore, the last dialogues for the character take place in the rooms of our heroes and are associated with a bizarre minigame that allows us to explore these rooms at three hundred and sixty degrees to enjoy some small details or find hidden collectibles. Players in possession of the PlayStation VR peripheral can also visit these rooms with virtual reality: it is a small gem that adds little or nothing but which was worth mentioning. In short, it is a strange approach, but in a certain sense it works: it provides increasingly demanding objectives and at the same time rewards fans of the series with a bit of fanservice which never hurts. Unfortunately, however, the thickness of these dialogues is really non-existent, and to make them at least enjoyable there are only the animations and the good voice actors, when, moreover, it is possible to choose between the track in English and the one in Japanese. In the end, it's a hair's rage to think that this spin-off so narratively sparse has been completely translated into Italian, while Persona 5 absolutely hasn't. Playstation 4 trophies The two games share the same number of Trophies: they are 42 in total and the platinum trophy is obtained by first unlocking three gold, twelve silver and twenty-six bronze trophies. Obtaining them is not very difficult, because it is enough to complete the various Social objectives and manipulate the difficulty to succeed in the enterprise without too much paranoia. let's Dance As far as gameplay is concerned, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight and Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight play exactly like Persona 4: Dancing All Night. In fact, Atlus hasI ported the exact same control scheme from the PlayStation Vita title to PlayStation 4, but in doing so it magnified some issues. Let's start from the assumption that graphically everything is much more beautiful and colorful: the polygonal models of the various characters are more defined and cared for and the greater fluidity and naturalness of the animations has allowed the developer to stage even more complex and spectacular choreographies, sometimes involving even more of two characters per song. However, as was already the case on PlayStation Vita with Persona 4: Dancing All Night, also in this case the complexity and frenzy of the choreographies do not play in our favor, because they often end up distracting us from the notes that appear on the screen and which we will have to beat in time of music. The scheme we said is always the same: the notes move from the center of the screen in six different directions and we will have to act on the left analog stick and on the keys to the right of the joypad to follow the rhythm, sometimes by pressing the keys for a certain period of time or Together. All in all, the interface is clear from the first moment, but if they can already confuse the movements of the notes while in the background the dancers move among a thousand strobe lights, another problem is represented by the field of view offered by TVs that have much larger screens of that PlayStation Vita. Therefore, following the notes becomes tiring, even if you get carried away over time, but you always have the feeling of having very little control over the action, above all because the game itself, reasonably, does not force you to perform perfectly: the player, for example , can completely ignore the notes represented by the blue circles which would impose a pressure on the stick but which in the end only affect the score, without jeopardizing the success of the game. The options fortunately allow you to change some parameters to make the game easier or more difficult even beyond the various difficulty levels offered individually for each song: in this way even novice players will be able to easily complete the most complicated songs, while rhythm game veterans will be able to count on even more demanding challenges. Ultimately it all leads back to Social objectives, because it is the accessories and additional options that allow for greater customization of the games, especially as the songs are replayed: the biggest problem of Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight and Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight is that the tracks are simply too few. Each game has about twenty-five songs, a little bit actually, especially if we also consider the remixes which, if we have to be honest, in this round seemed uninspired and almost always inferior to the original songs. A real pity: it would have been much better to bring the two casts together in a hypothetical dance challenge and offer a title that, in terms of quantity of songs and content, truly justified the price of a big-budget game.", "date": "2018-11-27", "grade": "6.5"}
