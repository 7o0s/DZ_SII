The Elder Scrolls Online proves that it belongs to this small circle with its latest expansion: Necrom. This new adventure in the vast world of Tamriel is a real twist for players who, after the past expansion, were now strongly discouraged and disappointed with Bethesda's work. With Necrom, however, they will find themselves faced with a completely new and compelling experience, saving ZeniMax Online from the embarrassing accusations made by the community that they are no longer able to create something interesting capable of responding to the needs of the players. We explain why in our review of The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom. The context Some scenarios of The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom With two new maps to discover, the Zenimax team expands the game's already vast universe, offering players a wide variety of fascinating locations to explore. Our adventure begins in front of the walls of Necrom, the City of the Dead, capital of the Telvanni Peninsula, one of the most remote areas of Morrowind, governed precisely by the Telvanni family. Necrom is where the Dark Elves venerate the dead and is considered by them to be a meeting point between the mortal plane of Nirn and the spirit plane of Aetherius. For this reason, both the rulers and the inhabitants of this region are completely disinterested in politics and the happenings of the outside world. But the real gem of the new expansion is represented by the new class introduced: the Arcanists. Possessing abilities drawn directly from the Daedric Prince Hermaeus Mora, the Lord of Knowledge and Memory, these powerful wizards embody the very essence of magic. Wielding the power of this new class is an exhilarating experience and highlights the exceptional flexibility of the Elder Scrolls Online game system. The story of The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom, without spoilers The story of The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom turned out to be a compelling one Given the premises, to immerse ourselves in the best way, we therefore decided to start our adventure with a character of the Dark Elf race (Dunmer) and Arcanist Class. In fact, the new chapter of ESO, like all the previous ones starting from One Tamriel, can be played without difficulty by characters of any level, even newly created. Our mission will be to thwart a conspiracy implemented by the Daedric princes Vaermina (Mrs. of Dreams, Nightmares and bad Omens) and Peryite (Lord of Plagues) against Hermaeus Mora in order to block his vision. For this reason we are contacted by Leramil, a high elf, agent of the Lord of Knowledge and by Hermaeus Mora himself, who inform us of the conspiracy, the consequences of which could destroy the very reality in which we find ourselves. During our adventure we were joined by one of the most successful characters - to date - in the game: Scruut, a small Watchling with a very austere and contemptuous attitude but who, despite this, made us immediately become attached to his figure and his company . The story almost immediately catapults us into the second area introduced with this chapter, or the mysterious realm of Apocrypha, one of the realms of Oblivion shaped by Mora full of infinite libraries that extend in every direction, containing all the knowledge of the universe. Apocrypha is where a good 60% of our adventure takes place and it is also where the developers of ZeniMax have given their all. The map, in fact, has a visual and immersive impact that impressed us a lot, especially when compared with the previous chapters. Another aspect that we really appreciated is the variety of enemy types we came across that are not limited to those that had already appeared in Skyrim's Apocrypha. This realm of Oblivion is, in fact, full of terrible and frightening creatures, Alien-style, some of which literally made an impression on us as soon as we met them for the first time. One of the creatures that struck us the most is certainly the Mind Terror, an arachniform alien monster with spear-shaped arms and numerous horns, capable of intimidating even some of Diablo's monsters. Two new companions During our adventure we came across one of the main novelties of Necrom: the two new Companion. Indeed, in Elder Scrolls Online, starting from Blackwood, it is possible to play one's own adventure supported by NPCs whose aesthetics and skills and equipment can be customized as well. With Necrom are stIntroducing Sharp-as-night, a Warden-class Argonian mercenary with no memory of his past and our favorite: Axander, a Redguard Arcanist who appears to be the perfect mix between Albus Dumbledore and Willy Wonka. The arcanist The arcanist makes her debut in The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom The novelty that no one expected and which created the expectation for the new expansion was the introduction of a new Class, a hypothesis which by now had been excluded by many and which made a large number of people return to play. The Arcanist is presented as an extremely fun class to play and certainly visually on another level compared to the others as it has unique and much more ~flashy~ animations when compared with the skills of the other Classes already present in the game. In the development of the Arcanist you can see all the effort put into the field by the Zenimax Team, especially in the attention to detail and in the study of his skills. This Class, more than others, at the moment seems to be the one truly able to effectively cover all the classic end game roles of each MMORPG (tank, healer or damage dealer). In the adventures we will be accompanied by two new companions Playing the Arcanist was that breath of fresh air that was needed in a game as long-lived as The Elder Scrolls Online and lends itself very well to being efficient even in the hands of the less experienced. The Arcanist, like the other Classes, has 3 Skills Exclusive lines: Herald of the Tome: dedicated to harm Soldier of Apocrypha: dedicated to the role of the tank Curative Runeforms: dedicated to healing The peculiar characteristic of this Class is the ~Crux~ system. Using the skills, in fact, we will be able to create or consume Crux and, based on how many we consume, our skills will have enhanced effects. For this reason, at the beginning, it was perhaps a bit complicated for us to understand how to fit the skills well trying to build the 3 Cruxes necessary to use the main damage Skill to the maximum power, but even if we made mistakes most of the time, we were still managed to inflict a large amount of damage during our adventure. What happens in the end game New opponents will challenge us in The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom Among the innovations introduced with Necrom, certainly a new raid end game could not be missing, the Trial, or a dungeon that must be faced with groups of 12 players. Sanity's Edge is the new challenge that the most veterans will have to face in order to obtain the new End Game equipment. To play it, we contacted the guys from the Order of Shor with whom we explored this interesting adventure and explained all the mechanics to us. The setting of Sanity's Edge is certainly innovative: in fact, we did not find ourselves in a physical place, but in the mind of a wizard who is having a horrible nightmare because of the Daedric Princess Vaermina. The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom players in action The Trial features three bosses with mechanics that put every single player in the group to the test. Coordination is key as is a good combination of Classes within the group. In Elder Scrolls Online, in fact, every single Class has a passive ability that gives the rest of the group a unique Buff which, in the most difficult challenges, are all extremely necessary. Playing this Trial was extremely interesting and we certainly wouldn't have been able to complete it without a group so willing to explain the mechanics even to those with less experience. Sanity's Edge has a fairly high difficulty, but still lower than the Trials introduced with the two previous chapters of Elder Scrolls Online, despite presenting much more dynamic and fun mechanics to play. A point against this challenge is represented by the final loot. Apparently, at the moment, of the four end game sets obtainable in the Trial, only the one from Healer seems actually effective. For now, Necrom has been able to conquer us and we can certainly tell you that it deserves an opportunity, the best advice we can give you to enjoy the adventure at best, is to join a guild of experts right away like we did.
