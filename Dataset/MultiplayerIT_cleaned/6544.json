This is particularly true in the mobile sector, where many titles refer to the visual style of the 16-bit consoles, with the gameplay that often and willingly follows this trend by going back to the stylistic features of the time. However, there are alternative paths, such as the one taken by the Combo Queen here, which combines a Super Nintendo look with playful mechanics typical of the new course traced by mobile gaming. Let's see if in this case the mix works. Endless action rpg rhythm runner As it is easy to imagine the protagonist of Combo Queen is a woman, in this case a blonde warrior armed with double axes that the player must lead in an infinite succession of clashes with various enemies: the basic structure can recall those of an endless runner, given that the on-screen character moves independently and the game ends when you are defeated, but it takes a few seconds to understand that the Tap My Game title has more affinity with the rhythm game genre. The fights are in fact all a matter of timing, given that to attack and defend yourself you need to tap on the screen at the exact moment in which a reticle reaches the relative indicator. Hence, to successfully carry out a blow it is necessary to touch the display when a quadrant is superimposed on the icon positioned on the enemy, while vice versa a blow can be parried when the cross that accompanies the movement of the opponent's weapon is positioned above the one that appears on the protagonist. All very simple, immediate and in perfect mobile style, even if the challenge levels are anything but casual: not only must the taps be performed on the screen with due timing, but it also takes a good quickness of reflexes to react to the particular gameplay dynamics set up by the developers of Tap My Game. Hence, after each attack, the movement speed of the dial varies (making it difficult to chain long series of blows), but the offensive pattern of the opponents also changes constantly, which are produced in one or more consecutive blows in an absolutely random and therefore unpredictable. I mean, the old trick of memorizing the right sequences doesn't work with Combo Queen... Thanks to a timely update, Combo Queen has managed to become an enjoyable game It must be specified that at the time of its release on the App Store, Combo Queen suffered from a poor balance of difficulty and an overly uncompromising tap detection system, two serious design oversights that dramatically undermined the usability of the product: luckily Tap My Game has listened to the criticisms of the first buyers of the game and has distributed a substantial update that has smoothed out almost all the edges of a title that was initially too frustrating. Therefore, if initially it often happened to die even in the first fight - due not only to the excessive timing required to give inputs but also to the deliberate choice not to give a progressiveness to the enemies' ability - now the situation is decidedly more normal thanks to also a mechanism that rewards perfect hits with greater damage and much clearer on-screen indications. We therefore proceed from one fight to another until we are defeated, accumulating the gems that are given as a prize for each victory to then spend them in the appropriate in-game shop which offers various upgrades and consumables at sufficiently high prices to stimulate the player to continue to win the most valuable pieces. In short, the development team must be given credit for having managed to plug the big holes in the very first release of the game, making a pleasant game out of what was a real mess of bad choices. Despite this, from a technical point of view Combo Queen proves to be perched on intransigent positions which make it objectively difficult to appreciate by anyone. So pixel art is welcome, but in this case the impression is that the inspiration for 16-bit titles was taken too literally by the Tap My Game graphics, who used a very limited palette of colors which gives the whole a muddy and unclear look. The same goes for the sound, with chiptune melodies and sound effects so blatantly old school as to be rather annoying in the long run.", "date": "2015-02-23", "grade": "7.5"}
