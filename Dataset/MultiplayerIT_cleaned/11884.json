{"name": "Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/age-of-empires-iii-the-asian-dynasties-recensione.html", "text": "The Age of Empires saga has been the most popular single and multiplayer real-time strategy series for over a decade. The accurate historical reconstruction and solid gameplay have made it a point of reference among enthusiasts and even the old titles are still played fairly well today. The third episode (if Age of Mythology is excluded) in addition to entirely 3D graphics, introduced a multitude of improvements in order to make the games even more profound, such as the experience points necessary to acquire playing cards, the streamlining of the collection of resources and the ability to train units from ships. The many civilizations available and the two expansions (including the one reviewed in this article), exponentially increase the variety of situations and tactics available to the player. The Asian Dynasties (which requires the presence of the base game) like its predecessors, offers a single player campaign useful above all to familiarize yourself with the new features present, which are generally pitted over the course of the 18 missions (6 for each of the 3 civilizations ). Apart from some rare and nice variations, most of the situations involve the creation of a base and a solid economy in order to churn out powerful units to then go on to defeat the enemy army, which in the meantime attacks every now and then with some poor units . Journey to the East Frankly, we don't understand why the developers are unable to offer a more refined artificial intelligence. With the exception of some missions in the final stages of the campaign, the sent armies rarely manage to put the player in difficulty, given the small number with which they attack, which is more useful than anything else to increase the player's experience points, especially given the importance which represents this aspect in the economy of the game. On top of that, enemy AI, even when it manages to bypass our defenses, generally ends up attacking structures rather than workers, making almost all enemy sorties a mere formality in practice. In short, during the game, the enemy manages to put you in difficulty only because he generates units out of nothing or has a consistent initial advantage, but we really aren't there in terms of tactics. One of the most successful aspects of The Asian Dynasties is instead constituted by the characterization of the three civilizations: Japanese, Chinese and Indians. Each has strengths and weaknesses that make it difficult to determine which is more powerful. The Japanese can generate resources from houses and have good quality troops, while the Chinese, in addition to having a very refined economy, train units from the barracks in groups, making specialized squads against specific units. Finally, the Indians can use, in addition to the fearsome elephants, the cows scattered around the map as well as to obtain meat, also to obtain experience by leaving them close to special altars. PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium IV 1.4 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: GeForce 3 with 64 MB Ram Disk Space: 2 GB Age of Empires 3 Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium IV 2 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1 GB Video Card: GeForce FX 5900 XT with 128 MB memory Age of Empires 3 Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.66 GHz RAM: 2 GB DDR2 Video Card: Geforce 7300 with 256 MB memory Age of Empires 3: The Asian Dynasties is a well-crafted and content-rich single and multiplayer expansion. The new civilizations are well characterized, as are the novelties on the gameplay front, which exponentially increase the tactical depth of the series. Too bad only for the poor artificial intelligence in single player. Pros Three new well-characterized civilizations Lots of strategies available Several new game modes Cons Lack of artificial intelligence Graphics not very updated Undemanding single player campaign Age of Empires 3: The Asian Dynasties is available for PC. Even richer multiplayer Among the innovations common to all new civilizations, we find the possibility of building a consulate and forging alliances in order to obtain particular benefits and the creation of a marvel necessary for each passage of age. These, once completed, depending on the case, provide particular military or economic bonuses or a constant flow of resources. All these introductions make the multiplayer even more varied and unpredictable. This expansion introduces new victory modes for custom battles, such as: Regicide (whoever kills the opponent's King wins), King of the Mountain and Treaty, where one player takes turns attacking and the other can only defendYes, but with more resources. The graphics engine in The Asian Dynasties is essentially identical to that of the base game, except for slightly more defined character models. Being a 2-year-old game, on the test PC the title runs smoothly at 1024x768 with all the details activated.", "date": "2007-10-29", "grade": null}
