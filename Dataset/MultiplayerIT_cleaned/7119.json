We can therefore offer only a partial comment, since we will have to wait for the release of the fifth and final episode to evaluate the work. If you have never heard of The Walking Dead video game, we advise you to read the review of the first episode of the second season. Finally, if you are one of those who cannot tolerate even the slightest revelation about the plot of a story, skip the review and read directly to the final comment. for you. The developers know right from the start where they want to go and rest assured that the story will cross all the expected milestones. In the course of In Harm's Way we reach a point where we realize that the episode has been going on for a few minutes without bothering to ask us. This extreme control over everything that happens behind the screen is perhaps justified by the fact that never before have so many characters been brought into play. Clementine and her large group are in the hands of Carver and his men, an uncomfortable and complex situation that we initially thought would occupy the rest of the series, but is resolved in the course of the third episode. There are so many interesting new characters that we would like to know more about, and already among the old ones, personalities have emerged that we have had time to bond with. However, all this was possible precisely because we spent most of the time looking at the screen as if we were watching a well-written television episode. It's actually not entirely accurate. In fact, we are offered the possibility of choosing who is becoming Clementine. His brutal transition from childhood to maturity is partly inevitable, we already understand it from the type of answers that are presented to us in the dialogues, but what his personality will be, well, that is up to us to decide. We get a preview of what awaits us when Carver tells Clementine that they are the same. A ruthless dictator who has no faith in his men to the point of assassinating one of them because of his ineptitude seeks the complicity of an (ex) eleven-year-old girl. You and I are the same, he tells her. What we choose to answer will make all the difference, even if unfortunately it doesn't seem to change the subsequent dialogue choices. We can always jump from one extreme in Clementine's attitude to the other, until the final terrifying emotional crossroads, masterfully prepared by the episode minute after minute. Never before has Telltale staged such a whirlwind of hate, blood and darkness. The player has the task of telling the evolution of Clementine's personality and staging the conflict between her new nature as a survivor determined to play by the rules of this new barbaric world and the person who owes her life to the love of who took care of her. Selfish, cold and uncompassionate or trustworthy, protective of the weakest and disgusted by violence? However you decide to play the role of Clementine, one thing doesn't change: all adults depend on her. How is it possible? Perhaps this is the most disturbing question of the new season. In Harm's Way forces Clementine to reveal her gray area. Will we be able to save her soul? Man is a wolf to man In Harm's Way is a frustrating episode, because right away it's clear that our hands are tied. We are at the mercy of Carver, who displays constant sadism, perhaps too uncontrollably at times. How does he keep a community going if he kills on a whim? In any case it works, because he knows how to make himself hated right away. The group independently decides the course of action and whatever we try to do, or rather say, it is clear that we cannot avoid the escalation of pain. The pleasure lies in deciding what Clementine's reaction is in different situations, and above all in observing how the adults' point of view towards her changes. Clementine is the new Lee of the group. She won't decide what to do, but when it comes to putting a plan into action, everyone counts on her. Another interesting development is the bond between Clementine and Kenny. There is a complicity between them that has two faces. They love each other, but they also understand each other on a much more disturbing level, which is about their worldview. We have a lot of decision-making power over these nuances, even if we are convinced that it is only a question of staging one emotion rather than another, without long-term consequences. In any case, Telltale once again packs an episodeor flawless that leaves us wanting to know what happens next. Of course, the situations presented are nothing new, and in fact the developers liquidate the dictator on duty in a single episode, but between the lines of dialogue it is perceived that the real story is told elsewhere, in the soul of the characters. A terrifying emotional trap awaits Clementine on the horizon and, considering the ease with which the Telltales use violence to corner the characters, we dare not imagine what it is. Even if it has lost the freshness of the first time, this second season could be even more intense and memorable than the first. For now, things appear to be exactly like this. Meanwhile zombies have been confined to the role of natural disaster. Like an earthquake, or a pack of wolves at the gates of a village. But fear not: in the end you will find yourself covered in blood amidst a horde of corpses. Death doesn't pause in The Walking Dead.", "date": "2014-05-15", "grade": "8.0"}
