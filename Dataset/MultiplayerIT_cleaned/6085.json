An add-on divided into two parts, offered at the double price of 14.99 if you want to buy the episodes individually or 24.99 if you want to trust the project and buy the second package. Little or nothing is still known about the second part and the hope is that it will arrive on the market before Christmas, but what we can tell you is that this first piece is actually practically self-contained, unlike what we would have expected. The first part of White March is finally available and we have played it from top to bottom Once upon a time The narrated story has its own precise narrative arc and does not leave the player hanging or, at least, not more than necessary since, most likely, the next part will be set in a different area of Biancamarca and will only take into account what is narrated in a minimal way in this episode. Wait to sing victory though, because the narrative aspect is the least successful of the package probably because Obsidian, in order not to dissatisfy both those who had already reached the endgame, and those who will take advantage of the expansion to start playing Pillars, has seen forced to create an excessively diluted plot, too superficial and lateral to the one narrated in the original game. Therefore, if on the one hand we have been able to appreciate the secondary missions that are decidedly better connected to the main quest, being also reduced from a numerical point of view, there is no doubt that having completed The White March Part 1 adds very little to the fantasy universe set up by obsidian. It's nice to find out more about the dwarves who inhabited the Durgan Battery and used its mythical forge or about the sad fate of the village of Stalwart, but note that the Legacy, the Observers and more generally the whole phenomenon of Animanzia have not crossed the boundaries of the Forest of Dyr, or nearly so, is hardly credible. Specifically, the expansion offers five different locations: the Biancamarca, a real separate map, offers four including a village that represents the new collection point for all the quests and the only safe area where the player can interact with non-player characters and obviously seek shelter and refreshment. Also added to the original Dyr area is the fortress of Cragholdt. While the latter is specifically dedicated to parties that have reached the endgame and will allow you to climb up to the new maximum level, the fourteenth, with new seventh-level spells and skills attached, Biancamarca is a territory specifically dedicated to level parties variable between the sixth and eight. Basically the only requirement to reach it will be to have completed the first act of Pillars of Eternity and to have discovered the stronghold in Caed Nua. However, the add-on also allows those who have finished Pillars of Eternity to face this new challenge and at the precise moment in which they will go to the new area, the game will allow the level of enemies to be increased at the player's discretion in an attempt to offer a balanced battle. Actually what we could see during our game session is that White March tends to be more difficult than the original for two reasons. First, it tends to bring much larger and more varied groups of opponents onto the battlefield with each encounter. Virtually every battle sees the presence of warriors, thieves, wizards and even clerics ready to slaughter the player. This element, combined with a rewrite of the artificial intelligence that finally takes into account the various skills and fighting styles, means that positioning becomes a crucial element in every fight and it does not happen so rarely to see some characters in your group immediately fall to the ground at the start of the fight due to being targeted from a distance. The White March quests also tend to take place much more inside dungeons with all that follows in terms of character movements and distance management during encounters. And, for those who write this review, it's a shame since the open-air fights were one of the distinctive and most successful elements of Pillars of Eternity. Lots of cool new stuff As we already wrote during our previous encounters with the expansion, a great job has been done by the developer to clean up and update the gameplay of this splendid gameclassic role. Starting from the artificial intelligence described above and which also influences our party members through, finally, the introduction of a series of behaviors that can be managed automatically and customized by the player. Based on the type of class we will in fact be able to determine the nature and style of the actions of our adventure companions during the clashes while they are not under our direct control. It's not just about managing how and when to respond to opponents' attacks but also what type of skills and spells to use and whether to ~waste~ even those that need rest to be recovered. But this is only the most evident tip of an iceberg also made up of the possibility of sending only certain characters into stealth, the addition of a handful of talents that allow you to use a rudimentary multi-class system and the presence of particularly powerful weapons which, once bound to the soul of a specific class, they also gain combat experience by gradually unlocking new skills and powers. In addition, the same game interface has been retouched to make the areas of influence of spells and abilities much clearer, so as to allow you to better plan your party's movements. As icing on the cake we also find two brand new companions, a masochistic monk and a female construct thief, both recruitable in Biancamarca but possibly usable also in the original territories of Dyr. And the most interesting thing is that all these improvements and changes to the gameplay, with the obvious exception of the new territory and unpublished contents, are also available to owners of the base game through a large free patch distributed a few days ago. In reality we feel compelled to beat the Obsidian guys anyway because despite the evident effort made to enhance the gameplay of their creature, we noticed that the problems regarding pathfinding highlighted in our original review have remained practically untouched here. Sure, as we wrote just above, enemies now tend to position themselves in a much better way than in the past, but all the difficulties our characters had in reaching them or getting around obstacles during combat are still an integral part of the game. It will continue to happen very frequently to see our melee fighters get stuck a few steps from the opponent on duty or, even worse, start strange dances on the spot when the targeted enemy is immediately behind another character and often the consequences are catastrophic even at due to the increased difficulty level. Furthermore, in the build we tested there was a rather annoying bug that left our AI-controlled companions motionless for several seconds when their target died. Before moving on to the technical component, it seems necessary to point out that it took us just over 13 hours to complete the expansion. Starting with a high-level group, it is possible that two or three less are needed. It's always a lookout From an artistic point of view there is very little to contest White March Part 1. The incredible attention to detail is still a consistent element of the gaming experience and the total change of setting, now almost completely covered in snow and references to the past masterpiece Icewind Dale, did a lot of good for the variety of the game. The scenarios are always splendid to see and the care in the choice of the color palette combined with the aesthetic solutions used to populate the maps duly compensate for the minimalist technical component and very close to the genre of very old-fashioned role-playing games. It is important to mention that Obsidian has also made an effort to make the scripted but interactive gamebook-style sequences in White March much more interactive, long and stylistically flawless. Often you will also have to decide which character from your party to use during the narrated actions and, sometimes, even which skill or magic to cast to dodge a danger or save the unfortunate person on duty. Last note for the soundtrack which is enriched with a handful of splendid orchestral pieces and perfectly in line with the original soundtrack. As always, the game is dubbed exclusively in English while the texts are in a perfectly translated Italian.", "date": "2015-08-29", "grade": "8.5"}
