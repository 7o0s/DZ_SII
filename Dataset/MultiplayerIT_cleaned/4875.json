It was a non-trivial operation, with the choice to abandon some basic features and try to force the code towards gameplay solutions rather distant from the typical Forza style, also considering the powerful realistic driving model that Horizon carries with it from the Motorsport series. Instead of enriching the miniature Australia of Horizon 3 by adding a new and fascinating environment, perhaps accompanied by some specific driving dynamics, as seen in the excellent Blizzard Mountain, this time the team went to modify the same driving style for offer completely new situations in this Hot Wheels Expansion. It is true that Horizon has always remained decidedly distant from serious realistic driving simulations but the engine in common with Motorsport has always kept it away from even the most extreme digressions of the arcade, however with this new addition the references change and certainties collapse . The absurd Hot Wheels tracks combine the adult driving model of Forza with the imagination of a child who assembles the pieces of a huge circuit, effectively realizing the dream of experiencing car racing directly in first person. In fact, there really isn't much more to be asked of an arcade racing game expansion than putting into practice a paradise of jumps, crashes, loop-the-loops and insane speeds. Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels Expansion lets us experience the thrill of racing inside a car I dream or I am quick While life flows (more or less) normally in the Australian outback, between races and huge engine-based festivals, as soon as you buy the add-on package you notice something different off the beach of the Twelve Apostoles, and the skyline of the newborn archipelago immediately understand that something has definitely changed. The Hot Wheels expansion introduces a series of islets off the coast, joined together by an intricate network of tracks that defy logic and the laws of physics, offering for the first time loops, impossible parabolic curves, half-pipes, instant speed boosts, deadly intersections, and a whole host of outrageous tricks and situations straight from Mattel's construction kits. The impact of this new and colorful plastic world is impressive, precisely because the driving model and physics remain the solid and semi-realistic ones of Forza Horizon 3 but are applied to a situation completely outside of reality. Here the ~poetic license~ is not limited to the possibility of having a custom-built car run around fields and beaches, but puts us behind the wheel at breakneck speed on very smooth plastic tracks that wind between heaven and earth at impossible angles, finding as difficult a splendid balance between the semi-realistic layout of the driving model and the madness of tracks that seem born from the mind of a particularly imaginative child. The map is progressively dotted with countless challenges between performances located in precise points of the complex of roads and more or less classic races, even if their dynamics are strongly transformed by the extreme track design. Various conditions are placed for the completion of the races that allow you to collect variable quantities of medals, the collection of which represents the main progression system in this particular world. There are so many things to do and the map extends over a significant amount of square kilometres, even if the fact of remaining for most of the time confined to tracks with raised edges or suspended in the void greatly limits the typical freedom of movement in the series. Xbox One goals There are 29 achievements in this expansion for a total of 500 points, which adds to the total of the original game and those of Blizzard Mountain. These are distributed equally between the natural progression in the DLC contents and the achievement of certain required performances, but considering the organic nature of the gaming experience it will not be too difficult to devote yourself to the complete collection. A strange world Hot Wheels' attention is entirely placed on the extravagant track design and in this context the surrounding scenario takes a back seat: for this reason the map, despite being extremely large, essentially offers repetitions and fragments of settings taken from the main game, located on islets that serve as supports for the slopes. dOn the other hand, the possibility of leaving the tracks and freely exploring the environment is reduced to a minimum, therefore the scenarios do not need to be developed in a particularly detailed way in favor of the care placed in the design of the tracks. However, there is no shortage of touches in pure Hot Wheels style, such as the presence of huge mechanical dinosaurs, circles of fire and other wonderfully tacky attractions that recall the components of the tracks that can actually be purchased in toy stores. On the other hand, the care with which the ~toy~ details are reproduced is impressive: the surface and color of the tracks are perfect reproductions of the real counterparts, just as some surrounding elements are clearly visible, for example the blue connecting joints which are used to snap track segments together. The package also includes 10 new cars taken from the immense Hot Wheels collection, also suspended between realistic reproduction and childish fantasy and although real car enthusiasts may turn up their noses, for those who know the universe in question the fact of being able to experience toy cars like the Bone Shaker or the historic Twin Mill from the inside is a unique emotion. Indeed, it would be desirable to have the possibility of accessing other Hot Wheels of the more bizarre series, but apparently the developers did not want to go too far on this front. Finally, the ~Blueprint~ system present here allows you to customize the structure of the tracks at the beginning of the various events through a sort of planning, but this only implies the choice of some preset configurations over others, we are therefore far from a real editor is exactly. A shame, considering the potential represented by the modular nature of the tracks, which could have allowed for a more free and creative interaction on the track design.", "date": "2017-05-17", "grade": "9.0"}
