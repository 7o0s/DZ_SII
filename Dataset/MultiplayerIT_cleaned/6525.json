It is a form of interactive storytelling that enriches the reading of a classic comic by including the reader in its very structure as an active element, able to decide the continuation of the story and the method of use. It's not a completely new thing in the current gaming landscape: the Rival Games game is certainly indebted to the Telltale series, with which it shares the setting and mechanics. It's about following the deeds of three different characters in a story of crimes and investigations in a large, rainy and decaying American city, trying to get to the bottom of the cases proposed to the local police. We therefore find ourselves playing a cynical and expert detective, a repentant ex-gangster who has become a collaborator of the police and a novice policeman in cases involving murders, drug trafficking, violence of various types and obviously widespread infiltration and corruption everywhere, in the classic dark atmospheres of police noir where it is difficult to be able to count on a certain distinction between good and evil in the eternal fight against crime. where the dead lie foundations for a continuation of the story, and in this sense the construction of the scenario, with its particular atmospheres, allows promising extensions for the world of The Detail. If trench coats and crimes are your daily bread, The Detail is the game for you It was a dark and stormy night By touching the screen it is possible to move the character within the setting and interact with people and objects, with the different options appearing contextually highlighting the different subjects. There is no real inventory management and therefore the puzzle solving component is entirely missing according to the classic style of adventures, in fact it is a question of observing and conversing with the characters by exhausting all the possibilities offered and, in some cases , make choices that influence (at least partially) the continuation of the investigations and the story. It is clear that such an approach removes the purely playful component to focus entirely on the narration and that is why we speak above all of history and interactive comics to explain this particular type of videogame experience, with the player called to take an active part in the continuation of events. The Detail does an excellent job of involving the user, especially during the more intense sequences such as the opening one, a sort of quick time event with choices and crossroads to which the game resorts in the most decisive and action-packed moments, but there are also some not exactly positive elements to report. To be a product entirely aimed at the story, one cannot fail to notice how the atmosphere plays largely on the clichs of the detective genre and the characters are particularly stereotyped. These elements are so obvious that they take on an almost ritual aspect, and if you take The Detail as a tribute to yellow noir they become almost appreciable. We are quite far from the characterization and rhythm of the best Telltale productions, but if nothing else we are faced with an interesting story, represented with a good graphic style that clearly recalls American comics (from the sequences composed of real dynamic cartoons to the lettering used for the texts) and framed by some happy directorial choices such as the black and white sequences and the general comic cut.", "date": "2015-03-03", "grade": "7.5"}
