And so after a global rethinking of the project that forced the publisher to forcibly put the sequel back under the knife for at least a couple of years, the new Splinter Cell has finally materialized wrapped in a dangerous aura of innovation and full of an expectation that must at all costs satisfy. With these heavy burdens on his shoulders, Conviction, this is the subtitle of the new chapter, can be played in one go on PC and Xbox 360 thanks, among other things, to an exclusive console whose mysterious genesis has yet to be fully understood. bottom. We probably can't speak of a masterpiece, but the ingredients of this rebirth have been mixed in the right quantity and with due attention and the result is undoubtedly fascinating. And now let's find out all these elements in detail. Illegitimate son of Bourn and Bond Splinter Cell: Conviction perfectly follows the narrative line of the series; it's been a handful of years since the events of Double Agent precipitated. Sam Fisher has left Third Echelon and Splinter Cell for good, his daughter Sarah died in an apparently random accident and his best friend, Irving Lambert, was brutally murdered by Fisher himself at the end of Double Agent, as the only culprit of the highest level for a series of leaks and abstruse double agent behavior. Conviction opens by immediately throwing the player into the heart of the action: Sam is hunted by the Third Echelon itself who has decided to give up unilaterally and Grim, the voice that has guided him in every mission for years, has reappeared to help him in a desperate escape through the streets of Valletta in Malta, a level that serves as a tutorial and that immediately stuns us with a handful of twists and cliffhangers. Sarah wasn't involved in a trivial accident, behind there is perhaps even a conspiracy against Fisher or maybe she could even be alive; Grimsdottir swings silently between the various factions in play never making clear his position as a double agent ally; out of nowhere comes a new ally of Sam, Victor Cole, Sam's historical and close friend, known on the field in a terrible mission in Iraq; Third Echelon seems to be corrupt at the top levels and involved in a huge attack that could bring the political leadership of the United States of America to its knees: what if Lambert hadn't been the mole? In short, there is really a lot of irons on the fire and the result is also clear from this extreme synthesis: most of the questions left hanging in the series are adequately taken up, analyzed and in the vast majority resolved. However, don't expect a real epilogue: once you complete Conviction, as per tradition for any self-respecting espionage story, you will understand that there is room for a next chapter in the series. And if on the one hand there is no doubt that this Splinter Cell can be properly appreciated only by those who have played at least Chaos Theory and Double Agent (respectively the fourth and fifth chapter of the series), as there are numerous references to the saga and abundant interconnections between the characters, personal stories and organizations involved, at the same time the narrative style winks at different stylistic choices that we have been accustomed to from the most popular TV series of recent years and this greatly limits the disorientation that anyone who approach Splinter Cell via this Conviction. And then make way for flashforwards and flashbacks that will mix perfectly to keep the player in a state of fascinating mystery and adrenaline-pumping agony who will immediately understand where the story is going, but will struggle until the last minute to understand who is involved , to what extent and above all with what tragic epilogue. Xbox 360 goals Splinter Cell: Conviction has 45 objectives for a total of 1000 points. 18 are secret and completely linked to the single player and cooperative campaigns and will allow you to unlock almost 400 points in total once the story is completed. The rest are linked to the completion of P.E.C. challenges. and the enhancement of all the weapons and gadgets available (about a dozen) and of course the multiplayer that allows you to unlock another dozen objectives, playing in depthto all available modes. Nothing should stop the flow of the action But if we want to find the real news resulting from the four intense years of development in which Ubisoft Montreal was involved, we need to look at the gameplay of Splinter Cell: Conviction. And the innovations immediately catch the eye. First of all, forget strange on-screen indicators or flashing lights: stealth, the true beating soul of the series, is now more than ever inherent in the graphic and artistic style of the game. The alternation of light and shadow, of outdoor scenarios and narrow confined spaces immediately reveals the nature of the sequel which, although enhanced by a much more immediate and frenetic action vein, maintains that typical stealth style narrated by Tom Clancy and perfectly embodied unchanged from the saga. The difference is that this time it will be our sight that will let us know if we are hidden or in the open, changing the color palette of what appears on the screen based on the coverage: when we are in the shadows, the colors disappear to transform the game into an action noir in shades of grey. As soon as our body is illuminated by some light source, Conviction returns to full color. The result is an immediate gameplay where in an instant the player is free to make his decisions by understanding at a glance how real is the risk of being caught in places where he shouldn't be. The artistic choice goes well with the so-called Last Known Position: yet another invention on the screen designed by those of Ubisoft so as not to interrupt the flow of the action. In practice, once we enter the visual cone of an enemy we will have a small handful of seconds (depending on how exposed we are) to return to the darkness or break the line of sight, otherwise the opponent will ~activate~ and be hunted for Sam Fisher. Once caught, if we manage to evade the attention of the guards again, our last known position will be concretely marked on the screen as a sort of transparent silhouette to indicate where the enemy will go to look for the former secret agent. It will be up to the player to take advantage of being discovered and use the enemy's search routines to perhaps knock him out before he goes to call for reinforcements. As if this were not enough, the simplification of the hud and more generally of the acquisition of information by the player also passes through the gimmick of showing the objectives of Sam's actions directly superimposed on the scenario. We will therefore see writing appear on the walls, on the streets, on the furnishings of a room. The player is never left free even for a moment: at all times he knows exactly where he has to go and what to do, without ever being distracted by the action that runs fast and lightning-fast across the screen. But the pinnacle of this restored, overhauled and rethought Splinter Cell is obviously the Brand and Justice. For a long time the protagonist of all the Conviction videos shown since its restyling at E3 in 2009, this particular mechanic probably perfectly represents the point of contact between the intimately stealth nature of Splinter Cell and the pounding action will of Conviction. By concretely killing an enemy with a melee shot, we will activate the possibility of marking a variable number of opponents (usually from 2 to 4 depending on the weapon used and the upgrades applied) and, as soon as we have them all on the screen, by simply pressing a single keystroke, we will initiate a rapid succession of absolutely automatic one shot one kills. Nothing that distorts the gameplay or makes it too easy: often succeeding in a close-quarters attack without getting caught is less simple than one might think and in the vast majority of cases the possible markings are far lower than the number of enemies in sight and the result it is finding yourself with a couple of guards on the ground and at least 5-6 instantly on your trail, recalled by an unsilenced shot or by the sight of a corpse in the middle of the scene. It's all about longevity And since we put the difficulty in the way, let's face it right away, Splinter Cell: Conviction could be finished in just 6 hours if you just play it on Normal difficulty (the middle one among the three available). If, on the other hand, you decide to face it in Realistico (and our dispassionate advice is to do so), you will easily arrive at about ten hours for a total of eleven missions. But the game has a sea of extra modes that offer a high degree of replay value and gameplay depth. First of all there is the multiplayer, all of which can be tackled strictly in cooperatives on Xbox Live or in split screen. A real prologue to the events narrated in the single player campaign where you will find yourselfto wear, together with a friend, the role of an agent of the Third Echelon, Archer and a Russian spy, Ketrel, in the long run towards the discovery of some weapons of devastating power. In the four missions that you will complete in just over 3 hours at the highest level of difficulty, you will be able to appreciate the same mechanics of the single player campaign enriched here with numerous options and probably even greater variety. There will be actions that will necessarily have to be done in two and also the mechanics of make and justice is loaded with the option of shooting crosswise so as to circumvent any dead angles in the view of the two agents. But that's not all because by entering the Special Operations menu (precisely the multiplayer), you will be able to face three further game modes: Hunter where the stealth aspect is fundamental in the behavior of the players, Final Clash, the only real competitive mode where it will be necessary to kill the other player while avoiding the disturbance of the patrols and a classic Last Man where adrenaline is the real protagonist given that the objective will be to defend an electromagnetic pulse warhead from growing waves of enemies. All within 6 maps, 2 unpublished and the rest recycled from the single player campaign. To then stimulate a certain type of collecting and spasmodic research within the game, there are the P.E.C. Challenges. In practice, real objectives that range from killing enemies in the most disparate ways, to the adequate exploitation of stealth to attack opponents and make certain moves. By unlocking these challenges, there are dozens of them available, you earn points that can be spent within the single player and cooperative campaigns to upgrade the many weapons available to Fisher and to buy additional uniforms to use in multiplayer by also upgrading these in second joke. Have we forgotten anything? Well without a shadow of a doubt we can't overlook the flaws that afflict Conviction because otherwise with all this content and a gameplay that runs smoothly like oil, why wouldn't we be faced with a masterpiece? A dull shimmer And instead Splinter Cell: Conviction has several defects. Nothing that irreparably undermines the gameplay, mind you, but what transpires already during the first game session is unequivocal: the 4 years of development and the total restyling made themselves felt and brought a certain sense of incompleteness as a dowry and more generally of lack of cleaning and optimization. Let's start with the minor problems: the interrogations in the first place, certainly interesting and choreographic on paper but absolutely useless in terms of gameplay. Already at the third you will be tired of pressing B near some element of the scenario just to keep the dialogue going; there is no possibility of modifying the responses of the unfortunate victim, the one who has to tell you tells you in any condition. Probably a simple but well-studied in-game cutscene would have been more pleasant to give the same result. And then there are the checkpoints. Always a distinctive element of the whole series, Conviction especially if played in Realistic, will lead you to die on many, too many occasions. And it's not so much the excessive level of difficulty (always approachable and rightly challenging) that makes you turn up your nose but rather Ubisoft Montreal's choice to put the automatic save points at a somewhat excessive distance. Sometimes you will find yourself facing 2, 3 firefights even in different environments, dying suddenly and having to repeat them all again, perhaps even with some absolutely unskipable interlude sequence that you will have to put up with for the second or third time in its entirety. It is undoubtedly a matter of taste, but in the opinion of the writer, today we are no longer so used to repeating the same long series of fights if perhaps we got caught by a camera between one move and another. In fact, there will be a couple of game situations in which being detected will lead to instant ~death~ and everything will amalgamate to create a clear feeling of frustration in the player. But unfortunately it is the artificial intelligence that represents the real Achilles heel of Conviction. Extremely smart, intelligent and realistic in normal gameplay situations or during the active search for Sam Fisher in which we will be able to appreciate encirclement and cover movements, grenade launches and more generally an ability to cooperate to hit our agent, in interactions with the corpses, with the lights off and especially with the last known position, literally seem to go ballistic. It will happen very often to be caught in f", "date": "2010-04-13", "grade": "8.9"}
