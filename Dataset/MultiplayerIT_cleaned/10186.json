It's war: the cause of destruction and unhappiness, always, but for unknown reasons equally tireless inspiration for franchises of various forms of entertainment. Among these, in primis, the recreational district, which can boast an incessant plethora of products dedicated to the most famous war events. One of the most committed software houses on this delicate but inflated front is Activision, which for some years with the Call of Duty brand - and in a constant manner especially with the Modern Warfare catalog - has dominated sales in most of the platforms for which this IP managed to debut. With the strong success of the iPhone/iPod Touch, then, a chapter in the series expressly dedicated to Apple portable devices could not be missing, for which Call of Duty: World at War: Zombies has recently become available. Not the usual fps Despite the homonymy of the name, the setting and the obvious main reference, Activision's latest effort has some peculiarities that deviate from the canonical and tireless concept trademarks of the brand. And not for the aesthetic aspect, as always more than valid when it comes to applications for iPhone/iPod and which also appear well in the presence of the so-called next-generation versions, and not even for the controls, however obviously based on the touch screen, but for the very essence of the gameplay dynamics. The concept behind Call of Duty: World at War: Zombies is in a sense that of any ~horde~ mode. There is therefore no real adventure, but to progress in the single-player it is necessary to overcome waves of enemies through well-defined rooms (practically mini-maps) that are relatively small and with a strictly subjective perspective. Within these maps there are some actions with which it is necessary to juggle and relate, essential in order to stay alive long enough to pass each level and resist all opponents. The main interactions concern the places of entry, usually four or five per room, which can be blocked by means of wooden planks with a simple touch of the screen by remaining near the hole for a few seconds, which act as an impediment to the siege of the assatanati zombies. Then there is the usual ammunition on the wall, for which correct planning is essential, especially at the higher difficulty levels, in order not to leave the flank unexpectedly uncovered. Unfortunately, the graphic sector of Call of Duty: World at War: Zombies does not reach the peaks of the best exponents of the genre who dictate the law on the iPhone and iPod Touch; nevertheless the aesthetic aspect is pleasant and in particular for the animations of the zombies, more than for settings and textures in any case in the standard of Apple devices. The frame rate is unfortunately slightly subdued, a bit of a dancer especially in sudden changes of direction and in moments of great crowding. More than good, however, the touch controls, which are made up of two small virtual levers, positioned to the right and left of the screen and with which the movement and the ~visual~ camera (a sort of virtual double analogue) are controlled, together with to the management of the fire and the fixed viewfinder for which there are two other separate keys. In addition to the single-player adventure, the Activision production seems well managed for at least two other valid reasons: the first, concerning the presence of a well-designed cooperative online multiplayer mode, equipped with support for up to four players via Wifi (local/online 4) or bluetooth (2), while the second thanks to the updates made by the software house through DLC - for a fee - which can also be purchased directly from the main menu. To date, only the expansion called Verrckt has been released, very similar to the original that appeared on consoles and PC, which adds a new scenario, unpublished weapons and other systems useful for attack and defense. Call of Duty: World at War: Zombies can be purchased on the App Store at the price of 7.99 euros; the Verrckt update, therefore the only one available, is instead offered at 3.99 euros.
