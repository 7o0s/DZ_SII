Since 2009 the title has touched practically every existing playful operating system, always managing to gain public and critical acclaim. We liked it a lot at the time: a singular approach to the real-time strategy genre, mixed with a comic storyline that doesn't take itself seriously and carries you through the countryside, with an enviable pace, mission after mission. After the Nintendo 3DS version, the eShop welcomes Swords & Soldiers for the second time, in an exciting high definition that for the first time on a Nintendo machine highlights all the excellent 2D sprites offered. Calculating the very recent Los Angeles announcement of the exclusivity of the sequel Swords & Soldiers II right on Wii U, this port had to demonstrate that it had all the cards on the table to easily pair with the Gamepad. Not a difficult target given its nature, but applause to the team for not taking the challenge lightly. Correct use of the Gamepad makes Swords & Soldiers on Wii U a satisfying but incomplete port Command touch Ronimo Games has opted for an intelligent choice: given the backwards compatibility in terms of Wii U accessories, the Dutch team has well thought of borrowing the point and click heritage of the Wiimote, used at the time on WiiWare, integrating it with the mentality Gamepad touch screen. Not only does this provide a wider spectrum of optimized control methods, but multiplayer - only offline, sadly - benefits enormously from it. The team's choice to exclude Wii U from any online gaming network weighs heavily, relegating the company fun to the mere possibility of clash with a large screen view managed by the Wiimote on one side and the Gamepad's LCD on the other. If you like the touch-screen, the direction of Swords & Soldiers is focused almost completely on the second panel of Wii U: Ronimo Games chooses to move the input structure en masse right on the resistive, thus guaranteeing precision, immediacy of action and fidelity , but making your beautiful television in the living room practically useless. Game action, gameplay flow, interlude scenes: everything is specular, with the fundamental feature that the controls, the real input fulcrum, are also included on the Gamepad. The typical session of Swords & Soldiers is therefore strongly oriented to take place with the gaze fixed on the pad, which is not problematic but simple as an obvious consequence of the features implemented. Similar but already widely analyzed speech concerns the gameplay via Wiimote: the changes from the 2009 version are imperceptible, a sign that Ronimo Games has not yet found any weaknesses in the now dated proposal on WiiWare. Legendary banquets The plot of Swords & Soldiers is nothing more than a simple thread to advance between the missions: thanks to a light but very pleasant style and an underlying goliardic spirit strongly based on self-irony, the game provides three campaigns, one for each people - Vikings, Aztecs and Chinese - each consisting of ten stages of increasing difficulty. The on-screen controls of the Gamepad help a lot in strategic management, allowing - also thanks to the camera entrusted to the backbones - an ideal control of the action providing precision and reliability, especially in complex situations. Given the frenzy of the final missions of each campaign, the Wii U touch-screen proves to be the ideal control system. Obviously there is no shortage of end-game material, with challenges that will greatly lengthen the completion times. Sore point instead on the DLC front: the publisher Two Tribes has excluded this Wii U version from the additional content previously released and capable of adding an entire new campaign. According to official statements, the choice of whether or not to release this addition will depend on sales: an at least curious idea, given the extremely low list price on which we doubt the addition of an now old DLC would have had much impact, with the the only risk that would have increased its value instead of tainting it with an incomplete package. Questionable business choices.", "date": "2014-07-07", "grade": "8.0"}
