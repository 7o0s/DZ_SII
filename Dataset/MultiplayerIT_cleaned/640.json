{"name": "Dead or Alive 4 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-or-alive-4-recensione.html", "text": "The news comes right from the choice of wrestlers, with the classic new entries, Kokoro and Lisa from the female side and Eliot for the boys. Among the new arrivals Lisa stands out, which when used by an expert player turns out to be one of the deadliest characters in hand-to-hand combat. One of the weaknesses of the previous DoAs was the low difficulty of the Story Mode. In DoA4 this defect has been largely curbed, thanks to a new implementation of the AI in the wrestlers controlled by the cpu, who become more reactive and aggressive than usual. During the last two battles, the new AI will make itself felt, especially when we meet Alpha 152, one of the bosses at the end of the tournament. With regard to this aspect, let's immediately say that different cameras have finally been abandoned, or the use of particular visual effects that put the player in difficulty perhaps more than the Boss himself. In DoA4 the final battle will take place under the same game conditions as in all the other rounds, and among other things, the boss itself will vary according to the choice of our character and his background. Although DoA is a classic fighting game, whose plot could easily be absent, Team Ninja wanted to develop a sort of background for each character, which will inevitably intertwine that of other fighters: until we finish the game with all the characters available, it will not be possible to fully appreciate the history of DoA4. Side note still dedicated to Alpha 152, unfortunately this character cannot be unlocked, together with the other hidden characters. The reason is probably related to his special abilities, which the CPU will show off from time to time during matches. For example, a sort of homicidal fury that occasionally hits Alpha 152, and that in less than 5 seconds with a series of two very complex combos, can put an end to the fight without the possibility of an answer. All for the series ~when girls get angry ...~ When Bungie and Tecmo meet A special mention goes exclusively to the agreement between Bungie and Team Ninja, which leads to the inclusion of a very particular girl among the ranks of DoA characters. Unlocking and using ~Spartan-458~ becomes a priority for everyone, and the result rewards the efforts, offering a small glimpse of how interesting it could be to see our Master Chief, fight hand-to-hand against the various Covenants, if in Halo they were DoA4 combat techniques have been implemented. The progress in game mechanics can also be seen thanks to other changes, which taken individually may seem like small things, but put together instead, significantly change the gameplay in DoA. First of all a further increased game speed, which does justice to the frenetic pace of this fighting game. Changes also for the counter-move system, which has now been made more difficult to carry out, and also more lethal if carried out in certain situations. In DoA4 the system of attacks in flight has also been improved, with related acrobatic moves and countermoves, and the blows aimed at a downed opponent have been enhanced. Fans of the series, after a few training sessions to fully master the updated move sets, will be able to truly dominate the less experienced, reminding them that in DoA4, even with energy at a minimum, a match can be totally turned upside down in a few moments. Updates also for the stages available, which not only present elements of passive offense, such as height differences from which to throw the opponent, walls or objects against which to throw him or surfaces on which to jump and lean to perform new combos, but also situations of active danger , like the car traffic in Las Vegas, or the animals in the African area and in the private garden of DoaTech. Among the latest notes is the introduction of an advanced mode for saving and viewing replays, with its photo mode available. Between polygons and textures The graphic aspect, especially using the game in high resolution, does not disappoint. While not representing a real generational leap, and without exploiting the potential of the new Microsoft console, DoA4 offers a real feast for the eyes. The only flaw of which is found in the frequent interpenetration of polygons, which are most noticeable thanks to the extreme cleanliness on the screen. The details to be appreciated vary from the creation of textures, to the new management of reflections on water and similar surfaces, to the reproduction of some animations that are anything but woody, up to the details implemented in the models. Among the new graphic effects we also find the use of motion blur, applied to the character when efmakes particularly fast moves or movements, a bit like the one seen in Project Gotham Racing 3. A good antialiasing and 60 frames per second are mandatory for Team Ninja in this new generation of consoles and are no exception in this chapter of DoA. Finally, praise is wasted on the development team for the creation of the arenas, which continue to amaze in every edition of Dead Or Alive. Obviously our Spartan will have the opportunity to fight in a level taken from the world of Halo, and without too much difficulty playing that area far surpasses the original seen in the Bungie title on Xbox. Another merit of the technical engine belongs to the very short loading times, in particular if the game is played on a console with Hard Disk, a device that Team Ninja has exploited well. Last note for users who own an older TV, the game is developed expressly for TVs with 60Hz support, and obviously for HDTV devices: those who own devices still linked to 50Hz may have problems using the game. Online Speaking of online DoA4 picks up where DoA Ultimate left off. Starting from a more optimized net-code which, however, still suffers from some small problems in overseas connections. During the game tests, carried out from a fastweb network connection, we did not notice any problems in the matches against Italians, or more generally in all the lobbies marked by an almost excellent (three yellow notches) or excellent signal. However, we recommend avoiding the lobbies marked in red, which do not allow you to better manage the rhythm of a fighting game like DoA. The lobbies that can accommodate up to 16 players have also been redesigned, and after a small period in which you find yourself disoriented, it is possible to appreciate the creativity of Team Ninja even in small things, such as customizing your three-dimensional avatar that will move inside the lobby. The available modes are the classic Quick, Custom and Optimatch, as well as the team battle variants, the winner or loser remains in the ring, the survival mode, and from this point on it is possible to select the game rules, and access to the various options to customize your profile or observe the numerous statistics of the world rankings. It goes without saying for those interested in Tag Team challenges that the choice of characters can be decisive, given that some couples integrate better in combined grips than others. Goals The objectives of the game are 45 and range from unlocking the various characters and costumes, up to the performances in the fights. The objectives are also well differentiated for all the game modes available, to finish the game 100% it will take several hours and a lot of skill. What can we say about this Dead Or Alive, and the work of Team Ninja which once again celebrates the debut of Microsoft consoles? Without a doubt it is the best DoA ever, with many of its weak points eliminated, and a revised game mechanic that rewards the expert player a lot over those who press the keys quickly and randomly, without any logic behind it. All with the addition of a very solid multiplayer and online support. However, given the potential of Team Ninja (Ninja Gaiden immediately catches the eye as an example), we could have expected something more not so much from a technical point of view, it is not easy for anyone to work to exploit new hardware immediately, but rather from the desire to find meaningful innovations within the game. Dead Or Alive 4 to the less attentive may seem like a ~more of the same~ but for those who want an immediate and adrenaline-pumping fighting game, the Tecmo title is confirmed as a point of reference in its category. Pros Faster and more frantic than ever High-level graphics Enhanced gameplay in all areas Cons Obvious polygon penetrations On standard TV it does not show a real generational leap It does not offer a real ~revolution~ of the genre Here we are in the fourth chapter of the made in Tecmo fighting game and in this round the watchword is evolution. In fact, Dead or Alive 4 does not present significant upheavals or changes of course compared to the past, rather a substantial series of optimizations and changes both to the graphics engine and to the structure of the game. The game menu presents the classic options already seen in the previous DoA, which include among others the Time Attack, the Survival which is confirmed as one of the most exciting challenges in DoA, the Training sections, Tag Battle, the Versus Mode, but especially the Online mode and the new Story Mode, which we will immediately analyze.", "date": "2006-01-23", "grade": null}
