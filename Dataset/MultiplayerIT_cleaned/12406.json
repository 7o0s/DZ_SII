{"name": "Fight Night Round 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fight-night-round-3-recensione_a.html", "text": "Initial loss of controls is quickly averted with a comprehensive tutorial, featuring training sections with a sparring partner. The control system adapts perfectly to the PS3 pad, with the two left and right analogs assigned respectively to the movement of the boxer and to the use of the basic blows, on the upper and lower part (together with pressing the L2 key) of the body. With the L1 and R1 keys it is instead possible to use combinations to avoid or parry the opponent's blows, according to a vast range of alternatives that makes the assimilation of the game system slightly complex but certainly satisfying and extremely realistic. The atmosphere you breathe while spending hours with the latest EA Sports creation is one of great occasions, moments of artistic inspiration, technical avant-garde and fun. Although the discipline examined is not the most popular, the production exudes obsessive aesthetic care. Dirty and deliberately retro menus, like a filthy and discolored poster of clandestine meetings, exhibit shaky and squared fonts, grooves of an old film that no one has ever shot, and are coupled with a rough, essential hip hop soundtrack. Sadly epic. Only a few notes are missing from Bill Conti, a Sylvester Stallone struggling on that famous staircase, and the name Adriana immediately stands out among the player's thoughts. FNR3 makes this filmic epic, of the American selfmade man, one of its sharpest weapons. But above all there is no doubt the will to glorify the genre, presenting an extremely rich sample of athletes, an editor for their own of commendable depth, the inevitable career mode, and the final, essential touch, the massive online support. It looks like a formula of divine perfection, it's not like that on balance, but the developers have come damn close... In terms of gameplay, FNR3 inherits the heritage of its predecessors without major changes, but adds some moves that veterans will appreciate, such as impact punches, special shots capable of turning the tide of the match, and greater general balance. The aforementioned editor not only offers the means for creating the perfect virtual alter ego, but also allows the customization of class and controls, offering a fighting style based on speed or power. The ESPN classic mode is also excellent, which allows you to try your hand at historical clashes in the role of the legendary Cassius Clay, Evander Holyfield, Oscar De La Hoya, Jake Lamotta and many others. The faces deform under the weight of the gloves... To get to the scenographic climax, the decisive blow that knocks the opponent down, seasoned with a slow motion animation that is difficult to describe. Simply, it must be seen with your own eyes The excellent impressions gained while browsing the menus are not sufficient to cushion the impact with the actual game engine. Gigantic athletes made up of a large number of polygons, but above all defined textures and a photorealistic lighting system to say the least, give the game an excellent technical impact even a year later. The scenarios are equally well done, which include gyms, warehouses, famous arenas such as Madison Square Garden, all enriched with an entirely polygonal audience. The neophyte's most natural reaction will be to admire the display with a dazed look, hesitantly take the pad and hint at a few hooks. With a consequent discharge of punches kindly bestowed by the CPU on duty, to realize that the best is yet to come. The faces deform under the weight of the gloves, presenting swellings, cuts and streams of blood, all with an unprecedented wealth of detail. To get to the scenographic peak, the decisive blow that knocks the opponent down, seasoned with a slow motion animation that is difficult to describe. Simply, it must be seen with your own eyes. Furthermore, in the passage on the Sony console, also thanks to the additional development time, the title has gained some light effects, more defined textures, and a slightly higher polygonal detail of the characters. The referee begins the agonizing countdown that separates from the KO, with difficulty we manage to get up, just in time for the bell to ring, it's over for now. Reclining on smelly armchairs, we can admire a further touch of class of the saga, the possibility of healing the wounds on the athlete's face. A real minigame that further shows the care put into making faces, simply impressive. The second round begins, and things start to look better. After the graphics hangover, you begin to enter the game to assimilate the commandsof, to understand that it is all very intuitive. And instinct soon gives way to targeted, strategic combat. Just enough to turn the tide in our favor, and after a series of effective uppercuts the computer is knocked down. But this is only the beginning, the career mode is long and provides for the complete climb of our fighter, from the lowest ranks, the amateur matches played in the gyms, until our popularity will be high enough to aspire to matches with the champions of the upper classes. The game includes a strategic section that precedes the actual battle, first of all it will be necessary to sign the contracts of the various available matches, evaluating the capabilities of the opponent on duty. The next operation will consist in trying some training mini-games, designed to improve the skills of our boxer, and will have to be performed according to the opponent's parameters. And before stepping into the ring, it's a good idea to buy a better pair of gloves at the glove shop. Indeed, the system is more invasive than complementary, as demonstrated by the possibility of skipping mini-games and instantly gaining improvements in physical values, but it is an appreciable diversion between the various clashes. The career mode is fun, but it doesn't best represent the spirit of the game, thanks to the low difficulty opposed by the cpu, more inclined to contain the player's attacks, making some matches rather tedious. On the other hand, a new mode for this version of the game is the one called ~Get on the Ring~, which allows you to face the encounters in first person and which turns out to be fun to face, with the possibility of deactivating the information on the screen and noticing the status of your player's health through the amount of blur and other graphical effects (such as blood) on screen. The partial incompleteness and tediousness of the career mode is filled by the online mode, characterized by a highly competitive ranking system. Once you step into the internet ring, things change radically. It's easy to come across remarkably difficult human opponents, so much so that the offline challenge is made a Sunday walk. Before jumping into the fray, it is therefore advisable to try your hand at friends or look for a challenge suited to your skills. The modality also foresees being able to use an athlete created in the appropriate editor, but the absence of limitations in the physical parameters (present instead in the career mode) consistently false an attractive opportunity. Despite everything, what interests us is the online functionality, and the work done is certainly appreciable. In fact, it is possible to participate in both ranking and non-ranking meetings, during our matches we also encountered very rare lag problems, a positive feature that contributes to making the online component a factor that significantly lengthens the longevity of the title. The latest incarnation of the boxing franchise from EA Sports leaves satisfied even after a year and on PS3. The playful foundations are based on the solid foundations of its predecessors, offering a model that balances the need for simulation and arcade immediacy. The control system is simple but not without depth, avoiding random tinkering and offering the player an interesting level of customization. The online mode is the proverbial icing on the cake, which completes a product strongly recommended to enthusiasts, but also to those who are interested in the noble art for the first time. There is no lack of room for improvement, especially for an offline mode that is not very diversified and excessively affordable. This does not mean that the EA Sports production still maintains the scepter of the best simulation of the genre and an unmissable opportunity to amaze your friends, obviously provided you do not already own the 360 version, identical in almost all aspects. Pros High-impact graphics Intuitive and customizable control system Full online support Cons Career mode can be improved A little too easy offline If you really hate boxing... EA Sports has already demonstrated on several occasions the effectiveness of its new generation graphics engines, starting with its sports titles on Xbox 360. But the commendable technical development has not helped the gaming sector, firmly anchored to the old canons, if not regressed. Fight Night is a very different case though. The previous versions have shown a constant improvement in terms of gameplay and aesthetic appeal, and the game, released almost a year ago on the Microsoft console, has received a lot of acclaim, both from a graphic and purely gaming point of view.dare. The third chapter of this successful series therefore also arrives on PlayStation 3, leaving all its qualities intact and introducing a couple of new options", "date": "2007-03-27", "grade": null}
