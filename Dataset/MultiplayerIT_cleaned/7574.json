Either they love each other, or they hate each other. Inevitable we would say, as this type of video game is characterized by engaging stories, but often with a slow pace as well as mechanics that present an almost total absence of gameplay, thus leaving very little room for interaction by what is can define a player-spectator. Although there are titles that have tried to merge the purely narrative elements of visual novels with those of other videogame genres, such as RPG and adventure, in games that fall within the purest meaning of this genre, we find ourselves interacting only to make advance dialogues and animations, being able to note as the only element left to the player's will a few well-targeted choices, through which to influence events. After having collected a respectable curriculum in this area with their past efforts, the Dischan Media team scattered around the world has created the first episode of Dysfunctional Systems, with which they now hope to definitively repeat the success of Juniper's Knot. In defiance of those who believe that visual novels are not suitable for the general public. Witness the arrival on Steam via Greenlight, which took place at the end of September, thanks to which this game has obtained renewed visibility within the videogame scene. Long live the visual novels, long live Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos! It's a dirty job, but someone has to do it In the first episode of Dysfunctional Systems, entitled Learning to Manage Chaos, we get to know the protagonist Winter Harrison. It is a young student from a utopian version of planet Earth, committed to learning a very special trade, that of the mediator. Thanks to the good fortune of living in an almost perfect world, the population of this world has in fact developed a system that allows some people to teleport to other less fortunate celestial bodies, afflicted by various types of problems that endanger their very survival. The subjects sent on a mission, called precisely mediators, try to put into practice the knowledge acquired through their studies and their persuasive ability, to put things back on the right track, thus restoring balance on the planet visited. After a first learning assignment, prior to the facts narrated in Dysfunctional Systems, Winter is sent on a mission to support her mentor, Cyrus Addington; their destination will be the planet Sule, where Winter will have to learn his future trade by visiting the nation of Brighton, subjected for decades to nearby Gabrea. Not even the time to get there and ask a few questions to figure out what's going on that things will start to fall apart, thus forcing Winter and Cyrus to make unthinkable decisions, in order to avert the worst. The good news Far be it from us to reveal anything else about the plot, which naturally constitutes the strength of Dysfunctional Systems. While offering the player relatively little time to spend with its two protagonists, the game is able to develop the contrasted relationship that exists between them, seen from the eyes and mind of the reflective Winter, whose only flaw is perhaps that she sometimes gets lost a little too much in small talk to himself. The result is a story that can be drunk in one gulp even in a single game session, thanks to the not excessive duration of about 4 hours, which can be retraced if you wish to see the second ending studied by the developers. The achievement of one or the other epilogue depends on the choice made at a precise moment in the story by the player, who therefore has the possibility to have his say on the unfolding of events, even if only after having accumulated a fair amount of playing time in the adventure switched to being a spectator. In this regard, Dischan Media has already announced that the subsequent episodes will remember our previous choices, thus creating a series of chain situations to be relived even after completing all the chapters of Dysfunctional Systems. From a technical point of view, the style retains that seen in Juniper's Knot, recalling the world of manga very closely with its drawings. Given the high quality of the drawings for settings and characters, the design will also be appreciated by those who do not eat bread and Japanese comics. The dubbing is completely absent, thus making it necessary to read the long dialogues, to appreciate which it is probably better to have a slightly above average knowledge of English. The audio sector offers some environmental effects, but above all a cosoundtrack of considerable thickness, created especially for the occasion and which will not struggle to enter the player's head thanks to its main theme.", "date": "2013-10-08", "grade": "7.5"}
