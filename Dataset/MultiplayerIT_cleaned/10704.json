Swords & Soldiers stands out against this panorama like a real boon. Ronimo's game represents what one hopes for from the WiiWare service: developed in an original way, starting from the concept up to the technical realization, this particular RTS does not appeal to the low cost to propose a second-rate pastime, but offers an experience game that is easily the envy of many games from the largest production, sold at a much higher price. It would not seem from the images, but Swords & Soldiers falls rather precisely into the category of real-time strategy: by pruning all the more ancillary and complex elements, in this game we grasp the core of the typical gameplay of the genre. Taking something from the ~tower defenses~ that are so successful in this period, the structure has been simplified to the maximum, inserting all possible commands into an interface that can be used only with the Wii Remote and squashing the game map into a two-dimensional representation , with side scrolling. Disguised under this unusual perspective we find an RTS that refers to the typical mantra of this genre: fundraising, building units and achieving an objective within various maps, facing three different campaigns corresponding to the three warring factions. Each campaign is made up of about ten missions (plus unlockable ~extra challenges~) and can be completed in a couple of hours, for a total of about 6 hours of gameplay, thus making (and together with the absence of an online multiplayer mode) longevity is the biggest weakness of Swords & Soldiers. The original choice of graphic representation is supported by a cartoonish and colorful 2D, decidedly far from what we usually see in similar products, with plot, dialogues and fragments of speech tending towards demented humor which confirm the parodic essence of this strange game of strategy, together with an epic and orchestral soundtrack that instead takes up much more classic atmospheres, creating an interesting mix of atmospheres. Remote control an army Although the levels offer different variations on the main theme (defense of the base, destroy particular objects, resist attacks for a given period of time), the basic scheme is always the same: we are at the far left of the two-dimensional map, with the enemies who attack us exclusively from the right. This simplification, amplified by the fully automatic movement of the units (not only of the resource collectors, also the fighters move autonomously towards the right of the screen, attacking as soon as the enemy comes within range) actually hides a frenetic game structure, which requires focus and speed from the player. Through a tree diagram it is possible to activate the various units and special powers with which to command the army, which will then be positioned - after a ~loading~ period - on the upper part of the screen, ready for use, all through a simple pointer interface, usable with the Wii Remote. The creation of each element requires a certain amount of gold, while the activation of spells consumes mana, which generally recharges itself, making the economy of these two elements a basic factor for victory. Although they differ in particular facets, each of the three armies is equivalent in terms of powers and units: there are short and long range fighters, warriors with magical powers, armored units of various kinds and fortifications to be built in certain points of the map. The spells can be used directly by the player by precisely selecting the attack zone through the pointer, and it is precisely in these special powers that the greatest differences between the three factions available probably reside. The automatic movement of the fighters leaves no room for prudent planning and procrastination, just as on the other hand the incessant pursuit of enemies at the edge of the screen pushes you to act quickly, so as not to give precious centimeters to the opposing army. The unique character of Swords & Soldiers lies precisely in the speed and frenzy of the action: not focusing on a vast amount of possible actions and tactics, it requires the player to have perfect timing and very fast army management. Along with the creationion of units and the development of the various powers, a continuous support of the troops engaged in the battle through the use of magic is necessary (and here it must be said that the two-dimensional representation sometimes does not help, in the case of particularly large armies, understand exactly what is happening in battle) without ever being able to let your guard down, characterizing the action with an almost action game rhythm.", "date": "2009-06-11", "grade": "8.8"}
