In the role of Ametto Rosso , a curious mix between Little Red Riding Hood and a warrior who fights wielding a sword and a fishing rod, we will be able to explore a rather large and interconnected world, accessing a large number of missions. Taking advantage of rapid movement systems, we will also be able to return from time to time to the base camp and there to use the money and materials collected in order to create new weapons and armor, as well as reload any ~ammunition~ of our equipment. After completing the sequence introduction that illustrates the narrative background of the game and a brief tutorial, we will be able to immediately jump into the fray, choosing between a fairly precise and responsive set of touch controls, characterized by a good layout of the buttons, and the possibility of using a Bluetooth controller, perfectly supported . Needless to say which is the best option, especially in the most chaotic and agitated phases. Gameplay Legend of the Skyfish 2 starts from the formula of the first episode, reiterating it during the initial stages of the campaign and then also introducing some interesting innovations. What we are offered is therefore a solid and refined gameplay, especially as regards the fights, equipped with a good yield of the impacts and fairly multifaceted mechanics. In fact, the protagonist can hit enemies with her sword, but also use her fishing rod as a grappling hook to attract her opponents or reach them in a few moments, in the case of bosses and mini-bosses. Exploration also benefits from these solutions, in particular the possibility of casting the hook towards certain holds to switch from one platform to another. More and more complex puzzles are built around this mechanic, which revolve around the identification and activation of switches that can allow us to continue in the mission on duty, often leading us into dark and dangerous caves inhabited by numerous hostile creatures. Also in this juncture the authors have tried to mix the cards in favor of variety, for example by inserting special enemies which, once eliminated, lead to the opening of magical gates. There are situations that are a bit tangled and potentially frustrating, especially when move among the traps, between turrets and spears protruding from the ground, but other than that the experience proceeds quite quickly, without ever raising the level of the challenge too much, even and especially during the boss fights. Clearly a lot depends on the progression, which in this sequel is conditioned by the loot and the money we can use to purchase new equipment. Technical realization On the technical front, the guys from Crescent Moon Games have seen fit to start from the comic style of the original The Legend of Skyfish and to improve it clearly, without distancing themselves from those solutions and therefore working on effects more than on animations for give the sensation of greater fluidity and brilliance both for the characters and for the scenarios. A goal that has certainly been achieved, while the soundtrack seemed to us a bit too taken up by the comparison with the aforementioned Zelda, therefore unable to put on table a precise personality.", "date": "2020-04-16", "grade": "8.0"}
