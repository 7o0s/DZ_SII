{"name": "Real War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/real-war.html", "text": "The troops in the field But let's talk about the protagonists of the ~contention~: on the one hand we have the ultra-modern and powerful US army on the other a not better defined Independent Army for Freedom (now if these are independent, who would they like to free themselves from?). It is possible to choose between 12 linear campaigns and the ~skirmish~ mode. The campaign mode tends to have very specific objectives to accomplish while the skirmish is won by the last opponent to arrive ~alive~ at the end. At the beginning of each mission we have only one headquarters available, it is necessary to build the commands of the air, land and sea forces to obtain the basic units. Each building can be upgraded, so more advanced units can be obtained. The energy needed to operate the various buildings is supplied by the energy generators, while the resources necessary for the construction of the structures and units are supplied by the depots. The most advanced units (the latest obtainable) consist of nuclear, biological and ~psychological~ weapons. Characteristics There are a couple of interesting twists that Real War draws from traditional strategy games. There is a limit to the number of structures and units that can be built, this limits the range of the army and forces the player to use a combined arms approach against the enemy, so it is not possible to focus your attention on just one unit type. A positive note is constituted by the supply system, in fact it is not necessary to waste precious time in the search for materials useful for the maintenance of the troops and for the construction of the buildings, given that once the depots have been built, these will automatically be supplied by transport helicopters which will periodically stop at the base to unload their cargo. In theory it would be necessary to protect these transport helicopters, but it is sufficient to build the depots inside the perimeter of the base to make them invulnerable. Basically this automatic refueling system allows you to focus your attention exclusively on the management of military units. Characteristics And it is really necessary to pay close attention to our units, as the Real War interface, the graphics, and the AI of our militias make this task a real nightmare. There is no speed control, and the game moves so fast that you often lose control of units. The basic idea regarding the controls and the interface would be admirable, in fact in the lower part of the screen there are buttons that allow the management of each single military unit and building, so as to avoid the stress of continuously scrolling the map search for the vehicle you want to control. But these buttons are very small, about 25 pixels, and the graphics are so approximate that the player cannot distinguish the control button, for example, of a truck, from that of any building. Units and means Many of the units in this game are impossible to distinguish on the battlefield, especially when they are selected, in fact the health bar and experience icon almost completely obscure them. Even at maximum zoom, the infantry ~men~ appear tiny and the various naval units are practically identical to each other. As far as the air units are concerned, however, the matter is different, these reach a good level of realism even in the movements. The graphics engine is strictly 2D, but the animation allows the units to move on the map as if they were polygonal: they are not fixed to pre-established movements and it is easy to see them capsize or take ~hazardous~ trajectories when they explode. But when they're in motion it almost looks like they're skating on ice, it's strange to see an aircraft moving sideways, but that's what happens in Real War when it tries to follow another unit's slipstream. However the vehicles often move in a disorderly manner, colliding with each other and causing chaotic traffic jams, there are formations with which to make them move, but they have no significant effect and most of the time they are not respected. Real War would potentially be a good game: naval units can have very effective weapons, as well as aircraft and land units, it is possible to place satellitesites to keep the enemy under constant control, in short, the bases to make this strategic game captivating would all be there, but it seems that the developers didn't try too much and everything got lost behind a bad gameplay and artwork to say the least. Comments and conclusions Unfortunately Real War is not only a bad game, it's also an example of bad timing: the game was released in the US just two weeks after 9/11, and if you choose to play the campaigns in the ranks of terrorists, it is easy to hear in the background voices calling for attacks on the civilian population and propaganda against America. It's not to accuse the game of lack of tact, but if Westwood was quick to change the artwork of Red Alert 2, it can not be said that Simon & Shuster have proved equally sensitive. On the box of the game appears this inscription ~Based On The Official Joint Chiefs Of Staff Training Game Developed For The U.S. Military~, in fact the developer (Rival Interactive), created this game as a commercial version of a multimedia CD-Rom that they had tried to sell to the US Army. Sincerely the claim of realism in this game is absurd, this ~peculiar~ feature is missing both in the graphics and in the execution. Trucks that move on the map as if they were driven by drunk drivers, soldiers who instead of moving are blissfully waiting to be crushed by some vehicle (and it cannot be excluded that it could be an allied vehicle), intelligent missiles that detonate the objective and everything that surrounds it, helicopters and planes that do not move in formation and perform UFO maneuvers. By claiming to have included real military units and realistic war tactics in the game, Simon & Shuster not only insults the users of the game, but also and above all its dominant subject. Do you remember the ~infamous~ sergeant from Full Metal Jacket? Just him R. ~The Drill~ Lee Ermey, has agreed to lend his voice for the intro of the various campaigns, certainly his voice is full of strength and charisma, but when loading each mission he bellows embarrassing slogans like ~Always fi, do or die, gung ho, gung ho, gung ho!~did he fall so low? Finally when you decide to quit the game our sergeant growls ~Oh boy, oh boy, isn't that sweet? You're givin' up!~thank you sergeant for making exiting Real War at least enjoyable. In conclusion, if you are a lover of well-made strategic games, you will survive even without playing Real War. Real War, a real game. Are your troops ready? Are your missiles aimed at the target? No? It's just as well... Real War takes us back to the times when we could ~admire~ the countless real-time strategists who were scrambling to follow in the wake of the success of the Command & Conquer series. Like most of the clones of the successful Westwood saga, we are faced with an example of an amateur game made in the worst possible way, and considering the main theme of the game, America's armed fight against terrorism, it is also an example of a colossal lack of timing (and good taste). In many respects Real War is a conventional strategy that combines the most modern and realistic weaponry with the most fictitious ones in the style of fantasy and sci-fi.", "date": "2002-01-08", "grade": null}
