The introduction of this review should have given you a rough idea of what awaits you during the frenetic games of WarHawk, and as fictional as it is, it's not that far from reality. Let's clarify a concept immediately, before delving into the boring meanders of videogame criticism: WarHawk is pure fun. And it's not a ~war~ game of the tactical kind, full of complex commands to learn in order to win, putting complicated war strategies into practice: WarHawk's main strength is precisely its immediacy, the almost arcade component that distinguishes it and which allows everyone, absolutely everyone, to play and have fun from the very first minutes, without having read a page of the manual. Which then, of course, isn't there in the downloaded version, and the first couple of hours could be a bit chaotic as you learn the function of the weapons and their capabilities, but connecting to the WarHawk servers, joining a game and starting to reap victims is of a disarming simplicity and speed. But let's go in order. WarHawk is available for download via PSN for the modest sum of 29.99: 5 maps and a ton of variety, frenzy and fun are enclosed in just 800 megabytes. War of the Worlds! WarHawk is available for download via PSN for the modest sum of 29.99: 5 maps and a ton of variety, frenzy and fun are contained in just 800 megabytes. The DVD version will soon be available in any store, which for around 60 will include some videos and, above all, a Jabra wireless headset with built-in microphone: one of WarHawk's peculiarities is in fact the ability to communicate verbally with your companions by pressing the L3 button, provided obviously a bluetooth microphone connected to the PS3 is available. From this point of view WarHawk shows an incisive support for the communities that will be created online, thanks also to the options inside the game that allow you to create real clans and customize them at will; not only that, by easily navigating through the simple option menus, it is possible to create and even host matches solely as a server, defining their characteristics from the type of match to more precise elements such as participation or respawn times. If, on the other hand, you just want to participate in a game, you need to call up the list of servers from the appropriate menu, consult it, and choose the match that best suits you among the many available, after naturally checking its characteristics: at this juncture, the only problem consists of the speed with which the situation of the various servers is updated, a sign of the high level of participation on the part of the user, and in fact we often find ourselves selecting a server where there is also room for us to then being sent back to the list with a bleak ~Match Full~. In a few seconds, however, the map is loaded and we find ourselves catapulted into the action: if the server allows it, our performance during the battle will be evaluated and rewarded with points that will allow us to advance in rank and earn medals for our actions, engaging ourselves in increasingly difficult tasks to climb the ranks. These recognitions are not only used to be recognized as the best warmongers of the match or to participate in battles with a rank requirement (commendable idea, which allows on the one hand to give life to spectacular battles between WarHawk aces and on the other not to involve the new players in skirmishes against much better players), are also the fulcrum of the possibilities for customizing our virtual alter-egos: in fact, when we take part in a battle we find ourselves in the role of a Chernovan or Eucadian soldier - the two factions they battle in WarHawk, in short - without distinctive features, which instead will be possible to add via a special menu external to the games, and the available options will increase more and more as you go up in rank, both for human models and for aircraft. And that leads us directly to what WarHawk is like graphically. Warhawk and PlayStation 3 Let it be clear that WarHawk is certainly not a title that squeezes the new Sony console, but in reality, even if WarHawk does not show who knows what graphic effects or exorbitant quantities of painstakingly textured polygons, but for what it moves, and for the way which it does, guarantees a visual spectacle that is nothing short of satisfying. Thanks to the somewhat realistic, somewhat cartoonish and even slightly sci-fi look, WarHawk has style to spare: from the uniforms and armor of the various soldiers (classic for the Eucadians, a little more technological for the Chernovans) to the from land transport, passgoing for the very elegant and sophisticated WarHawk, it is a pleasure to use our human alter-egos, excellently animated in every action, from attacks to the most basic movements, and it is even more satisfying to pilot a jet, make it rotate in the air, dodging torpedoes and shooting volleys of bullets crossing electric discharges, piercing the beautiful volumetric clouds hanging in the sky. Everything travels anchored at 60fps, and you can admire battles between dozens of aircraft from the roofs of the capital, when a game can accommodate up to 32 players with non-existent slowdowns (and practically no lag), between explosions and consequent wreckage (or bodies, even) flying from all sides ... it's really not bad. Jets fly over us casting their shadows on the ground, explosions illuminate the surroundings and vehicle parts bounce off the ground before disappearing in a whisper: the care taken by the Incognito team is commendable. The variety of personalized avatars through the ranking clashes a bit with that offered by the maps: at the moment there are only five areas available in which to battle, and any patches that increase the number have not yet been announced, even if they are quite predictable. The five maps, however, are enormously vast and detailed, so full of possibilities and touches of class that you can't get tired of them so soon: locations such as the aforementioned Capital, with numerous multi-storey buildings and the huge park center, or Eucadia, with its bridges and citadels between the hills and the sea, offer an infinity of different situations, and the presence of hidden paths or hidden areas even allow you to explore them while the battle rages just for the curiosity of discovering their secrets or admire them from a rather panoramic position: even the sky is imposing at first glance, then you realize that it is nothing more than a static texture, damned well done. The level-design is in fact excellent, and the numerical limit of the zones does not ultimately represent a particular defect, unless you know every corner of the game by heart: in that case, you are more delighted to exploit the advantages of one's own experience, rather than getting bored with the usual location. And then, there's the audio sector: the development team's attention was mostly placed on the very high quality sound effects, especially in the case of weapons. In some ways it is even possible to recognize a weapon by the peculiar sound of its reloading, and we are not joking when we say that it was possible to predict the presence of an opponent nearby without looking at the map just for the reloading sound of his bazooka. The explosions, the roar of the engines of the various aircraft, the screech of the crawlers and the eerie hiss of the flamethrower... the realistic sound effects are impressive. And in the background WarHawk offers a soundtrack that can become almost imperceptible during the action, but which proves to be of high quality in proposing musical pieces that not only adapt perfectly to the war context of the game, but which also follow the rhythms and songs of the most famous action films: playing WarHawk many times is like feeling next to John Rambo, and the spectacular nature of the action favors this Hollywood feeling. Enter the Battlefield! After so many words spent talking about how you participate in WarHawk games, how it is sold and how it presents itself audiovisually, it is incredible that fewer lines are spent explaining how the multiplayer effort produced by Sony is actually played. After all, the commands vary depending on what we are doing or, to be precise, on the vehicle we are piloting: in general, at least one key is reserved for primary firearms, another for secondary weapons, and it is possible to change weapons recalling a simple graphic menu with the digital cross. It takes a few hours to learn how to perfectly control our virtual alter-ego in WarHawk, especially if you decide to keep the Sixaxis motion sensor as vehicle control system: given that it extends to driving all vehicles, the response is very fast and precise, and controlling the jets in the air by tilting the joypad is pleasant and fun, and allows greater freedom in using the viewfinder. However, it is not an easy control system to master, and it is practically impossible to train in peace when anyone is willing to kill a dancing jet, and many will therefore find themselves preferring the more immediate, even if limited, control via stick: cleverly the options allow you to customize the control system at will, not only by activating and deactivating the motion sensor, but also by inverting the sticksand motion axes, for example. Once you become familiar with the joypad, WarHawk is a field open to any experimentation, thanks also to the perfect balance of the paraphernalia included in the game: each weapon has its pros and cons, in a system that is very reminiscent of the Chinese morra, and which pushes players to vary their weapons without fossilising on the most powerful which, often, are also the ones that leave the most defenseless perhaps due to the slowness in reloading or in the limited range. For example, the war knife only strikes at close range, but a blow from behind is enough to knock out an opponent, and it makes us invisible to radars: on the other hand, if an enemy notices our presence and starts shooting at us from far, it is practically impossible to reach it and in the open field you risk only defeat. The gun turrets and missile launchers are devastating and provide unrivaled covering fire, but the slowness of their attacks, and their static nature, make them easy prey for jets: the latter are the highlight of battles in WarHawk and facing enemies in the air, hovering, and returning enemy fire, it's extremely fun, but it is also true that to obtain greater and deadly precision in attacks you have to switch from movement mode to suspension mode, making us vulnerable to the aforementioned turrets or armed soldiers of rocket launchers. Pros and cons, it was said, and you never feel disadvantaged when you just need to use your brain to solve the most intricate situations: in fact, WarHawk is a game that definitely rewards the player's skill more than luck. And it is true, by extension, that if you happen to be in battles against organized clans, the possibilities for having fun can quickly fade into frustration, when the respawn points - that is, where you appear after being killed - are manned by groups of enemies they support each other, exterminating newly reappeared players. It's a problem that in this genre of games is more persistent than ever, and every player of World of Warcraft - which ironically belongs to a completely different genre - will understand what we mean when we think of the organized teams that make the Battlegrounds more hell than entertainment : Again, in WarHawk timing and player skill allow you to get out of these situations and sometimes turn the tables, but perhaps it would be better to prevent clans from facing random groups in free games. Certainly, the speed with which it is possible to take part in a match and abandon it for another makes these sporadic cases of abuse of tactics decidedly irrelevant, thanks also to the various game modes: WarHawk in fact offers various types of games such as Death Team Match and Death Match, the classic Capture-Flag, Dogfights in which only aircraft are used, and an unprecedented challenge to those who conquer and keep more territories on a map. The variety of game modes will allow clans to indulge in the development of tactics and cooperative battles, but casual players will never feel out of place in battles: and this is nothing but a plus. What else to say about WarHawk that hasn't already been written? It is certainly one of the funniest titles of the season, enhanced by an obsessively curated online support, very simple to learn and play, within everyone's reach. Its main flaw is undoubtedly the lack of a single player campaign - and the settings and background deserved it, but WarHawk is a title that lives essentially in multiplayer mode and therefore the inclusion of split-screen for play online with the same console; on the other hand, the ranking system and the many objectives make online matches much more than a simple pastime. It's a spectacular, fun, adrenaline-pumping product, it costs only 30 and if you love to play online and you're not already downloading it from the Network then you really deserve a machine gun at point blank range. Pros: Excellent support and online community Fast-paced, immediate and fun Technically sound Cons: A few more maps would have hurt Initially cumbersome control system Its multiplayer-only orientation makes it not for everyone Eucadia, 3.43 pm: the sun is still high, it's hellishly hot and the bombs that explode two meters away from me are not encouraging. I try to distinguish the WarHawks from the Nemesis Gliders in the clouds, I have to aim well or risk shooting down one of my fellow Eucadians: I'm in command of this missile turret and my hands are shaking a bit. Suddenly on the radar I notice that a Glider is dangerously approaching ours", "date": "2007-09-07", "grade": null}
