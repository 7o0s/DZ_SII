It has been a year since Bethesda produced the third installment of its glorious series: The Elder Scrolls for PC and Xbox. It goes without saying that Morrowind was a real pillar for the RPG player community, a game to have, play and appreciate for its multitude of qualities. One of these is its incredible modularity that allows anyone to modify or add anything to the world of Morrowind thanks to the editor included in the game: ~The Elder Scrolls Construction Set~, TES for friends. More or less 6 months ago the first official expansion was released: Tribunal, this was an anomalous expansion since in practice it was nothing more than a gigantic module that was grafted into the world of Morrowind, however making very few changes to the interface and above all to the graphics and sound engine that governed the game. A second anomalous expansion Now, 6 months after Tribunal and one year after Morrowind, Bethesda has decided to offer fans of the original title the second official expansion: ~The Elder Scroll III: Bloodmoon~; technically it's like installing a huge expansion module (*.esm) of about 120Mb. Bloodmoon will also bring the version of the game to 1.5.1629 which includes all the innovations added in Tribunal, which will therefore be present in the game even without the installation of the latter. As we said, initially the system detects Bloodmoon as an expansion module and loads it exactly like any other module. By loading an old save-game, the game will automatically convert the old quests adapting them to the new mega module installed. Unfortunately I noticed some compatibility problems of the old modules used before Bloodmoon, this incompatibility is systemic, so much so that numerous threads appeared in the official Bloodmoon forum asking for a compatibility list between the amateur modules already present and Bloodmoon. A second anomalous expansion To avoid any problems I decided to play Bloodmoon using a smooth configuration: Morrowind, Bloodmoon and of course the inevitable ~Morrowind ITP  Final Version.esp~. With this configuration I had no problems whatsoever, on the contrary, the localization module of the ITP adapted perfectly to the new expansion, presenting translated everything that belongs to Morrowind (interface, descriptions of objects, dialogues, etc.), leaving in English only the dialogues and the names of the objects and places of Bloodmoon, in a synergy that pleasantly surprised me. Alien in a foreign land Bloodmoon luckily doesn't have a way to access the new Machiavellian and abstruse area like Tribunal. The expansion takes place exclusively on a gigantic new island called Solstheim, northwest of the island of Morrowind, easily accessible at any time from the port of a popular coastal town of Morrowind. Obviously, being designed as an expansion for players of a certain level, I strongly advise you to access it only with an already strong character, with a lot of energy points and able to hit very hard. Arriving in Solstheim, the first sign of civilization will be Fort Frostmoth, an outpost of the Imperial legion in the frozen and inhospitable land of Solstheim. From here your new adventures will start in three different narrative strands, not to mention the dozens of occasional quests that will come your way. The main quest (main quest) will wind along all the places of Solstheim, taking you along an exciting narrative path to learn about the religion, customs and traditions of the people of the north, as well as meeting your destiny narrated in an ancient prophecy of the moon red. The cultural state of the peoples of the north draws heavily on classical Nordic mythology, proposing concepts already known in a new key by reading mythology books or simply reading or renting the ~13th warrior~. Sometimes you will feel just like the character in that novel/film, an alien in an alien land of overwhelming beauty, but deadly danger. Alien in a foreign land The quests are very well structured, starting in a fairly classic way they will surprise you with twists and continuous reversals in situations. Some quests reminded me a lot of Ultima IX, while others seem to take their cue from Rowling's novels and especially from the latest ~Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire~. The quests will lead you to have your own home or to conduct your own business, but I won't tell you more so as not to spoil the surprise. One of the most recurring narrative strands in Bloodmoon is that of werewolves(werevolves), true leitmotif of the expansion to which we owe the title and the wonderful red moon that will stand out in the clear nights above you. Bethesda is giving you the ability to become a werewolf yourself, with all that that will mean for you. Becoming a werewolf in fact depends on the infection of a virus which, caught during the fight with a werewolf, involves the gradual but inexorable transformation into a beast. I will not tell you if there is a remedy for the infection, it will be up to you to decide in one of the most painful and meditated choices of the entire Morrowind saga. A new land full of opportunities Speaking of setting, you may like it or not, personally I love Nordic settings like Icewind Dale and I found Bloodmoon amazing for how the island of Solstheim was designed. You go seamlessly from frozen wastelands to deep snowy forests, from inaccessible white and dangerous peaks to banks of pure ice. Walking on a frozen lake you can hear the thin layer of ice beneath you crunch ominously, you will slip if you climb an iceberg, you will be absolutely blinded by the blizzards that will rage around you. The fauna will be decidedly numerous and vicious. It will seem that every square inch of Solstheim is filled with fierce enemies. You can literally say that you will have to sweat every meter of the way and as you progress in the game, the entire island will be littered with the corpses you leave behind. A new land full of opportunities In Bloodmoon there is (fortunately!) the respawn of monsters and, even if unrealistic, your hunting trophies will remain on the ground as an imperishable memory of your fights. You will have to deal with wolves, bears, spriggans (a kind of anthropomorphic creature of the woods) as well as with mercenaries, bersekers and so on. From the point of view of the variety of opponents, there is certainly nothing to complain about. Speaking instead of the NPCs, they will be relatively few but with a very high characterization. NPCs will recognize you when you let them know you and will be grateful if you do them a favor. The dialogues with the NPCs will therefore be dynamic, both the passive ones (the words they will say to you when you pass by them) and the active ones, during a dialogue session. Everything OK? If it hadn't been understood yet, I greatly appreciated Bloodmoon, but alas it is not free from defects that could even undermine its playability. Let's start with the quests, some triggers in their structure do not fire, preventing you from moving forward. Emblematic is the case of a quest that asks you to free a missionary, after having found and freed her the trigger does not go off that will allow you to conclude the adventure positively. Not bad after all it's only a secondary quest, a pity that this also happened to me with a quest of the main vein, forcing me to reload an old save and do it all over again. Luckily everything went well then, but in any case this denotes a certain superficiality in the beta testing phase. From a graphic point of view, we are faced with a setting designed with absolute mastery and with an enchanting beauty, sometimes ruined by a slowdown of the graphics engine for loading the areas, which sometimes lasts whole seconds. In the long run, this ends up turning a game session into a continuous torment, considering that there is no transport system in Solstheim and you will have to run a lot, both to reach a place and to escape a host of angry beasts. Everything OK? I wonder if after a year more could not have been done to optimize memory management, perhaps assuming a gradual texture loading system that doesn't involve the total blocking of the game. Furthermore Bloodmoon will occasionally slam you to the desktop without warning, this will happen randomly, maybe in three hours of play everything will go smoothly, then you will find yourself at the desktop twice in 20 minutes. All these problems have been noted by many users of the official Bloodmoon forum and Bethesda has stated that a patch is in preparation to improve the situation. Unfortunately, the implementation times are not known and in any case a more precise and punctual beta testing phase would have been enough to at least solve the problem in the quest triggers. Ultimately remember to save very, very often in Bloodmoon. In conclusion I admit it, I started Bloodmoon with some sufficiency, I didn't expect much from the proposed quests or from the new setting. How wrong I was! Bloodmoon enriches Morrowind with a wonderful new island and aconsiderable number of interesting quests, as well as a stimulating and exciting narrative. I had a lot of fun playing it and my more than positive opinion allowed me to overlook the listed defects, which demonstrates how much the positive aspects are decidedly greater than the negative ones. An expansion that cannot be missing on the shelf of every fan of The Elder Scrolls saga; for all the others, Bloodmoon could be the good excuse worth buying the original game. Presentation: 7 The expansion is naturally in English, we still don't know anything about the Italian packaging or the presence of a paper map of the new island, the US version is complete as usual. Graphics: 7.5 The same as Morrowind, unfortunately the serious problems in memory management are now unacceptable one year after the release of the original. After all this time Morrowind's engine should run smooth as oil, not stall at every turn.Sound: 6 Same sound as Morrowind, two points less because if in Morrowind there were already a few and in Tribunal they didn't fix the problem , in Bloodmoon it was imperative to add at least a couple more musical themes.Gameplay: 9 The setting is superb, the quests are interesting and challenging. Many possibilities will present themselves in front of you, including becoming a werewolf. The playability of Morrowind to its umpteenth power. Final Verdict: 82 Too bad for the defects, if Bethesda had paid more attention the vote would certainly have been higher. On the other hand, one cannot penalize such a well-made and structured expansion which, due to its qualities, alone is worth the purchase of the original game.Gabriele ~AarnaK~ Dal Fiume Silence and Ice I look at the immense frozen land that stretches out below me, walking is difficult, let alone running. The menacing crunch of the ice suggests that there must be water down here, I just hope I don't find myself battling a crack in the surface as well! Yes, to fight, since I landed in Solstheim I have done nothing else, this inhospitable land: wolves, bears, spriggans and whatnot have barred my way, not to mention the other horrors I dare not even utter. But despite this, Solstheim is a land you can't help but love; the landscape, the people, here I have found a name, a reputation, a place to call home, I don't think I will be leaving this island any time soon and if I do, it will be with deep regret and sadness. A distant howl, not a normal howl, by now I'm learning to recognize it, they're coming, they're coming to get me, well I'm ready, it's time to finish this story!", "date": "2003-06-26", "grade": null}
