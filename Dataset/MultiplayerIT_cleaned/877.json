{"name": "Moto Gp 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moto-gp-7.html", "text": "The evolution of the species? The second and third chapters of the Namco production have instead revealed a willingness on the part of the programmers to remain faithful, if not very faithful, to the traits set with the first episode, thus limiting progress to small improvements and the expansion of the available modes. Having overcome the graphic problems associated with the first development kits and perfecting the controls via dual shocks, users have in fact always obtained roughly the same game, with a mechanic however destined to feel the weight of the years in an increasingly marked way. To this aspect was added the market debut of the homonymous Climax series for Xbox which, especially with Moto GP 2, marked a clear superiority over the Namco product from every point of view. With the third episode just around the corner, a strong response was therefore expected from the Japanese company, a tangible sign of the will to respond blow by blow to THQ's ~rival~, based on a detachment from the past seasoned at least with a rewritten graphics engine and revised and corrected physical routines. On the contrary, Moto GP 4 is the usual Namco Moto GP, with all the pros and cons of the case. In reality, the review could already be closed here, with an invitation to purchase for those who have appreciated the series in question in the past, and a warning to stay away from it to those who have instead preferred the equivalent made by Climax. The main novelty of this year is represented by the inclusion of the minor classes, 125 and 250, obviously accompanied by official licenses; which, we remind you, are in any case updated to last season. This choice of programmers, although it constitutes a more substantial and credible career mode, does not represent a valid addition for gameplay purposes. Simply, the smaller classes are too slow; which, added to a mechanics specifically designed for moto gp since the beginning of the series, makes the 125 and 250 races dramatically boring. On the other hand, the return of the challenge mode is pleasant, with over a hundred challenges to face to unlock various extras and bonuses; this is undoubtedly the best strength of the Namco stock in terms of overall longevity. Ruthless without pity As already mentioned, Moto Gp 4 differs from its predecessors only in a few additional modes and a general slight filing and correction here and there. The control system and game scheme adopted is therefore always the same, blatantly arcadey; and it is precisely in this modality that the Namco game finds its reason for existing, that is by proposing an immediate motorcycle title and without any simulation ambitions. On the contrary, anyone looking for greater depth in the driving model will unfortunately find, even in the simulation mode, an all too conspicuous series of unconvincing aspects to really consider Moto GP 4 an alternative to the equivalent on Xbox. Seeing the pilot dangle from a lean to the left to a right without apparently caring about the force of gravity, or noticing the presence of a center of gravity fixed in an at least questionable way, or still observing the little credible result of braking and acceleration are heavy defects to accept . From a graphic point of view, as well as for all other aspects of the game, Moto GP 4 offers an overall picture largely borrowed from its predecessor, with only a few refinements, however not particularly incisive. The overall result is therefore pleasant, even if far from the limits of Ps2. Fluidity is however guaranteed, as long as you don't activate the unfortunate option that allows you to keep the entire group of motorcyclists compact for the entire duration of the race: try to get in line with the ~serpent~ to see a really memorable slow motion. The artificial intelligence is discreet: the opponents follow common and pre-established trajectories often even in clear contrast to what is happening on the track, but still demonstrate good aggression thus preventing the player from taking off by creating a vacuum behind him. Comment Moto GP 4 is nothing different from the expected Moto GP 4. By now faithful to the policy adopted for this series, Namco has in fact decided to limit itself to a few corrections here and there, some filings, however leaving the game that we have known for 5 years now essentially completely intact. The most important novelty, i.e. the inclusion of 125 and 250, has not brought the desired results, offering a possibility that will in all probability be really exploited by a minimal percentage of game buyers. The result is therefore a pleasant, light product, but which is now suffering the weight of time and above all of the competition from manThe newest Climax title for Xbox. Pros: Immediate and accessible arcade mode Graphically pleasing Full-bodied longevity Cons: Basically always the same game Inadequate simulation mode 125 and 250 not very stimulating Namco's Moto GP series, which made its PS2 debut between the end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001, marked an important turning point in terms of the presence of motorcycling within the world of video games. An arcade but not flat approach (thanks to the simulation mode), a prominent graphic aspect despite the ladders and the license of the world championship and its protagonists were the fundamental elements of a truly exciting overall package both for lovers of the sport in question and for those who were simply looking for a good game. And in fact Moto GP was this: a good game, very good at times, as well as an excellent starting point for a series on paper capable of evolving from year to year. Unfortunately things didn't go exactly like this...", "date": "2005-07-14", "grade": null}
