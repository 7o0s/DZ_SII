In the case of Pro Evolution Soccer, a football series that has been a point of reference for fans of the genre for years, things can be even more complicated, because there is the real possibility of losing the very elements that characterize the product and which make it have decreed success. And if in the transition from PlayStation 2 to PSP the game manages not to lose its technical identity, making some compromises only with an often uncomfortable and ~tiring~ control system, the same argument does not apply when trying to transport the Konami title on the Nintendo DS. Pro Evolution Soccer 6 has clarified, perhaps even too harshly and brutally, that one cannot simply try to convert such a game for the dual-screen portable console, but rather that one must rethink its mechanics and structure. We need to study a new PES, in short, strong in new features, avoiding the comparison (invariably ominous) with the original product. More arcade than simulation The new ~interpretation~ of Pro Evolution Soccer is evident right from the brief introduction of the game, in which a stylized child (drawn in a somewhat questionable way) kicks a ball and invites us to choose one of the available modes: World Tour, Match, Network or Training. While the latter serves to familiarize yourself with the control system and to learn how to play the various games, the other options allow us, in order, to face a modified version of the old Master League, to organize a single match or a cup and finally to access the multiplayer modes. The configuration of friendlies, penalties and cups is really very simple and limited, while the World Tour contains the most substantial part of PES2008: starting from a team that counts among its ranks the usual Minanda, Macco, Hyulens, etc. we will have to face all the national teams of the world and defeat them. The opposing teams are classified and divided into groups of five, from ~band~ K to band ~A~, and we will have to beat them all as they unlock. To replace our crooks with proper players, we will not have to resort to the market but rather use the ~Gacha-get~ system: each game won translates into the gain of one or more tokens, which we can spend on a slot machine or one of those surprise ball dispensers. While the functioning of the latter is entrusted completely to chance, the slot machine allows us to make quite prudent choices: by inserting more tokens, in fact, the three rotating boxes (team, position and shirt number) will scroll slowly, allowing us to block the object we are interested in. The players we will be able to ~win~ only belong to the national teams we have already defeated, however, and we will have a virtually unlimited number of slots to insert our new ~signings~ into the team, subject to the obligation to set up a starting line-up and a certain number of reserves. Club teams are excluded from the competition, which however are present in a very small number. Products? Pro Evolution Soccer 2008, in its Nintendo DS version, gives us the possibility of adjusting the team's parameters by choosing between a series of quick settings (~more defenders~, ~more forwards~, etc.) or advanced settings. The latter are used to change the scheme, the positions on the field and, of course, to replace the players in bad condition with those in better condition. On the right side of the screen, you can see a slot available for assigning a ~product~. In this case, these are various types of upgrades that can be purchased in the PES Shop, using the tokens earned. There are the products ~super shot~, ~super speed~, ~dodge ability~ and so on, and each player can only own one of these upgrades. The game Once you take the field, you find yourself dealing with a classic control system, which does not make any changes compared to the previous episode. So the players move using the d-pad, while the buttons are used to shoot (Y), make low-lying (B), high (A) or smarcanti (X) passes. In the non-possession phase, the same configuration allows us to guide our teammates towards the ball carrier, counter the opponent, make sliding tackles and call the goalkeeper out. The role of the back buttons has not changed either: R activates fast running, while L (in combination with other buttons) is used to activate special actions as well as to change the player we control. The difficulty level is set to ~easy~ by defaulta, and increasing it produces visible changes both in the behavior of the opponents and in the final results of the matches, much narrower. In any case, our antagonists always turn out to be very vulnerable to marking doubles, as if they didn't ~see~ who is going to oppose them in addition to the player we directly control. The setting of the game is decidedly arcade, very fast, and usually singles make a difference but for the wrong reasons. In fact we are faced with a modest level of artificial intelligence: our teammates rarely support the game effectively, often find themselves in absurd positions or even fail to intercept passes. The through ball, in particular, in this PES2008 goes a bit where it likes and it's as if it doesn't take into account the direction pressed on the d-pad. A similar argument can be made for crosses, which rarely turn into conclusions on the net because the player in the area is never in the ball's landing zone. The Konami series (just like the EA Sports one) has always accustomed us to a sort of ~semi-automatic~ control of the teams, in particular as regards the positioning of the players, but in this version everything is very ~free~, with mediocre results. the quality and ergonomics of controls. In this regard, unfortunately it must be said that playing PES with the Nintendo DS can be a far from relaxing experience: the d-pad is what it is, but above all its position close to the left back button obliges to position the hands in an often absurd and unnatural way, with a series of problems already after a few minutes. Technical realization Compared to Pro Evolution Soccer 6, a different interpretation of the measures can be seen: the ball has returned to having realistic dimensions, but the players appear slightly smaller than normal when compared with the field. This fact is evidenced by the only view available, the one from afar: arriving at the baseline with one of our wing players to make a cross, we will not be able to see the lines that delimit the penalty area, with the risk of letting the ball run out out without even realizing it. Also in this 2008 version the quality of the graphical interface leaves much to be desired, above all for the style adopted, and the biggest problem concerns the radar visible on the lower screen during matches: the dots representing the players on the pitch are too big and they often overlap, making us think of narrow markings that aren't actually there. It is possible to deactivate the radar to have a view of the fatigue indicators for the whole team, but this is frankly a useless option (just check the status of the players during the interval, it is useless to always have an eye on it), while the buttons remain on the touch screen to change the level of attack and defense in real time. As far as the players are concerned, the resolution of the Nintendo DS does not allow the presence of sophisticated polygonal models resembling the real counterparts, therefore the developers limited themselves to inserting superficial characteristics (skin and hair color). The animation quality is sufficient but nothing more, with the graphics flowing smoothly except in the most crowded situations or during set pieces: in that situation, the view changes and moves behind the player who has to shoot, but the frame rate drops to historic lows it's so jerky. On the sound front, the obvious comparison with FIFA08 appears ruthless: the EA title boasts a signed and engaging soundtrack, as well as a series of good effects, while PES2008 has some anonymous jingles and really mediocre effects: a pang was not expected commentary, but good old Sandreani intervenes only in the event of a goal and with only two different sentences, where the third (inexplicably) is recited by a Brazilian commentator... Multiplayer mode PES2008 allows us to challenge other players both locally and online. In the first case, we will be able to organize friendlies for up to four participants if they all have the game, or two if only one copy is available. It is also possible to swap players if you wish. Online multiplayer, via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, finds an opponent based on the criteria we select (same level, same nationality, friends only) and sets up a match in seconds. Too bad that the lag is really unacceptable: the game action is slowed down a lot, bugs often occur and, in general, you don't have much fun. Such a pity. Bonus Challenges and Penalty Challenges Among the innovations introduced by this version2008, we note the presence of bonus challenges within the World Tour mode. After a few games, in fact, we will find ourselves having to face particular challenges, overcoming which we will be able to get hold of our opponents' products. As far as penalties are concerned, the game puts us in front of a structure divided into six sectors that identifies the goal: the player will shoot in the direction indicated by the tap of the stylus, and our goalkeeper will behave in the same way when he is the opponent to shoot. Comment Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 for Nintendo DS is simply not the soccer game we all hoped to see on the dual screen handheld. The developers realized that they had to shuffle the cards a bit and opted for a very arcade approach (see also the boosters for the players), forgetting, however, to solve the obvious problems that afflict this title. The control of the players, the precision of the passes, the level of artificial intelligence, the tremendous lag of the online multiplayer... even leaving out the technical shortcomings (which, with a little effort, could be at least ~smoothed~) and considering the discrete playability of this PES2008, the results obtained are really too far from what Konami could have done. Pros: It's still PES Interesting arcade approach Multiplayer even online... Cons: ...but afflicted by a huge lag Technically mediocre AI that can be greatly improved", "date": "2008-02-05", "grade": null}
