{"name": "Amy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/97956-amy-il-male-dentro.html", "text": "The game is available for download via PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Version tested: Xbox 360 There is something terrible about Amy. And we are not referring only to the protagonist of this bizarre survival horror, but to its controversial gestation. We have more than one reason to think that the VectorCell project, a house founded by Paul Cuisset (former author of Flashback), has run out of funds in a decidedly premature stage and left to its tragic fate in the digital delivery market. Let's see in detail what awaits us in this high-voltage title, in every sense. 90's Truth be told, since the release of the first teaser the expectations for this product were quite high and rightly so. The genre is far from prolific on new generation platforms and the incipit proves to be decidedly intriguing. In the role of a woman named Lana we find ourselves facing a journey in the company of little Amy, who gives her name to the game, an eight-year-old autistic girl and guardian of strange powers. We soon discover that we have taken the little girl away from a research laboratory with perhaps not very legitimate systems, but motivated by what will happen shortly, the explosion of an apocalyptic epidemic, capable of transforming most living beings into ravenous zombies and abominable creatures. Lana herself is infected by the virus, thus seeing her undead future held back only by miraculous vials and the very presence of the child. That's right, Amy's proximity cancels any influence of the nefarious infection, provided, however, that you remain in close contact with the child. Thus begins a symbiotic relationship on which the entire game system develops, in a similar way to what is seen in products such as Ico. But VectorCell looks more to the sagas of Silent Hill and Resident Evil, especially the first, and aspires to bring the survival horror genre back to its ancient, glorious origins. Every man for himself The road to hell is paved with good intentions and never a proverb is more apt as in the case of Amy. As we have said, the setting follows that of the adventures of about fifteen years ago, with a precarious and frightened protagonist, protected only by a few improvised weapons and the powers of little Amy, able to copy glyphs on her Pad capable of give special features. Taking advantage of the indefinite futuristic setting of the story, the title shows off technological instruments, in reality a mere pretext for the preparation of a series of puzzles aimed at lengthening the broth. Among these we include DNA-loaded doors, which require backtracking sessions from the first minutes of the game (!) whose understanding is totally up to the player, switches to be managed with four hands (with Amy) and terminals to unlock, essentially hacking mini-games with even embarrassing conceptual errors. Trying your hand at Amy gives sensations strongly biased towards the unpleasant, the good atmosphere of the game is contrasted by controls that are difficult to tolerate, a totally random collision system and various bugs, some very serious. In our sessions, everything happened to us, from zombies suspended in the void, to the little girl who refused to follow us, getting stuck in the seabed. The most dramatic aspect, however, is represented by the rescue system, which is truly insipid. The game automatically saves in pre-established points of the 6 chapters, but the checkpoints are reduced to the bone, and the strongly trial and error structure forces you to repeat the same steps an excessive number of times. Particularly disturbing is the lack of logic of many deaths, inevitable as they are cynically planned by programmers to accumulate game hours. Dulcis in fundo, resuming a game means having to start the chapter all over again, a simply unacceptable condition. Xbox 360 goals Amy offers the canonical 200 player points, divided across 12 objectives. Being a single player adventure, you can get almost all of them by completing the main story along the 6 chapters, in the three proposed difficulty levels. An operation that is anything but easy, given the daunting task that falls to the player to see the coveted credits, good luck. The Walking Dead Even technically Amy does not make you cry out for a miracle, the polygonal modeling of the characters is not stingy with details, especially the inexorable transformation of Lana when away from Amy. This is really impressive and exponentially increases the tension, not to mention that in a certain passage we have to use our despicable state to pass unharmed among the zombies (does this remind you of anything?). Much more questionable is the direction aArtistic, Lana inspires more fear than an undead even when in healthy conditions, and the disproportions of the limbs have a frankly horrible rendering. The scenarios are the most canonical imaginable and strongly derivative of the Konami horror saga, therefore we have unhealthy and depressing environments, surrounded by darkness and red blood cells smeared on the walls. Unfortunately everything runs in really bad conditions, with a framerate that barely exceeds 20 frames, the screen devastated by tearing phenomena and various slowdowns. It is evident that the optimization phase and, we suspect, beta testing have completely failed. The audio section is normal, with a series of ambient sounds that are all in all effective. The game is spoken in English with Italian subtitles. Amy is available on Live Marketplace for 800 Microsoft Points, and on Sony Playstation Network for 9.99.
