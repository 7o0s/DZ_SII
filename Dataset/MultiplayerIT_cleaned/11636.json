{"name": "Turok - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/turok-recensione.html", "text": "Turok Forest From a technical point of view we certainly cannot be enthusiastic about this game, which uses the Unreal Engine but which is subject to too many ups and downs. We're not just talking about the frame drops that unfortunately afflict the game too often, or even the low-resolution textures that characterize more than a few surfaces such as the forest floor, we're referring in particular to the management of artificial intelligence. We were particularly disappointed with the way the various movements of the soldiers and dinosaurs were handled. The enemy troops are unfortunately almost always afflicted by embarrassing pauses, remaining motionless just long enough to be killed by an arrow, they are animated according to trivial scripts and we will often see them running one after the other straight towards the greatest danger, us and the our firepower. The soldiers hardly take advantage of the shelters provided by the forest or military structures, and in some ways the dinosaurs behave more ~intelligently~ by running from one part of the screen to the other and attacking us suddenly. From these movements and the sudden attacks that arise from them, we will find ourselves facing quick time events that will see hand-to-hand combat between us and the lizards. Fights that will end with a series of ~artistic~ kills, if we manage to press the indicated keys with the right timing. The forest was created to be credible and oppressive, here we see the efforts of the programmers in creating a hostile environment, with each polygonal element capable of hiding pitfalls, such as for example the small and fast dinosaurs, but also the bodies of the soldiers fallen and their weapons. Here too, unfortunately, the elements that compose it are of decidedly fluctuating quality. Too many ups and downs affect the final result Turok Forest In more than a few scenes, especially in the interludes, the characters incredibly have a sort of luminous aura around them, an incomprehensible defect which, just as it is present after a few scenes, disappears and then suddenly reappears. The dinosaurs are the real added value of the game, they are rich in detail and excellently made, even if their movements are sometimes a little too rigid with animations that certainly need to be perfected. Multiplayer in Turok consists of 7 maps that offer weapons at will to fight each other in all the most famous modes, from deathmatch to capture the flag. Again, although we note the efforts made by the developers to offer a rich experience, we do not even come close to the quality of the online offered by other recently released titles. The multiplayer option that we have found to be the best is certainly the one offered by the coop: facing the arenas full of dinosaurs and enemies together with three other friends gives a good feeling. A group of soldiers in a large warship, something goes wrong, one attack and the shuttle crashes. Here begins the fight for the survival of Turok, a strong military man of Indian origin who is treated as a traitor and outcast by the rest of the team. Within the Whiskey Company, Joseph Turok is not accepted because he was previously a member of the Wolfpack terrorist group, led by Roland Kane who is precisely the objective of the mission. During the adventure we will have the opportunity to understand how things really go. The world in which the events of this title developed by Propaganda Games take place is certainly not very comfortable, a forest full of pitfalls and scary thick populated by opposing soldiers. But that's not all, the third wheel are the dinosaurs. As is clear, the real crazy variable of the game is made up of the rich population of prehistoric creatures, including T-rex, which hinder not only our movements but also those of the enemy troops. From the gameplay point of view there are no big news, and the game fully reflects the canons of classic fps. We will have the task of advancing trying to reach the various and successive objectives from time to time using our strength and above all the devastating power of our arsenal in no uncertain terms. Thousands of shots will be fired and almost never risk running out of ammunition. In the vast arsenal of the game we will find almost all the most famous instruments of death, from the shotgun to the grenade launcher, the sniper rifle, the machine guns and the famous bow certainly could not be missing. The weapons are equipped with two types of fire, a main one and a secondary one that proves devastating, such as the grenade launcher, the flamethrower or the machine guns. For example, the primary function of machine guns is to fire consistent bursts of shots at enemies, the secondary is instead to transform into a real turret resting on the ground. Xbox 360 - Goals The 1000 points up for grabs with Turok we tell you right away they won't be easy to get. They have been divided into 43 objectives and 30 are obtainable only by playing multiplayer, the rest are dedicated to the story mode. By finishing the game and not playing online you will only be able to get 200/250 points, focus on Xbox Live! Comment Where to start from to write a comment on an FPS like Turok? The series is famous, it has experienced ups and downs and this new chapter certainly does not make it make the definitive leap in quality. The title developed by Propaganda Games proves to be only discreet, the good realization of the environments and dinosaurs collides with a poor and not very ~intelligent~ artificial intelligence. The clashes are resolved most of the time in a display of brute force that after a few levels may not convince those looking for more complex experiences. The use of the bow gives some more joy, but certainly fighting against immobile opponents, who almost never manage to worry the player, does not give great satisfaction. The charm of the setting and the dinosaurs are undeniable, but alone they are not enough to decree the full success of a title that could have given much more. Pros Dinosaurs Brute force and the bow Cons Technically too many ups and downs A.I. below sufficiency Turok is available for PlayStation 3, Xbox360 and from the end of March for PC. The tested version is the one for Xbox360. Although firearms are particularly effective, the tool that has always characterized the series, and which we have always preferred, is the deadly Turok bow. Thanks to the bow we will be able to carry out silent killings, almost like in a stealth game like Splinter Cell, without alarming the whole group of soldiers and thus starting to eliminate the opponents little by little. Not only stealth but also a disruptive power since we will be able to make our rival fly into the air with a single arrow. The bow is very simple to handle once the sight is aimed at the target, the longer we hold down the dorsal trigger, the farther the arrow will go. If used with precision this system allows us to do a good cleaning among the enemy ranks, certainly in close combat we will only be able to switch to firearms or, if the proximity to the opponent allows us, even to the knife. The silent kills unfortunately don't always work well, either due to artificial intelligence problems, or due to the not very precise aiming system, which frustrates our efforts, but the fact remains that the bow / arrow system is fascinating, since the days of John Rambo. The management of weapons has been successfully entrusted by the developers to the directional pad, this system allows you to switch in an instant not only from one weapon to another but also from one configuration to the next. Yes because in our crew we will always have the knife and the bow then we will be able to choose whether to use a single one (with the possibility in the case of zooming and aiming carefully with the left trigger) or whether to take up a pair of weapons, from the two machine guns to the pistols or the combination of our choice such as the shotgun and a pistol.", "date": "2008-02-07", "grade": null}
