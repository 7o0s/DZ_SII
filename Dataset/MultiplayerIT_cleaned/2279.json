{"name": "Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shaun-palmers-pro-snowboarder-3.html", "text": "Activision O2 and Shaun Palmer As Joypad announced a few hundred news stories ago, Activision has launched a new label exclusively dedicated to extreme sports. Given the success of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series, the O2 (that's the name) has worked on Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer, the second installment of Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX and ~our~ Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder.But Who is Shaun Palmer? (Here we need a joke as only Zelig people can do) Shaun Palmer is a real tough guy, Shaun Palmer is a great lover of Cadillacs, Shaun Palmer has his name tattooed on his chest and wherever there is snowboarding, Shaun Palmer doesn't he is the absolute protagonist. Just to add a line to his curriculum, he has practiced other extreme sports in the past and is multiple world champion (snowboard) and it is said that only the air can stop him :) Together with our friend, probably very modest, in the game we will find characters of the caliber of Ross Powers, Tara Dakides, Markus Hurme. We insert the disc and take the pad in hand After an introduction that ~charges~ you and introduces you to the world of snowboarding, you will have a menu that is not too well designed graphically but still simple and intuitive, so no problem if you want to get to the slopes immediately to see what the game is made of. At first glance, Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder (henceforth simply SPPS) might be considered a difficult game to pick up, but after a few minutes of play and a few broken bones from your many falls you'll figure out how to handle your character, and then fidget in air after a jump in all conceivable and unthinkable ways possible. But how was the game structured? As I have already announced in the first lines of this article, owners of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 will feel right at home. By selecting the career mode you can select one of the available characters (including, I repeat, Shaun Palmer) or created by you, and start your adventure with the board under your arm. In case you would like to start a career with a character created by you, therefore without relying on the default ones, you will have a fair amount of possibilities available. Having entered the ~Create Boarder~ menu, you will immediately notice the amount of characters that can be created, that is ten. Once you have selected a still unused ~space~, you will enter the actual editor. It is possible to change the player's name, personal data, physical appearance and qualities; let's talk about the latter immediately, fundamental for the game in career mode. You will have eleven points to distribute in the following characteristics: ollie (sway), spin (rotation), speed (speed), landing (landing), balance (balance). As personal data, you can change your gender, age and size. For the physical aspect instead the programmers were more specific: type and color of the hair, face, constitution, type and color of the jacket, type and color of the trousers, gloves, boots and finally the type of table (patterns/colours). There are eight settings available, all of which really exist and, unlike the SSX series, it does not impose a track to follow. In fact, in SPPS you will have a considerable amount of space at your disposal, which does not limit you to following a single path, but leaves you with complete freedom of choice. This must be underlined, as it is one of the main features of the DearSoft title. In these tracks, just like THPS3, you will have to achieve some objectives, such as reaching a certain number of points (which can be accumulated thanks to the 75 combinable tricks), destroy certain signs, find hidden sponsors, let yourself be photographed ... These objectives, some very extravagant, others rather complicated, vary from track to track and must be achieved individually in a certain period of time. As you progress in the game, it will be increasingly difficult to bring home successes. For each objective achieved you will have one more sponsor, while with more objectives you will receive ~quality~ points to add to your character. With the sponsors you will gradually be able to make the other slopes and the other 5 snowboards available (carbon fibre, etc etc), while you will be able to add points to the qualities of your snowboarder (why not make him faster or give him more balance? :D )With the Freestyle mode instead you can have fun freely without imposed goals or simply train on the patterns available from your career. There is nothing else to resume here, the characteristics are similar to the career mode. The Graphics Let's talk about graphics...definitely the worst side of Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder. Where gameplay and sound (which we'll get to later) win out, looks andaesthetic leaves much to be desired and considering its competitor, SSX Tricky, I'd say that we can speak of real defeat. The most terrible thing, in my opinion, are the backdrops... real images stuck as a background (and it's too noticeable). The rest is all decent, nothing outrageous, but not fantastic either. The character models are just enough (but not the animations, really well done), like the textures used... very monotonous for the sport and for the soundtrack that follows it. On the other hand, buildings, such as houses, cottages, cable car stops, etc. are made in a good way. etc. If we were in school, the grade would be a tight seven... we could have done much better, above all to deserve Tony's formula. I can see myself inside of youuuuu Another positive aspect of this game is surely the soundtrack, really suitable for this type of extreme sport, and which I consider a really great set of songs. If you are curious like me, here are the titles:ALIENT ANT FARM - COURAGE GODHEAD - INSIDE YOU INSOLENCE - NATURAL HIGH ORANGE 9MM - WHEN YOU LIE PANTERA - MOUTH FOR WAR PAPA ROACH - DEAD CELL POWERMAN 5000 - BOMBSHEEL SHOOTYZ GROVE - MAD FOR IT SPINESHANK - NEW DISEASE STATIC X - THIS IS NOT STEREOMUD - DON'T BE AFRAID SUPERSUCKERS - THE EVIL POWERS OF ROCK 'N' ROLLEven the game itself enhances the songs in question. DearSoft has created a special section where it is possible to listen to the songs just as if it were an Audio CD but, speaking more strictly of the game, has ensured that players can order the various pieces as they please or have them chosen random. When sharing the screen becomes a pleasure... The multiplayer mode, offered by the game, does not allow you to connect and play on the internet or to play four, but it is still unmissable. In fact, sharing your television screen can be more pleasant than you think :) The available modes are Freestyle, Palmer X, Push and Horse. Push mode is certainly the one that stands out the most from the others. Every time one of the players performs a series of tricks and combos and lands correctly, depending on the score, the opponent's slice of the screen shrinks, thus also compromising the field of vision. Obviously the latter can recover by behaving in a similar way. When the screen becomes ~owned~ by a single player, the game is over. Freestyle mode follows the same rules as singleplayer mode, and the winner will be the one with the highest score. The Horse mode compares the two challengers for a small handful of seconds in a given point of the track and the one who reaches a lower amount of points ~earns~ the first letter of the initially chosen word (by default, look what, HORSE) . It goes on to the bitter end, whoever accumulates all the letters first, thus completing the entered word, loses. Little to say for the Palmer X mode: first come, wins. Summing up In conclusion, Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder was in my opinion a little considered title compared to its real value, probably due to the overwhelming presence of SSX Tricky, which really can be criticized very little. But here we are faced with an almost different game, which takes the world of snowboarding in a different way. While in SSX we are limited to a track to follow, with SPPS we have greater freedom of movement, in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 style. Where he gains, however, he also loses: the graphics of ~our~ title are inferior to Tricky, a big ordeal . However, considering the high fun (because you have fun, and not a little), the soundtrack and other small details Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder is to be considered promoted and, for true snowboard enthusiasts, to buy even if you already own by SSX Tricky. For all the others, it is truly an excellent alternative, especially for those who love open spaces a lot. Summing up Pro Guaranteed fun Soundtrack to be listened to Very large and really existing levels Many tricks that can be performed Cons Not very graphically equipped Not very thick When it comes to snowboarding on Playstation 2, the first thing that comes to mind is SSX Tricky, the hugely successful title from Electronic Arts. But what we are going to analyze with this review is a game always dedicated to extreme sports that sees snow as the protagonist, but addresses the theme in a different way. Maybe SSX Tricky addicts will remain strangers to Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder, but for those who have a more open mind, they will find themselves in front of a really fun game, with discreet graphics and with a soundtrack suitable for all the fanatics of this globe. For those who also own Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, then, you will immediately notice the familiarity at certain points in the gameplay. Now the details", "date": "2002-01-11", "grade": null}
