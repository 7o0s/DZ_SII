{"name": "Star Wars Trilogy: Apprentice of the Force", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-trilogy-apprentice-of-the-force.html", "text": "May the Force be with you The game is a typical horizontal scrolling 2d platformer; the player's goal, apart from on rare occasions, is to reach the end of a stage, avoiding the many traps scattered along his way. At the beginning the moves available to Luke are not many, he can simply shoot and jump, but over time you will learn many new Jedi actions dear to fans of the series. The controls are excellent, well calibrated and responsive enough, and offer the best of themselves in sword fights. You will be able to carry out many types of attacks, but above all you will be able to deflect enemy shots by parrying yourself by pressing the L key, a very satisfying action. The only slightly out of place move is the one that allows Luke to slow down time and move faster than everyone else on the screen; move evidently inherited from Prince of Persia, but which has absolutely nothing to do with the universe of George Lucas. Another flaw is the tendency that the character has while in the air to hang on to every handhold he finds, even when it is not necessary, which could make less patient players nervous, especially in levels with many jumps. Overall, however, the controls are done very well, the feeling of commanding a Jedi is reproduced very well. The levels, while not standing out decisively for originality, do their duty. Every now and then there are sections where you can't continue left or right and you are overwhelmed by enemies to kill, until you exterminate them all and you can continue on your way. The levels, like the enemies, have been created very faithfully, and nothing has been invented entirely by the developers. Many of the races introduced in the episodes covered have been included in the game, from the Sand People to the very nice Ewoks. There are three atypical sections that you will have to face in the main quest: one with Luke's ship at the end of the first episode, when you will have to go inside the Death Star, one always with the same ship but in open space, another with the speeder with which you will have to extricate yourself, just like in the film The Return of the Jedi, within the woods of the planet of the Ewoks. These sub-missions take place from a top-down view and are both fun and useful, as they break up the extremely fast pace of the game. The part in the open space, during which you will have to chase and destroy the Imperial Fighters, you can also face it against a friend of yours using two Gameboy Advances, a link cable and a single cartridge. This simple multiplayer mode, due to its repetitiveness, won't take long to tire you out. So we come to the main and unbridgeable defect of what could have been an excellent game: longevity. AotF is divided into three parts, each representing an episode, each just over an hour and a half long. Therefore, although the gameplay is excellent, unfortunately the game fails to deepen any of the many themes included in these few hours. In addition to this, the difficulty of the levels remains practically constant from start to finish, preventing the game from making the leap in quality. Even the extreme fidelity of the story, narrated in the first person by Luke, loses all its charm given the absurd speed at which events unfold. A few lines between one stage and another will tell you all the events that have become legend in the first three films written by Lucas, ridiculing cathartic events such as the death of Obi-Wan, the meeting with Yoda, the discovery of Darth Vader's true nature or , above all, the epilogue of the story. In short, the seriously insufficient longevity ends up undermining all the other components of the game, which taken individually would have been anything but negative. Graphics and Sound The technical department is divided between ups and downs, and also in this case the haste with which AotF was developed is evident. The graphics are very good, with a style very similar to that seen in Prince of Persia for GBA, which attempts to bring the effect of Cell Shading into two dimensions. The large rendered characters are surrounded by a black border that detaches them from the rest of the background, but the real prized piece of graphics are the near-perfect animations of all the subjects and all the races you will meet in your adventure. The game runs smooth as oil while, unfortunately, the sound sector is not up to the task. The music, all taken from the legendary songs by John Williams, are distortions of the original masterpieces, and the fault is certainly not the small Nintendo console which has shown in the past that it can do much better. The sound effects are saved, exciting as always the historical one of the lightsaber. Sttar Wars: Apprentice of the Force is a very fun and well-structured game, with a respectable graphic design, too bad it lasts less than five hours. Which, given that it costs as much as a regular Game Boy Advance game, is way too cheap. The multiplayer mode gets boring quickly, and the scarce extra material is all unlocked by simply beating the game. Recommended only for the most ardent fans of the series, who will surely enjoy the fidelity with which the Jedi abilities have been reproduced. Pros: Precise and intuitive control system Jedi skills very well structured Awesome graphics Cons: Short, very short Multiplayer mode ridiculous Poor sound Star Wars Trilogy: Apprentice of the Force is yet another GameBoy Advance game based on the famous and beautiful saga created by George Lucas. Developed by the division of Ubisoft that also dealt with the portable adaptation of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, it was marketed quickly in conjunction with the box set containing Episodes IV, V and VI on DVD, to obtain certain commercial advantages. This Apprentice of the Force, henceforth AotF, proposes the story of the last three episodes of the series lived from Luke's point of view, from the beginning of his adventure on Tatooine to the clash inside the second Death Star with Darth Vader .", "date": "2004-10-11", "grade": null}
