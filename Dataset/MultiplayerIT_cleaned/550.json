{"name": "Odama", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/odama.html", "text": "The pinball machine, reinvented Describing Odama's game mechanics is honestly complicated. Probably the basis from which to start to be able to create an image of it is that of a pinball machine; as in the most classic of bar pastimes, also in the effort of the Japanese team Vivarium there are 2 paddles with which to hit a ball to launch it upwards. However, the similarities with the classic idea of pinball stop here, since in Odama there are no buffers, bonuses, colored buttons or scores to increase. The game table, if we can call it that, is in fact composed of a small plain with rocks, rivers, houses, trees, and in general everything that contributes to creating a rural landscape typical of feudal Japan. The aim of the game is to allow your platoon of men (yes, there are small armies on the game board) to reach the top of the screen, in order to successfully transport the sacred Ninten bell. If you have read up to this point and it seems pure madness to you, know that that's not all ... Yes, because obviously the transport of the bell is not so simple, since between our men and the objective there is an entire enemy militia who has no intention of letting go. Odama is the name of the magic ball, which is the only tool that the player has to directly influence the fate of the battle and help his soldiers. As? First of all, the huge sphere can instantly kill anyone in its path, including allies, unless a special bonus is collected that allows you to pass over the latter without causing them damage. Furthermore, through this atypical tool it is possible to interact with the environment in an often fundamental way; for example, hitting the lock of a river can affect its course. Closing it will allow your troops to continue, opening it will be able to block the advance of the enemies. Or you can hit stairs to knock them to the ground, thus allowing soldiers to pick them up and use them to overcome otherwise inaccessible barricades. But that is not all! Yes, because inside the game package there is also a microphone, identical to the one attached to the last chapter of Mario Party. Through this device, in fact, one has the option of giving orders to the troops, obviously in Italian, using an excellent voice detection system. The beauty is that the orders are immediately available, but must be collected by crushing some of the houses on the ~tables~ with the odama; so here you can push the troop to move to the right or left, retreat or advance, attack with force or pick up objects and so on. Unfortunately, the high number of orders does not translate into their actual usefulness for each of them, thus ultimately concentrating their use on a well-defined handful. It was easier at the bar Faced with such a complexity in Odama's description, it would be logical to imagine a relative and consequent difficulty once the pad is picked up. In fact, the first game sessions are not simple at all, and coordinating the commands given to the ball via the pad with those to the soldiers to make them move or act correctly is frankly complicated, as is being able to follow everything that happens on the screen. But it is enough to persevere a little and continue in the missions to be able to obtain an excellent command of the control system, to the point of realizing that in reality it does not represent a problem. Yes, because Odama's main defect must be sought elsewhere, or rather in the formula of the product itself which, simply, is not particularly apt. Unintriguing premises often turn into surprising productions; on the contrary, the tantalizing cohesion between strategic and pinball of the Vivarium product struggles to involve the player, to stimulate him, or simply to capture him and entice him to continue in the adventure. The negative point that weighs the most on Odama's head is certainly to be found in the excessive randomness that determines the development of events; often, very often, in fact, it happens to win without realizing the dynamics that led to the result, just as other times one gets lost with doubts about the cause of the defeat. This is not a lack of attention from the player, but rather it is an integral part of the mechanics of Nintendo production; it is therefore fun to observe the action with a real sense of admiration for the creativity of the Japanese team, but also the feeling one gets in the face of the results that follow one another level after level is frustrating and not very satisfying. As if that weren't enough, the difficulty level set by the programmers is quite high, forcing you to rerepeat the internships even numerous times before being able to find the key to achieving success. Finally, the level design proves to be quite erratic, going from very good to poor. From a technical point of view, it is also evident how the game suffers from the years of programming it carries on its shoulders, just as it is clear that Odama wants to play its cards more on the originality of the concept than on pure aesthetic appeal. Nonetheless, it is difficult to consider the graphics of the Vivarium effort something more than simply ~functional~, above all due to a rather small number of polygons on the screen and animations that are really minimal wages. Comment Odama is a truly original, atypical game, and by choosing an alternative path to those trodden by the ~cash~ genres, it immediately collects our sympathy. It is also a well-finished product, which demonstrates the passion of those who programmed it. Unfortunately, however, the formula it proposes, which is a strange mix between a strategic and a pinball game, simply does not convince. Not even after having become familiar with the control system, nor after passing over a barely sufficient graphics, nor after having accepted a truly excessive randomness in the positive or negative resolution of the missions. Yoot Saito deserves all our respect, but unfortunately his Odama is not a game to remember. It will be for next time. Pros The essence of originality Intriguing at first Very good voice recognition Cons The formula doesn't work very much Too much randomness in matches Overly sparse graphics Odama's name has long echoed in the minds of Gamecube owners interested in original and innovative gameplay. On the other hand, the designer in charge of the project, Yoot Saito, is the same one who created the bizarre - to put it mildly - Seaman for the Dreamcast, a kind of interview simulator with a talking fish. At Multiplayer.it we are always enthusiastic about the idea of playing something that tries to tread paths different from the conventional and inflated ones, distinguishing itself from the mass of clones: you will therefore understand why we have welcomed this latest project with great interest and trust. .", "date": "2006-04-10", "grade": null}
