Now two years after its release and with the last major expansion before the already highly anticipated Destiny 2 in stores, the time has come to take stock. Over the past few weeks, a multitude of users have asked us if it's worth picking up Destiny now, starting from scratch. The answer to this question is twofold. As a player it is clear that taking hold of a title so solidly anchored to the concept of online progression, and joining it when it has already been tested or even concluded for some time by everyone, can only leave a bad taste in the mouth. The emotions experienced by the teams while discovering the first raid, the famous Vault of Glass, is something that a new player will never experience. And it's also one of the elements that made Destiny famous and allowed it to survive a number of death sentences that are beyond imagination. At the same time, if you are truly convinced of becoming part of this universe and above all if you have some companions to embark on the journey with, buying the Collection version can only be the best way to have so much to do at a competitive price. For our part, we have thoroughly experienced this last package, and we can finally give an overall judgement. Is it also worth buying Rise of Iron, the new Destiny expansion? The Iron Temple For those who are among the very few who have followed the narrative arc of Destiny, more articulate than you think, but at the same time sketched and closely linked to the reading of the famous ~grimoire cards~, it will be enough to know that the campaign of this expansion tries to highlight the truth about the famous ~Nine~. Forget about having answers to the old questions: what happened to the Unknown? Is the Sleepless Queen really dead? All this is not given to us to know. In all likelihood we will be forced to wait for the next chapter of the franchise to delve into these details, but this does not eliminate a sense of inconclusiveness that perennially hovers throughout the very short duration of the campaign. Despite a new social zone (the first in which you find yourself fighting to free it) and a whole further patrol environment on Earth, the four or five missions necessary to close the narrative arc of the expansion are a pittance, beyond words. . Making the simplest and most obvious comparison, it can be said that the already short campaign of the previous expansion of the game, The Taken King, easily managed to last three times longer and unravel through a series of interesting and in some respects even innovative missions. The exact opposite of The Lords of Iron, except for the final, epic and interesting mission. We are well aware that it is not the campaign that matters most in an expansion of a game of this genre, but here it leads to the unacceptable, especially after a year of waiting. Drop me the SIVA What The Taken King had focused on to attract new players, but also to bring back old ones, was the so-called transition to Year Two. This brought a new increase in the level of the character and a total distortion of the use of the Light Level, a real score dedicated to the so-called endgame. If this was combined with the impossibility of increasing the power of one's Year One weapons except through a specific procedure, it is clear how everything was balanced in the hope of giving the player a lasting growth system. The Lords of Iron, on the other hand, cannot be considered a real Year Three, due to a non-raised character cap and the possibility of upgrading everything that can be upgraded. The growth speed has consequently proved to be exponential, without the need to accumulate new weapons and armor already in our possession, but updated to the current system. This can be positive for all those who do not find the search for equipment fun and stimulating; this does not change that it affects an overall longevity of the adventure which makes the search for new weapons and armor its nerve center. The other content that catches the eye, leaving aside the new raid which we will arrive shortly, includes a brand new raid, accompanied by two other revisited and updated in mechanics and a handful of competitive elements, such as new maps and a new mode. Precisely with regard to the competitive aspect, after two years and millions of tears shed, Bungie has finally decided to make the famous private matches available. This will allow all those who need to organize their own tournaments or land own group games, to manage the type of game, the duration, the map and only one player who will be the host, so as to make total customization also in the multiplayer area. It is important to note that this element is obviously not part of the additions relating to the expansion, but it is an update that has already been available for about twenty days and can be exploited by all Destiny players, with no limits whatsoever, except as regards the new maps and the new mode. Playstation 4 trophies As for the trophies, we are exactly from the parts of The Taken King, with the need to complete the main businesses and activities of the package. The two trophies linked to the conquest of the raid in the two available difficulties cannot be missing (the difficult one will be unlocked later) and a small secret gem, which can be unlocked in the new social area. And now when will we meet again? Reviewing an expansion of a game belonging to this genre often involves the need to update the judgment later, or at least to wait for a series of contents that are unlikely to be revealed all at once. As with The Taken King, we also expect this expansion to reserve us some pleasant surprises linked to secret or timed quests (see examples such as the Hammering Spindle or the Sleeping Simulator) and events linked to specific moments of the year (the Festival of Anime for Halloween or the Scarlet Doublet for Valentine's Day); but we are still expected to make our own judgment as to what material is available at the moment. After a long reflection and a series of changes in perception, it certainly cannot be said that The Lords of Iron represents that great lasting scaffolding on which to base a year of waiting in view of the new chapter. At the same time, all those who have spent the past two years with Destiny and still manage to have fun today will continue to find bread for their teeth, net of the need to have a series of friendships with which to enjoy the new additions. And if you are part of that group of players who have found in Destiny (quite incredibly) a game on which to vent their need for competition, private matches alone represent the most important addition since day one; addition that as mentioned does not need spending to be experienced. In fact, the point remains exactly the same: does I Signori del Ferro deserve the certainly not small price it costs? Probably not. Like any initiative related to Destiny, we are talking about a price that is absolutely out of parameters compared to what it offers, but you cannot fail to take into consideration the hours of fun that the title can guarantee you. In these two years there are more people we know who have found themselves again, pad in hand, to test the new activities, despite having promised themselves never to fall into them again, compared to those who have actually succeeded and ~detoxified~. This will always remain Bungie's greatest achievement, for better or for worse. Mechanical Fury As for the new raid, the definitive activity for six players, we can only repeat the refrain that recites joys and sorrows. The launch of a Destiny raid is the highlight of the year, with a series of teams all launching at the same time in search of glory, hoping to be the first to finish it and receive the congratulations of Bungie itself. This last event was no different. The activity itself is clearly affected by two years of run-in mechanics. While the lack of explanation and the need to figure out how to work your way to the conclusion persist, it is clear that more experienced players will quickly understand the demands of each area of the mission. Bungie's desire to make the raid less dependent on the success of every single task of the players (a key element of the one present in The Taken King) had the double effect of transforming it into a less frustrating and more immediate activity, but at the same time at the same time extremely faster and painless than we had hoped. Here too, therefore, it is up to each of you to choose which side to take. The objective fact is Bungie's ability to create an activity that is always beautiful from an aesthetic point of view (with some excellences that even surpass the legendary Vault of Glass) and intense in terms of harmony. For the writer, the success of the raid is equivalent to the success of half of an expansion and undoubtedly it is the good half of The Lords of Iron, despite being unique and without a very long future.", "date": "2016-09-27", "grade": "7.5"}
