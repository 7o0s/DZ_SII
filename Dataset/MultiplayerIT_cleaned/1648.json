With such a fanciful setting, a slight hint of plot could not be missing, just to connect the different missions of the campaign, obviously organized in a gradual way to allow you to become familiar with the game mechanics and the structures that you will have to build. Yes, because the success of your missions will largely depend on the structures, productive and otherwise, that will be erected on your island, but let's go in order and let's get into the part first. As a good convict of His Royal Majesty, you took the opportunity to escape as soon as this presented itself in the form of the buxom (er, summer pun, forgive me) Charlotte, with whom you ventured into the forbidden seas escaping a thousand dangers , bla bla ... in short, here you are landed on a remote islet inhabited by a handful of buccaneers, who have kindly offered to help you, and who end up under your command and that of your attractive adventure companion. The only inconvenience: while you had already taken a nice bath with Compagnia dei Caribbean ointments (and after months in prison it is no small feat) and mentally prepared for a night of madness, you discover with great regret that the indomitable beauty (and a bit... OK I'm not saying anything) she left, leaving you with deliveries (but who does she think she is, Geena Davis ?): organizing the island and making it productive for her return (from where we don't know), when together you will set up a real pirate fleet! Wow! Sounds interesting, doesn't it? So let's get to work! The core of the game lies in the island you control and in your ability to make it a place that is both productive, pleasant and peaceful. In fact, starting from a few sparse huts you will have to manage the resources and erect the appropriate structures to start the micro-economy that will allow you to start your pirate business. On the island there are few pirates and a certain number of prisoners who will be destined for work. Your task will essentially be to order the construction of the most suitable buildings allowing certain productions or activities to be started: plantations to feed, refineries to quench thirst, blacksmiths for weapons, brothels and taverns for entertainment and so on. There is also a delicate balance between pirates, who demand leisure and satisfaction, but also order, and prisoners, who want to be less controlled. There are structures used to spread both order and anarchy, and the balance between the two will determine one of the satisfaction factors of the two classes of inhabitants. Watch out, because disgruntled pirates or enraged slaves can be just as dangerous. It will not be possible to directly control the subjects, but only to build the appropriate structures and wait for the workforce to be sorted. At most it will be possible to issue edicts with which to issue general orders or grant benefits to islanders and pirates, such as a forced enlistment among the pirates, or the organization of a festival or more, just to keep the approval threshold of your work at acceptable levels. Boarding! Being a small empire built on piracy, it goes without saying that one of the primary sources of income will be precisely the raids of the vessels that will depart from your docks. Prisoners to put to work (especially to extract metal and work wood) and gold to keep in the chests are your primary needs, and only pirate expeditions will get them for you. But behind each expedition there is careful preparation: the ships must be supplied, the crews must be fed, indulged and enticed with beer, women and entertainment, and on their return they like to find their island all in order and certainly not in the hands of prisoners riotous. Furthermore, missions may end badly, and you will promptly have to rebuild your ships to replace the losses. Once equipped with rations, weapons, cannons and so on, the ship can be directed towards a certain type of mission, whether it is to roam the sea in search of loot, or to attack a land settlement to kidnap specific people (skilled workers for manage advanced buildings) or explore new trade routes. You will also be able to adjust the level of aggression and other factors related to the behavior of the crew, but sadly, any naval action will be left to the AI simulation while you sit on your islet directing production. Upon its return from each voyage, the ship will dock loaded with treasures, weapons and prisoners taken on land or at the expense of other ships, and among them you may also find rich people, whoand they could have great economic value: waiting for the right moment to then issue a ransom decree on a renowned prisoner could yield a nice nest egg, much more than keeping him working in a banana field. The game also includes diplomacy activities, to be managed with care, in order not to alienate naval powers such as Spain or England, which could indeed become excellent trading partners. Letting go of ships flying the flag of one allied nation can add a lot to your coffers, while going too hard with ships of another would only get you a bounty and perhaps an armed invasion of your home. After all, being a pirate is not just a matter of cannon fire The Pirate King? Tropico 2 finds me quite dumbfounded when it comes to making a judgment. Interdicted because if it is true that there was a lack of management software among the more recent titles and that the impact with the setting and atmosphere is decidedly positive, it is also true that the level of challenge of the game leaves something to be desired , and the complexity is not so high as to allow a diversified and personal approach. The buildings are not too numerous, and the inability to directly issue orders to workers and crew is sometimes frustrating. It seems that the essence of the game is to build buildings and watch while the A.I. sorts prisoners and pirates and the economy slowly takes hold. One gets the impression that, wanting to mark a marked detachment from the first episode, where the part of production and trade was preponderant, the developers wanted to make the role of piracy more relevant, but did not fully hit the target, just sketching something that would require more definition. The many statistics that illustrate the conditions of your domain and how to correct any management gaps may initially satisfy you for their completeness, only to discover that we can only indirectly act on them. In other words, there is no feeling of immediate effectiveness of our choices, and this is especially sad considering that the setting is masterfully rendered and with very accurate graphics. It is therefore not a game about pirates, but, as the title itself says, about the pirates' hideout, even if this does not justify the excessive simplicity of the gameplay: in my opinion, the control should have been deepened, especially on ships, and variegate more feasible objectives and strategies - all right, it is a management software after all, but I still find it too limited, while the socio-diplomatic part is certainly more appreciated and stimulated, which manages to give a certain flavor to an otherwise too light to fully satiate. Pros: Ideal for non-hardcore gamers Apt and pleasant soundtrack Good atmospheres and graphics Cons: Not recommended for the most demanding Limited manageability Reduced longevity Pre-summer heat? Don't worry, we set sail for the Caribbean! Hi all, nice day huh? Take a look out the window and tell me: are you hot? You are forced to wander around the house, with the gentle buzz of cicadas piercing walls and doors (the windows are duly open I imagine) to keep you company, dressed in bathing suits  or worse  sweating like country sprinklers and the slightest effort lowers your blood pressure to level tired old lady ? Well, me too. But if you like, I can take you with me to a distant place, where the heat is not as oppressive as in the asphalt jungles, first, because there is a pleasant coastal breeze there, and, second, because at that time there were no asphalt jungles. What place am I talking about? Obviously from the Caribbean, the Caribbean of the 17th century, no man's land, surrounded by pristine seas and beaten league by league by the fearsome pirate galleons! The climate was decidedly more acceptable, and perhaps life was less chaotic, perhaps Certainly not for the one who aspired to become the King of the Pirates  a completely fictitious guy, necessary to justify the existence of a strategic management and, above all, of these hard-earned (in every sense) lines. All this pappardella to introduce the game that I am going to present to you, i.e. Tropico 2  Il Covo dei Pirati, which re-proposes the scenario and game dynamics of its predecessor (Tropico, of course) in a revised and corrected key, bringing back to the screen a genre a little eclipsed, to season that gameplay that children weaned on bread and Sim City have learned to love with a touch of the exotic and adventurous. However, it is not a strategic with epic tones as a film about pirates, or a duel could bewarcraft 2-style naval - quite the opposite: it is precisely a management system, which will put you in front of problems of a not strictly war nature, but rather of the administration of your beautiful island, a den of infamous minions who launch themselves into the open sea to reap booties and slaves to feed your economy, all with a touch of light-heartedness and light-heartedness (the game box talks about ~exhilarating simulation~ but don't pay too much attention to it, they've gone a bit crazy...). I want to immediately point out the care dedicated by the developers to the creation of the environment, beautifully described with clean and precise graphics, with wide scalability. The zoom factor has a very wide range, which allows you to go from a global overview to reading the signs of a single building without loss of detail. Furthermore, with the help of 3D effects everything is more alive and palpable, such as the sea that breaks on the beach with its rhythmic waves. Even the audio sector has a really positive impact, with a very wide range of sound effects (even the prisoners complain in their mother tongue, be it French, English or Spanish!) and some really spot-on background tracks (however there would be some could have stayed longer). In essence, therefore, we have a title on our hands that immediately manages to captivate with its pleasant design and its relaxing music and which is waiting to be played. We just have to go and see the mechanical and management aspects of Tropico 2 up close!", "date": "2003-05-28", "grade": null}
