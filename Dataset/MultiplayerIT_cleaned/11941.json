{"name": "Stuntman: Ignition - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stuntman-ignition-recensione.html", "text": "It's time to whiz around film sets around the world at 1000ph, back to racing with Stuntman Ignition, the new chapter in the THQ saga. This new episode picks up where the last one, which appeared on PlayStation 2, ended. Things have not changed, we will impersonate the usual crazy stuntman who, to satisfy directors even crazier than him, will have to contend with breathtaking rides, explosions and many, many, accidents. The concept of the game is all here. It is about interpreting with our vehicle, be it a motorcycle, a souped-up car or a fire truck, scenes from some films. On the set we will have to follow the instructions of our coordinator to better follow the events and put into practice what the director wants. The scenes are completely scripted and we will have to perform them in the times and with the methods foreseen by the crew, we will not be able to invent almost anything and the unscheduled ones are not foreseen, except to a very limited extent. On-screen indicators, actually not always clear, will guide us along the path by signaling the areas we will have to cross. These yellow arrows will provide us with the information necessary to perform the evolutions, it will be a matter of drifting in curves, jumping on ramps, riding on two wheels, passing through the narrow gap between two vehicles, crawling against a car and literally destroy the next one. In reality, these indicators are not always functional, and unfortunately it has happened to us more than once that we have to redo the scene from the beginning precisely because of an inconspicuous information. To help us in our task, the stunt coordinator will not only follow us along the way, guiding us with verbal indications, which are usually punctual but sometimes late, throwing our choices into crisis, but also before starting the scene, with a briefing focused on the most difficult evolutions. The carreer The Career is the heart of the game, in which we will start from rookies and semi-unknown stuntmen up to being the stars of the first magnitude in the firmament of the craziest pilots in the world. In this mode we will have to put our driving skills at the service of six different registers for as many films, each set is then divided in turn into six different scenes. The introductory films are very well done and in addition to introducing us to the different personalities of the directors, they also introduce us to the different shows, also allowing us to recognize some of them freely inspired by some famous series (who said Hazard?). The difficulty level rises steadily and as the scenes become more complex and long, we will be explained new evolutions to perform, before being able to perform them on the set, however, we will have to overcome them in the test mode which will be unlocked for this very purpose. As we successfully pass the different sessions, our reputation will increase and we will begin to be requested for other jobs as well, for this purpose a further sub-mode has been created in which we will be able to compete by completing commercials for television or shows for the public. When we advance in the levels our test will be judged on the basis of a five-star evaluation, from the single star that identifies the minimum to satisfy the director to the five stars that will literally make the whole crew shout with enthusiasm. If trial and error bores you, you won't like Stuntman: Ignition The carreer We obviously point out that to achieve high scores, four or five stars, we will have to redo the path many times and perform all the events of the single scene to perfection. Timing will be fundamental, knowing the route, the obstacles and the movements of the other cars, for this very reason you will see the countdown that starts the clapperboard an infinite number of times, frustration will sometimes peep out but precisely for this reason the euphoria after the success will be very big. If trial and error is a game pattern that bores you, don't even consider playing Stuntman Ignition; we will have to interact over and over again with the scripted events of the different action scenes and keep in mind that the chances of screwing up a scene are only five, after which we will have to redo the entire sequence from scratch. The involvement in the adventures on the set is high, certainly thanks to the excellent localization and the good dose of irony of which the THQ title is rich. Our performances will unlock some very nice extras, from the possibility of coloring the car (the ~color factory~), to new usable vehicles, to nominations for invented festivals dedicated to the craziest stunts. After completing the series of evolutions requested we will be able to review all the our interpretationnor through the cameras of the ~production~ and the careful lens of the director, exciting replays in which we will be able to recognize our ability and any mistakes or ~unscripted~. Once the six scenes of the film are finished we will also be able to see the trailer of the complete product, recognizing our stunts, obviously enriched by the excellent editing. Technically If Career is the main mode, we cannot fail to mention the alternative offered by the developers, namely the Builder option. Within this choice we will be able to build our arena, materially inserting the obstacles, jumps and buildings to then compete, obtain a score and thus make it classified and playable via Xbox Live by other users. The online mode that is more exploitable, however, is that of the ~Multiscontro~, which allows you to compete together with other stuntmen in the film sets of the game, running together we will have to win by reaching the highest score and it will be possible to ~steal~ the evolutions of the opponents simply by bumping into them . We didn't find many opponents online but the matches turned out to be very entertaining. Technically Stuntman Ignition is certainly not a leading title but in concrete terms the settings are made in a more than discreet way, the scenario is almost completely damageable and the sensation of speed is good. The vehicles were created with equal attention, from classic cars to the most bizarre ones, ending with mega off-road vehicles and large trucks with trailers (towing a missile is not an everyday thing). The explosion system, the particle effects and the blur used to underline the heat of the engines and the fire are certainly to be praised, certainly less valuable is the management of collisions that are not always precise, and more than a few times we have noticed interpenetration of polygons between different objects as well as a bit of aliasing on the asphalt and in certain areas of the scenarios. The driving model of the cars, despite being absolutely arcade, has been carefully created and allows you to perform all the required evolutions without excessive effort. A little less cared for is certainly that of motorcycles, too sensitive in fact leads to excessive stress on the vehicle, making it quite difficult to manage. Goals 360 The 1000 Stuntman Ignition points divided into 50 objectives are not easy to obtain at all. To reach the first 300 we won't have to suffer much, just finish the game and play a few online games. The other 700, on the other hand, require continuous and lasting application, winning challenges on Xbox Live and above all finishing each level with 5 stars are not everyday feats. Comment The THQ title entertained us, thanks to the crazy evolutions, the ease of driving, the excellent Italian adaptation and its irony. Performing the different stunts and pleasing the crazy directors hasn't always been easy and the trial and error formula may not be liked. Redoing each level many times to get a valid score and to continue the career can actually be frustrating, once the goal is reached, however, the satisfaction is maximum. Technically it is certainly not a leading product but overall it is more than decent, with excellent vehicle models and excellent explosions. A game not for everyone, but in our opinion it deserves a chance. Pros Fun and loud Arcade to the core Cons Try and try again Technically not excellent Few users online", "date": "2007-10-11", "grade": null}
