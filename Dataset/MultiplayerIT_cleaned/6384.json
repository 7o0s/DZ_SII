{"name": "Aaru's Awakening", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/148694-aarus-awakening-buongiorno-notte.html", "text": "Mythological creature, a sort of chimera with the body of a monkey and the head of a bird, Aaru is the ~champion of the Dawn~ in a mystical and mysterious world, where four phases of the day are opposed. The kingdom is suddenly shaken by a conflict implemented by the Night, and so Aaru finds himself having to cross four different locations to oppose those who want to break the balance of Lumenox, facing increasingly difficult challenges and trying to survive a disproportionate number of traps. To succeed in the difficult task we will be able to use two peculiar skills: the ability to jerk forward and to teleport. The first of the two powers works like a traditional double jump and allows you not only to reach platforms placed higher than normal, but also and above all to destroy the walls that prevent you from continuing on your way. As far as teleportation is concerned, the character throws a ball of light into the air (charging the shot in a different way, if necessary), aiming with the right analog stick, to then swap places with it and thus be able to cross tunnels and confined spaces, or even eliminate opponents by teleporting into the space they occupy. Will this set of moves be enough to allow us to get to the end of a short but really, really challenging adventure? Aaru's Awakening is a hardcore platformer with a peculiar aesthetic, but short and with several problems Aaruvaje? Aaru's abilities are at the heart of a gameplay that is based on platforms, of course, but which at the same time is characterized by a sequence of ~problems~ to be solved, in an attempt to reach the next checkpoint and proceed to the end of the level. In fact, there are spikes, mobile platforms, heat rays, electric shocks and many other dangers to avoid, often by performing the required maneuvers on the fly, in a complex exercise of dexterity. How else to describe situations where you have to jump into a chasm, launch the teleporter ball upwards a second before hitting the bottom, perform the shift maneuver and finally use the dash to break through a wall that is at the apex of the map? It is a setting in watertight compartments that mainly relies on the ~trial & error~, given that in the more advanced stages it is necessary to memorize the position of the traps and enemies and then execute the moves with the right timing, under penalty of game over and return to the previous checkpoint. Not to mention the bosses, which occur at the end of each area and which really require a great deal of effort, as well as the resolution of some environmental puzzles that can lead us to identify the enemy's weak points. The first three stages serve as an introduction to these mechanics and include a short tutorial aimed at making us familiar with the control system, which uses the DualShock 4's back buttons to jump and sprint (left back) or to launch the ball of light and perform the teleport (right lats, in combination with the relative analog stick for aiming). The console controls are certainly not as precise as on PC, where the teleporter was ~pointed~ via the mouse; but that's not so much the problem of an experience that often turns out to be very frustrating, but rather a series of annoying edges that end up punishing even theoretically correct conduct. We often died because the character got stuck in a wall during a jump, for example, or because the responsiveness of the controls was not up to the required precision. All this must then be placed in the perspective of a campaign that does not last very long (we are about two hours), but which ends up engaging more than necessary precisely because of the large number of attempts accumulated. Playstation 4 trophies The fifteen Trophies present in Aaru's Awakening are based solely on the speed of completing the levels, therefore there are three for each area (bronze, silver and gold) and are obtained precisely by totaling the best possible time. Bastard cardboard The most striking thing about Aaru's Awakening is the graphics, completely hand-drawn, capable of representing a fascinating world and particular characters on the screen. The result is in some ways reminiscent of some independent feature films of European production, and gives the visual component of the game a peculiar aspect, although from this point of view we proceed between ups and downs. In fact, we have not always found the color combinations chosen by the designers to be ideal, which often tend towards acid, and in the same way it seemed to us that the feeling of being in front of a real cartoononly materialize in a few situations; for example when one observes the movement of tentacled creatures with shells, those on which one must lie down to overcome stretches of high, often electrified, water. In many moments the style appears rather anonymous, certainly controversial; however, if the goal was to create something distinctive, able to stand out and stay ahead, then it can certainly be said that it has been achieved. A similar discourse can be made for the sound, incapable of proposing a truly noteworthy accompaniment, but also original and atmospheric, therefore effective in its small way. These are all elements that undoubtedly enrich the Lumenox Games product, but which clearly do not in any way solve the problems we mentioned earlier, which unfortunately end up undermining the enjoyment of the experience and transforming the project into a title of niche, which will be appreciated only by those who really want to compete with a hardcore approach, although often ~unfair~ and full of rough edges.", "date": "2015-04-24", "grade": "6.0"}
