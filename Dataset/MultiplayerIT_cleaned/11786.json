In the case of The Simpsons, we've seen years and years of poor transpositions, with developers too concerned with capturing the spirit of the cartoon to even put any effort into making their games entertaining. With the acquisition of the official license by Electronic Arts, things seem to have changed, at least in part. The Simpsons: The Video Game is a cross-platform product that appears in the same structure on all systems apart from the Nintendo DS. The differentiation, based on obvious technical issues, in this case produces interesting results: the version for the ~major~ consoles, in fact, is characterized by an approximate realization in several respects while boasting a very entertaining and well-written basic story, full of hilarious quotes. Basically On DS, the game is decidedly simpler on a practical level but maintains the same irreverent spirit, which is revealed both in the interlude sequences (made in a classic 3D, with excellent results) and in the actual action. In fact, each stage contains various mockery of the world of video games and therefore exerts a demented visual humour, to which are added not only the jokes in the cutscenes, but also the intervention of the comic book seller whenever the screen is presents one of the clichs of video games. The incipit is really very particular, in fact the starting screen gives us the possibility to select a stage by moving on a map of Springfield, but the first thing we will have to do with is a sort of ~virtual Homer~: the character is lying on the sofa and we can tickle him with the stylus or feed him to increase his sense of satiety and his mood. Sometimes interacting with Homer in this way opens the doors to some levels for us, while in other cases it turns into a fun but only accessory practice. Once we enter a new location, we will generally have to manage two characters from the Simpson family, taking turns in controlling them as we progress and the scenario requires the skills of one or the other. The various Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart and Maggie in fact possess peculiar abilities, ranging from literally transforming themselves into a ball to convincing others to lend a hand, from moving objects with the power of thought to shooting grappling hooks to access areas inaccessible. Pair match Usually the stages that have Bart and Homer as protagonists have the classic structure of a platformer, while when Marge comes into play the action is transformed in an evident way: the character can move in three dimensions as if it were a scrolling fighting game , but you must use the stylus to command your ~henchmen~ immediately after summoning them with the persuasion special ability. In this case it almost seems to be faced with a real-time strategy, given that you can order the followers to attack enemies for us by touching the first and then the seconds on the touchscreen. Whatever the structure of the moment, each character has a more or less effective attack combo available, and in Bart's case you can also launch projectiles of various types with the slingshot. Unfortunately, the combat system does not appear very successful, often eliminating an opponent results in the loss of some energy and one feels the lack of alternative solutions, even of a classic nature (a big jump on the head?). In any case, the game is never frustrating: when our energy runs out, we will be able to restart from the last checkpoint without problems. Ultimately, the result is a very simple and fairly linear structure, but which manages to entertain and does not suffer from particular problems. Technical realization It is clear that the Nintendo DS version of The Simpsons: The Video Game is very different from what we saw, for example, on Xbox 360. This is not a bad thing, far from it: trying to reproduce graphics of that type on the laptop from the dual screen would have proved to be a bankruptcy operation, and so a radical change is welcome that makes everything much simpler and more essential, but really well done: characters, animations, locations... everything was done very faithfully to the cartoon, with good fluidity. The upper screen extends the action vertically and therefore is an active part of the experience, while the sound sector is characterized by a huge amount of speech, good effects and some nice music. Control is via d-pad and the main buttons, but on more than one occasion you have to use the stylus at the same time. The thing, however, does not cause who knows what inconvenience and in the end everything flows yessmoothly. Comment This new Simpsons tie-in manages to capture the spirit of the series. It is a simple and fun game, characterized by a good technical realization but above all by a base of excellent humour. We are not dealing with a masterpiece, that's for sure, but the steps forward made at the hands of Electronic Arts are undeniable: by continuing like this, the Simpsons video games could really make the leap in quality and aspire to important positions in the panorama of transpositions. The Nintendo DS version takes advantage of the console's features adequately, often using the touch screen to manage some special skills; and only sins in excessive simplicity, which leads the various stages to flow away quickly and smoothly. Pros: Very faithful to the cartoon Very rich sound Playable and fun Cons: Too easy Poor combat system Action varies, but not too much", "date": "2007-11-28", "grade": null}
