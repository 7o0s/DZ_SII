{"name": "Passione su pista targata Milestone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/passione-su-pista-targata-milestone.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360After the consecration with the titles of the Superbike series for PC, Milestone returned to dealing with officially licensed motorcycle racers only in 2007. One could even speak of a monopoly, in fact, given that for the third consecutive year the software house italiana deals with both the SBK series and the MotoGP series, providing two-wheel racing enthusiasts with a complete scenario from every point of view; furthermore enriched by the official nature and therefore by the presence of the teams, motorbikes and riders that we have the opportunity to actually see competing during the competitive season. For SBK 09: Superbike World Championship the basic concepts are always the same: gameplay highly adaptable to the needs of the player, solid structure typical of the most accurate simulations and technical realization up to the situation. What more could an enthusiast want? An online multiplayer mode with single races and full leagues, perhaps with the option to play as a team? Well, there's that too. The pleasure of the challenge The Challenge mode is nothing new for the SBK series: it is a set of skill tests divided into ~time~, ~special~ and ~scenario~. Time-based Trials are completed by riding part of a given track within a time limit, with increasing difficulty; the ~special~ ones involve the execution of stunts of various kinds; finally, the ~scenarios~ are based on actual races and our goal is to resolve each situation proposed in the best possible way. All challenges can be completed by earning a bronze, silver or gold medal, depending on the goodness of our performance. When I grow up I want Tetsuya Tsurugi's motorcycle After the usual introductory sequence, spectacular and well edited, we are faced with a truly special start screen: a fully polygonal cross-section of the paddock, in which it is possible to see a rider and his bike, one of the many ~umbrella girls~ nearby and even an Alfa Romeo Mito on display. In the lower part of the screen, the available modes scroll: Quick Race, Training, Race Weekend, Championship and Challenges. Before choosing one, however, it is advisable to take a look at the options, which in fact determine how we will enjoy the experience. As in Milestone's previous works, in fact, SBK 09 allows us to choose the driving style we prefer between arcade, intermediate and simulation, with substantial differences that can be observed on the track from the first corner. The arcade style allows us to brake without worrying about the wheel on which the device acts, face the curves with great tranquility and give gas immediately without the bike getting out of our control. From intermediate to simulation, on the other hand, the situation changes radically: you have to control the front and rear brakes individually, pay close attention to grip and above all dose acceleration at all times. In practice, conducting a race without any help translates into a complex experience, full of facets, which requires commitment and attention at all times and which transforms even a moment of distraction into a spectacular accident. This time, moreover, crashing will produce visible damage to the bike, both in terms of aesthetics and behavior on the road: better to avoid... Multiplayer and surroundings As mentioned at the beginning, SBK 09 has an online multiplayer mode via Xbox Live that allows us to play quick races or to participate in championships individually or as part of a team, therefore with the aim of making our team win the trophy of the builders. In any case you can decide the level of difficulty of the ride and the degree of realism. These modes represent a very valuable extra to the game, since they are in fact an ~arcade~ alternative to the rigid structure of the single player championship. We were able to play a few games online and the system proved to be solid and well studied, without any problems and with many fans already ready to do battle. Anyone remember Street Hawk? The heart of the game is the Championship mode, which sees us select a real team and driver and then tackle all the season's races in sequence. It's not simply a question of taking to the track and catching up with the other riders, as racing simulation enthusiasts know very well: each event is divided into free practice sessions, warm-ups, qualifying and only finally the actual race. The best approach is to test the circuit for a few laps, memorizing the bends and planning a strategy regarding the trajectoriesand to follow, then test the best setup both for the qualifying stages and for the race. At this juncture, SBK 09 is probably the bike racing game with the largest number of adjustments possible: any component of the bike can be modified at will, and these changes translate into different behavior on the track. The more savvy will be able to really indulge themselves by dedicating themselves to the art of tuning, while the less patient will have the opportunity to contact the team engineer to ask him to automatically apply the best settings from time to time. Similarly, you can press the Y button to completely skip a stage and move on to the next. If desired, it is even possible to take to the track without qualifying, starting last in the arduous attempt to reach the head of the group in time for the finish line. Reaching the podium means not only earning precious points for the championship, but also attending the prize-giving scene, discreetly staged. Xbox 360 goals There are forty-nine objectives that can be unlocked with SBK 09, with values ranging from 10 to 40 G. The more ~heavy~ ones are clearly obtained by completing the championship mode, even more than once, while for the minor objectives you have to stand out for skill and precision inside of the races: leading a race by leaving your opponents behind by at least ten seconds, crossing the finish line without ever falling, spending a certain number of seconds drifting and so on. Technical realization There are certain aspects of the graphics in SBK 09: Superbike World Championship that you really have to tip your hat to. In the first place, the lighting system manages to literally transform the panorama according to the weather situation: when it rains the colors are dull and gray, the drops wet the virtual camera with a truly realistic effect and the motorbikes raise splashes of water more or less full-bodied depending on the speed; with the sun, on the other hand, the scenery takes on full and lively hues, it almost seems to be in another place and the puddles that still invade the track produce beautiful reflection effects ~ la PGR4~. Needless to talk about the bikes, since they are now close to perfection and can boast the added value of visible damage following falls. The textures are extremely defined and the frame rate never seems to give in to uncertainties, maintaining a certain fluidity even in the most get excited. What is missing, unfortunately, is once again the ~outline~: on the edges of the track of an official circuit one certainly does not expect to find people or small shops, but a desolate background is never nice to see and the areas where one finds the audience sounding a little stretched out, without much detail and without ~real~ people. The songs that accompany our competitions range from rock to techno, satisfying everyone a little but without surprising, while the effects are as usual realistic and of sufficient ~impact~.", "date": "2009-05-29", "grade": "7.5"}
