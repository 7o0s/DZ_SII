{"name": "Il Padrino (The Godfather) - recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-padrino-the-godfather-recensione.html", "text": "Honour men As you can imagine, in this video game you don't have to retrace the events of the film step by step, which is so dear to cinema enthusiasts, but you go along a parallel path which very often, however, intertwines and if necessary even manages to modify slightly the original succession of events, proposing a very high number of characters, places and situations seen in the film. The idea of seeing, or rather ~living~ many scenes of the film from a different perspective, taking part in them personally, represents for fans of the Ford Coppola saga on paper a real event, but as we will see later, from narrative point of view the realization is not always exciting. It all begins with an antecedent that takes place several years before the actual start of the game, when some thugs from the Barzini mafia family kill a collaborator of Don Vito Corleone by beating him to death in an alley after blowing up his bakery Italian. Honour men Witnessing the scene are his wife and little Aldo, their son. The part played begins when, after nine years, Aldo's mother takes advantage of Connie Corleone's marriage (precisely the one in the famous scene from the film) to ask the Godfather to help her son, entangled in the affairs of a ramshackle gang of delinquents. Don Vito does not deny the favor, and sends for the boy to none other than Luca Brasi, one of his best men. After a brief tutorial, the energetic recruits Aldo into the Corleone family, effectively starting his long career in organized crime. At the beginning of the game the user can choose whether to take on the role of Aldo as proposed by Electronic Arts or customize him as he likes in name and appearance thanks to ~Mobface~, which is none other than the character editor already seen in the latest Tiger Woods, expertly transported and adapted in ~The Godfather~ to allow the creation of Italian-American characters with all the trimmings. Game structure In ~The Godfather~ the ultimate goal is to become the undisputed boss of New York, controlling the underworld of the city and prevailing over all the rival families (or rather families) who occupy the five territories in which it is divided the metropolis. From a special menu you can constantly monitor the progress made, check the level of importance and the respect you enjoy. It is useless to deny that the game is very inspired by the GTA saga, from which it largely borrows all the fundamental characteristics. Like the successful Rockstar Games series, The Godfather boasts a large play area with densely populated city areas, full of shops and infested with traffic, the possibility of beating up anyone and stealing cars. After a rather linear beginning, mainly due to the tutorial, the now canonical possibility appears to concentrate on the main missions that carry the story forward or to devote oneself to the various ~side-quests~, assigned by guys who occasionally meet on the street, which further enrich the eventful life of the underworld. One of the focal points of the secondary missions is extortion: with a proven mechanism borrowed from years and years of organized crime, EA allows the player to intimidate New York shopkeepers in order to get paid the famous ~pizzo~. Game structure The methods to bend the will of the shopkeepers can be different, ranging from destroying the furniture and tools in the shop to scaring the customers, up to more extreme actions such as beating or shooting the owner himself. Each shopkeeper has his own weak point among these listed above, and it is up to the player to find the fastest method to obtain payment of the protection money from time to time. Once you have taken control of a shop, in addition to having a periodic insured sum of money, the back door opens automatically which allows access to premises where a clandestine activity is carried out (for example gambling). These illegal activities can be fully ~detected~ using the same methods used for the store. Even more fun is definitively defeating one of the mafia families, sometimes a real feat that requires a considerable dose of commitment. The main missions, on the other hand, are almost always intertwined with the plot of the film, and as mentioned at the beginning, they allow the player to experience those situations that many times have only been able to watch passively in front of the TV at home (even the delivery of the horse's head to the director of Hollywood and the protection of the Don during the dhospital emergency). Unfortunately, at the narrative level, something is wrong, and the player's insertion in these well-known scenes is not made to work as it should. It ends in crap! One of the things that do not fully convince of ~The Godfather~ is certainly the control system, which especially in the PC version seems too cumbersome and not very intuitive, making the learning curve steeper than necessary. Things improve in the console versions, but the feeling of not finding the right command at the right time is still present, at least for the first few hours of the game. In the PC version it is possible to simulate the analog controls of a joypad by assigning the attack functions to the mouse, but this practice turns out to be even more uncomfortable and, in certain circumstances, even grotesque (imagine a guy who moves I keep the mouse back and forth). Artificial intelligence is not surprising but it does its job worthily, and if this is not immediately noticeable in the virtual inhabitants of New York, who are often a little too ~sleeping~ and are unable to show off articulated dialogues, the music changes for the enemies, made rather reactive to any type of threat, moderately cautious in the bloodiest firefights and, above all, ruthless when they see a hint of weakness in the player. As you progress through the game, you'll encounter really hard-to-kill mobsters, for whom you'll need to have mastered the semi-manual aiming system properly. The driving missions, very numerous and of great importance in the GTA saga, are somewhat scaled down in the Electronic Arts title, and this is not necessarily a bad thing since the highly simplified car physics could in the long run make driving boring for the pilots more savvy. The game, as a whole, is still quite exciting, fun and undoubtedly long-lived. Graphics and sound From a graphic point of view, The Godfather is not a jaw-dropping game, quite the contrary. The screenshots released for the Xbox 360 version also had the owners of the other platforms a bit deluded, who instead find themselves a title with not exactly extraordinary graphics. The characters, at least the main ones, are well made and fairly convincing, with good animations and a sufficient set of facial expressions. The environments are much less satisfying, and above all the exteriors in the city are dull, monotonous and repetitive. The music does its job, but apart from the famous original ~theme~ of ~The Godfather~, the added ones do not stand out for their particular beauty. The Italian dubbing is close to levels of excellence, re-proposing some of the voice actors who worked on the film, primarily that of Marlon Brando. The most ardent fans of the saga could opt for the English-language version, which can boast none other than the participation of Brando himself, who recorded the dubbing sessions before his death, to interpret Don Vito again after 30 years Lionheart. Other actors in the film also lent their voices to the digital characters again, but unfortunately there is the serious flaw given by the absence of Al Pacino, who, not having granted the rights to EA, forced the programmers to create the character of Michael Corleone anonymously, devoid of resemblance both visually and vocally. Cross-platform As already anticipated, ~The Godfather~ gives its best in the PC version, but it is also true that by making the necessary proportions it is precisely on this platform that the graphics leave a bad taste in the mouth the most. Of the two console versions, the Xbox one is the best, while the PS2 version has the most obvious clipping problems and poorly defined textures. The Godfather is undoubtedly a long-lived and fun game, which however fails to prevail over the greatest exponents of its category and discovers the side of various structural deficiencies. The technical realization, the imperfect narration and some small design defects do not allow the Electronic Arts game to obtain a judgment aligned with the goodness of the extraordinary work from which it is inspired. Strongly recommended to all fans of the film saga, who are however warned: some shortcomings could leave a small dose of bitterness in the mouth. which leads It is known that in the gaming industry tie-ins are historically accompanied by a high rate of skepticism, and this is justified by the fact that often and willingly the software houses only aim to churn out mediocre games that can exploit the image of the work from which it hasno origin. And if the work in question is ~The Godfather~, a film considered among the best in the history of cinema, doubts and expectations increase exponentially. Will Electronic Arts have managed to pack a game worthy of the masterpiece by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo? Let's go find out.", "date": "2006-03-30", "grade": null}
