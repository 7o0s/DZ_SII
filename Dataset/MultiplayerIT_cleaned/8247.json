An appointment that is sometimes successful, sometimes a little less so, but always irresistible. Worms games aren't for everyone, be warned. Hybrids a little action and a little strategic with a sprinkling of platform and lots and lots of irony, Worms must be taken in the right spirit: it takes patience, focus, and quite a bit of skill to master every map, weapon, or situation, and fans know this well. The franchise, however, has remained mostly crystallized in its original form for all these years, never offering anything drastically different from any previous iteration, save when it moved to 3D with frankly questionable results. On the occasion of this very special anniversary, Team 17 has decided to change the cards a bit: will they really succeed? Inglorious worms The first thing that catches the eye, to a veteran of the series, is the brand new cosmetics: Team 17 has actually returned to 3D, but only pretending. Worms Revolution uses a fully polygonal engine, but the action is always shot from the side, as if the game were two-dimensional for all intents and purposes. The result is decidedly pleasant: the polygonal models of the worms, however simple, are colored and animated very well and each map has numerous details, starting with the animated backgrounds. The sensation is in fact that of being faced with a new generation Worms without however distancing oneself from a tested and, indeed, necessary setting. The camera that shoots the map must always allow us to have a quick and precise idea of what is happening, allowing us to analyze the map in a few moments and without struggling with all the variables linked to three-dimensional space. The step back in the middle of Team 17 therefore seemed quite right to us: there are no risks or innovations in this approach, but the more sophisticated graphics certainly play their part. The whole game, moreover, is sarcastically commented by the funny voice of the British Matt Berry (The IT Crowd) who never misses an opportunity to underline the absurdity of our actions, especially during the Campaign: don't expect a real plot, mind you, how varied dozens of missions that will often strain your nerves thanks to the supernatural and ill-timed precision of the artificial intelligence and the intricate, ingenious complexity of some maps. The Puzzle mode is instead a solid addition for solitary players, who will be able to try their hand at a series of challenges in which it is necessary to use the environment wisely and the few objects available to achieve some particular objectives. Among other things, the game has the bad flaw of explaining very little of its mechanics, as if it were mainly aimed at veterans of the franchise: mostly it will be necessary to explore the appropriate guide in the options menu, rather than relying on the narrow tutorial, but the more refined tactics will only be learned through advice in the advanced missions of the Puzzle mode. The good, the worm and the bad Worms Revolution naturally shines in the multiplayer mode, which offers an unprecedented possibility of customization of the matches. Virtually any parameter can be altered, from physics to the number of objects in the field, passing through the consumption of individual objects or the frequency of certain circumstances. In short, you can create the match of your dreams. Moreover, it is possible to challenge up to a maximum of three players online in three different game modes in customized and ranked matches. Add to that a map editor, and you certainly can't complain about the content. Otherwise, Worms Revolution is played like any other Worms, with some exceptions. Your aim will once again be to eliminate the opposing team using weapons and the environment during your turns, but this time you will have to manage four different types of worms. We're not sure whether the introduction of a class system has benefited the franchise, but it certainly made a mechanic that seemed to have nothing more to say a little more interesting. The Brute, the Explorer and the Scientist are now added to the traditional worm, or Soldier. The first is a bigger and tougher version of the Soldier, but also slower and bulkier; the Ranger is a fast but vulnerable worm, well-suited to hit-and-run tactics; finally, the last class allows you to regenerate a little energy at each turn and is more effective when using technological weapons. Learning to handle each class properly is the key to the new Worms, but some of them don't quite have itand convinced, the Brutus in particular. The emphasis placed on the new ~physics~ that characterizes some environmental elements, which can be manipulated at will through some gadgets such as the UFO or Telekinesis, is not too convincing either: in theory it is possible to use them to hinder enemies or cause chain destruction, in practice, however, the control is quite uncomfortable and imprecise, so much so that they are rarely used. The same concept applies to the other main feature of this edition, even present in the game logo: water. More similar to jelly than water, in truth, this fluid is no longer present only on the bottom of the map, certain death for those who fall into it, but also accumulates in strategic positions on the map itself, ready to be manipulated by the player through gadgets or clever modifications of the environment itself to drag enemies away, injure them or literally drown them. This addition with a not indifferent strategic charm is actually extremely difficult to manage and does not seem to behave in a really realistic way: better to resort to the classic mines and firearms or, why not, to explosive grannies and other crazy gadgets. After all, who would want to play Worms without shooting a kamikaze sheep at least once a game?", "date": "2012-10-19", "grade": "7.7"}
