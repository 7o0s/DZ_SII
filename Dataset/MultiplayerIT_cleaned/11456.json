Having held the official license of the popular car competition for several years now, we expected a significant qualitative leap, also because the developers themselves had promised a significant gap compared to the past. Reluctantly, however, we already have to tell you that we were left with a bitter taste after several hours spent in the gravel, mud and snow in the splendid locations that host the WRC championship. Unfortunately WRC 10 can be considered a simple expansion of the previous chapter with some welcome additions and rare technical improvements, rather than a new title capable of rekindling the interest of fans and countering the fierce competition. We don't want to anticipate everything already in the introduction, so before our final verdict we want to tell you what the developers have done for WRC 10 and what was absolutely missing in this new chapter of the series. Discover with us the news, improvements and problems in the review of WRC 10, the official video game of the World Rally Championship. 50 years of WRC The main screen of the mode dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the WRC This year the World Rally Championship celebrated its 50th birthday. The developers have therefore decided to seize the opportunity to implement a new game mode dedicated to this anniversary within their creation. The central idea is to revive the most iconic rallies in the locations that have marked the history of this sport. For example, we will be able to go back in time and re-task the San Remo test of '81, or the very difficult Safari Rally of '83. Overall we will find 7 tracks, specially recreated in this mode dedicated to the 50th anniversary for a total of 19 single events. Of course, the most iconic cars of the rally such as the legendary Lancia Delta or the Audi Quattro A1 could not be missing either, all made with care compared to their real counterparts. In total, the fleet of historic cars has 20 models belonging to different eras of motor racing with the most popular brands such as Alpine, Audi, Ford, Mitsubishi, Subaru and Toyota. Try again some of the most famous rallies of the past aboard the classic monsters that have forged several generations of followers has left us with an absolutely positive feeling. The nostalgia of seeing old cars again, the official names of the teams and above all the historic tracks has warmed our hearts as enthusiasts. However, since this is the real novelty of WRC 10, the developers could dare something more and add other historical stages of the past to better retrace the whole story. What's in WRC 10 Preparation for the start in the WRC 10 rally in Sweden One of the most important qualities of WRC 10 is undoubtedly its fleet. Overall, the cars of 52 different teams belonging to the official WRC, WRC 2, WRC 3 and WRC Junior championships have been recreated with absolute fidelity. The polygonal models, liveries and interior details of the cars featured in WRC 10 are truly rewarded for their meticulous construction. To these are added the 20 cars of the mode dedicated to the 50th anniversary already mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even the latter have an excellent level of detail, especially appreciated by longtime enthusiasts. The 2021 WRC championship this year was hosted in four unpublished countries for the videogame series. The new locations implemented are located in Croatia, Estonia, Catalunya and Belgium. In total there will therefore be 12 countries in which we will be able to travel to the stages of the official championship. However, some stages of the real season are missing (some not even competing in the real counterpart due to the restrictions due to COVID. The absence of other locations such as Greece made us turn up our noses a bit. The game modes featured in WRC 10 In WRC 10 we can test our driving skills in different game modes. The classic Season will allow us to face the WRC championship aboard our racing car, having to worry exclusively about giving our best on the difficult terrains of the various locations. In Career mode, however, the creation and subsequent management of our team will also take over. For those who are also passionate about Formula 1, the Career mode of WRC 10 can be compared to My Team of F1 2021. Then there are the events of the past made forr the 50th anniversary and the evergreen Quick Play mode. The developers will also constantly offer gamers new daily and weekly challenges to always offer new incentives to return to the title and demonstrate how good we are behind the wheel. Of course, there are also online rankings to be able to compare yourself with other players. The multiplayer mode, on the other hand, is characterized by the possibility of creating or joining online leagues with other players. You can also compete in simple quick matches or via local split screen. Gameplay Screenshot during WRC 10 gameplay captured on PC Once we have sifted through all the game menus and the related contents present, we dusted off our trusty steering wheel and pedals to get on the WRC cars looking for the maximum possible realism. Even trying several hours to hack through the various force feedback options and other parameters related to this game peripheral, we were not able to get the desired result. Unfortunately, the sensation of driving the steering wheel is not pleasant, on the contrary it is rather detached and superficial. It lacks the power, the feeling of friction of the tires and the responsiveness of the front end in certain situations. In short, the feeling is more similar to an arcade video game than a simulation title, which will undoubtedly make a certain more hardcore user turn up their noses. Trying out the gameplay of WRC 10 by holding the classic pad we found much better sensations. The work done by the development team has clearly been concentrated on this control system to offer an extremely enjoyable experience for those who do not have a specific driving system. With the pad you can perceive our rally car much better, anticipate certain movements, manage drifts and in general you have a more solid and natural felling. The experience with the Playstation 5 Dualsense was also positive, which offers excellent feedback with the adaptive triggers for the accelerator and brake as well as a different haptic feedback for each type of surface on which we are going to run. Historic cars featured in WRC 10 Going into more detail, the developers said they had revised the physical engine of their creature, going to adjust the behavior of the suspension, aerodynamics, turbo and brakes. This was supposed to lead to a more advanced driving model that changes radically depending on the type of terrain. During our test, however, we did not find any radical changes compared to WRC 9, as we would have expected from this chapter that also arrived on the new generation consoles. The driving model is rather arcadey and the response of the cars on certain surfaces (for example on asphalt) did not seem realistic to us. However, it remains a sufficiently complex title for novices who have to get used to the behavior of rally cars in order to be able to express maximum speed (or alternatively activate the numerous aids present). However, we have to admit that we enjoyed whizzing along the difficult courses of the World Rally Championship, trying to give our best in every corner and thus deceive the stopwatch to set the best time. With the pad, the difficulty seemed well balanced even without aids, providing us with positive feedback. Too bad that for those who want to go further and move on to a more simulative level with the use of the steering wheel, they cannot enjoy the same quality. Technical compartment Rally in Kenya aboard the WRC 2021 machine The arrival on the new generation consoles and the promises made by the developers have made us anticipate a superior experience from a technical point of view. Unfortunately, however, the graphic sector of WRC 10 does not excel at all. The now historic pop-up problems remain even at short distances and tearing unfortunately partially ruins the experience in more complex situations. The sensation of speed is not perceived well and ruins the driving experience a bit by increasing its difficulty. The damage system remains almost unchanged compared to the last edition of the WRC video game, therefore rather basic both physically and visually. Even from the textures and in general from the trees, bushes, rocks and other elements that make up the various locations, we expected something more, especially on Playstation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. However, we must reward the cars present, truly made with greater care than the rest with the original liveries and all the official sponsors. The implementation of the reflections with ray tracing is also good, which is mainly noticeable in the puddles of the track, particularly realistic at night when they are illuminatedfrom car headlights. The sound effects, on the other hand, disappointed us for their flatness and lack of variety between the cars. While playing the title exclusively with good headphones, the audio didn't give us the hoped-for sense of immersion in the slightest. The cars produce very similar noises, just as it is not possible to perceive significant differences between the various terrains on which we are going to whiz.", "date": "2021-09-03", "grade": "7.0"}
