{"name": "Dark Souls: Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/199612-dark-souls-remastered-dark-souls-remastered-la-recensione.html", "text": "As we have had the opportunity to write in previous articles, Dark Souls was probably one of the most important games of the last generation, in particular because it was able to reintroduce a form of game design that had disappeared for a long time, applying it to the field of action- RPG and giving birth to a new sub-genre. At a time when video game production is largely oriented towards titles that tend to offer a more guided and cinematic gaming experience, often to the detriment of the mechanics, Dark Souls still represents a real exception today, with its gameplay ~hard~ and without frills, one of the most successful level design and an online multiplayer compartment that is an integral part of the main adventure. From Software now brings it back to us after a few years in a version adapted for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One which, we say it immediately, improves fluidity but does not offer striking news in terms of content and technical compared to the original edition, aiming for almost everything about the beautiful atmosphere and gameplay. This, perhaps, will disappoint those fans who expected something more from this remastered, but will make happy those who instead only wished for a certain stability of the frame rate and therefore to find the beating heart of the experience intact from every point of view. Playstation 4 trophies The game offers 41 Trophies, of which 17 are hidden, divided into 18 Bronze, 20 Silver, 2 Gold and 1 Platinum. To get them you have to progress in the adventure, embracing Patti, acquiring the best weapons, eliminating certain bosses or bringing spells to the maximum level. Try, die, learn Since practically every player knows the game or has had the opportunity to deal with some other souls-like with similar characteristics, we don't want to bore you with a useless and detailed description of the game. Therefore in this review we will limit ourselves to summarizing style and plot as much as possible, then focusing on the novelties offered by Dark Souls: Remastered. As far as gameplay is concerned, the work by Miyazaki and From Software offers, as always, a level of challenge calibrated upwards, and rewards those who have patience, those who study the routes, the statistics, the behavioral routines of the enemies and even some bug to defend and attack with the right timing, and not who starts throws in stays. Trying multiple times, dying repeatedly, and starting over until you can clear an obstacle are the basics of the gameplay. The correct way to learn how to survive in a world with one of the brightest complex maps ever created, and aggressive and very dangerous enemies. Punishment and pleasure, all often concentrated in an instant, what separates yet another death against a boss, from the intoxicating satisfaction of having finally eliminated him. A concept, an idea of the game expressed through gameplay for some perhaps repetitive and even boring, certainly not without its flaws, but also complex and well structured. From this point of view in Dark Souls: Remastered the gameplay has remained almost unchanged, with all its pros and cons. In fact, if you didn't like it seven years ago, you won't start liking it now, even if everything is smoother now thanks to 60 frames per second. The controls thus feel a little more responsive, but less than one might expect, especially when compared to those of the more recent Dark Souls III. The character, in fact, responds well to commands, but remains wooden in movements and actions, also due to obsolete and outdated animations. Death flows on the net To look for some more ~substantial~ news in Dark Souls: Remastered you have to look at the online sector. The main structure remains the same, but dedicated servers have been implemented to stabilize the game over the internet, the option for six players to play simultaneously (the maximum was four in the original), and a password system similar to that of Dark Souls III to facilitate the participation of online friends. In practice, everyone can summon them as ~ghosts~ in their own world by sharing an access key with them, and host them even if they are of a higher level. The strongest characters, in fact, will see their parameters resized and adapted to those of lower level players only for that game session. For the rest, a series of small tweaks complete the offer, such as for example fewer Estus flasks in PvP for the ~ghosts~, or the Arena mode for three-on-three deathmatch challenges. During our tests we didn't encounter any major problems, apart from a disconnection, some sporadic lag and... some opponents who abused ~backstab chaining~ (attacks rrepeats from behind) and ~reverse roll~. However, here we enter another field of discussion, the one linked to game mechanics that some users do not like, considering them subtle and necessary for tweaks to better balance the action, while others appreciate them because from their point of view they are moves related to skill of the more experienced players. Anyway, going back to our experience with the game online, it was positive, it being understood that during the tests the number of connected users was limited. Still on the subject of new content, we find other innovations in the technological sector, where there are some improvements in terms of image cleanliness and general fluidity. The game, in fact, on the console that we used for this review, i.e. PlayStation 4, runs at 1080p and, as written before, at 60 frames per second even in the most chaotic situations, including in the sadly famous Infamous City which in the original showed scary drops. It could have been done better From a graphic point of view, however, the ~old gen~ matrix of the project remains intact, revealed in the evident limits in the rendering of certain textures, in the backward three-dimensional models and in the definition of some surrounding elements. It's true that we can't expect miracles from these remastered editions, but we have the feeling that From Software has been a bit lazy, as it could have done a little more to embellish the game. On balance, the software house limited itself to transferring the material of the PlayStation 3-Xbox 360 version to the new consoles, saturating the colors, which makes the exploration of some dark areas annoying, and only improving effects, lights and shadows . Despite this, Dark Souls: Remastered manages to stand visually on a remarkable artistic direction and on the excellent design of enemies and settings. His world, gloomy like that of certain black fairy tales, is as always fascinating, capable of still offering truly suggestive glimpses despite the years and the imperfect restyling. Thanks to a well-chosen sound sector, which helps to make that feeling of magic more oppressive, but also of isolation, abandonment, terror and danger experienced by the player during the adventure, step by step, breath after breath. A fantasy universe beautifully ~described~ also through images, with a cryptic but decidedly fascinating historical background, waiting to be discovered. Understanding every facet of the plot requires a lot of patience and attention from the player, prompting him to search for information within stories and situations that may seem confused and generic to the most casual eyes. The ~historical~ identity of the various settings, of the characters encountered and of the objects recovered, must in fact be understood by the gamer after having deciphered it from the clues collected and put together, piece by piece, like in a huge puzzle. Fragments which also include the contents of the Artorias of the Abyss DLC, included in this Dark Souls: Remastered, at the time of release acclaimed by critics as it was considered even more cryptic and bad than the base game, as well as able to shed light on many of the events of the main campaign.", "date": "2018-05-23", "grade": "8.0"}
