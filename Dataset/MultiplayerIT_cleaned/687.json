An instant wake-up call to what sports titles will be like on Xbox 360 and more generally on the next generation of consoles.~ These are the first comments of our correspondent at X05 after the meeting with the EA title, we confirm everything, the first moments are shocking, heart pounding, almost incredible. But let's go in order, once we enter the virtual gym we can call the main menu with the start button or the quick one via the d-pad. The choice will be almost immediate between a quick game, starting a season or entering the online world of Xbox Live. By choosing to start a quick match we will be able to continue, as anticipated above, shooting for baskets with our athlete until the end of the loading when we will see him dematerialize and leave the scene, we will then be projected into one of the great NBA arenas. The presentation is excellent, with the camera rotating, framing the arena, the audience and then focusing on the athletes entering the field. NBA Live 06 can easily be defined as the first true next generation basketball, the visual impact is shocking, one seriously doubts whether one is watching a real game, a quick check on the remote control and we will realize that it is all true, it is the game, it's the NBA on our console. NBA Live 06 can easily be defined as the very first next generation basketball A slap in the face The care in reproducing the details of each individual basketball player is obsessive, they are faithfully reproduced in every detail, not only in the faces but also in the tattoos and in the length of the beard, the shirts finally move following the movement of the body in a natural way. The textures of the athletes' skin are incredibly defined, even if a little too shiny, and if the players are initially ~dry~ after a few minutes the first droplets of sweat will appear. Let's not forget the audience, entirely polygonal and dynamic, following the action, exulting in the event of a positive outcome and murmuring in the event of a trivial failure. On high definition televisions it seems to see a product a couple of generations ahead of what we were used to, on normal televisions this impression changes slightly, but it is clear that we are dealing with a game like we have never seen before, at least since graphic point of view. Then starting to play, unfortunately, problems arise, one realizes that all the care placed in the graphic layout has not been re-proposed also in the animations, which are often woody and not very fluid, above all they do not seem connected to each other, the impression of being running is missing or watching a single continuous movement, while suddenly switching from one movement to another. The only notable exceptions are the very fluid and spectacular reverse dunk animations. The frame rate is uncertain and almost never manages to remain stable, annoying the player with small ~jerks~ of the image especially when playing at 720p. The changes, however, although evident, do not completely ruin the gaming experience which remains enjoyable. Gameplay 06 or 05? After the long, however due, technical analysis, let's talk about the gameplay. From the first games it is clear that the programmers, in order to be able to get the game out at the launch of Xbox 360, preferred to leave the game system derived from the previous version of NBA Live almost intact, dedicating themselves exclusively to the new graphics engine. The controls have remained almost unchanged compared to NBA Live 05 with a button for shooting, one for dunking the basket and the right analog used for freestyle control. Fortunately, the developers have made freestyle moves less fundamental, it is not so easy to dribble past your opponent and coast to coast requires great skill and a good dose of luck. It is better to prefer reasoned actions, quickly calling the schemes with the d-pad, circulating the ball and finally finding the free man for the winning two or three points. The artificial intelligence performs quite well in the offensive phases, and proves to be more developed than in the previous chapters of the Electronic Arts title. Instead, it is another matter as regards the defensive phase, in which the CPU that drives our men often acts late, terribly suffering from the opponent's moves, and incredibly even the defensive rebounds are much more ~difficult~ to obtain and we will often find ourselves cursing for our sleeping teammate who got ~cut out~ by the opponent under the basket. It is evident that the programmers, have left the game system derived from the previous version of NBA Live almost intact Gameplay 06 or 05? NBA Live 06 includes, as always, a myriad of statistics with all the official data provided by the NBA league and in this respect it proves to be the best exponent of basketball played on consoles. It is also possible to download the updated roosters from Xbox Live, choose whether to play with the default teams or change the settings following the market movements that take place during the year. The main modes of the game are create a player, start a season and online modes on Xbox Live, there's nothing else and unfortunately no mode has been included that allows you to completely manage an NBA franchise from a managerial point of view. It is obviously possible to swap players and change the quintet of our team during the season, but nothing more and above all once the season is over you have to start over, possibly with another team. Some shortcomings like this are evident and a bit strange for a product as tested as the EA NBA series, probably to respect the release date they had to exclude some features. An obvious problem in the game, which affects matches quite decisively, concerns free throws, which are really difficult, almost impossible to score even with players with always hot hands like Allen Iverson or Kobe Bryant. The shots from the line are performed by making the right stick make a movement from the bottom up, in the most fluid way possible. The fact is that there is no indicator that indicates power or accuracy, and often we will see bad shots even by a lot without knowing why. Nowhere in the game is it explained how to make these shots, we had to open the manual and consult it to understand how to do it, still obtaining very low percentages. Truly an inexplicable choice. Live camera We have already talked enough about the graphics sector, but we just want to let you know the available views and the problems that arise from them. It is possible to choose different types of framing, all customizable in height and proximity to the field: press box, broadcast, from the backline and from the sideline. The most spectacular is certainly the broadcast one, or rather the television one, which moves by zooming and rotating, trying to always keep the action in the foreground, sometimes crashing into the bodies of the players, or failing to provide an optimal view for going to the basket, certainly spectacular but not very effective. Our favorite turned out to be the press box with the maximum zoom level activated, it guarantees the possibility of managing the whole team thanks to a good rendering of perspective and depth. The problem with all shots is that often in the event of a fast counterattack the ball will go off the screen, making it impossible to organize a timely defense. Another lack that we noticed and that made us turn up our noses is the total absence of the possibility of personalizing the replays, it is, in fact, only possible to enjoy them live during the game by pressing the left analog stick with the right timing, it is the fraction of a moment and losing the moment we will never be able to see the action again. From an audio point of view, however, we are facing one of the best products ever, it really seems to be in the great NBA arenas, Steve Kerr's commentary is always spot on and the music is very engaging, without forgetting the roars of the audience when getting up standing yelling in delight at the basket just scored by the home team. On the online gaming front, unfortunately the news is not comforting, the EA servers have really disappointed us by offering an unacceptable connection with a lot of signal delay in almost all of our tests. It goes without saying that playing like this is almost impossible. It is possible to play free matches or to earn points and climb the world rankings, it is also possible to enter the lobbies dedicated to different skill levels and to the various nationalities, of course there are not many Italians at least at the moment, but in any case an opponent is you will certainly find. The hope is that in the days to come these problems will be solved with patches or with a nice injection of efficiency to the servers. Comment NBA Live 06 after having amazed us at first impact with its cosmetics, has left us with a bad taste in the mouth. The graphics sector makes us forcefully enter the new generation, but from the many problems, which afflict the EA title more or less heavily, we note the hasty gestation it had. However, the title ~makes itself playable~, especially if you have an HD televisionready deserves a try and to do this we can only remind you to access the Xbox Live Marketplace and download the available demo. NBA Live 06 seemed to us a taste, a promise from the developers on what we will be able to see in the 07 edition, and hopefully on that occasion we will not be disappointed. The next generation has arrived, but we'll have to wait a few more months to fully enjoy it, at least as far as basketball is concerned. Pros Next gen cosmetics The NBA in all respects Stadium sound Cons Lack of a management mode Unstable frame rate Problems with online A futuristic gym complete with a basketball hoop that emerges from the subsoil and builds itself in real time before our eyes, on the walls the images of our favorite champions, from Kobe Bryant to LeBron James and Steve Nash, the music starts to rise, the rap is engaging, and finally our athlete materializes on the parquet: Dwyane Wade. Incredibly we can move it right away, pick up a ball and bring it to the basket with ease. This is what awaits us once we enter NBA Live 06 on Xbox 360, the menu, in fact, is completely dynamic and waiting between one load and another it is possible to get carried away with the commands, and have Wade perform some evolution or to the sample we have chosen.", "date": "2005-12-17", "grade": null}
