This is not a faithful conversion of the game for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but a reinterpretation that follows the same plot and confronts us with the same ~moral dilemmas~, adopting however the structure of an action game with a variable view (generally top and three-quarter view). Defining this portable reduction of Army of Two: The 40th Day simply a shooter would be an understatement, given that the characters can sometimes interact with the environment, collect objects (the classic shield above all) and hit their opponents even with their bare hands when found at close range. In short, the developers of EA Montreal have tried to re-propose the elements that characterize the series (the so-called ~Aggro~, the collaboration between the characters, the weapons that can be purchased and upgraded, the ethical choices, etc.) and to place them in a context different, in many ways simplistic and limited. Salem Nights The protagonists of the game are once again Tyson Rios and Elliot Salem: two skilled mercenaries, inseparable companions in many battles who for some years now have specialized in guerrilla and infiltration operations. This time they have to face an entire army of terrorists in the streets of Shanghai, with the city under siege and pitfalls around every corner. The setting is therefore urban, divided into six stages which unfortunately are completed in no more than four hours. At the beginning of the game we are asked to choose our character between Salem and Rios, but apart from some dialogue and some of the famous ~choices~ there are very few differences between one and the other. In any case we have two weapon slots available, initially occupied by a machine gun and a shotgun: the first looks like the classic all-weather weapon, versatile and with a long range, equipped with an averagely large magazine and moderately effective; the second is the ideal choice for close quarters, given its exceptional effectiveness (one shot and you're dead), but from a distance it is useless and suffers from the particularly short clip. Reloading operations generally take place automatically, but it often happens that we run out of ammunition just when we are facing an enemy, with a consequent and copious loss of vital energy. As in the ~major~ versions, we can take cover behind objects and carry out our offensive from there until the scenario is clear, or quickly get away from danger by rolling: the right back button is used for both actions. The combat system is typical of top-down shooters, that is, it uses the four buttons Square, Triangle, Circle and X to open fire in the relative directions, with the difference (far from negligible) that the targets are ~ hooked~ and that therefore the direction of the attack is subject to variations according to the situation. For example, to hit an enemy located to the north-east, we just need to press the Triangle button and continue moving as we see fit. The days of Rios The variety of situations is supported only by the presence of different enemies, as well as final bosses who must be defeated by attacking only their weak points. When we are faced with armored soldiers, who have to be shot from behind, we must necessarily take advantage of the numerical superiority and wait for our partner to be targeted to move and sink our shots into the enemy's back. This is an operation that does not always succeed due to the mediocre AI that not only distinguishes our companion but in general all non-player characters, allies or opponents. We can order our better half to follow us, to stop and to have an exuberant or normal attitude, but the fact remains that in the most agitated situations his conduct is completely senseless: if we find ourselves on the ground and we need him to get us up (which which also happens in reverse, as in the first Army of Two), our friend will not care about the army that is targeting him and will run towards us with the only consequence of being mortally wounded: game over. Not to mention when there are obstacles between us and him: a complete blockage situation will be created, because our partner will not be able to reach us in any way. Similarly, enemies often do not care about cover and start shooting in the middle of the scenario, waiting for our response with a smile on their faces and without taking any evasive action. That being the case, most internships are completed with a yawnor, as they lack an adequate level of challenge and a structure that can give depth to the gameplay. Things improve during multiplayer (locally only, sadly), but only up to a certain point. Friends for life In the end, the technical sector of Army of Two: The 40th Day for PSP is the only above-average element of the EA product. The design of the characters, as also written in the preview phase, is caricatured and cartoonish, enhancing the physical differences between Salem and Rios. The drawing style, in general, is excellent and finds its best expression during the cutscenes that follow the situations in which choices must be made (such as ~kill this guy and earn extra weapons or let him live because deep down we like him ?~). The scenarios are well differentiated from each other, but the variety in the context of the same stage is unfortunately lacking: we often find ourselves exploring identical sections. The frequent shot changes work very well and denote a certain directorial effort, an effort which unfortunately is not supported by a very limiting and simplistic structure, even more spoiled by the bad AI. The quality of the animations is good, the frame rate is quite stable (although suffering in certain situations) and the lighting appears well managed, apart from the usual ~glow effect~ typical of the old generation of consoles, which frankly got tired. The game has an excellent dubbing in Italian, which compensates for the lack of quality music and effects.", "date": "2010-02-10", "grade": "5.0"}
