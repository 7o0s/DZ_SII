Which is not exactly a good thing, especially if the product in question fails to even come close, from a qualitative point of view, to the peaks that the Nintendo series has earned over the years. Table Top Racing: World Tour is one of the examples to be counted in the negative, and it doesn't matter if on paper the presence of developers from historical series such as Wipeout or Project Gotham should have been synonymous with competence, good ideas and manufacturing quality. If nothing else, the title is available free of charge for all Plus subscribers and will be available until the end of May, nevertheless the reasons to rejoice in this offer have turned out to be rather small. Tracks, drifts and power-ups aren't always synonymous with fun Everyone on board! But also not Table Top Racing draws inspiration from titles such as Mario Kart or Modnation Racers, through features such as the presence of power-ups, upgrades for cars and the division of racing into categories based on engine size. At the same time, a graphic style aimed at children was selected, which partly follows the Micro Machines brand and partly another arcade racing game such as Toy Home, based precisely on the presence of toy cars. The difficulties emerge already in the analysis of the tracks and in the functioning of the competition objects. Despite being set in five different places, the twenty Table Top tracks proved to be too linear, short in duration and very similar to each other. Even the power-ups that are collected along the tracks are few, not at all original and not even so scenic to observe. We are given the opportunity to acquire a homing missile, drop a bomb or oil slick on the ground, acquire a speed boost or release an electrical discharge in the area around the vehicle. End of the fun. There's really no room to be impressed, even after unlocking the Superweapon power-ups that are accessed after completing the first two championships. Theoretically, one should choose whether to recover an object and exploit it immediately, or vice versa to wait to forfeit a second element and therefore benefit from an enhanced attack. At first the game ensures that these new items will not only damage a single opponent but will also affect the surrounding environment in some way. The hope that the matches could become a little livelier and more lively is immediately denied by practice, since in fact no substantial differences are perceived between the first and second techniques, with the exception of the freezing attack which, once strengthened, allows immobilize the opponent in the ice and make him comfortably get out of the way. Even the driving system didn't capture us at all: the absence of a button for managing the skid, which on the contrary occurs only on the basis of the vehicle's predisposition, proved to be a handicap of no small importance, further affected by the repeated drops in fluidity of the graphics engine and the presence of some anomalies in the collision system. Playstation 4 trophies There are a total of 31 Table Top Racing: World Tour Trophies, divided between 15 bronze, 11 silver and 5 gold. Some are about conquering championships, others are about buying cars, activating power-ups and winning multiplayer competitions. Rhythm deficiencies If nothing else Table Top Racing tries to attract attention through the presence of six different game modes. In the Battle and Speed competitions you can face a traditional race, in the first case with the power-ups activated while in the second case without any help. In Elimination you must try to stay in the lead until all opponents controlled by the CPU have been eliminated from the match, while in Pursuit you must be able to hit a vehicle further on the track within the time limit. To close the picture there are the Drift mode, in which you have to drift for a long time to forfeit high scores, and the Time Race, developed as a traditional time attack. All variants can be used in normal tickets for the Championships but also to complete some special events, through which additional coins are obtained which can then be invested in the purchase of upgrades or other vehicles. The latter are divided into three different categories: the handy Cult Classics, the fast Street Racers and finally the powerful Supercars. For each of these categories are available onlyor four cars, consequently the overall fleet stops at just twelve units. Nonetheless, each class has cars with unique characteristics, to ensure improvements in speed, acceleration or drifting capabilities. The upgrades of each vehicle can go to increase variables such as maximum speed, acceleration, maneuverability and armor, while by purchasing new tires you can put your opponents out of action, forfeit extra coins after each successful attack or receive protection shields for short periods of time. In these respects Table Top Racing doesn't perform very badly, but in the light of the poor quality of the experience on the track, the judgment remains negative. The prospects improve minimally if you decide to embark on multiplayer challenges, which however only offer online competitions for up to a maximum of eight participants, without providing shared participation in split-screen instead.", "date": "2016-05-09", "grade": "5.0"}
