An alternative reality where to shape suggestive meanings that escape the banality of everyday life. And in the last ten years the desire to live in worlds populated by knights, vampires, space marines and creatures of all sorts has reached incredible heights. Fantastic Worlds have regained the top spot at the box office, have given new life to the publishing market and have supported PC video gaming thanks to a genre that allows you to literally live in an alternate reality. We're talking about the online role-playing game (mmorpg) that has made giant strides since Ultima Online culminating in the success of World Of Warcraft sanctioned by the impressive number of 11 million users. But there are some variants of the mmorpg genre that have recorded even more incredible numbers. In fact, some browser games, in the guise of free simplifications of an mmorpg, have hundreds of millions of users and move huge capital thanks to advertising and microtransactions. The advantages are many even if the gaming experience is limited and revenues are not guaranteed by monthly subscriptions. Among the bonuses we can mention the minimum hardware requirements, the possibility of interrupting the game at any time and the strong socializing component that distinguishes them. Dofus was born as an attempt to combine the advantages of mmorpg and browser game in a single accessible, modest, economic experience and above all placed in a different market segment from that of World Of Warcraft. A successful attempt given that the Dofus community has reached 25 million players. A true mmorpg Dofus 2.0 offers us all the typical mmorpg elements such as races, classes, levels, guilds, professions, jobs, dungeons, graveyards, free exploration, trade and magical items. Each voice is articulate, complex, and balanced to deliver the fullest experience possible. The classes are 12 and range from the warrior who bases his techniques on luck to the spellcaster who fights using summoned creatures. The levels, on the other hand, even reach 200 and as they grow, they automatically unlock a large list of spells and attacks. But it is the player who decides how to spend the 5 points obtained from each level by customizing his character in detail who will be able to carry more weight, increase specific damage according to the increased characteristic or avoid attacks thanks to high agility. The guild also grows in level, as also happens in the latest high-budget mmorpgs, and among the social options, the one linked to marriage stands out. There are all harvesting jobs and they allow us to collect wood, minerals, meat, hides and so on. The materials can then be sold or used to develop the professions which from the 65th level onwards will allow us, after specialization, to also build objects of great value and even to sign them in order to advertise our products. They range from weapons, to armor, to potions, to jewels, to poisons, to flowers, to foods and the professions are still useful immediately to obtain some basic objects and to raise money useful for buying from shops or from other players. But the best way to get items of great power is the classic one of any self-respecting mmorpg. We're talking about the pitiless massacre of increasingly stronger creatures and more and more full of treasures to conquer. And Dofus adds a significant detail to the loot system by drawing, directly from Diablo, a magic find system called prospecting and based on luck points. But there is another way to collect items that is somewhere between pvp and pve. In fact, some players belonging to guilds have the right to place a perceptor on the maps. It is a very robust creature that grows in power as the guild level increases and collects part of the loot generated by the fights of the map in which it is located. Of course, players from other guilds may have a certain antipathy towards this very efficient debt collector who can be defeated and cleaned of all the goods he has stolen. Goods that add to the loot, built items and traded items and which, at this point, begin to become bulky. But the automatic sales structures, obviously present in Dofus, can be impersonal and lacking in appeal. And it is probably for this reason that the guys from Ankama Games have fished out the figure of the shopkeeper from Ultima Online. The only limitation is to use one of our characters, disconnected, as a walker. A choice that avoids finding dozens of PNGs abandoned here and there and that facilitates the management of our seller's inventory and lookAnd. Turn based mmorpg One of the special features of Dofus is turn-based combat. A choice that contributes to increasing the peculiarity of the Ankama Games title both in terms of gameplay and in terms of how to use it. In fact, we are given the opportunity, rare in an mmorpg, to distract ourselves from the game even during a fight, perhaps to answer the phone or to check another window and so on. A convenient opportunity on many occasions and which, combined with the minimal hardware requirements and with the extremely compatible development platform, further increases the usability of Dofus even in contexts such as school, study and work. A fundamental detail for those who produce mmorpg for a mass audience, even if obviously it is a concept that involves some ethical complications. Obviously the interruption cannot be eternal and is limited by a timer, so as not to block the other players involved in the clash and to prevent a player from blocking a creature preventing it from reappearing to be challenged by other players. But let's go back to the combat that is divided into PVP and PVE, allows you to attack a monster in a group and includes duels between players and a PVP system based on alignment and factions. Once a mob or a player has been attacked, it starts with the selection of the starting box and then it is the initiative, calculated on the basis of the characteristics of a monster or a character, which decides who starts first. At this point, all that remains is to choose the right spell or attack to face the type of enemy we are facing, paying close attention to how we spend action points and movement points. In fact, each attack has a different range and it is essential to try to avoid the greatest number of enemy attacks by calculating the distances well. Especially since Dofus introduces another particular element, typical of tabletop turn-based games and which increases the tactical complexity of the combat. This is the threat area that surrounds the characters who can hinder the movement of those who cross it even outside their turn. And being joined by a burly warrior and not being able to walk away because it keeps tripping us up is a situation to be avoided at all costs. But sometimes it is really difficult to get out of trouble and the limited playing field is often a death sentence when we are faced with too difficult enemies. Fortunately, a single fight cannot be fatal, in fact life points only determine defeat while energy points decree the death of a character. When the energy points reach zero the character becomes a ghost and must reach for a resurrection phoenix to come back to life. Dofus 2.0 Dofus 2.0 is a 2D mmorpg with an isometric view, developed entirely in flash and therefore able to run on a huge number of different systems. Even after the update that sanctions the transition from the browser to the client version, the Ankama title is satisfied with a single gigahertz processor and 512 megabytes of RAM, taking us back a few years in terms of hardware requests. Furthermore, the requests in terms of bandwidth also remain low and the turn-based combat allows you to play even for those who do not have a good latency. And finally we also find a complete adaptation in Italian that many more famous mmorpgs have never given us. In short, in terms of usability Dofus is unassailable and this restyling allows it to defend itself also from an aesthetic point of view. In fact, if little has changed in terms of playability since Dofus 1.29, much has changed in terms of enjoyment. The title has been completely redesigned starting from the menus, which are clearer and more functional. The manga look is now more pleasant and more detailed and although many parts of the territory are nothing more than similar meadows, some views and buildings are very pleasant to see. The more vivid colours, the more pleasant animations and the more convincing symphonies complete the picture of a graphic revamp now necessary, after four years, to justify the monthly cost of the subscriptions.", "date": "2010-04-15", "grade": "8.0"}
