{"name": "Catlateral Damage", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/150622-catlateral-damage-io-micio.html", "text": "When the demo came out, or rather the prototype of Catlateral Damage was greeted by a cheering choir. We ourselves immediately fell in love with the idea of guiding a sweet kitten to destroy a well-ordered apartment, committing ourselves to throwing various furnishings and trinkets on the ground with great satisfaction. Doing so had something cathartic and left a good taste in our mouths, like a dish with an important flavour. From the success of the idea to the leap towards the commercial title, the step is short, especially if you have four legs. Unfortunately, something went wrong, because the transfer proved to be anything but successful. The problem is easy to spot: we're talking about the exact same game, just a little broader: you guide the kitten chosen from the selection screen and paw by pressing the mouse buttons to throw the objects to the ground, after having reached them on the shelves that cram them. The exact same things are done in both available modes, only that in one you have to accumulate a certain score within a time limit, while in the other you are free to act as you wish. A little bit? Decidedly. Of course, each map is procedurally generated, so the position of the various objects varies from game to game. There are also power ups to collect and special events that happen from time to time to add some variety. For example, it may happen to turn on disco lights, or to unlock a super jump with a soft glide that allows you to reach otherwise inaccessible places, or even to let a mouse enter the apartment or to have to chase a red light. There are also unlockable items, such as photos of cats that will form a rich gallery in the extras, provided that you have found them around the rooms first (they are quite obvious, actually). The cats also have unique characteristics, in perfect role-playing style, which can be upgraded during the game, but they are of little relevance given the final result. How much hair will the Catlateral Damage review leave us? Too many hairs to brush The problem is that it works for a few minutes, and then comes the bitter feeling of having exhausted what interesting the game had to offer. At that point, the problems that the initial sympathy had marginalized and overlooked also take on weight. For example, the cats are much less agile and reactive than they should be and, in general, the gameplay is really woody and not very fluid. A contradiction, since we are talking about felines. Reaching certain shelves is painfully frustrating, not so much because of the difficulty of the jumps, but because of the difficulty of jumping accurately (it's subtle, but there is a difference). In short, from the construction point of view, the overall work done on Catlateral Damage is really mediocre. You probably couldn't expect much more from such a small team, but if you can turn a blind eye to the certainly not exceptional technical side, although it is not unpleasant, it is more difficult to overlook the rest. In conclusion, we are not talking about a disastrous title, but not even one that leaves its mark. It can be useful to have a few laughs with friends, but it stops there and sweet kittens are not enough to lift it.", "date": "2015-05-29", "grade": "5.5"}
