{"name": "Grimvalor", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grimvalor-recensione.html", "text": "Grimvalor is an extraordinary title, and it only takes a few minutes to understand it. Set in a tremendously inspired dark fantasy scenario and permeated with a disturbing atmosphere, the game puts us in command of a brave warrior (male or female, we'll choose at the beginning of the game) who is tasked with finding the lost king of Vallaris. However, he does not know that this mission will put him in front of evil and powerful creatures, scattered within stages connected to each other by a map that incorporates the typical features of Metroidvania, with environments with watertight compartments, ~elevators~, portals and altars where you can rest, recharge your energy and save your position, as in soulslike. The genre of belonging is in fact that of action RPGs, but the title developed by the Finnish team Direlight Games, born from the ashes of those Touch Foos who in 2012 offered us the excellent Swordigo, draws on both of these sub-genres, exciting and challenging the players with always new situations, opponents characterized by different attack patterns, mini-bosses and real bosses that we will be able to defeat only after several attempts: monsters with long claws, shadow knights, aberrations similar to Genestealers, fighters equipped with shields and chain maces, angels covered in flames, and so on. The key to defeating these enemies also and above all lies in the loot earned on the field, with two different currencies that allow you to enhance the protagonist's health, physical strength, dexterity and spiritual energy, or to forge new weapons and armor to equip . But be careful: Grimvalor is a premium product, which costs 7.99 euros without including any microtransactions: a courageous approach in a market now monopolized by the freemium model, which must be absolutely rewarded if we consider that the single player campaign of the game keeps people busy for something like fifteen hours. Gameplay and structure While supporting MFi controllers, Grimvalor is equipped with very well organized touch controls, which lack just a few tricks to be perfect. From the options it is in fact possible to increase or decrease the size of the keys and move them in their entirety higher or lower, or increase the distance between the arrow keys and the buttons assigned to attack, jump and sprint, but at the moment they cannot be customized individual icons or arrange them freely on the touch screen. Why do we talk about it? Because the combat system is based on attack and dodge, so we would have found it more convenient to be able to pair the two commands so as not to get confused with the jump during a life or death situation. The kind of events that you will often have to face during the Grimvalor campaign, given that the degree of challenge of this experience has many things in common with the Dark Souls philosophy, while renouncing excessively punitive implications: you will return to the game over at the last checkpoints, while retaining the collected items. The more you go on, the more it will happen that from the last altar to the crime scene there is a bit of a distance, but it is a price that one gladly accepts to pay for such beauty. The duels become more complex when we unlock extra maneuvers, which are activated by dragging the attack button in the four directions and allow for example to crush enemies to the ground, throw them in the air or deliver a very powerful blow, capable of inflict serious damage. Equally important are the healing potions, which we can use by touching any area of the touch screen for a few moments, and which are also recharged at the altars, without therefore acting as real consumables. At first, the protagonist's running and jumping appear a bit light and there is no doubt that on this front we can still take a few steps forward, but the feedback from the blows is extraordinary, it conveys the impact of our blows very effectively and it makes it all a lot of fun. Similarly, the dodge maneuver must be performed with perfect timing to be able to project behind the opponent and open his guard, so as to sink as many blows as possible until he is able to react. As you bust through walls to collect more treasure, climb walls to reveal hidden areas, and explore each of the five locations in depth to uncover everything the experience has to offer, you can't help but notice how much care has gone into it. in the creation of characters, enemies (which change at each level, becoming more numerous and dangerous), bosses (with few exceptions and very few ~clones~) and scenarios, the realization of a convincing level designnte and inspired. And the music? Not even those have been left to chance, indeed the soundtrack really manages to involve with solutions of great atmosphere, which do not miss even some important quote (Resident Evil?).", "date": "2018-10-29", "grade": "9.0"}
