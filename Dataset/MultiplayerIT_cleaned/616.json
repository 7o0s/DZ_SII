{"name": "Koloomn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/koloomn.html", "text": "Smash Koloomn is a puzzle game and as such it is closely linked to some basic rules of the genre. While not deriving from the Tetris family, i.e. from that branch of puzzle game with pieces that cyclically fall from the top of the screen, the aim of the game is alternatively to beat the opponent by making sure that his stage fills up before the or simply playing ab libitum competing on the score until you are completely submerged by small colored pieces. The game area of Koloomn looks like a series of rows of smiling colored cubes, the aim will be to rotate (with a square pointer from two squares by two) the colored blocks to join four or more of the same colors so that they melt and disappear. The rule that underlies the game is therefore rather linear, everything is linked to the simple rotation of the blocks and the speed of the player in knowing how to see the best moves through the colored grid. What makes Koloomn a strategically well thought out and fun game is represented by a whole series of moves to be combined with the normal mechanics, which substantially transform the game approach especially in multiplayer sessions. To be clearer, we must first of all say that depending on the color of the eliminated block there will be a different consequence which can vary from changing the size of the pointer from 2x2 to 4x4, to creating megalithic blocks practically impossible to move or simply inserting bars in the lower rows to reduce the opponent's playing area to make life even more difficult for him. In addition to the chromatic consequences of the destruction of the blocks, an important part of the game covers the creation of chains that will give the possibility to start devastating combos, excellent for clearing one's stage and filling that of one's enemy. Depending on the number of combos, or simply depending on the number of blocks blown up, the player will be assigned a particular bonus block whose use will allow him to perform particular actions if blown up: the block with the arrow inside will allow you to transform the color of all the blocks on the road indicated by the direction of the arrow and thus effectively destroying one or more horizontal or vertical lines (obviously depending on the position of the vertex), the block with four vertices on the other hand will transform all the neighboring blocks into the same color, the wave block instead will simply destroy all blocks of a certain color within the stage. The diversification of feasible tactics makes Koloomn a game that is absolutely adaptable to any type of player, the variety of moves present means that the gaming experience is never repetitive. Impossible is nothing The game modes are divided into the most classic of ways: single player and multiplayer. The single player mode is divided into the homonymous mode where the only purpose will be to compete against yourself and against the clock until the end of the game; the second mode is the tutorial that introduces the player to the game techniques present in Koloomn, the presence of the tutorial is very useful due to the actual difficulty of the moves that can be used in the game; the self-evident training mode concludes the single player lot. Despite the name, the best part of Koloomn played alone is found within the Multiplayer mode: Campaign mode and Arcade mode are two roughly similar modes that put the player in challenge against the cpu, the aim will obviously be to beat the your opponents one at a time until the end of the game. These two modes represent the real heart of the game due to the use of the chains: koloomn played against time is reduced to a simple systematic destruction of all the blocks that enter the stage, the game against the cpu instead is enriched by all that series of moves described by the tutorial that turn the game experience on the player's tactics and speed. The ad hoc wireless multiplayer mode concludes, the defect of which remains that of having to find another person who owns the game in order to have fun together. Impossible is nothing The graphic sector breathes Japanese air deeply with a whole series of animations and graphics typical of manga and anime, the eight characters of the game derive largely from the stylization of Japanese characters such as the masked wrestler, the ningia with the handkerchief tied under the nose , the student etc. Even the game menus are made in manga style and give a good idea of the light-hearted air that hovers over the game. The animations that follow the game action are fun without, howeverget to the glories (in the genre) of super puzzle fighter. As for the sound, nothing in particular to report, in the game there are a whole series of melodies that accompany the game action and which are more concerned with not annoying the player rather than making people talk about them. Koloomn is basically a good game, a great product for a laptop: light, fun and well designed. The only defects evidently found are linked to a not exaggerated diversification between the proposed methods and the actual difficulty of playing a multiplayer game with a human opponent. The game mechanics are very well structured even if some of the moves that can be performed are absolutely difficult to perform, master class stuff. Pros: Technically well thought out. Graphically appealing. Fun and long lasting. Cons: Modes too similar to each other. Some moves are *really* hard to pull off- Wireless not up to scratch- There are games announced years before their release, there are games announced and postponed postponed and postponed again, there are games announced and never released again, there are games announced more to make news than to make people play and finally there are unannounced games. of those that you find them on the shelf in the shop when you least expect it and that pleasantly surprise you. Koloomn is one of these, one of those games made especially to be on a portable console because they are perfect for the typical five-minute game waiting for the bus or simply on the train journey, a puzzle game that draws liberally on other titles of the genre by creating a product that is fun, simple, and well-crafted.", "date": "2006-02-16", "grade": null}
