{"name": "Below", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/below-recensione.html", "text": "More than five years have now passed since the announcement of Below. The new title of Capybara Games, able to catalyze the public's attention right from the first announcement. The game has experienced a rather troubled genesis: between postponements and disappearances from the radar, it finally lands on PC and Xbox One, trying to have its say within a genre close to saturation. Below is an incredibly scenic and equally cruel rogue-lite, able to convey a lot, and to frustrate even more. After twenty hours and many curses, we are ready to tell you what we think. A story of images, notes and emotions The impact with Below, when starting the first game, is one that we will be forced to remember for a long, long time. The artistic value of the first minutes is what explains in the most direct way possible the reason why the video game can (and must in some of its specific forms) aim to be recognized as art. The nebulous initial image, which almost imperceptibly expresses the movement, tells us about the desperation of the journey with a disruptive force. Just as some artistic bird's eye views are capable of confusing and not clarifying the subjects involved at first glance, so Below launches us into a stormy sea, on a small boat which, at first, seems more reminiscent of a small organism in movement. The lightness of the gait, capable of creating small ripples on the water, confuses and bewitches, during the five minutes that anticipate the understanding of the scene. It is difficult to put into words such a simple and impactful concept, going to perfectly represent the idea that makes a creation art. By the time we understand what it is, it's too late to dwell on it. A strip of land finally emerges from the sea, our sail points straight towards possible salvation and we land, still shaken, on an abandoned and deserted shore. This way of introducing us to the world of Below loudly recalls the scenic impact that Fumito Ueda gave us with his Ico at the beginning of the last decade. It is no coincidence that the atmosphere of Below recalls that way of narrating and moving emotions that only the Japanese master was able to create. There is no plot properly so-called but, not for this reason, our exploits on the island that forms the backdrop to the story will skimp on small elements here and there, able to tell us about the past and the legacy of an extraordinarily lively territory, despite the be civilly dead. The shores of the beach give us only a few simple useful objects, such as logs or a vegetable, up to putting us in front of a bonfire. Having caught our breath following the initial emotions, we are now ready to climb the wall that will lead us to the heart of the island. Among lost lands, foliage always in the pay of the wind and gigantic structures scattered throughout the game world, Below is already a candidate for a place among the most evocative incipits ever. Now we are truly alone, left to ourselves, about to embark on an adventure that we will hardly forget, even if not always for the right reasons. What really matters is that, after twenty hours, we can tell you with certainty that Below represents an experiment only half successful. Less artistic gameplay Setting aside the narrative premises and the scenic impact, Below still remains an exponent of a genre that has recently been abused and difficult to innovate. What often characterizes the conception of rogue lite (direct descendant of the more famous rogue like) is its ability to raise the degree of challenge and change with each game, with the consequence of making death apparently permanent, albeit capable of carrying a series of elements that make us stronger with each new attempt. The Capy Games game is no exception and, starting exactly from this assumption, it puts us at the controls of a character who will be forced to dive into the depths of the mountain, from room to room, trying to reach the most remote and inhospitable point. The progression of Below is therefore expressed in levels of depth, each consisting of a series of rooms procedurally generated at each game, with the particularity of being connected at an intermezzo (between one floor and another) by areas instead detached from the discourse of generation random. This choice, which brings positive and negative elements as a dowry, is the daughter of one of the great design elements of Below: shortcuts. Let's face it, it is a game of extreme difficulty, far beyond what you can humanly expect, and this element would not go well with the need to repeat dozens of ~useless~ rooms for progression. For this reason, continuing to descend and explore, yesit has the possibility of lowering a bridge or activating an elevator or even opening a large stone door and so on, making sure that the different levels of depth can be reached more quickly. This element becomes fundamental the moment you die, and you will die a lot. The first rooms and the first levels do not convey the idea of the malice of a title that sets traps, its greatest companion of sadism. For this reason, the small red creatures, often weak and never too aggressive, will not create too many problems for you. On the contrary, where the traps scattered are often nothing more than an annoying addition, here they will become your biggest nightmare, also considering their ability to kill you instantly in some cases. Continuing the descent, the areas will become increasingly dark and the amount of adversity will grow inversely proportional to the resources that you can recover, making the concept of survival something very close to that of frustration. Even in purely stylistic terms, what initially seems to be almost completely unrelated to technology, if not for some small elements and gimmicks, continuing will instead prove to be much more than simple lighting management. We don't want to spoil some surprises for you, but know that even from the scenic point of view and the background of the Below universe, some elements continue to strongly remind us of the works of Team Ico. As previously mentioned, all these elements condense and find their balance at the moment of death. Unlike a large number of similar titles, the latter will lead to the complete disappearance of the adventurer just played, and to the landing of a new handsome man on the shore from which we started. With the new character you will be able to use all the shortcuts unlocked by the previous unfortunates and, if you want, to take advantage of your own generosity shown in the previous run, teleporting to the closest bonfire to which you were. This concept introduces us to the other fundamental element of Below: light. As soon as you land on the island, you will come into possession of a lantern. This will allow you to accumulate a series of spheres of light, released largely by dead creatures in the depths, useful for making the way more understandable, but also for opening passages that would otherwise be impossible to activate. At the time of your death, the new adventurer will not find the lantern waiting for him on the beach, but will be forced to find the body of whoever preceded him, and recover it directly from his remains (together with the rest of the inventory if necessary). It is clear how this choice is interesting and wicked at the same time. Despite the strength behind this idea, we find it at least risky to put the player in the position of not being able to advance, unless he finds his old body, especially in the light of a procedural nature of the rooms that does not exactly allow making them too recognizable. This is joined by the fact that the use of bonfires and the expense of twenty-five lumens to ~boost~ them and make them spawn points live on a single attempt which, once used, will make them simple campfires again. An interesting dreamlike element comes to our aid, which allows us to rest and find a room useful for releasing objects into a shared deposit, the only real safe in the game, but always unable to do so with that interesting little object which is the lantern. there being only one around the mountain. This element, combined with a nice but not very successful crafting system and the need to also manage one's hunger and thirst, outline a picture that is anything but difficult to digest. Just the physiological needs of the protagonist, initially easy to maintain on good levels, will become a nightmare going down, when the animals will be less and less and starving will become a further danger not to be underestimated. To complete a certainly not idyllic picture, we think about a combat system that is far too simple, without any kind of particular flash, also dirtied by an antiquated aiming system and which finds its least successful element in the management of the bow. Technically speaking Below is a feast for the eyes, there is no arguing about this. Regardless of your personal tastes, the style that Capy Games has managed to put on the plate is something extraordinarily successful. The dark atmospheres and the features that outline the rooms and our protagonist are a little gem, difficult to replicate. The same can be said for the maniacal care dedicated to the audio and for the management of the lights and volumetric effectsthere, which elicit more than a smile during the first hours. Certainly the engine is not the lightest and cleanest, juggling between situations of extreme tranquility in the management of the frame rate, to others in which it inexorably collapses on itself, annoying with an uninspiring jerkiness. Nothing that affects the gameplay too much, but certainly difficult to digest for a title of this technical scope, also characterized by a bird's eye view, among the most distant that our memory has allowed us to remember.", "date": "2018-12-21", "grade": "7.0"}
