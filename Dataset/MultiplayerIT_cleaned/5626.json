{"name": "Droga per demoni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/165583-mind-zero-droga-per-demoni.html", "text": "We're talking about a Japanese RPG inspired by the Persona series: not only as regards the ~high school~ setting, but also for some elements of the game structure. The title, presented for the domestic market even in August 2013, is a mix in which the genre of visual novels and that of dungeon crawlers are mixed in equal measure. It's not a masterpiece, but on Vita's small screen it was saved: on PC Mind Zero is even more disappointing Lots of dialogue It takes about a couple of hours to come into contact with the first monsters: this long period of time is used to get to know the protagonists (starting from the main one, Kei) and the story that acts as an architrave in the development of the title. In a school in Nippori (but we will also visit the districts of Yokohama, Akihabara and Amamiya) a mysterious portal has opened from which a violent creature has come out and killed a boy with an ax. It seems that the perpetrator is the victim of a new and powerful kind of drug: in reality it is a sort of pact with the devil which our heroes will have to accept, despite themselves. Being kidnapped by a ~graveditch~, they can return to the real world only by choosing the weapon that best represents them and that will bind them with a demon, called MIND; if they were to make a mistake they would be killed instead. However, not all MINDs are ~good~: some have lost their minds and are breaking out of the ~inner realm~ to invade the real world. To our the thankless task of blocking the bad guys. Behind them the police will begin to investigate with ever greater insistence and, being obviously unaware of this incredible parallel world, will doubt that the young people are involved in drug dealing. In all fairness the story manages to pique interest, despite the actors in the field practicing in the opposite direction. Kei is difficult to bear with his snobbish air, Leo seems too stereotypical and shallow, and in general none of the extras that enrich the cast manage to create particular empathy. Everything is crippled by the English dubbing: considering that the story proceeds through static comics, we understand how the voice of the flesh-and-blood counterparts in this genre is more fundamental than ever. Unfortunately, the economic constraints with which the publisher Aksys Games had to make ends meet did not allow it to hire high-level voice assistants, with disappointing results: luckily there is the possibility of using the original voices in Japanese (keeping the subtitles in English ) that definitely do more justice to the work of the designers. and many monsters The story is therefore really important, as shown not only by the first approaches to the title, but also by numerous interlude scenes: however, the script is not the only pillar on which the gaming experience is based. Entertainment relies on the dynamics of dungeon crawlers: the labyrinths are explored in first person as was the case in Ultima Underworld more than twenty years ago. In a completely random way, doors, treasures and above all enemies may appear, which are faced, always with a first-person view, in turn-based combat. The party (made up of three elements) only appears at the time of the attack, while only the opponents are framed during the choice of moves. In addition to using the classic ~physical~ moves, Kei & Company can call into question their MINDs: thus an interesting mix of strategies is created which must be well balanced to bring home the fur. In fact, the demons take in all respects the place of their summoners, not only by facing the enemies (even with special moves that can be unlocked by equipping them with specific ~cards~, i.e. the equivalent of Final Fantasy VII matter), but even taking damage in their place. When the ~mental point~ counter is reset due to too many hits taken, or even due to excessive use of attacks, the boy is left at the mercy of monsters who can quickly take him out. Knowing when to make use of the help of the MIND is probably one of the most interesting challenges of the clashes that prove to be fairly challenging and long-lasting from the lowest difficulty level. More than porting, emulation The PC version is a poor conversion of the already existing one for PlayStation Vita and on whose characteristics Mind Zero was originally designed. The resolution at which it is preferable to play with is therefore that of 960x544 pixels, which in fact corresponds to a window about a quarter the size of a FullHD screen: it is possible to ~stretch~ the image until it covers the entire surface of the monitor, but in this case obviously thedefinition goes down the drain especially in fights, where it seems to be dealing with a PC title from the mid-90s. To be honest, even the splendid illustrations by Kuzuma Kaneko, undoubtedly one of the strengths of the portable release of Mind Zero, lose much of their charm in the transition to large PC monitors. The use of keyboard and mouse is practically impossible, while with the classic Xbox joypad you can manage everything easily, even if there are some annoying bugs: for example, sometimes the A button, which should be used to confirm a action, it is absolutely not taken into consideration by the system. This is particularly annoying in the dungeon exit phases, where it is necessary to press the key an unknown number of times before the will to exit the labyrinth is perceived. The loading times are also irritating and if they could have been accepted on the modest hardware of PlayStation Vita, they are completely intolerable on systems equipped with an exaggerated amount of RAM and hypervitamin processors. Longevity stands at good levels also considering the presence of secondary missions that bring the overall gaming experience up to forty hours; the soundtrack instead is, as per the Japanese tradition, a real gem.", "date": "2016-03-28", "grade": "6.0"}
