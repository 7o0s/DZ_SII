You, as good nameless heroes, must go down there and eradicate evil by following the orders of the god Din, a terribly arrogant giant who lives in the village but takes care not to lift a finger in case of danger. Yes come on, you got it right: it's yet another Diablo clone. Also quite shameless to be honest. In reality it seems that the genre of action role-playing games cannot or does not want to produce anything that deviates too much from the original formula of the Blizzard classic, strengthened by a public success that is renewed despite the obviousness of certain design choices. The genre seems to have died with Diablo, but since then it has produced countless clones that perpetuate the memory. Din's Curse is no exception and, having respected all the rules that we have been carrying around since 1996, it tries to have its say by adding a couple of innovations which we will discuss later. To start Once a game has started, we have to choose the class of our avatar from the six presets, or create a personalized one by pairing two specializations. The other choices that can be made concern the name and some options that modify the difficulty (such as the respawn speed of the enemies or their initial level with respect to the hero). Other choices are grayed out because you have to complete the game at least once before you can use them. For example the Hardcore mode in which a dead character cannot be resurrected or the Curse mode in which only cursed objects can be used. The character creation screen Once we've made our decisions, let's start the game. As already mentioned, we find ourselves in a randomly generated village, under the orders of the god Din, who immediately entrusts us with a mission. If desired, it is possible to talk to the other inhabitants who sell objects, assign secondary missions or give some useful information. We will find out later that the village is not only the place to return to after exploring the multilevel dungeon where evil lurks a bit, but it is also an active part of the game. A novelty of Din's Curse, in fact, foresees that the village is attacked from time to time by strong scouts sent by the lords of the underground. In these situations, our task is to let go of everything we are doing and run to save it. In fact, if too many inhabitants were killed, the mission would inexorably end up forcing us to start everything over, while maintaining the current level of the character. Interesting? Yes, but with reservations. The Alternatives Action RPGs have come out galore over the years, so we won't mention them all. Among the various representatives of the genre, Diablo aside, we certainly recommend the recent Torchlight, released at the end of 2009 and available online for a few euros. It is one of the best Diablo clones and is superior to Din's Curse in almost all aspects, apart from multiplayer. Another valid alternative is Titan Quest, a 2007 title characterized by being set in mythological Greece. Finally, if long adventures don't scare you, jump into Sacred 2 and its huge open world. It will keep you busy for days. Go-go backtracking The biggest problem comes from the nature of the movements between areas. Once inside the dungeon, the only way back to the village is via teleportation stones scattered across the maps (one for each level). Imagine standing around a level without having found the stone yet and seeing the village attack icon appear. The only option is to go back to the upper level from which to finally reach the base. The problem is that, especially when you are very strong, the envoys of the underground become really powerful and if you don't hurry, they take little time to massacre the inhabitants of the surface, with the result of completely nullifying the efforts made. The absurdity is that they can also eliminate quest givers, forcing you to manually cancel missions that have become unsolvable. If desired, it is possible to take advantage of a quick teleport available in the bottom bar. The problem is that it can only be used once per dungeon, even if it is made up of many levels. So imagine in a twenty-level dungeon, having to go back and forth just to have to save the inhabitants. At first, the novelty can excite you, but given the backtracking it forces, it doesn't take much to get tired. A boss Mommy, Mommy the graph is dead! Another big problem of Din's Curse, which is easy to understand by looking at the screens that surround the articolous, is graphic poverty. It is true that it is an indie production, but the fact remains that a very old title and of the same production level as Fate (by the same authors as Torchlight), is immensely superior to it. The fact that the scenarios are randomly generated does not justify their extreme repetitiveness and total lack of detail. We certainly don't want to condemn the product only for technical reasons, but something more could certainly have been done. For the rest it is, as already mentioned, a carbon copy of the good old Diablo, so expect a myriad of objects to collect, random missions to solve and monsters to kill by clicking furiously on the mouse.", "date": "2010-04-21", "grade": "7.0"}
