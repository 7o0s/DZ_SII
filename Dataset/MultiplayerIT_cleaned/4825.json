Following the big improvements of the previous chapter, MXGP 3 marks the definitive abandonment of the proprietary engine of the house, in favor of the eclectic and always surprising Unreal Engine 4, probably the most versatile engine in existence and which never misses an opportunity to get noticed, with some shade, even in this incarnation. The year away from MXGP 2 is therefore justified with a view to a sensitive graphic restyling, but a lot has also been done on the physics side. We managed to get our hands on the Xbox One version, has Milestone managed to improve further? New face, old ways Speaking of the menus, the need for a decisive rejuvenation for the presentation side Milestone productions is immediately evident, even if being involved in many racing projects it is understandable that an optimization is implemented in a practical sense, but the menu setting reminds too much of the old efforts of the team and the not very pleasant impression is that of playing the same title with a different skin. If this is a negligible detail after all, it is not possible to overlook the now stale career structure, linked more to the productions of the previous generation, whose inadequacy is explained in the usual sequence of static screen shots on the inevitable contracts offered to our pilot, as usual fully customizable. The identity with our dirty centaur is forced from the beginning, so as to represent an avatar to be upgraded through the internal credit system; any improvements to the bikes are paid for in virtual currency that can be earned during the races. The internal economic system is already well defined, so much so that a DLC is available to multiply credits to accumulate and speed up upgrade operations, but the game puts everything in the user's hands without resorting to these practical shortcuts. Apart from the detail of a more dutiful than inspired career, in terms of content there is very little to complain about MXGP 3, the modes are really many and include the Grand Prix and championship (independent of career), time trials, different modes and support for online tenders. Particularly among the most obvious, considering the license, is the presence of all the liveries, riders and circuits of the official MXGP and MX2 championship. So make way for the various Cairoli, Lupino and Maddii as far as our team is concerned, and obviously there is no shortage of houses. The music produced internally by Milestone is adequate and energetic, as it knows well the range of users to which the product is aimed, with a playlist full of dubstep and various electronics. Full fun What is most striking about MXGP 3 is the impact on the actual mud, unfortunately on Xbox One following long loads, with an immediately satisfying and expertly calibrated guide system by Milestone. The customization possibilities offered to the player are many, involving the same physics, the artificial intelligence of the opponents and the inevitable rewind to correct errors, however it is good to remember that the difficulty is set by default to a very easy level, and all aid activated. Settings carry over to all modes automatically, so without a quick visit to the race options the game will feel overly forgiving and approachable. By setting the simplified physics to assimilate its dynamics, the generated effect is that of great fun and spectacularity, so as to evoke fascinating ghosts from the past, such as SEGA's Enduro Racer. Despite its inevitably ~simcade~ nature, Milestone racing should not be underestimated in its dynamics by deactivating the aids and setting the difficulty in realism mode. In this case the game can become quite challenging, with the pilot's falls no longer representing sporadic events, without however reaching peaks of realism capable of affecting the fun. This means that, even in pro mode, some perhaps inevitable contact will be forgiven, a compromise that we are not sorry about but which could generate disagreements. Less exciting is the handling of artificial intelligence, with pilots having a tendency to keep a calculated distance. This implementation results in the classic climb, with the first places obviously at a safe distance and more difficult to reach. Xbox One goals MXGP 3 features the classic 1000 player points, divided into 36 goals. The first are withquistable with relative ease simply by trying the various modes, an opportunity that will allow you to quickly accumulate over 100 points. For the rest, a greater amount of time and work will be required, considering the need to develop the career mode, and beyond. Good luck! In the mud, for the third time We had high expectations for the visual aspect of MXGP 3, but the technical realization on Xbox One, the version we tested, is a lukewarm shower despite the complete switch to Unreal Engine 4. The image is noticeably dirty and blurry, a probably due to a very aggressive level of blur, and also on the resolution used, which seems lower than Full HD, at the cost of losing many details. The interaction with the environment is just acceptable, a detail that is not very surprising with this graphics engine, but it is clear that the developers have tried to avoid sensational exits from the road and impacts with billboards that do not move a millimeter , bringing the pilot back on track with excessive severity. This is a detail that also has a negative impact on the game, since it is enough to even leave the circuit just a little to be brought back and lose precious seconds. Last but not least, the framerate proves to be rather unstable during the most crowded races, also thanks to the use of particle effects, even dropping a lot from the basic 30 frames per second, which is already not very exciting in a racing of this type. The shades are excessively dark and oppressive, so much so that a gamma adjustment is forced, fortunately with good results. The weather in the races is fully customizable, but the rain implementation is the least impactful, with a simple independent layer applied to the screen. The audio is also not very convincing: the rendering between the 2 and 4-stroke motorcycle types is well defined, but the sounds are tiring in the long run and the audio mixing is not optimal, with environmental effects excessively in the background. Fortunately, the most important aspect emerges as the winner, namely the rendering of the mud, convincing in its dynamic and threatening deformation when enriched with appropriate shaders. On a technical level in general we can say that this passage to the Unreal Engine was due, and the detachment from the internal Milestone engine is immediately perceptible, with a more realistic rendering, but on consoles the technical limit cannot be ignored, fueling the wait and the need for more powerful hardware, such as the Xbox Scorpio.", "date": "2017-06-06", "grade": "7.8"}
