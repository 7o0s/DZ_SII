{"name": "NHL Hitz 20-02", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-hitz-20-02.html", "text": "A violent sport This NHLH offers a good deal of fun in both single play and multiplayer mode. Do not expect a perfect simulation of this frenetic sport which is ice hockey as the Midway product has an arcade-style setting. Leave at home various technicalities or team strategies that characterize more serious games. Here all that matters is running, scoring and defending (perhaps with club blows or pushing off the balustrades). First of all, in addition to the aforementioned lack of free kicks, etc., there will be three players (beaters) on the pitch (plus the ever-present goalkeeper). You can already understand, therefore, what kind of game you are going into. The control system looks good and the response to the commands given to the joypad is excellent. The layout of the keys is quite simple and intuitive. In the offensive phase, they are dedicated to passing, shooting, running and feinting; while in the defensive phase we also find the keys to make barbaric entries on the opponents such as shoving, club blows and improprieties on the low points. Until we finally get to the real blows between opponents. This kind of ~mini-brawl~ is quite rewarding especially when playing with other friends. Here will be the key for the jab, for the low punch, for the block and for the grapple. Once the blasting is over, the downed player will be forced to leave the field for the entire match, while the winner will receive huge applause from the frenzied crowd. As in the various NBA Jams, here too the players, after three consecutive scores, become ~on-fire~ managing to run more than the others and to make more powerful and precise shots. The flow of the game is very smooth and fast, while playing it is quite fun. Then add the inclusion of a mode for up to six players simultaneously via multitap and the omelette is done. NHLH 2002 is a fun and entertaining game, mostly in company. This is obvious. A good look The game in question, developed by Black Box Games for Midway, is quite nice and clean to the eye of the gamer. This means that the graphics have been well cared for by the programmers not only as regards the design of the various players and stadiums, but also as regards the animations. The latter settle on the sixty constant frames, thanks also to a not too high number of polygons. It's not that I counted them (!?), but their quantity certainly doesn't reach that seen in more massive games like Devil May Cry. The players on the field are however well defined, colorful, and move with extreme fluidity and ease during the course of the whole game. What amazes most of the visual aspect of the game is undoubtedly its speed. Precisely for this reason it happens, even if rarely, to lose sight of the disk and not understand which of the players is in possession of it. This happens especially when the CPU invents game textures that focus on lightning-fast rallies and powerful one-time shots. Finally, a note of merit goes to the digital audience created by many beautiful colored polygons and not by very flat sprites as in most of today's productions (GT3 A-Spec?). On the cosmetic level, NHLH 2002 honestly carries out its work even though it is not a sacred monster in this field. How many modes! One thing that immediately catches the eye right away, that is, from the first screen of the game, is certainly the number of modes available. In fact, in addition to the now conventional Exhibition and Championship (note the presence of all the professional players with their respective names and faces), the Midway product includes the Custom team, with which it will be possible to create your own unbeatable team, the Franchise mode, thanks to the which to spend the points accumulated during the victories in the purchase of the most disparate items (shirts of the past, improbable stadiums such as discos, ghost houses, etc.). Another novelty is the inclusion of the option called Skills through which it is possible to participate in a series of tests that will test the different skills of the player in the hockey world. Once this is over, other news will be unlocked All this amount of extras in the game are a counterweight to a genre that usually sins in depth. A nice surprise is represented by the musical accompaniment that manages very well to delight our eardrums thanks above all to musical groups such as Limp Bizkit and Korn. The rare commentary during the actual match is also hilarious. It's better to be cleari think this NHLH 2002 is a nice game, which will enthrall many fans of this violent sport, as long as they don't disdain arcade-style games. If you then have the opportunity to play with three, four or even five other friends, the product in question could prove to be a very happy pastime with an unlimited duration. Those who, on the other hand, have some doubts or don't particularly like ice sports, would do better to let it go and turn their thoughts elsewhere. Pros: Fun with friends Fluid and fast Lots of modes Cons: Not recommended if you are not a hockey fan Boring in single Midway, how many memories Midway, a softco famous for years for titles such as ~Nba Jam~, returns to the rescue with the sequel to its hockey game ~Nhl Hitz 2001~ which differs from this sport for some small additions (or omissions?) ... Expect a game dedicated to the NHL rosters without rules in which a point can be scored even by winning a round of boxing with a player from the opposing team. I am not joking! After all, Midway has accustomed us to these beautiful reinterpretations of various sports. Yay with the fiery shots!", "date": "2001-11-24", "grade": null}
