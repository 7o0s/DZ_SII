First of all, the modeling, detail and animations of the monsters are of excellent quality. Particularly valuable are the applied skins, full of bump mapping, which often allow us to see the workmanship of the monsters' knotty skin. The animations are paired with the excellent textures, everything is very fluid and above all the choice of the programmers not to make the pachydermic monsters as agile as human fighters is worthy of mention. In fact, their heaviness and ~immovability~ is rendered perfectly with exchanges of close shots that are more reminiscent of those of heavy medieval knights in armor than that of modern hyperkinetic Matrix-style fighting games. As regards the construction of polygonal environments, therefore cities, we cannot equally say that we are faced with the same levels of excellence. Overall, there would seem to be no macroscopic defects: the cities represented are built with numerous polygons and are also well detailed, with a discreet use of light effects. The interactivity with the environment itself is also remarkable, everything is destroyed in the arena and it is possible to uproot and throw a large quantity of elements at the opponent. The flaws come to the surface when the camera zooms in, highlighting textures that are sometimes very flat and not at all detailed. The audio sector is simply of excellent workmanship, enhanced by the localization completely in Italian. Comment Ultimately the only negative note of this title lies in its very nature of a fighting game in meetings. Once all the monsters, artworks and arenas have been unlocked we can say that we have seen the whole game, which despite an excellent balance of the difficulty level happens quite soon. The best of the title can be enjoyed in multiplayer perhaps with four players, and this is not always possible. So summing up we have on the one hand an intense, exciting but short single player mode, and on the other a sensational, long-lived and very fun multiplayer. Ultimately, it all comes down to evaluating one's own possibilities, however, both in the short and long term, fun is guaranteed. Pros: Excellent modeling and textures of monsters Multiplayer of the highest level Cons: Single player quite short Godzilla or Rampage 2003 Let's immediately dispel a doubt given the cinematographic derivation of the Atari title: Godzilla Destroy All Monsters Melee is a good game. The sad tradition that makes most movie tie-ins pathetic playful productions doesn't concern this funny match fighting game. As in the old but never forgotten Rampage, all the monsters that appeared in the Godzilla films will face each other in the main cities of the world. The title is set up as a classic match fighting game: winning fights will unlock new characters, multiplayer arenas and various artworks inserted in a substantial gallery. Compared to other conceptually similar titles (with all the limitations of the case, of course) such as Soul Calibur or Virtua Fighter, Godzilla instantly acquires the third dimension in movements and game mechanics. Finding yourself in the middle of a city, and having to navigate skyscrapers, city traffic, ruins and uncovered power lines, freedom of movement seems to be the minimum requirement to face your opponents. Rather than throwing yourself with a white weapon against your opponent, pressing randomly on the keys of the pad, in the game it is more useful to go around your opponent, hit him with your laser, hide behind a building (very useful pause to wait in complete safety the recharge of the previously used laser) and if necessary get close, perhaps hitting him with a proverbial tail slap on the head or a nice combo of punches and kicks. This gameplay is further enhanced in the multiplayer mode, which supports up to 4 players: total chaos reigns supreme, between lasers, flames and buildings thrown like twigs towards the opponent. In addition, if the chaos on the screen weren't enough, we must pay attention to the ground defense troops, who bombard us with artillery shots and unconventional weapons. The game possibilities available to the player are many: the main one in single player mode is the adventure one. With only three credits available we have to face eight monsters in eight different locations, following the classic pattern of fighting games with bosses, or rather, the final monster (definitionsone more than appropriate given the game!). By diversifying the initial choice of our alter ego, slowly as I have already written, arenas and new monsters will be unlocked. The other single player mode is the classic survival in which with a single energy bar, and without the possibility of continuing, as many monsters as possible will be fought in series. The multiplayer has been well thought out, with three distinct modes: the first one (Clash) is the more classic all against all; a second one (team fight) needs no further explanation. The third instead revives the glories of the aforementioned Rampage. No clashes between monsters in the foreground, but the exclusive objective is the destruction of the city, complete with maxi bonuses for those who deal the last blow to an already shaky skyscraper. It goes without saying that you can always hit your opponent when he is about to receive the maxi bonus and then bastardly steal the points obtained with painstaking work. In a nutshell a big mess, hilarious and extremely entertaining. All of these modes host up to four players, practically feeling like you're playing a classic Super Smash Bros Melee-style party game, but much more violent!", "date": "2003-02-13", "grade": null}
